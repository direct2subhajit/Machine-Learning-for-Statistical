Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba of the United Arab Emirates, head of OPEC's market monitoring committee, accused Nigeria of ''stabbing OPEC in the back'' by exceeding its production quota. **********Thus has it ever been when cartels, whether in oil or drugs, lumber or concrete, lose control of a market. The weakest members then covertly cut prices or produce more than their quota. **********OPEC's basic problem as a would-be monopolist was that it could not bar entry to new producers. It could have held the price of oil so low as to discourage high-cost producers from entering the market. But greed, or a lack of foresight and control, caused it to put prices up so much that high-cost suppliers ranging from the North Sea to the North Slope sought and gained entry. And the high world- market price caused oil users to rein in consumption, especially by shifting, in the case of consumers, to more energy-efficient cars and homes, and, in the case of producers, to more energy-efficient plant and equipment. **********OPEC's crude oil production has dropped to about 14 million barrels a day now from 31 million in 1973. Total world production, 55.6 million barrels a day in 1973, climbed to 62.4 million in 1979, but has since fallen back to less than 52 million. **********The cartel's oil export revenues have fallen to $160 billion from nearly $300 billion in 1980. Its balance of payments, once strongly in surplus, is now in deficit. **********How long will the world oil glut, which is hurting not just OPEC but all oil producers, last? Nobody knows, given the uncertainties stemming from such factors as the rate of economic growth of the oil-importing countries, the debt problems of the third world, technological changes affecting the demand for energy, structural changes in the world oil industry, Soviet and other sales of natural gas to the West, wars, revolutions or other political upheavals affecting the oil producers. **********In a new study, Cambridge Energy Associates, a research concern, and Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting company, report that, in interviews with 125 price forecasters within the oil industry and the financial community, nearly all expect oil prices, adjusted for inflation, to continue declining over the next several years, but to rise again in the 1990's. **********A leading petroleum economist, Prof. Maurice Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, regards the oil glut as the chronic condition of the world oil market, given the continuous tendency to underestimate reserves and undiscovered oil. ''There was a glut 70 years ago, 50 years ago in 1933, 15 years ago in 1970,'' Professor Adelman said in an interview this week. ''But that condition of everlasting glut is periodically broken by dangers of oil shortage.'' OPEC, he thinks, is ''on the verge of a dogfight.'' **********If the price should plummet - say, to $15 or even $10 - there would be a serious cutback in production by the outside producers in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries. Then, Professor Adelman thinks, there would be an explosion of investment in the low-cost oil countries of the Middle East. The Saudis are currently producing three and a half million barrels a day but could go up to 20 million. **********''There's so much cheap oil that prices could be cut drastically,'' he said, ''but there would be a firestorm on the way down. It's possible that OPEC would break up, but there would be violent efforts to resuscitate the cartel.'' He warned that, if oil prices should keep dropping, there might be a catastrophe for the overextended, high-cost oil producers of Britain, Norway and the United States, whose costs are close to current selling prices. **********If the low-cost OPEC producers were to slash prices far below current levels, the world might be ''plundered,'' Professor Adelman said. But he does not think the Saudis and other cheap producers will try that highly risky approach. ''On our side, there would be agitation to protect domestic activity,'' he added. **********To guard against the chaos collapsing oil prices would create, he would impose a tariff on imported oil, setting the rates inversely to the drop in prices. To offset a $10 drop in price, he would impose a $15 tariff. Most of the incidence of the tariff, he believes, would be borne by OPEC. ''Once they get to the profit-maximization point,'' he said, ''there is nothing they can do. They couldn't raise prices to offset it. They would be very vulnerable.'' **********He would also bring Canada, Mexico and possibly others under the United States umbrella, carving out about one-fourth of the world market. ''The best thing for the U.S.,'' he said, ''is to break up the gang and protect our own industry.'' **********Another solution is simply to let the market work. Painful as it is for oil producers at home and abroad, the oil price decline is fostering productivity gains in the industrial countries and enabling consumers and businesses to spend or invest larger proportions of their incomes on other goods. **********In addition, the decline in oil prices is helping to hold down inflation, just as the inflation of the 1970's was aggravated by the oil price explosion. The end of double-digit inflation augments more stable growth in the United States and the world economy, and, by keeping a gradually rising floor under energy consumption, should contain the threat of a collapse of oil prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/22/business/the-northeast-housing-boom.html": {"writer_name": "Kirk Johnson", "pub_date": "1985-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE NORTHEAST HOUSING BOOM", "print_headline": "THE NORTHEAST HOUSING BOOM", "body_text": " **********A resurgence in the housing industry is visible here, amid the construction cranes and bulldozers that are rebuilding much of the downtown area. It can been seen through the scaffolding that cloaks many of the old formerly abandoned mills and factories that are being rehabilitated into housing. It can be seen in the face of Bruce Polishook. **********''We're going crazy,'' said Mr. Polishook, vice president of C.W.C. Builders  Inc., a Boston-based company with seven active construction jobs in the Boston area, including the rehabilitation of a 100-year-old former chocolate factory in the city's Lower Mills section into 80 rental apartments. ''We've got two solid  years of work ahead right now without a breather.'' **********Boston housing officials say that 4,600 housing units are expected to be completed this year, nearly double 1984's total, but that the number is still small compared with the demand. And the city's housing vacancy rate in 1984, at  less than 2 percent - compared with a national average of 6.3 percent and 8 percent across a broad band of the South - is not expected to decline. The Commerce Department said last week that housing starts in the Northeast surged 23 percent in June. **********Jump in Housing Starts **********In fact, for the first six months of 1985, the Northeast, which includes New  England and the Middle Atlantic States, was the only one of the four Commerce Department regions to show an increase in housing starts, up 29 percent from the same period in 1984. Declines in the other regions ranged from 1 percent in the  West to 16 percent in the South. **********What is happening here reflects the economic revival that is sweeping through much of the Northeast, as the long retooling from an industrial base to a technology and service economy nears a payoff. Housing economists and builders say the sharp increase in housing demand, in a location long ignored by most of  the big Sunbelt-based homebuilders, is only one of the factors that have been tossed into the housing industry's supply-and-demand equation over the last couple of years. **********''A lot of things are not what they were,'' said Lynn Michaelis, chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, a wood products concern in Tacoma, Wash. **********Indeed, builders and economists point to a handful of interrelated short- and long-term trends, in addition to the resurgent strength in the Northeast, that are affecting the housing industry as the homebuilding and home-buying season reaches its summer climax: *********** The strength of the multi-unit housing sector. Although the number of housing starts for buildings of five units or more has fluctuated widely over the last six months - taking a large drop in June, after a rise the month before - economists still say that the numbers are stronger than expected. Total housing starts this year, according to the seasonally adjusted figures for June, are expected to reach 1.7 million units, compared with 1.75 million last year. Starts of buildings with five or more units are expected to total about 600,000, compared with about 544,000 in 1984. *********** A shift to rental housing. Economists say that more and more of the new multi-unit buildings started in the last year have been rental rather than condominiums. This has been fostered by lower price-appreciation rates for owner-occupied housing, and the possibility of less favorable tax treatment in the future, particularly for investment and resort condominiums. U.S. Housing Markets, a trade publication, expects starts of multifamily condominium units to decline by as much as 35 percent nationwide, ''and 50 percent or more in many Sunbelt markets.'' *********** The specter of tax revision. For builders, the proposed changes embodied in current Federal tax revision proposals, which could make apartment building construction less attractive, have served to bolster construction timetables, thus firming the number of housing starts reported by the Government. Economists agree that the strong numbers in multi-unit housing starts this year, which are  expected by some economists to trail off toward the end of the year, are being affected at least in part by those financial considerations. **********''This year, we're making doggone sure we follow through on everything we planned,'' said Joseph Barrett, chief financial officer of the Lincoln Properties Company, a Dallas-based builder that has some 12,500 new apartments scheduled for completion this year. ''Certainly you can't go start a thousand units just because of what is imminent in the tax proposals,'' he said. ''But there's a pressure to push a project that might have started early next year into late this year.'' **********According to Mr. Michaelis of Weyerhaeuser, the biggest changes in the housing market have been the decline in the inflation rate and the subsequent decline in the appreciation rates of home and condominium prices. **********''When house prices were going up 15 percent a year and mortgages were 11 percent, there was a strong economic incentive to invest in housing,'' Mr. Michaelis said. ''Today, even with a mortgage rate of 12 percent, the incentive  to buy is not as clear.'' According to Mr. Michaelis, ''Only in the Northeast have home prices mostly kept up.'' **********Looking North **********Indeed, builders say that because real estate prices have largely continued to rise in the Northeast, condominiums have remained attractive to builders there, while in the Sunbelt, rental housing has become more popular. At the same time, some home builders have begun looking North. **********New York, in particular, is a hotbed of condominium construction, with more than 9,000 apartment units, mostly condominiums, under construction in Manhattan alone. Conversions of rental buildings into cooperative apartments have also been occurring in great numbers in New York, but they are rare in most other cities. **********''In Boston and in the belt all around New York City anything in the condo line - new, resale or conversion - is hot,'' said a recent issue of U.S. Housing Markets. ''It's a very different picture.'' **********It is a picture that is turning some heads. This year, Lincoln Properties, which is the biggest developer of apartment buildings in the United States, opened its first Northeast office, in Philadelphia, and began its first Northeast project, a development of several hundred rental apartments in Philadelphia. **********''In the Northeast, we're seeing real demand-driven construction,'' said James Christian, senior vice president and chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. ''They're building not where the land is, but where the market is.'' **********Small Portion **********Despite the current strength of its housing market, however, the Northeast is still a small part of the homebuilding activity in the country, builders say. The big numbers are still in the Sunbelt. According to the Commerce Department,  in the South -even with the 16 percent drop in housing starts this year - construction was still begun on more than 400,000 dwelling units in the first six months, compared with 110,800 in the Northeast. **********But builders say that Sunbelt centers stretching from Florida to southern California that boomed with housing construction in the 1970's have become segmented into a mosiac of hot and cold markets, some overbuilt, some not. In Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, the high housing vacancy rates have been aggravated by the slump in oil prices and recurrent devaluations of the Mexican  peso. But builders say there are still submarkets that are attractive. Southern  California, in addition, with its military and technology industries, has remained strong. **********'Illogical Thinking' **********''But the overbuilding has to stop,'' said one Texas-based homebuilder who asked not to be identified. ''There's been a lot of illogical thinking down here. You believe your deal is the best one going, your lender believes it and you end up fooling each other.'' **********Economists say that particularly in the Sunbelt, much of the housing supply in the past has been driven by cash-rich financial institutions, and that many of them are now cutting back, as oversupply problems grow. **********Mr. Polishook, whose company also builds in some Southern markets, said that  although the short-term housing market in New England looks bright, the future there is not certain either. He said that the Federal housing monies that made the chocolate factory rehabilitation project possible, for example, are all but  gone in the Boston area because of cutbacks by the Reagan Administration. After  the current wave of projects is finished, about 1987, he added, ''I don't know where we'll be. I don't know how long this will last.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/04/business/market-place-new-optimism-on-oil-issues.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1985-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;   New Optimism On Oil Issues", "print_headline": "Market Place;   New Optimism On Oil Issues", "body_text": " **********OIL stocks are back in favor. **********This is despite the recent predictions by the Saudi Arabian oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, that the price of crude could go below $18 a barrel and snickering remarks from Western analysts that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was on its last legs. The latest advice from Wall Street is that the oil industry is holding its own and will probably do so for the next few months, at least. **********''There are two camps; there are those waiting for the price of oil to cave in, and there are those who understand the oil market,'' said Rosario Ilacqua, who analyzes the industry for L. F.

Oil industry analysts are speculating that the Russians made the move so that crude could be diverted to its Eastern bloc allies, which may be shortchanged because of the Iranian situation. **********These developments restricting supply come at a time when OPEC, which is meeting in Vienna, is showing a little more self-control and when seasonal conditions usually mean higher energy use. **********Todd L. Bergman, who tracks the industry for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said all of this was happening while stockpiles of crude oil were at a low point. ''Inventories are down to rock-bottom levels,'' Mr. Bergman said. ''People have no choice. They have to go into the market to buy oil.'' **********Analysts feel that the price of oil, currently at about OPEC's official level of $28 a barrel, will remain steady with the coming of winter. **********And if oil profits stabilize, analysts believe that oil stock prices will remain strong. In fact, the shares of oil companies surged earlier this week as a number of Wall Street brokerage houses told clients that the issues were at bargain-basement prices. Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. was among the analysts who turned positive on the group. ''The underlying reason,'' he said, ''is that oil equities have been under pressure owing to the continuing Saudi pronouncements on their new policy.'' The Saudis have been threatening to greatly increase output, and have acknowledged selling crude at a discount. A big output rise could still have dire effects on oil prices. **********But Mr. Nowak said the stock market had been ignoring other industry fundamentals that were ''on balance quite favorable.'' Earlier this week he recommended purchase of stock in Amerada Hess, Amoco, Atlantic Richfield, Exxon, Royal Dutch/ Shell and Shell Transport. **********Paul Mlotok of Salomon Brothers also has a better feeling these days about the oil industry. ''I'm one of the people who turned positive,'' he said. The reason? Mr. Mlotok believes Iranian exports from Kharg Island are down to between 100,000 and 200,000 barrels a day. In better times the Iranians shipped 1.4 million barrels a day. **********Details of the Soviet Union's move are more clouded. But Mr. Mlotok speculates that output of Soviet crude is down this year and that the country may be storing oil in anticipation of a bad winter. In addition, he said, the Russians may be anticipating the needs of its allies who might be hurt by Iran's problems. **********''These are developments that reduce oil's availability,'' Mr. Mlotok said. ''If there is going to be a drop in prices, it's put off at least until next year.'' **********David Montgomery, director of the office of energy markets and end use for the United States Energy Information Administration, is predicting a slight drop in oil prices between now and the end of the year. He sees energy companies on average paying about $26 a barrel for crude, compared with about $27.51 a barrel at the start of 1985. **********The department's worst case scenario - or best case from a consumers' viewpoint - is that oil prices could drop to about $22 a barrel. But it would take a substantial increase in OPEC production for that to occur, Mr. Montgomery said. **********While they do not believe any disaster will befall OPEC, oil industry analysts concede that there are still grave doubts about the future. Walter Levy, head of the W. J. Levy Consultants Corporation, says, ''The underlying factors remain as uncertain as ever.'' **********But Wall Street seems to be taking OPEC pronouncements more in stride. Yesterday, for example, OPEC confirmed that Saudi Arabia had begun offering discounts on oil sales in violation of the group's pricing accords. And one OPEC source, who requested anonymity, was quoted as saying that there was a consensus in the group that the price of oil could not be prevented from falling to the $26 level. **********But on Wall Street yesterday, oil stocks held their own.

There are 55 million bicycles - more than double the number of passenger cars, or to calculate it another way, one for every two Japanese, including infants and the aged. **********But far from regarding the bikes as an ecological blessing, many Japanese have come to view them as a menace, an urban blight, a strain on small businesses and even a symbol of growing national laziness. **********Narrow Streets Are Clogged **********Ask Tokai Masami, who sells grilled octopus by the Kyodo rail station on the Odakyu commuter line in western Tokyo. Hundreds of illegally parked bikes clog the narrow streets alongside the station, and every night Mr. Masami must clear away several dozen of them to make room for his octopus stand. **********''This locality is really irresponsible,'' he complained as he untangled two ''minicycles'' whose handlebars had crossed like spaghetti strands. **********To those living in a place where subway riders may be shot and tourists are mugged every day, Japan's ''bicycle pollution'' may not seem like a top-of-the-list urban issue. Nevertheless, the sprawl of thousands of bikes across city streets, especially near train stations, is far from a joke for many communities. **********The problem arose a decade ago when Japanese started riding bikes en masse during the first oil crisis. These days, increasingly affluent city dwellers are more likely to be interested in saving steps, not fuel. They cycle everywhere - to rail stations, to stores, to neighbors' houses - depositing their bikes wherever they find room. **********On occasion, the bikes pile up six deep or more. ''Sometimes I forget where I left mine, and even when I remember I have trouble finding it among all the others,'' said Misako Murakami, a college student. **********Police Take Action **********The problem is considered serious enough for the Prime Minister's Office to take periodic surveys of the number of bicycles parked illegally. **********Now and then the Tokyo police crack down, as they did one recent week, hauling off 28,000 bikes that had been parked illegally near 233 stations. In 1983, city and ward authorities confiscated 200,000 bicycles, eventually scrapping half of them. **********Such measures help a little, said a traffic official, Tetsuharu Banba, but ''there is still no quick remedy - the bicycles come back again.'' **********In some neighborhoods the clutter has an effect on big businesses as well as small. Near Mr. Masami's octopus stand, for example, the entrance to the Kyodo branch of the Mitsui Bank is all but impassable because of bicycles. **********''We put up iron railings to keep a path clear, but people don't care,'' said a bank official who gave his name only as Watanabe. ''They just park between the railings. We can't take strong action because we consider everybody in town to be a potential customer.'' **********''The biggest problem,'' Mr. Watanabe said, ''is that we've totally lost customers who come by car because the road is completely blocked.'' **********Pedestrians Imperiled **********As in New York, Tokyo streets sometimes become small battlegrounds between cyclists and pedestrians. Perhaps the phenomenom is less obvious than in New York because people here are far less likely to scream at one another in public. **********But the mongoose-cobra relationship exists nonetheless, and it became more strained a few years ago when the Tokyo police let cyclists pedal on sidewalks - where there are sidewalks - as well as in the streets. The choice between smashing into a roaring truck or bumping into a pedestrian was an easy one for most bike riders. **********As a result, long streams of bicycles coil across sidewalks. Blue-suited businessmen on two wheels weave through the crowds as insouciantly as the delivery boys from noodle shops. **********Merely to stroll the streets of central Tokyo can lead to a nerve-racking game of pavement ''chicken.'' People learn quickly that there are only two types of pedestrians - the quick and the bruised. **********City's Population Shifting **********There are at least 5.6 million bicycles in Tokyo alone, an increase of more than 25 percent in the last five years. In a sense, the growth reflects the steady shift of the city's population from older eastern sections along the Sumida River to fairly new and affluent neighborhoods to the west. **********In those areas, virtually no land is more expensive than that near train stations, Japan having become a nation of commuters. The prices are too steep for most homeowners, and so they must live farther from rail lines than they would prefer. **********Even a 15-minute walk can seem like a lot in Tokyo, where, according to a recent bank survey, nearly a third of all office workers spend two to four hours a day in commuting. **********''People want to save 10 or 15 minutes so they can sleep later in the morning,'' said Buntaro Takabayashi, secretary general of the Japan Bicycle Industry Association. ''If it's a 20- minute walk, people consider it too far. So they buy a bike.'' **********''Minicycles,'' inexpensive little vehicles designed for casual use, accounted for 41 percent of the seven million bicycles sold last year. Unlike the auto companies, Mr. Takabayashi said, the bike industry has been in a slump because the popular minicycle offers little opportunity for big profits. **********What of the Samurai Spirit? **********What the reliance on bikes for short rides may say about the old samurai spirit is another matter, the industry official acknowledged. But there seems little doubt that the bicycle is here to stay. **********Miss Murakami was typical. Each of the four people in her family has a bike, she said. **********Mr. Banba said the best answer would be to create more off-street parking areas, but the necessary land is either too expensive or unavailable. Some enterprising Tokyo residents who live near stations have taken to making extra money by renting slivers of their property as parking spaces. **********Basically, though, Tokyo seems to have little choice but to leave the bikes where they are. At the encircled Kyodo station, that means right next to a sign warning ineffectually that all bicycles will be removed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/advertising-mca-adds-liquor-billings.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  MCA Adds Liquor Billings", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   MCA Adds Liquor Billings", "body_text": " **********assigned Canadian Mist whisky, Southern Comfort liqueur **********and Early Times bourbon by **********B-F Spirits Ltd.

''That is also the view of the Holy See.'' This position is strongly opposed by Israel, which claims all of Jerusalem as its capital. **********The Pope left no doubt that he favored Israel's right to exist. ''Of course, we cannot deny to Israel the right to be a state,'' the Pope said. **********Though essentially a reiteration of the Vatican's position favoring a specially guaranteed status for Jerusalem, the Pope's comments took on special importance because King Hassan heads the Islamic Conference's committee on the status of Jerusalem. **********Private Meeting With King **********The Pope's visit here could carry risks for King Hassan, a Moslem who is said to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed and has the title Commander of the Faithful. It could also carry risks for the Pope, who was quoted by Vatican officials as saying he considered his stop here ''an experiment.''

''We live in the same world, marked by many signs of hope, but numerous signs of anguish. **********''We believe in the same God, the one God, the living God, the God who created the world and brought his creatures to their perfection.'' **********Praising what he called Morocco's ''tradition of tolerance,'' the Pope said that ''in this Moslem country, there have always been Jews and almost always Christians; they have lived in respect, in a positive way.'' **********A Warning Against Extremism **********The Pope avoided direct references to fundamentalism, but warned Morocco's young people against extremism and violence. Some among the young, the Pope said, ''risk wanting to change all through violence or through extreme solutions.'' **********''Wisdom,'' he went on, ''teaches us that self-discipline and love are the sole levers for desired renewal.'' **********He said that devout Moslems and Christians must deal with a world ''always more secularized and sometimes even atheist.'' He added that they shared a common desire to ''construct a world where God has the first place.'' **********During the flight, Vatican officials hastened to clear up part of the Pope's answer on the issue of Jerusalem. **********The Pope had characterized the Arab position on the city as seeing it as ''the capital of three monotheistic religions and that it should not only be the capital of Israel.'' **********This implied Arab acceptance of the state of Israel, as well as the idea of Jerusalem as its capital.

The victors were the Shiite Amal and Druse militias. **********The crushing of the Mourabitoun and the subsequent resignation of the Cabinet widened the division in Moslem ranks and further deepened Lebanon's decade-old national crisis. **********'Colossally Grave' Situation **********Prime Minister Rashid Karami, himself a Sunni Moslem, described the new violence as a ''horrific nightmare'' and said the situation in the country had become ''colossally grave.'' **********The Cabinet had already been crippled because of a decision last week by Mr. Karami and another Sunni Cabinet member, Dr. Selim al-Hoss, to boycott meetings to protest President Amin Gemayel's handling of the Moslem- Christian fighting in the southern port of Sidon. Mr. Gemayel is a Maronite Christian. **********The Prime Minister announced his resignation and that of the rest of the Cabinet in a statement broadcast by local radio stations shortly after Dr. Hoss said he was resigning. Mr. Karami noted that the Cabinet was formed a year ago to put an end to fighting like that on Tuesday. **********Asked to Stay as Caretaker **********After his broadcast, Mr. Karami telephoned President Gemayel to tell him of his resignation. Local radio stations said Mr. Gemayel asked Mr. Karami to stay on as caretaker until a new government could be formed. **********The 12 hours of street battles, which sometimes took the form of house-to- house combat, left as many as 29 people dead and 120 wounded, according to hospital and police reports. The fighting was said to have begun after the Amal militia tried to open an office in an area held by the Mourabitoun. **********The defeat of the Mourabitoun is regarded as a humiliation for the Sunnis, who were the largest Moslem group in the capital before Shiites and the Druse arrived a few years ago from southern Lebanon and the Shuf Mountains. **********Like many people who spent a sleepless night in the capital as the fighting raged, Mr. Karami, 63 years old, looked tired and sounded depressed as he made his statement. **********Addressing Beirut residents, he said, ''I want to apologize to you, brothers, for what has happened, and to you and to Beirut, I tender the resignation of the national unity Cabinet.'' **********Many of West Beirut's streets were strewn with debris from smashed windows and burned cars. All efforts to arrange a cease-fire failed as the rival gunmen used rocket-propelled grenades, antiaircraft guns and jeep- mounted 106-millimeter recoilless rifles in mounting attacks and counterattacks. **********The residence of the top Shiite leader, Nabih Berri, came under rocket fire during the night; he and members of his family were rescued by an armored personnel carrier sent by the army. **********'Uprising Carefully Planned' **********Mr. Berri told reporters that in his opinion, the fighting was ''an uprising carefully planned by Arab hands exploiting sectarian ideas, aliens and guests to Beirut.'' **********The term ''guests'' apparently was a reference to Palestinians. **********He said the Mourabitoun had started the fighting to thwart plans he announced Tuesday for Moslem and leftist militias to form a joint command to control West Beirut. **********Mr. Berri, 45, is head of Amal, the mainstream Shiite movement. He was also in charge of South Lebanon Affairs in the national unity Cabinet, which grouped senior Moslem and Christian leaders, including Walid Jumblat. **********Mr. Jumblat, the head of the mostly Druse Progressive Socialist Party, is an ally of Mr. Berri. Mr. Jumblat's militiamen joined Amal fighters in the gun battles against the Mourabitoun. **********This morning, Amal announced that its fighters, in cooperation with their Druse allies, had seized all the offices of the Mourabitoun and had routed the Sunnis. **********The triumphant militiamen ransacked and burned the Mourabitoun headquarters on the Corniche Mazraa.  The offices also housed the Sunni radio station Voice of Arab Lebanon. **********Building Reduced to Rubble **********The old building, next to a mosque dedicated to the memory of Gamal Abdel Nasser, was reduced to rubble. A bearded Shiite fighter, carrying a rifle and festooned with ammunition clips and grenades, said, ''The Mourabitoun are finished forever.'' **********Later, Shiite and Druse gunmen paraded through the streets, raising their arms in victory signs. **********Voice of the Homeland, a Sunni radio station that was the first to broadcast the Prime Minister's resignation announcement, reported that Mr. Karami had telephoned Mr. Gemayel and told him of his decision and that Mr. Gemayel had immediately called Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad. **********The national unity Cabinet was formed at the end of April last year as part of Syria's effort to bring about Lebanese national reconciliation. **********Before his resignation, Mr. Karami had said he would not attend Cabinet sessions until the crisis in the Sidon area was resolved. At Sidon, Christian and Moslem militiamen have been battling each other for the last month. **********The Voice of the Homeland radio station said today, ''When all energies had been devoted to ending the Sidon crisis, a worse problem developed in Beirut.'' **********Political analysts noted that the combined effort by the Shiites and the Druse in crushing the Mourabitoun had discredited the Sunni leadership in the Lebanese Government. As a result, Mr. Gemayel may find it extremely difficult to get a Sunni leader to head a new Cabinet. **********Premier Is Always a Sunni **********Under the country's ''national covenant,'' the Prime Minister is always a Sunni Moslem, and the President is a Maronite. The post of Speaker of Parliament goes to the Shiites. The covenant is an unwritten agreement worked out by Lebanese leaders on the eve of Lebanon's independence in 1943. **********Sunni resentment was reflected in the Prime Minister's resignation statement, and in a statement earlier by the spiritual head of the Sunnis, Sheik Hassan Khaled, the Grand Mufti. **********Mr. Karami said that what he termed ''selfish aspirations and ignorance'' were responsible for the Beirut violence. **********Sheik Khaled said Moslem West Beirut was being treated ''as if it were Israel.'' **********Those responsible, he said, ''are the ones whom we have welcomed among us.'' **********Israelis Hit Lebanon Base **********TEL AVIV, April 17 (AP) - Israeli warplanes attacked what the Israeli military command said was a Palestinian guerrilla base in the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley, today. In addition, Israeli troops raided a Shiite Moslem village in southern Lebanon, rounding up 60 men for questioning. **********The military command said the air raid was on a base near the town of Bar Elias, in a Syrian-controlled area that has been attacked by the Israeli warplanes several times in the past. It was the sixth Israeli air strike in Lebanon this year. Neither the Israeli command or the Lebanese press, in reporting the attack, mentioned casualties. **********U.N. Force's Mandate Extended **********UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., April 17 - The Security Council today extended the mandate of the United Nations troops in Lebanon for six months.  The vote was 13 to 0, with the Soviet Union and the Ukraine abstaining. Several Council members expressed concern over the safety of the 5,800-man force. The United States delegate, Richard Schifter, said the vote ''could well be the last interim extension that the international community would be prepared to support.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/world/thais-planning-to-meet-tomorrow-on-cambodians.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1985-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THAIS PLANNING TO MEET TOMORROW ON CAMBODIANS", "print_headline": "THAIS PLANNING TO MEET TOMORROW ON CAMBODIANS", "body_text": " **********Faced with problems of disease, crime and overcrowding in refugee settlements along the Cambodian border, Thai officials are planning to meet Monday to discuss the future of Cambodians driven into this country by the Vietnamese offensive last winter, officials said today. **********The meeting will be held amid reports that there are pressures within the Thai Government to send the more than 225,000 Cambodians, followers of guerrilla armies seeking to oust the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh, back to Cambodia now that the summer monsoon season has begun. **********Thai Foreign Ministry and international aid officials said today that there were no plans for a forced repatriation of the Cambodians, though officals said that at least some of them would be moved from overcrowded settlements to new sites within Thailand, possibly closer to the border. **********'These Are Our Friends' **********''After all, these are our friends,'' said Nit Pibulsongkram, the head of the Foreign Ministry's international organizations department. ''We have no reason to push them back into the arms of the Vietnamese.'' **********Despite the onset of the rains, making large military operations difficult, aid officials working along the border say Vietnamese activity is continuing on the Cambodian side. Followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk said this week that about 200 Vietnamese troops had crossed into Thailand to kidnap exiles. The Sihanouk supporters later moved deeper into Thailand. **********Mr. Nit said the meeting Monday of Thai military and national security officials would be primarily devoted to the problems of a settlement known as Bang Poo, or Site 7, the home of more than 50,000 displaced Cambodians, followers of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the larger of two non-Communist opposition groups. Bang Poo is adjacent to the Khao-i-Dang refugee camp. **********Military officers in the border region have said they believe a recent rise in violent crime in Khao-i-Dang, reserved for Cambodian refugees seeking to resettle abroad, may have been at least partly attributable to guerrilla irregulars with access to Bang Poo, which houses Cambodians who fled the Rithisen settlement on Christmas Day. **********Malnutrition a Concern **********Malnutrition has become a concern of health officials in the overcrowded camps. Mr. Nit said sanitation was deteriorating as the rainy season advanced, turning the grounds of the heavily populated camp into seas of mud. **********In addition, there have been outbreaks of resistant strains of malaria in the border region, affecting Thai troops as well as exiles and guerrilla fighters, according to Gen. Arthit Kamlang-Ek, the country's supreme military commander. **********Thailand has tried to keep separate the temporary settlements, in which the Government says 225,213 people are now living, and the refugee camps, where more than 120,000 Indochinese stay, 23,500 of them at Khao-i-Dang. The refugees at Khao-i-Dang are eligible for resettlement, but the others, with some exceptions, are not. **********Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians have entered, and often re-entered, Thailand in the last decade, fleeing first the Khmer Rouge regime and, after 1979, the invading Vietnamese. Every winter for the last six years, Cambodian guerrillas and their families have been pushed out of their camps in Cambodian territory by Vietnamese troops trying to stamp out resistance to the Heng Samrin regime in Phnom Penh. **********The guerrillas have usually returned when the summer rains bogged down the Vietnamese, with their heavy artillery and tanks. This year, however, the exiled Cambodians and Thai officials say they fear that the Vietnamese will try to seal the border, leaving 250,000 more Cambodians more or less permanently in Thailand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/11/business/china-alters-course-with-sale-of-stock.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1985-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA ALTERS COURSE WITH SALE OF STOCK", "print_headline": "CHINA ALTERS COURSE WITH SALE OF STOCK", "body_text": " **********As the line began forming on a misty morning in mid- January, the survivors  of this city's old capitalist class could have been forgiven for thinking they were dreaming the entire scene. **********Beginning at 3:30 A.M., hundreds of Shanghai residents gathered outside a red brick building to sign up for the first stock offering here since 1949. **********By 2 P.M., three hours before the offering closed, the full allotment of five million yuan, equivalent to $1.79 million, had been sold to individual investors and to others buying on behalf of state-owned and collective institutions. **********The stock offering by the Yanzhong Industrial Corporation represented a cautious step forward into a new era of corporate fund-raising mandated by reform-minded Communist leaders in Peking. But it also constituted a step back toward the old ways of doing business in what had been China's largest commercial center before the Communists seized power 35 years ago. **********Playing the Market in 1950 **********Some of the pensioners who lined up outside the Yanzhong office at 45 Ningjiang Road had been playing the market in 1950 when Communist troops threw a cordon around the old stock exchange and made wholesale arrests of people inside. Some threw files out of windows, and others set their offices on fire. Many were given nominal trials for ''exploitation'' and shipped away to spend years in distant labor camps. **********Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, efforts are being made to bind the wounds of that bitter time. Old ''capitalists'' are being rehabilitated, and some in Shanghai and Peking are even getting their mansions back. Party leaders  are consulting them on ways to propel the nation's economy, and they are being encouraged to lend any help they can in stirring back to life the embers of entrepreneurship. **********In the charter for urban economic reform laid down by the Communist Party in  October, the emphasis was on shifting from a situation, in which all important matters were decided by central planners, toward one in which the marketplace plays a decisive role. **********Managers Make Decisions **********Since Jan. 1, managers at every level have been required to make decisions on investment and production, procurement and sales, manpower and wages decisions that were previously dictated to them. **********The changes are disturbing to some people, exciting to others. Among officials who see their prerogatives being undermined and those who regard themselves as guardians of the country's Marxist ideology, opposition has centered on the charge that Mr. Deng is leading the country back to capitalism.  He has rejected the charge by saying that ''some capitalism'' will do no harm as long as public ownership remains the guiding principle. **********The Yanzhong stock offering suggests something of what is happening at the local level. Zhou Xinyong, the company's general manager, is a model of the new  entrepreneurial class, a 56-year-old former district official who turned a neighborhood sewing and electrical repair workshop into a diversified company with 12 plants, 2,500 employees and earnings of about $535,000 in 1984. **********Profit Motive Recognized **********Much of Yanzhong's growth, now 30 to 40 percent a year, has come since Mr. Deng returned to prominence in Peking in 1979 and signaled that the profit motive was acceptable again. Like Mr. Deng, Mr. Zhou was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, being forced to wear a dunce cap and repent publicly for the profits made by Yanzhong. **********From buttons and radios, the company expanded into the manufacturing of photocopiers, duplicators and generators, along with sidelines in clothing and plastics. More than 200 service centers for the copying machines were opened across the country. Mr. Zhou was cited as a model manager but still had his ''hands tied,'' in his words, by the requirement to remit all profits to the state and to adhere to official decisions on most managerial matters. **********Selling stock to the public is part of the shift toward autonomy sought by Mr. Deng. Under Peking's new rules, companies will pay various taxes on their profits but will keep the rest. Instead of getting investment allocations from the state, they will finance growth from retained earnings, bank loans and other financial instruments, including selling stock. **********Many Qualifications Noted **********However, the new freedoms are hedged with qualifications. For example, in Yanzhong's stock offering, only about $32,000 of it was allocated for individuals, with the remaining $1.75 million designated for collectives and other enterprises under state control. These include the Shanghai branch of the  Bank of China, which more or less has replaced Government planners in overseeing Yanzhong's operations. **********The stock certificates, at a face value of 50 yuan (about $18) each, can be sold only to Yanzhong or to the Bank of China and at par. Their attraction lies  in the dividend. Initially it will be a net 13 percent annually, more than twice the bank interest rate of 5.76 percent. An additional 2 percent will be set aside for an annual lottery in which shareholders will have a chance to win color television sets, tape recorders and cameras. **********Officials hope that the Yanzhong stock sale, and others like it that have been tried in recent months in Foshan County, outside Canton, will be an effective way of redirecting large sums of savings that until now have had nowhere to go but into the bank. **********Individuals' Savings Mount **********At the end of 1984, individuals' savings at the Bank of China totaled more than 121 billion yuan, or about $43 billion. Reforms that have doubled incomes among the country's 800 million peasants since 1978 expanded the bank's coffers  by $11.4 billion in the course of the year, with $1.6 billion of that in the Shanghai area alone. **********Just how eager some savers have been for a better return on their money was demonstrated by the Yanzhong stock sale. **********Among those who lined up in the pre-dawn hours were an elderly couple, described by Mr. Zhou as pre- 1949 ''capitalists.'' Both the husband and wife bought about $7,000 worth of shares. **********Others in the line, Mr. Zhou said, included blind people in wheelchairs and newlyweds. **********Other Offerings Expected **********Mr. Zhou sees the stock issue as an initial step that could lead to similar offerings by other companies and even to a revival of the Shanghai stock market. The Communist Party press has commented on the subject, and the Ministry of Finance in Peking has sent officials on tours of stock exchanges in New York and Tokyo. **********However, Wang Mingyang, an official in Shanghai's Foreign Affairs Bureau, says there is vigorous debate between those who consider a stock market essential to efficient allocation of investment capital and others who regard it as a plunge toward full- scale capitalism. **********''There are some who say, 'If there is anything in capitalism that can be of  benefit to China, let's use it,' '' Mr. Wang said. ''There are others who say that a stock market can only breed speculation, so we should be strongly against it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/world/west-beirut-where-even-chaos-gets-worse.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1985-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEST BEIRUT, WHERE EVEN CHAOS GETS WORSE", "print_headline": "WEST BEIRUT, WHERE EVEN CHAOS GETS WORSE", "body_text": " **********George Zeini is a well-known figure around Makhoul Street in West Beirut. Over the years, his restaurant was a refuge for those Lebanese - artists, writers, professors, especially Christians - who stubbornly refused, despite violence and chaos, to move away from this predominantly Moslem sector of the capital. **********Gaunt, gray and insistent, Mr. Zeini also ran an art gallery a few blocks away on Rue Bliss. Over lunch one day, he talked excitedly of an exhibition of watercolors of Rue Bliss, at one time an intellectual center of the Arab world, now best known as a place where cars are often stolen at gunpoint. Implicitly, the exhibit would call for a return to the old Beirut tradition of intellectual and political freedom, rather than what Mr. Zeini termed the current rule of ''barbarians.'' **********Robbed 6 Times in 3 Months **********Although Mr. Zeini's restaurant, Smugglers Inn, was robbed six times in the last three months by gunmen who stripped customers of their money and jewelry, it still seemed a small haven for West Beirutis from the mean streets outside. The quickest seats to fill up were the red leather banquettes in the narrow space by the bar in back. **********That is where the bomb went off last Thursday, killing four people and wounding 12. **********The explosion that destroyed Smugglers Inn was only one of a half-dozen set off in the last week in this nightmare city, where bombings, murder, kidnapping, robbery and gunbattles in the streets are everyday events. **********'Destroyed - for What?' **********Over the last decade, starting with the 1975 civil war and leading up to the 1982 Israeli invasion, the brief rule of the Christian Government and the Moslem revolt and breakup of the army last February, West Beirut became virtually a synonym for mindless death and destruction. For anyone who lived here during that period, it seemed inconceivable that the city could get any worse. But it has. **********''I have built this place with my life, all my life, and now it is destroyed - for what?'' Mr. Zeini was heard to cry over his ruined restaurant. **********''West Beirut is in the grip of lawlessness,'' a former Cabinet minister said. ''Everything is bad and getting worse.'' **********''I am the most depressed and pessimistic I have been in the past 10 years,'' he went on. ''I think now we are going down, finally. Yes, we are going down.'' **********There appears to be little reason for optimism. The Lebanese Government appears hopelessly bogged down in tribal feuds. The once resilient economy is in ruins. And most of the country is the provenance of either Syrian or Israeli occupiers or local warlords. **********The much-heralded army deployments under the Government's many security plans have proved even less than cosmetic. The troops are often shouldered aside by militiamen. **********West Beirut, still bustling only a few months ago, has in the last two weeks become a place where the streets now empty out before noon as residents scurry back to what they hope is the safety of their homes. **********Even Beirutis inured to the mysterious bombs that go off in front of shops and offices almost every night - usually, it is believed, to enforce demands for protection money - have been shaken by the catalogue of horrors of the last few days. **********American Priest Kidnapped **********Last Tuesday, an American priest who headed a relief agency helping war victims was kidnapped by eight gunmen. The abduction occurred less than 12 hours after a kidnapped Swiss diplomat was freed by his captors. The priest, the Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, was grabbed only a few yards from a big sandbagged police station in the same neighborhood where three other Americans have been seized in the last 10 months. **********Another American is also missing, and the shadowy terrorist group that calls itself Islamic Holy War said Monday that it planned to put all five on trial as spies. **********A day after the bombing of Smugglers Inn, there was another bomb explosion, this time at the Bank of Beirut and Arab Countries. Three people were killed and 15 wounded, all pedestrians unlucky enough to be walking by when the blast sent metal, concrete and glass flying. As for the reason the bank was bombed, there was only speculation. **********Two more bombs exploded on Saturday, killing two people in a Sunni Moslem neighborhood, injuring a dozen more and sending jumpy, rifle-brandishing militiamen into the streets, where they set up roadblocks. **********That night another bomb destroyed a Druse amusement parlor near Hamra Street. **********On Monday, two French soldiers of a neutral observer team, which supervises a shaky truce between militias that keep the Green Line open between the Christian and Moslem sectors, were slain by machine-gun fire in the Shiite Moslem shantytown of Burj al Brajneh near the airport. A caller from Islamic Holy War said they ''were liquidated for spying on our youths and positions in the Islamic suburbs.'' **********High-Ranking Officers Slain **********While the overwhelming majority of victims here are civilians, military prowess is not necessarily a guarantee of safety. A week ago, the deputy commander of the French observers was found in a district called Thieves Alley with a single bullet in his head and his briefcase missing. Last month, one high-ranking Druse army officer was found murdered and dumped on the beach and another, a general, was ambushed on his way to work and riddled with bullets, as was his bodyguard. **********It only adds to the horror that in almost every case, there is no idea who planted the bomb or why. In Beirut, no one is ever caught, let alone tried. **********Kidnapping, too, has become a way of life, with gangs of militiamen lurking at the crossing points grabbing people of the opposite religion, or family members seizing hostages to exchange for relatives being held by a militia. **********Relatives of kidnapping victims have formed an association to put pressure on the Government to find the more than 1,000 who have disappeared over the last two years. The Government is reluctant to act because it would have to admit that most of them have probably been killed by militias, which will only cause more trouble. **********No Strong Single Force **********The chaos has several causes. **********Most important, there is no single figure or militia strong enough, or willing enough, to impose order on West Beirut, unlike the Christian sector, where the militia associated with the Phalangist party of President Amin Gemeyal's family exerts control. **********The various forces in West Beirut - Shiite, Sunni and Druse - are constantly clashing. The Sunnis, traditionally the elite in Lebanon's sectarian- based politics, have lost the most, for they have little military power. **********The Shiite Moslems, long Lebanon's underclass, are now the force to be reckoned with. But it is a volatile and increasingly radicalized force. **********The mainstream Shiite militia, Amal, which means Hope, is not an ordered, disciplined organization, but a rather amorphous movement, difficult to control and discipline. Further, Amal's leader, Nabih Berri, regarded as a responsible moderate by most Western diplomats, is himself under challenge among Shiites, both from the ranking Shiite religious leader, Sheik Mohammed Mahdi Shamseddin, and from the fundamentalist movement, Hezbollah, or Party of God. **********Hezbollah appears to be the most rapidly growing movement in West Beirut, partly because of the displacement of Shiites from the south, a consequence of the Israeli occupation. **********Economy Near Collapse **********The second major factor, which could become increasingly important, is the impending collapse of the Lebanese economy. The long-stable Lebanese pound, which had held at 4 to the dollar after the Israeli invasion in 1982 and a little over 5 at the beginning of last year, briefly hit 10 this week, sending shudders throughout the country. **********The decline of an economy that kept much of the country wealthy, albeit largely illicitly, banking sources said, had two external causes. The oil glut ended the boom years in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, as well as the jobs of tens of thousands of Lebanese expatriates who sent their money home. **********And in the days before the Israeli invasion, other Middle Eastern countries used to pump in a kind of foreign aid for political factions and militias that amounted, according to a key banker, to $100 million a month. This has been drastically cut. **********Apart from political attacks, there is a crime wave gripping the city. Militias and individual gunmen shake down merchants for protection money and plant bombs if they do not pay up. **********One appliance store was bombed twice this month, even though it had hired its own guards. This week it sank iron stanchions in the street to prevent booby-trapped cars - or any other kind - from parking. Such devices are going up all over West Beirut. At least four bombs have been defused in the last five days in the few blocks around the Commodore Hotel, the headquarters of foreign journalists. **********Shops Still Lushly Stocked **********The Hamra Street stores are still stocked with lush merchandise arrayed in the manner of Paris boutiques despite the filth outside, but they are plagued by robbers, such as the gunmen who walked into an Armenian jeweler's the other day and ordered several kilos of gold. The jeweler complied without a murmur. **********Many shop owners have started hiring their own gunmen. **********Few people go out to restaurants at night anymore for fear of stickups by gunmen, who sometimes pretend to be religious Shiites, there to smash bottles of Satanic alcoholic beverages. One American, caught in such a holdup, was held for seven hours. **********There are still a startling contrast between the squalid and the lush here, such as Goody's, the elegant delicatessen that is the Zabar's of the remaining West Beirut elite, where the Noveau Beaujoulais has arrived and the goat cheese, p^ate and shallots have been freshly flown in from France. **********There are even bursts of civic spirit, Beirut style. At Goody's recently, a thief snatched a woman's pocketbook and made for the door. As he bolted by the pyramids of avocados and kiwi, half a dozen Beirut matrons reached into their Gucci and Louis Vuitton shoulder bags, pulled out revolvers and opened up, downing him with a leg wound. **********Bombing 'the Last Straw' **********But for many in West Beirut, it was the bomb at Smugglers Inn that symbolized the grimness of the situation. Throughout the next day people gathered silently under a leaden sky on Makhoul Street, a narrow lane in the business district, to stare at the wreckage. **********''For me, blowing up Smugglers is the last straw,'' said a young woman whose Maronite Catholic family has stuck it out in West Beirut through all the last 10 years of trouble, including the Israeli invasion and siege. **********''Before, even when things were terrible, you thought they might get better,'' she said. ''Now there is just no hope. Smugglers Inn - I first went there when I was l4. I used to go there all the time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/26/world/around-the-world-bush-reproaches-ethiopians-and-russians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Bush Reproaches Ethiopians and Russians", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Bush Reproaches Ethiopians and Russians", "body_text": " **********Vice President Bush bluntly condemned the Ethiopian and Soviet Governments today, saying their response to the famine in Ethiopia was ''shocking.'' **********Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to visit Africa next week on the food crisis there, singled out the Marxist Government of Ethiopia for policies in which, he contended, famine relief plays a secondary role to military needs. **********''Food for starving millions still takes a back seat to military cargo when authorities decide the order in which ships can dock in the ports of Ethiopia,'' Mr. Bush said at the National Press Club this afternoon. **********Mr. Bush coupled his attack on Ethiopian policies with a broader attack on the Soviet Union.

Gorbachev. **********''This was a God-sent opportunity,'' said a senior Reagan aide, who described the mood in the White House today as ''exhuberant.'' **********Several officials said that, although it would be premature to predict the long-term implications of intercepting the hijackers, the rise in popularity could add to Mr. Reagan political muscle at a time when his critics have been predicting a decline. White House officials have long counted on of a strong Reagan Presidency to drive their initiatives through Congress. **********''I think it will been seen as very courageous, but very appropriate and I think the public wants both,'' said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the President's assistant for political and governmental affairs. ''This confirms the quality the President's supporters have always admired in him and to that extent should strengthen his hand generally.'' **********Edward J. Rollins, the former chief White House political strategist and now a Washington political consultant, said that the operation against the pirates came at a critical time in that it will lift Mr. Reagan's popularity and erase any notion that he was ''tough on rhetoric, but short on action'' in the international arena. **********''I think it puts him in a point of very strong leadership going into the summit,'' Mr. Rollins said. **********Because the successful operation comes on the heels of the Senate's passing a bill supported by the President requiring a balanced Federal budget in five years and some other legislative achievements, officials said it provided a sense of momentum for the White House. **********''My judgment is that the last two weeks have been the best two weeks we've had since the President announced he'd run for reelection in Jan. 1984,'' said Richard Wirthlin, Mr. Reagan's longtime pollster and a Republican political strategist. **********Another political strategist took a larger view of the successful mission in making a similar point. **********''If this proves a single thing, it proves to me that Ronald Reagan is not going to be a lame duck, because he always has the ability to act bold and decisively and that's what he did in this situation,'' said Lee Atwater, a former White House political operative. **********The President, as he has throughout criticial periods in his political life, took a gamble when he ordered American fighter planes to intercept an Egyptian airliner carrying four hijackers, who had seized an Italian cruise liner Monday. As so often has been the case in his career, the gamble paid off. **********''I can't think of many people, whether partisan Democrats or Reagan Republicans, who don't feel better about the Presidency today, than they did yesterday,'' Mr. Wirthlin said. **********By capturing the hijackers, the officials agreed, Mr. Reagan showed that the Presidency as an institution can respond to an act of terrorism, even though the drama is still unfolding as attempts are underway to begin legal proceedings against the hijackers. **********One White House aide, who accompanied Mr. Reagan on a trip to Chicago Thursday, said the President himself had voiced the frustration of being unable to strike back against terrorist aboard a helicopter flying him to Air Force One. **********''The President has been hesitant to retaliate against terrorism because Ronald Reagan doesn't want to kill innocent civilians,'' the official said. ''In the previous cases, its been a case of how to go about hitting those hard who have been involved without doing extensive damage to other people. This was a beautiful piece of work.'' **********Mr. Attwater said: ''For the first time since the whole hostage era began, the American people have been able to see a concrete action and that's reassuring. It's a major turning point in the whole hostage era.'' **********But beyond the institutional aspect, Mr. Reagan also addressed a nagging criticism of his own Presidency in the second term related to assertions that it has been floundering amid uncertain leadership. Senior White House aides have been particularly sensitive to such assertions, which have surfaced as they and the President have come under attack for such issues as Mr. Reagan's trip to the Bitburg cemetery, the Congressional stalemate on the budget and the campaign to overhaul the Federal tax system. **********In this instance, the Administration showed that it could skillfully carry out a delicate military operation. Moreover, it came in the same week that the proposal endorsed by Mr. Reagan to balance the budget in five years prevailed in the Senate and a textile bill dubbed as protectionist by Mr. Reagan passed in the House by a margin inadequate to sustain a threatened Presidential veto. **********Officials say those developments are evidence that the problems that greeted Mr. Reagan when the White House staff changed as he began his second term are now behind him and that he has the ability to move successful on several fronts at the same time. Since August, they said, the staff has managed to alter what appeared to be potentially damaging situations in terms of the Administration's policies on South Africa, the deficit, the trade area and, with the military operation Thursday night, terrorism. **********While aboard Air Force One as he returned from his August vacation at his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., Mr. Reagan had asked that a plan be developed to generate a balanced budget, a senior aide said. Less than three month later, the aide said, that had been accomplished, with the ''Democrats going from an offensive position to a defensive position.'' **********Mr. Reagan's popularity rose to more than 50 percent from the high 30's following the October 1983 military assault on Grenada, which the Administration called a foreign policy plus.

Gen. James A. Abrahamson, chief of the Stategic Defense Initiative Organization, said today that ''we must accelerate examination of potential applications'' of ''Star Wars'' research ''to the short-range missile threat.'' **********In testimony to the Subcommittee on Strategic and Theater Nuclear Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Air Force general said that, in tailoring the research and testing program to accommodate Congressional budget cuts, he had nonetheless made a priority of work on fighting missiles of ''all ranges.'' **********Hearings on U.S. Policy **********This may have been done, in part, to reasssure the European allies that the United States does not intend to erect only a North American shield, while leaving them exposed. However, other officials made clear that there was technological compatibility in the plan because the technologies needed for antitactical missile defense were closely related to those needed in the final, or terminal, layer of a continental defense consisting of several layers of antimissile weapons. **********General Abrahamson's appearance with Fred C. Ikl'e, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, at the first of five hearings meant to clarify Reagan Administration policy, also underlined these other points: *********** The Administration is more than ever committed to seeking a complex, sophisticated ''multilayer'' defense, and not a more limited defense of key military and leadership complexes. *********** Emphasis, ''to the greatest extent possible,'' should be on methods to destroy missiles while they are still rising above the Soviet Union and before they have been able to dispense a bewildering cloud of decoys along with re-entry vehicles containing nuclear warheads. *********** The key to a ''totally effective'' defense is persuading the Soviet Union to agree to a ''cooperative transition'' from current deterrence based on nuclear retaliation to defenses and ''a carefully drawn down'' mutual reduction in arsenals of offensive missiles. *********** At some point the ''Star Wars'' program will require ''modification'' of the 1972 treaty limiting United States and Soviet missile defenses. That point, General Abrahamson conceded, will come earlier if the United States continues to follow a restrictive interpretation of the treaty's terms, rather than a more permissive interpretation, which it recently said was legally justified. **********Antiballistic Missile Treaty **********The 1972 ABM treaty limits only defenses against strategic, or long-range, missiles and thus permits any level of work on shorter-range interceptors. **********Several senators expressed skepticism about the Administration decision this month to reinterpret the treaty by contending it did not restrict testing and development of space-based antimissile systems using new, advanced technologies. **********Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, called it a ''revisionist theory of history'' and ''tantamount to revocation by theologians of the New Testament.'' **********Asked if a perfect defense was practicable, General Abrahamson and Mr. Ikle acknowledged that the objective was to ''reduce substantially'' the threat and that a leakproof defense was difficult to guarantee. By reducing the confidence of ''Soviet targeteers'' that attack could succeed, the general said, ''it would be good enough to achieve a defensive level of deterrence.'' **********He also gave some brief, generalized but possibly significant, glimpses into the program's progress and management. **********Efforts Made in Program **********While the legislative process is incomplete, Congress is expected to cut between $1 billion to $1.2 billion from the $3.7 billion request for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Anticipating these cuts, the director said he had been forced to scale back work on laser weapons based in space. He also asserted that the cuts would slow research and elevate final costs. Officials acknowledge, however, that there is no chance for significant restoration this year. **********But he said that progress in methods to compensate for atmospheric distortion of laser beams ''has progressed to the point where it appears the potential for large, effective ground-based lasers is very real,'' and that this might improve a defense's survivability against attack. To be effective, such ground-based lasers would require a system of large mirrors orbiting in space, which would relay the focused, destructive light beams. **********The general also said that the ability to utilize high-power electrical sources in electromagnetic ''rail guns,'' which fire projectiles with bursts of electrical energy, ''has been demonstrated far sooner than expected.'' **********Several computer scientists have said this year that they did not believe it would ever be possible to write reliable, trustworthy computer programs to manage the intricate system.

On the other hand, he and other analysts have noted that large numbers of competitors have been attracted to Manhattan because of the abundance of communications businesses here. **********Many companies, for example, have begun providing bypass programs that enable customers to circumvent the facilities of New York Telephone and connect directly to long-distance carriers. Telecommunications analysts, as well as company officials, consider bypass to be a major threat to Nynex. **********Nynex's return on equity was 12.9 percent.

It is also a time when the current month's Major Market Index options expire. **********On March 15, for example, when that month's M.M.I. options died, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 14 points even though there was no significant market news. Previous expiration dates of the options have witnessed similar downward price ''spikes.'' **********''While the next witching hour will come on this Friday, when this month's index options expire, it does not mean the market will plunge again,'' said Jack A. Barbanel, director of futures trading at Gruntal & Company. ''We could see a sharp upward spike on April 19. It all depends on whether big traders have used the expiring options to create large long or short positions in the market.'' **********In recent months, market analysts have noted that traders with large stock portfolios have profited handsomely by buying puts on the expiring M.M.I. options. **********Buying an index option put is the same as selling the market short. When such puts are bought on an option that is about to expire and when the market is rising or relatively steady, the premium cost is often negligible. For these cheap puts to turn profitable, all that is needed is for the market to plunge, especially on a Friday when many traders leave early for the weekend and puts that are expiring profitless are moments away from becoming worthless. **********The American Stock Exchange's M.M.I. options, known by the ticker symbol, XMI, are based on an index of 20 blue-chip stocks that closely correlates with the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average. There are no futures or options traded on the Dow average. **********The huge Chicago Board of Trade now trades futures on the M.M.I. under an arrangement with the Amex. This permits institutional and other large players to hedge positions. **********In any case, Gruntal's Mr. Barbanel and other index market experts expect the next important witching hour will come in June. **********''Whatever happens on April 19,'' Mr. Barbanel said, ''we think June's witching hour will be most interesting for two reasons. One, June is an expiration month for both index futures and options, which occurs at three-month intervals. Second, many large institutions and individual investors normally sell short the more liquid and more highly leveraged S.&P. 500 index futures for hedging and income-producing purposes, just as they do the XMI options and futures.'' **********Quite often, the profits from the highly leveraged index futures are much greater than the portfolio losses caused by price spikes. Consequently, Mr. Barbanel noted, ''there will be a lot of money riding on either a sharp drop - or rise - in stock prices before June's double witching hour ends.'' **********New Strike-Price Policy **********Much of the extraordinary growth of the three- year-old index futures and options markets has been at the expense of the stock options markets. At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where the index option on the S.&P. 100 sets volume records each month, trading in options on individual stocks has been shrinking for more than a year. **********Stock options give the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying shares at a specified ''strike price,'' within a fixed period of time. The cost of buying a put or call is termed the premium. **********Last week, the C.B.O.E., the American Stock Exchange and the regional equities options markets decided to cut in half the strike price increments of put and call options on underlying shares trading at $25 or less. At present, the strike prices are in increments of $5. On May 1, this will be narrowed to $2.50. The move is intended to revive trading in the options. **********Robert A. Bassi, assistant vice president of the Chicago Board, said that at his exchange the move would affect ''perhaps 30 of our 145 listed stock options.'' **********''By thus providing closer near-the-money options,'' he said, ''it would in effect shorten the percentage moves, or odds, for investors holding lower-price puts and calls. '' **********For example, the buyer of a $25 call on a stock that is trading at, say, $21, now needs a 20 percent rise in the stock for his option to reach the ''at the money,'' or break-even point. But if the investor could buy a $22.50 call on a stock trading at $21, he would need only a 7 percent rise to break even, ignoring the premium cost, Mr. Bassi noted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/05/business/great-lakes-shipping.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Great Lakes Shipping", "print_headline": "Great Lakes Shipping", "body_text": " **********A slump in Great Lakes shipping has continued all summer, the Lake Carriers Association said today.

But in both cases, the banks acknowledge that they have no evidence of fraud, no hint of criminality or intentional wrongdoing. **********Chase is seeking $175 million from six employees to cover its loan losses in the 1982 collapse of the Penn Square Bank. The Bank of America, too, is suing six employees for losses arising out of a mortgage-backed securities scandal that led the bank to take a $95 million charge against 1984 earnings. **********Both banks conducted extensive internal investigations into the losses, interviewing dozens of employees about how the relevant decisions had been made, and then filing suit against only a few of the employees involved, charging that they had negligently violated internal bank policies. **********Most banking and insurance lawyers say that both Chase and the Bank of America are using the lawsuits as a route to recovering their losses from their insurers. **********''If you sue some employee for $20 million and he doesn't have anything approaching a $20 million net worth, that suggests you're just using the employee as a conduit to the insurers,'' said one New York lawyer who does insurance litigation. **********Another clue that the lawsuits are aimed more at the insurers than the employees named as defendants lies in the characterization of the employees' actions as negligent. Although the banks might have a stronger case against the employees if they charged fraud, any such allegation would defeat the possibility of insurance coverage, since most insurance policies do not cover intentional misconduct. **********Still, both banks seem to believe that, if they win a judgment against their employees, they can make good their losses out of their directors' and officers' liability insurance, which insures against injuries caused by certain high-level employees' misconduct. **********As might be expected, the insurers are not happy about this new trend. Indeed, shortly after the Bank of America filed its complaint, the Employers Insurance of Wausau Mutual Company -which provided the bank's directors' and officers' insurance and is named in the suit - canceled the Bank of America's policy. **********''The whole concept of officers' and directors' insurance is that it will be there to defend the corporation, or pay losses, in a third-party suit against the corporation,'' said Anthony Lanzone, who is representing Wausau in the Bank of America case. ''It was never intended to be used in first-party suits against employees.'' **********Many of those involved in the Chase suit also say it is an attempt to misuse the insurance policy. **********''The insurance carriers have told us they don't insure for bad loans,'' said J. Robert Lunney, who represents one of the employees in the Chase suit. ''That's not what directors' and officers' insurance is for. The banks may be insured for negligence, but not for bad judgment by its employees.'' **********Mr. Lunney says his client and the other employees named as defendants are outraged by the lawsuits. They say they have done nothing wrong, and are simply being used as scapegoats to get at the insurance money. **********''This suit has seriously jeopardized their future in the industry,'' Mr. Lunney said. ''Some of these people have spent 25 or 30 years at the bank, their entire professional careers, and there was never a suggestion that they would be sued and held liable for their loan decisions. There's no reason why these particular people should be taking the blame, especially since there is some evidence in this case that the higher-ups knew exactly what was going on.'' **********Indeed, the banks' decision to try to pin the blame for huge losses on a small group of employees carries certain risks. For one thing, it is almost certain to force the employees who are sued to try to prove that the actual blame lies higher up the corporate ladder. Then, too, the spectacle of an institution going so far as to sue well-meaning employees for faulty decision-making cannot reflect well on the management of that institution - and may have bad effects on employee morale. **********''The idea that this huge institution is trying to pass off the blame on a few little guys who work there cannot create very good feelings among the work force generally,'' said a New York banking lawyer. **********Although it is likely to be a long time before either of the cases gets to trial - and there are some signs that the Chase suit may never get that far -many banking lawyers say they do not expect either Chase or the Bank of America to have much success in recovering money from their insurers. **********And even if some money is recovered, the banking lawyers say, the negative side effects of the lawsuits may outweigh that gain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/31/business/restructure-of-apple-held-near.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1985-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 431, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESTRUCTURE OF APPLE HELD NEAR", "print_headline": "RESTRUCTURE OF APPLE HELD NEAR", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. will announce a major restructuring of the corporation Friday in an effort to streamline its operations and cope with rapidly declining sales a source close to the company said late today. **********The reorganization will eliminate the two separate product groups in Apple, the Macintosh and Apple II groups, the source said.

And whether players avoid injury depends in part on artificial turf, which has undergone many technological improvements to make it safer. **********Artificial turf has surged in popularity in recent years, and has become a $50 million industry worldwide, with a market divided among six major companies. Since the Monsanto Corporation supplied the first major installation of its Astroturf synthetic grass at the sunless Houston Astrodome in 1975, some 550 high schools, colleges and municipalities have installed artificial turf. **********Unlike grass, artificial turf does not have to be seeded, watered or fertilized.

But several smaller companies have entered the fray, and have produced three-part ''systems'' in which a thick pad is placed over asphalt or gravel, then a two-part carpet, consisting of the ''grass'' attached to a plastic sheet called a pile, is attached to the underlying pad. The total thickness is two inches. **********Many first-generation surfaces became hard when oxygen ''cells'' inside their underlying pads collapsed from players' repeated pounding.

In Buffalo, meanwhile, Sportec International Inc. has begun marketing a 100 percent rubber pad for its Omniturf artificial surface that is says is naturally bouncy. **********Equally important, many companies have begun using polypropylene instead of nylon to make artificial grass itself. While both substances are technically plastics, polypropylene is believed by materials experts to be the more flexible and durable - although Monsanto says its latest version of Astroturf can last for more than eight years. Still, many experts in this area believe that using polypropylene makes it less likely that a player will stumble on the artificial surface. **********Toward the same end, the new surfaces being shown to athletic directors also have loose sand fills in the polypropylene grass. The sand cushions the impact of players' pounding feet and is said to hold ersatz blades upright long after regular grass would have been flattened. Also, supporters say, the sand permits the use of fewer blades placed relatively far apart. That creates a surface, they say, that is more likely to bend under pressure from a player's foot. **********''The sand acts in the same fashion as soft soil,'' said Alvin L. Wieler, the president of Sportec, a subsidiary of Tecsyn International Inc. of St. Catherines, Ontario. ''It holds up the grass yet provides some flexibility.'' **********Added Danny T. Collier, director of marketing for All-Pro: ''When regular ground gets cold, the moisture in it freezes and the whole surface becomes hard. Our surface stays soft.'' **********Not everyone is convinced that artificial surfaces are more economical than real grass. ''The way we maintain artificial grass, it take more time and costs more,'' said George P. Toma, the chief groundskeeper of the Kansas City Chiefs who has 40 years' experience in the field. He adds, ''After every game we have to have people on their hands and knees scrubbing off the Gatorade from the artificial turf.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/world/car-bomb-kills-50-in-eastern-beirut-172-are-wounded.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1985-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "172 ARE WOUNDED", "print_headline": "CAR BOMB KILLS 50 IN EASTERN BEIRUT; 172 ARE WOUNDED", "body_text": " **********A car bomb exploded in predominantly Christian East Beirut today, killing at least 50 people and wounding 172, according to radio reports tonight. **********The bombing came as fighting between Palestinian guerrillas and Shiite Moslem militiamen continued into a fourth day in the heavily populated southern sections of the city and its suburbs. **********Authorities said at least 34 people had been killed and 157 wounded in Palestinian-Shiite battles today. The casualty totals since the fighting started Sunday are believed to have reached at least 155 killed and more than 800 wounded. **********Fighting Over Refugee Camps **********The combatants are battling for control of three Palestinian refugee camps in the area, where militiamen of the Shiite movement Amal and defenders of the camps appeared to be locked in a fight to the finish. All efforts to arrange a truce have failed. **********Today, Palestinian forces fired volleys of Katyusha rockets into the area in an effort to relieve the pressure on the camps. [Page A10.]  In East Beirut, no one took responsibility for the car bomb, and it was not clear whether the bomb had been intended for a specific target. **********Apartment Buildings Crumble **********Officials said they expected the death toll to rise, since more bodies were believed to be buried in the rubble of at least five apartment buildings. **********Car bombings are frequent in the anarchic, mostly Moslem western sector of the city, but are comparatively rare on the Christian side. East Beirut and its environs have long been ruled by a single militia, dominated until recently by the family of President Amin Gemayel, and the militia has maintained tight security. Recently, however, there have been splits in the Christian ranks. **********Refugees Had Moved In **********Residents at the scene said no important political figures lived on the block, nor were there any military installations. Several Christian refugees from sectarian fighting in the Sidon area of southern Lebanon had moved into the already crowded Sin Al Fil district. **********Many of the victims pulled from the rubble by rescue workers and Christian militiamen were children. A crowded school bus was among the vehicles caught in the blast, according to witnesses. **********Witnesses said the bomb exploded while the car was still rolling. The driver was killed along with a passenger, according to reports on Christian radio stations. Some authorities suggested this could indicate that the car had been booby-trapped and set off by remote control. **********Black smoke poured from a row of the multistory apartment buildings that appeared to have taken the brunt of the blast. The fronts of the buildings disintegrated, leaving only the gaping shells of the back rooms. **********Other buildings across the street were also damaged and burning. There was a huge hole and a tangle of metal and concrete wreckage in the middle of the street. The damage spread for a radius of about 500 yards. **********Rescue workers pushed through the rubble with bulldozers, and fire engines and ambulances hurried through the clogged streets. Christian radio stations broadcast appeals for blood donations. **********Many people fled in panic as artillery shells began to fall nearby, and militiamen warned that a bombardment might be coming. Then they fired into the air to scatter the remaining onlookers. **********Beirut Crossings Closed **********Security in East Beirut has been such that it has been more difficult than usual for an outsider to enter the sector. In addition, the five crossing points over the Green Line dividing the Moslem and Christian sectors have been closed for three weeks because of sectarian fighting. **********Earlier this month, a car bomb was discovered near the home of Elie Hobeika, who ousted another Christian hard-liner, Samir Geagea, as leader of a brief militia revolt against President Gemayel over his increasing dependence on Syria. **********The car bomb went off at about 2 P.M. as people were hurrying home for fear of another night of shelling across the Green Line. The downtown sections of both East and West Beirut empty early these days because of the heavy fighting. **********East Beirut had been relatively calm for the last two days, as most of the fighting suddenly shifted to a battle between the Shiite Moslem Amal militiamen and Palestinians barricaded in the refugee camps of Sabra, Shatila and Burj al Brajneh on the southern outskirts of the city. But a scattering of shells began falling on East Beirut this afternoon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/18/world/200-hospitalized-in-india.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "200 Hospitalized in India", "print_headline": "200 Hospitalized in India", "body_text": " **********Nearly 200 high school girls were hospitalized for possible food poisoning after complaining of dizziness at Nedumangad, 18 miles from Trivandrum in southern India, the United News of India reported today.

''This report is absolutely false and we certainly hope that the Egyptian Government will help protect the academic center and its personnel by issuing an official denial,'' Mr. Sasson said. **********'Sheer Nonsense' **********In Jerusalem, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry declared the report ''sheer nonsense.'' The report, he said, was promoted by ''elements in Egypt who want to impede normalization and an improvement in ties between Egypt and Israel.'' **********Israeli sensitivity about such allegations has been heightened by the killing here in August of an administrative officer at the Israeli Embassy. The aide, Albert Atrakchi, was killed, and his wife and another woman who was a secretary at the embassy were wounded when gunmen sprayed their car with machine-gun fire in a Cairo suburb. **********Responsibility was claimed by a previously unknown group calling itself Egypt's Revolution. It demanded in a communique that President Hosni Mubarak disavow the peace treaty Egypt signed with Israel in 1979 and expel the Israelis from Cairo. The group vowed that such attacks would continue until Israel's flag no longer ''desecrated'' Egypt, which is the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel. **********No Arrests **********Although Egyptian officials vowed to punish those responsible for the slaying, no one has been formally charged and there has been no announcement about the existence of suspects. Shortly before Mr. Atrakchi was killed, Al Ahali and another opposition newspaper reported that the Egyptian authorities had unmasked an espionage ring at the Israeli and American Embassies. Several diplomats had been expelled from Egypt, the report said. Both Israel and the United States asked Egypt to deny the report, Western diplomats said, but no denial was issued until after Mr. Atrakchi was killed. **********Egyptian officials said Thursday that they did not believe that the Government would deny the article that appeared Wednesday in Al Ahali. A spokesman for the Ministry of Interior said Interior Minister Ahmed Rushdi would decline to comment on any charges of this nature as long as the investigation of the slaying of Mr. Atrakchi was under way. **********'This Is Democracy' **********A spokesman for the Ministry of Information explained that the Egyptian Government did not want to adopt a policy of denying articles in the opposition press. He said that such reports, which also criticized President Mubarak and his Government, were often ''wildly inaccurate and widely regarded as such.'' **********''But this is democracy,'' the spokesman added. ''President Mubarak is committed to freedom of speech and press. Besides, if we start denying such stories, we would have time for little else.'' **********Israelis here and in Jerusalem said they did not find the explanation convincing.

CONSIDERS 2 BANK CONTROLS", "body_text": " **********The board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voted yesterday to release for public comment two new means it is considering for controlling risk-taking by banks. **********One would increase the bank capital requirement to 9 percent, from the current 6 percent, and the other would limit the amount that uninsured depositors of failed banks are repaid. **********The insurance agency emphasized that the study paper was not yet in the form of proposals, but simply included ideas that it was considering following extensive bank deregulation. The F.D.I.C. insures deposits of up to $100,000 in commercial banks, and it is one of the principal bank regulatory agencies. **********''When existing Government controls are dropped in deregulation, that creates a vacuum,'' said Alan Whitney, an F.D.I.C. spokesman. ''The board feels that some other risk-control mechanism must be put in place.'' The number of troubled and failed banks has risen to record levels, at the occasional expense of the F.D.I.C. **********Market Discipline **********The first alternative in the study paper would use market discipline to rein in bank growth. It would increase over a period of several years banks' ratio of capital - the amount of shareholders' equity, plus intangibles, such as good will - to about 9 percent of assets, from the current 6 percent. **********The level was just raised to 6 percent in February, and in January the Treasury Department proposed that the capital requirement be increased to 9 percent, or more. **********The key feature is that the capital increase would be attained by banks selling securities - subordinated debt instruments - to raise the needed capital. Thus, the market would exercise the restraint, because if the market did not have confidence in the bank, it would not invest in the securities. **********The American Bankers Association, a trade organization, has already responded to this suggestion. The association earlier contended that, while this might work for nationally known banks active in the capital markets, it would hurt smaller community banks that do not have market access. **********Uninsured Deposits **********The second alternative would revise the way uninsured deposits - those over $100,000 - were repaid in the case of a bank closing. Effectively, there are two systems now, one for smaller banks and one for larger banks. All depositors in large banks that have failed have been guaranteed full repayment, while some small bank depositors have not enjoyed that guarantee. **********The proposal under study by the F.D.I.C. would unify the approaches, according to Mr. Whitney. Under it, all insured depositors would be repaid immediately, or have their accounts transferred intact to a new bank, if a merger could be arranged with a healthy institution. **********The uninsured depositors would be treated as creditors of the failed bank and repaid to the extent possible from its liquidated assets, Mr. Whitney explained. The uninsured depositors would initially be repaid a portion of their deposits, based on the F.D.I.C.'s estimate of how much it was likely to recover from the liquidation. If the liquidation turned up more than expected, the additional amount would be distributed to the depositors. **********This method has been tested by the F.D.I.C. in the past year. In one instance, Mr. Whitney said, when the West Coast Bank in Los Angeles failed, it had total deposits of $159.6 million, with $4.8 million in uninsured deposits. The uninsured depositors initially received 50 cents on each dollar of their deposits. They will receive more if the liquidation generates additional cash, Mr. Whitney said. **********This payoff proposal would encourage those depositing more than $100,000 to select their bank carefully, restricting the growth of banks that are perceived to be weak."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/02/business/washington-watch-textile-curb-pressure-builds.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1985-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 639, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  TEXTILE CURB PRESSURE BUILDS", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH;   TEXTILE CURB PRESSURE BUILDS", "body_text": " **********PRESIDENT REAGAN's rejection of shoe industry pleas for protection against imports has strengthened the hand of textile lobbyists pressing for legislated curbs, and a showdown with the Administration could come within a few weeks. **********''It exacerbates our problem,'' said a spokesman for the American Retail Federation, which opposes the legislation. **********Before last week's shoe decision, an agreement had been reached between the textile bill's chief sponsor, Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, and the Senate Finance Committee leadership over the bill's future. **********They agreed that the bill would be voted on by the committee after only two more hearings -on Sept. 12 and Sept. 23. **********Even though it is co-sponsored by a large majority of the Senate, the protectionist legislation had been bottled up in the committee by Chairman Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, and John C.

Some private economists, however, place the debt of the sub-Saharan African countries alone at between $130 billion and $135 billion, a figure these economists say is more realistic than the I.M.F. numbers. **********The sub-Saharan region comprises all African nations except Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. In addition, South Africa is not treated as part of Africa in economic discussions. **********The World Bank estimates that this year, 38 of the sub-Saharan countries will be required to shoulder $11.1 billion in debt service payments, nearly double the amount they were required to pay only two years ago. **********Indeed, just last month the Organization of African Unity declared that most of the continent's countries were approaching ''economic collapse.'' And while the organization attributed much blame to ''an unjust and inequitable economic system,'' as well as natural catastrophes such as the drought in the Sahel, the 51-member O.A.U. also pointed to ''some domestic policy shortcomings'' as factors in the economic fragility of many nations. **********Austerity Measures **********Although Africa's debt is dwarfed by that of Latin America - Brazil's debt to foreign creditors alone approaches that of all of sub-Saharan Africa - many economists contend that the very fragility of African economies makes it far more difficult for those countries to manage their international obligations than countries such as Mexico, Brazil or Peru. **********Currently, 12 African nations, including Mali, Niger, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, have adopted austerity measures arranged by the I.M.F. Nonetheless, there is widespread pessimism about African economies and many American commercial banks are quietly beginning to withdraw from involvement in the continent. **********At least three countries - Zambia, the Sudan and Liberia - are behind on their repayments of I.M.F. loans. Nigeria, the largest African debtor with an outstanding debt of nearly $21 billion, has avoided incurring debt from the I.M.F. and consequently has also avoided the strictures attached to I.M.F. lending, a condition rare among African nations. **********''One of the things that alarms us,'' said John M. Underwood, a specialist on external debt at the World Bank, ''is that if you look at the total debt service Africa has been paying, it's been running $4 billion, $5 billion. In 1983, it was $5.7 billion. What we're projecting for 1984 is $9.7 billion and for 1985, $11.1 billion.'' **********With this steep jump in debt service, he said, ''we just don't think they can manage it without some kind of debt rescheduling.'' **********Combination of Factors **********The economies of most of the sub-Saharan countries have been staggered in the last decade or so by a combination of factors, including dramatic increases in oil prices; falling prices for cocoa, groundnuts and coffee, the region's key export commodities, and widespread economic mismanagement. **********Officials at the I.M.F., which has about $8 billion in outstanding loans to Africa, declined to discuss the agency's lending policies or its appraisal of Africa's economic state, but one source familiar with the views of the fund said the I.M.F. saw considerable difficulties ahead for African countries. **********''A lot of adjustment needs to be made,'' said the source. ''A lot of financing is needed beyond what is available at commercial rates or from the fund. There needs to be a lot of other money coming to help them. They are in the worst shape of any region.'' **********This need for dramatically enhanced attention to Africa was emphasized by Edward V. K. Jaycox, a vice president of the World Bank, in a speech earlier this month. **********'Overwhelmed by Difficulties' **********''Access to new credit and private equity investment has all but dried up and concessional aid has declined,'' said Mr. Jaycox. ''By and large, African governments have failed to adjust their economies, and have therefore been overwhelmed by difficulties.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Jaycox observed, ''we now estimate that on a net basis the capital flows to Africa in the period 1985-89 will be less than one-half the net flows during the period 1980-84. We do not foresee any dramatic improvement in terms of trade or export possibilities that can offset this reduction in net capital flows.'' **********In response to this gloomy picture, the World Bank, according to Mr. Jaycox, ''has put sub-Saharan Africa at the top of its priority list.'' **********While the debt picture for Africa appears increasingly bleak, some bankers and African experts believe that if given enough time, most African countries can strengthen their economies and accommodate foreign lenders. **********''It's not a question of whether they will meet their obligations or not, with the exception perhaps of Mozambique,'' said Jeffrey L. Schmidt, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. **********He added: ''It's mostly a matter of sub-Saharan countries being granted rescheduling of their debt service. Our feeling here is that unless they get some breathing space, they will never grow and will never get out from under their debt burden.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/26/business/ford-s-profit-falls-17.5-incentive-plan-is-cited.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1985-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 458, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORD'S PROFIT FALLS 17.5%, INCENTIVE PLAN IS CITED", "print_headline": "FORD'S PROFIT FALLS 17.5%, INCENTIVE PLAN IS CITED", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned $313.1 million, or $1.70 a share, in the third quarter, down 17.5 percent from the $379.7 million, or $2.05 a share, earned in the comparable period in 1984. **********The company attributed the decline to the cut-rate financing programs that were offered during the period to stimulate car sales, and to the cost of introducing new models. **********Worldwide sales fell 2 percent in the period, to $11.6 billion, from $11.8 billion.

Only 14 Republicans voted in favor of bringing the measure up for consideration while 164 were opposed. 50 Republican Votes Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. reiterated today that he would not allow the legislation to be brought back to the floor unless Mr. Reagan could promise a minimum of 50 Republican votes. **********The House Republican leaders, however, appeared to be withholding any such commitment until they get concessions that could, in turn, disrupt the Democratic support needed for final passage. Thus far, Mr. Reagan was said to have lined up 35 Republican votes, according to a Democratic Representative closely in touch with White House lobbyists. **********Democratic leaders and White House officials were still hopeful today that the President could drum up enough Republican support over the weekend to get the bill up for a vote before Congress adjourns. **********'Actively Involved' President **********''The President will continue to be actively involved and will today, and over the weekend, be making telephone calls,'' Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. ''We've made good progress in the area of vote gathering and that prompts me to make my statement that the White House believes that tax-reform legislation would pass if it gets to the floor of the House of Representatives.'' **********The White House also said that Mr. Reagan would discuss the tax bill in his Saturday radio talk. **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was hopeful that enough Republican votes could be lined up so that he could go back to the House Rules Committee ''in the very near future'' to bring the legislation back up for consideration. **********But after separate meetings today with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Democratic leadership rejected a Republican proposal to allow House members to vote on two major changes in the Ways and Means bill. Mr. Michel contended that such changes were needed to win additional support from Republicans, although he could not guarantee that the changes would produce the 50 votes Mr. O'Neill demanded. **********Christopher J. Matthews, a spokesman for Mr. O'Neill, called the proposal a ''red herring'' intended to ''shift attention from the fact that they don't have 50 votes; they're just trying to confuse the issue.'' **********Mr. Michel said the rule changes would win his vote on whether the issue should be reconsidered, although he said he intended to vote against the bill on a final ballot. Democrats have been frustrated by the position of House Republican leaders who have refused to help build Republican support for passage of tax-revision legislation that is a top legislative priority of Mr. Reagan's. **********Today, the deputy Republican leader, Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, circulated a two-page memorandum for Republican lawmakers to use in explaining to constituents why they are opposed to the tax bill the Democrats and President Reagan are backing. The measure, they say, would harm the economy and be bad for American families. **********Although Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Michel were scheduled to remain in Washington over the weekend, no further meetings between the two were scheduled. The Democratic strategy was to wait to see how many votes Mr. Reagan could produce over the weekend. With the House in recess until Monday, no further formal action could be taken anyway to move the bill along until Monday, when Congress returns. If enough Republican votes could be lined up by Monday, a hearing by the Rules Committee could quickly be scheduled and a vote on the bill taken the next day. **********House Republcans wanted to be allowed to put up an amendment on the House floor that would change the Ways and Means plan to provide a full $2,000 personal exemption to all taxpayers in an attempt to lure some conservatives Republicans on a ''pro-family'' theme. The Ways and Means tax plan would provide a $2,000 exemption for nonitemizers, but only $1,500 for those who itemize. Some Republicans have criticized this feature as discriminating against some large families. **********To pay for the change, the Republican amendment would also include new limitations on the deductibility of credit card and other consumer interest. Both proposed changes were previously incorporated into a Republican alternative tax plan that was to be voted on before the Ways and Means tax plan came up for a vote. **********Mr. Michel also wanted the rules on House consideration of the tax plan to allow members to adopt a resolution that calls on House and Senate tax-writers to delay the effective dates of many of the bill's provisions dealing with business investment until Jan. 1, 1987, instead of Jan. 1, 1986. Mr. Michel said the change was needed to prevent prolonged Senate consideration of the bill from disrupting business activity. Meanwhile, Republican leaders said they were working with Administration officials on a letter that Mr. Reagan would sign that would guarantee a veto of tax legislation that ultimately reached his desk if it were not more to Republican specifications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/business/turner-pessimism-on-mgm.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turner Pessimism On MGM", "print_headline": "Turner Pessimism On MGM", "body_text": " **********Turner Broadcasting System has suggested that its heavy borrowing to acquire the MGM/UA Entertainment Company could cripple its ability to run MGM as a major movie studio. **********In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington on Friday, Turner Broadcasting said that MGM's cash flow after the acquisition ''would be insufficient to fund new motion picture production by MGM or debt service by Turner Broadcasting.'' **********The filing also said that MGM suffered ''a substantial loss'' for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 1985. **********Turner Broadcasting's difficulties in swallowing MGM, in a $1.5 billion takeover announced in August, have been known.

''It is obviously less than a full agreement,'' one high-ranking State Department official said. ''It is really just a number of generalities, and that is why our response is in the form of questions. If it means that there is an Arab party ready to negotiate directly with Israel, then it is positive. If it means acceptance of Resolution 242, then it is good. We don't have the answers now.'' **********Shultz 'Fuzzy' on Accord **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz, when asked about the unpublished understanding between King Hussein and Mr. Arafat, announced on Monday in Amman, said today that ''our knowledge is kind of fuzzy.'' **********''We don't know exactly what is coming out of this discussion and I suppose it will sort of evolve along,'' he said in an interview over the Voice of America. ''But if there is movement, it helps,'' he said, ''even though the specific plan is something that is not operable.'' **********Specifically, Mr. Shultz said the United States did not know whether the Hussein-Arafat accord would lead to direct talks between Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, as sought by Washington, or whether the Arabs would insist on a broad international conference that Israel and the United States would oppose. **********Another high-ranking State Department official said the Administration has been told that the principles agreed to by King Hussein and Mr. Arafat still have to be approved by the Executive Council of the P.L.O. and the Palestine National Council in Tunis. **********Warning of Collapse **********Comments today by two senior P.L.O. officials, Farouk Kaddoumi, the group's foreign affairs specialist, and Saleh Khalaf, the No. 2 official in Fatah, the main P.L.O. group, that seemed critical of the framework agreement led the State Department official to warn that the whole project might again collapse. **********In April 1983, there was also a seeming accord between King Hussein and Mr. Arafat in April 1983, but Mr. Arafat failed to win the backing of the Palestine National Council, which would have allowed Jordan to negotiate with Israel on the status of the West Bank. **********According to Administration officials, the United States has not received a text of the agreement, but has been told that the framework accord consists of numerous principles. They are said to include these points: **********- A desire by Jordan and the P.L.O. to work out an accord involving the return of the lands occupied by Israel in exchange for peace. **********- Acceptance of previous United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian issue and Middle East diplomacy, but not a specific acceptance of Resolution 242 of 1967 and Resolution 338 of 1973, which are generally regarded as the bases for future negotiations involving territorial concessions by Israel in return for peace with its Arab neighbors. **********- A call for an international conference to decide on Middle East issues, although at the moment, Washington does not know how many governments Jordan and the P.L.O. have in mind. The United States opposes any such conference that goes beyond the Middle East participants and the United States. Prime Minister Ahmed Obeidat of Jordan said today that the peace conference envisaged by Jordan and the P.L.O. would include all permament members of the Security Council. Washington would not agree to such a format, officials said today. **********- Establishment of a joint delegation of Jordanians and Palestinians, although it is not clear now whether the P.L.O. is insisting that the Palestinians be subject to P.L.O. discipline, or could be drawn from other Palestinian groups more acceptable to Israel. **********- Insistence that the rights of self- determination of the Palestinians be accepted. In the jargon of the Middle East, this usually means acceptance of a Palestinian state, to be established in territory now occupied by Israel, on the West Bank of the Jordan, something that is opposed both by the United States and Israel. **********- Some kind of eventual ''confederation'' between this Palestinian state and Jordan. The United States favors an association between a Palestinian autonomous area on the West Bank and Jordan, but opposes setting up a Palestinian state first. **********Administration officials said that they were aware of reports in the Arab press, that purport to contain full texts of the Jordan-P.L.O. agreement, but they said that they have not been presented with such a text. The purported texts in the Arab press do contain some aspects of the principles that American officials said they have been informed of. **********American diplomats, the officials said, will be seeking answers to specific questions in coming weeks. It is not expected that there will be any firm conclusions drawn until President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt visits Washington on March 11, the officials said. The Egyptians, who have been giving their backing to a Jordanian-P.L.O. accord for months, have generally hailed the Amman framework agreement. A senior Administration official said that Jordan and Egypt had both asked the United States not to be quick to criticize the framework accord because it is only a preliminary set of agreements. **********''We view the milestone that has been achieved in Amman as one along a road that has many more to be achieved,'' he said.

Last month the Israeli Government offered a $1 million reward for Dr. Mengele's apprehension. **********Faces Trial Under 1950 Law **********The Israelis intend to put him on trial under the 1950 Law for the Punishment of Nazis and Their Collaborators. Under that law, Adolf Eichmann was condemned and hanged in 1962. **********Mr. Harel, who spirited Eichmann out of Buenos Aires to Israel and who later hunted for Dr. Mengele, said Nazis in South America had repeatedly tried to confuse the pursuers by spreading false reports of the doctor's death. **********He recalled that 15 years ago they erected a tombstone bearing Dr. Mengele's name and circulated photographs of it. He said he believed that the tombstone was in Paraguay. **********Chief Superintendent Menachem Rossek, commander of the police unit investigating Nazi war crimes, said, ''I'm convinced the man is alive and the whole story cropped up because the Nazis feel they're under pressure and in distress.'' **********Mr. Rossek noted that Dr. Mengele's family in West Germany had been reticent. He said that if Dr. Mengele did drown in Brazil in 1979 and was buried there, his relatives should have been the first to announce the news, ''to get the Auschwitz stigma off their backs.'' **********''By the plainest, simplest logic,'' Mr. Rossek continued, ''they would have announced it at once to enable positive identification instead of keeping the corpse hidden for years until unequivocal identification becomes impossible.'' **********The Ministry of Justice said, ''For the present, Israel is pursuing its efforts to locate Mengele and bring him to justice in Israel.'' **********The ministry spokesman, Yitzhak Feinberg, said coordination with American and West German committees was continuing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1985-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Inflation Deflated There's more good news for consumers ahead. August's consumer price index, due out this Tuesday, should show at most two-tenths of 1 percent growth, says Sam Nakagama, chief economist for Nakagama & Wallace Inc. That would mean four consecutive flat months for the index, which measures the movement of retail prices that consumers pay. **********''The big factor is the cut-rate financing by the auto industry,'' said Mr. Nakagama. Gasoline prices are also falling, he says, and food prices have come down. **********Mr. Nakagama says that inflation, as measured by the broadly-based gross national product deflator, will dip from about 4 percent in 1984 to 3.5 percent this year and to 2.9 percent in 1986. For one thing, he says, the end of quotas on Japanese autos means a rise in the supply of foreign cars, which forces down prices of new and used cars. He also expects oil prices to decline by $3 to $5 a barrel by next March, adding: ''I think the longer-term drop in inflation will be greater than most people realize.'' **********Trade Winds **********August's merchandise trade figures, scheduled for release this Friday, will show a $12 billion deficit, says Joseph Carson, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics. The deficit, which represents the difference between the nation's imports and exports, was only a bit less dismal in July, when it came to $10.5 billion. ''For August,'' Mr. Carson said, ''the deficit level should be more in line with the average monthly trade deficit for the first part of the year, which was $11.6 billion'' - roughly the same average monthly figure the Department of Commerce expects for 1985. **********Some economists however, are more optimistic. ''Further increases from here will be modest compared with what we've had during the earlier part of the year,'' predicted Burton Zwick, senior economist at Kidder Peabody & Co. The dollar's decline since February, he says, will soon start to show up in smaller monthly trade deficits. **********A Hybrid Hit **********The dollar's six-month drop has attracted foreigners to an unusual investment instrument: the dual-currency bond. Ford Motor Credit, International Business Machines Credit and others are raising funds with the bond, an odd composite that seems tailor-made for short-term dips and long-term strength in the dollar. The bond redeems coupons in foreign currency, the Japanese yen, for example, and returns the principal, in 7 to 10 years, in American dollars. **********''The popularity of dual currency bonds surfaced after investors saw that the dollar had been weak for a few months,'' said Vilas Gadkari, research analyst at Salomon Brothers. From February through August, companies worldwide raised $2.9 billion with such bonds, reported London's International Financial Review. Of 29 issues for the period, 18 were United States issues. **********William Blood, treasurer of Ford Motor Credit, expects the bonds' popularity to continue. Like many American companies, Ford has placed its dual-currency bonds with Japanese investors, who he said, like the yield: Japanese government bonds, for example, yield about 6.5 percent at maturity, while the yen-dollar bond coupons give a return of about 8 percent. **********More Work, Less Play **********Americans are working longer and spending less time at leisure, according to a national survey by Louis Harris and Associates Inc. The median work week stretched to 47.3 hours in 1984, up from 43.1 hours in 1975. The median time for leisure was just 18.1 hours in 1984 down from 24.3 hours in 1975. **********What's worse, for those who love the hours not assigned to working, sleeping, or home- and life-sustaining tasks, leisure time will continue to shrink, said Mr. Harris. One reason for the trend: Uncertainty about the economy's direction has caused many businesses to be more cautious about hiring. ''Corporations would rather work their present work force harder and pay for more overtime,'' said Mr. Harris, who sees a 48-hour median work week for this year and - barring a sudden upturn in employment - an even longer work week for 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/09/world/regan-is-wary-adviser-less-so-on-soviet-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 997, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REGAN IS WARY, ADVISER LESS SO ON SOVIET TALKS", "print_headline": "REGAN IS WARY, ADVISER LESS SO ON SOVIET TALKS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan sought today to lower expectations about progress at his summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. At the same time, some of Mr. Reagan's top advisers said efforts were under way to encourage progress on arms control. **********Mr. Reagan told Republican Congressional leaders at a White House meeting that he expected difficulty in bringing about a ''genuine improvement'' in relations with Moscow. **********But in a decidedly more optimistic assessment, Mr. Reagan's chief arms control adviser, Paul H. Nitze, said the United States was not giving up on the prospect of progress in the arms talks in Geneva. Despite wide gaps between the two sides, he said, the Administration is working on a set of guidelines to give a fresh stimulus to the talks. **********'Confidence and Optimism' **********Mr. Reagan told the Republican leaders of his ''confidence and optimism'' about the summit meeting, to be held in Geneva on Nov. 19 and 20, but he said he was aware of significant differences with Moscow. His tone was similar to that of other high-ranking officials, who have suggested in recent weeks that the two sides are still far apart on such issues as arms control and regional disputes. **********''I have no illusions about Soviet intentions and fundamental differences separating us,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''We are bringing a broad agenda to Geneva focusing on the full spectrum of U.S.-Soviet relations, not just arms control, but regional conflicts, bilateral relations and human rights. **********''Genuine improvement in the relationship,'' the President said, ''can only result when there is progress in all four areas.'' **********Mr. Reagan left the door open for some progress by telling the Congressional leaders that he would not seek ''artificial linkage'' among the four areas when he meets with Mr. Gorbachev. Thus, he suggested, the issue of arms control will not directly influence progress in other areas. **********Arms Adviser's Assessment **********Mr. Nitze's assessment, which was reflected by other Administration officials, was made at a breakfast meeting with reporters. It followed the return from Moscow of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who had warned after his Kremlin talks against betting on success at the summit meeting. **********Mr. Nitze said neither Moscow nor Washington wanted the summit meeting to be a failure. **********''We want this to be a success,'' he said. ''We want to maximize the productivity to help the President maximize the productivity between the two leaders.'' **********Mr. Nitze said the guidelines that were being discussed for the arms talks would cover both offensive and defensive weapons. **********Asked about the chances of arriving at such guidelines before the summit meeting, Mr. Nitze said, ''I am never able to make an estimate on getting something done. **********''Our hopes are we can work something out,'' he said. ''There is a big gap between our proposal and their proposal. It is not only the numbers involved. The devil lies in the detail. You really have to work on the detail.'' **********A State Department official said the Administration's senior arms control experts met this afternoon to discuss Mr. Shultz's trip to Moscow and the just-completed round of negotiations in Geneva. The group was expected to discuss the prospects for guidelines for the arms talks. The Soviet Union has called for an agreement on principles to guide the negotiations. **********The possibility of some progress was also raised by Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman. **********''I think both sides will make a presentation,'' he said. ''For our part, we hope that it would result in some basis for proceeding at the arms control talks. But that remains to be seen.'' **********In recent weeks, Mr. Reagan and Administration officials have said the summit meeting is primarily designed to establish an ''agenda for the future.'' Mr. Reagan suggested that goal again today, saying that the meeting was not an ''end in itself.'' **********''We will chart a realistic course for further discussion among our negotiators at Geneva,'' the President said. ''We face a difficult negotiating task in Geneva. We do not view Geneva as an end in itself, but rather part of an ongoing process.'' **********Mr. Reagan said he was going to the summit meeting ''with a sense of confidence and optimism based on the knowledge that over the past five years we have restored America's strength and international standing.'' **********In a related development, senior arms control officials were briefed today on a Defense Department report on how the United States should respond to purported Soviet violations of arms control agreements. **********The Defense Department was asked to prepare the report after Mr. Reagan decided in June to continue - for the time being - to abide by the unratified strategic arms limitation treaty as long as the Soviet Union did. For months, the Pentagon has been evaluating possible United States actions, including the construction of additional strategic weapons. **********Expected to Repeat Allegations **********Administration officials said today that the report was expected to repeat allegations of Soviet cheating and to call for responses that would require the United States to abandon its commitment not to undercut the second treaty on strategic arms. **********Some Administration officials said they were concerned that the conclusions and recommendations of the report would be disclosed to the press before the summit meeting and could sour the atmosphere there. **********In a major speech last month, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger asserted that the Soviet Union had deployed the mobile SS-25 missile in violation of a treaty provision limiting each side to one new land-based missile. But Administration officials have said that the Soviet Union in fact told Washington privately months ago that it was beginning to deploy the SS-25. **********Some Administration officials said Mr. Weinberger had made the speech to build support for a hard-line United States position at the summit meeting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/26/business/executive-changes-182440.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 351, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Atari Corp., the personal computer company based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has named Michael V.

Today, the main problem is closer to home: The mills are caught up in a fierce battle among themselves for market share and are cutting each other up on prices. **********''The complaint isn't about imports anymore; it's about domestic price-cutting,'' said Charles A. Bradford, steel analyst at Merrill Lynch. **********On the surface, there are signs of progress. After years of trauma, the major mills are trim and relatively efficient. The results of their effort to lower costs have been described as ''superb'' and ''amazing'' by analysts. The old complacent management cultures are gone, replaced by a competitive breed. Some companies have been turning a profit even with the rampant price-cutting. **********But the improvement that has occurred cannot be credited to the import program. ''Looking ahead a year ago at this time with the present import program,'' said James N. Rudolph, analyst at Wertheim & Company, ''one would have expected the industry would have been doing nicely by September 1985. In terms of expectations, things are worse.'' **********Bankruptcy Proceedings **********In the past year one major mill, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Company, entered into bankruptcy proceedings and is being struck by the steelworkers' union over its plan to reduce wages. Troubles have spread to many mini-mills, and plant closings have continued. **********The battle for market share among the major mills is said to be fierce, led by the United States Steel Corporation, a company that used to announce the price increases that the rest of the industry followed. U.S. Steel has increased its market share to 17.6 percent in the second quarter from 16 percent in the first, Mr. Bradford estimated. **********''The industry has had a price collapse, which is hurting the second half,'' said Peter Marcus, steel analyst at Paine Webber. ''The oligopoly has been replaced by competition.'' The price of some products has fallen by as much as $70 a ton this year, he said. **********To be sure, imports still provide some pressure on prices, and the industry is still looking to the import control program to take hold. **********Delay in Setting up Program **********The President, who has denied import relief to many industries, announced the steel program last Sept. 18 as the Presidential election neared. It required that nations agree voluntarily to limit their imports. But setting up the program took longer than expected and controls were not generally in place until spring. **********The President's five-year program set its sights on reducing foreign market share to 18.5 percent. In July, import penetration fell to 21.9 percent, from a worrisome 28.1 percent in June. August figures are not yet available. **********Donald H. Trautlein, chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute as well as of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, said July's performance created hope that the program ''may be beginning to have some effect.'' **********But even if the program succeeds in bringing imports under control, some analysts fret that the rewards will be short term. They fear that import controls will increase the imports of finished products that contain steel, hurting the customers of the mills and eventually the steel industry itself. **********Decline in Demand **********John C. Tumazos, analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said he expected a 1 percent decline in demand for domestic steel next year, even with trade protection. He believes the development of plastic auto body panels will displace 4 percent of domestic steel shipments over the next decade. **********In the recent past, steel consumption has declined because of the trends toward smaller cars and aluminum beverage cans. Many analysts believe that any major gain in consumption in this business cycle, such as in durable goods, has already occurred. **********All this means that the mills must continue to cut costs, analysts say. They fear that any short-term success brought about by import controls would cool the desire to hold down expenses and whet the unions' appetite for a larger share of the pie. **********''I can see the potential for a catastrophe next year,'' Mr. Bradford said. ''Let's theorize that the import controls begin to work, but the profit generated is purely temporary. Then the unions will come in and say, 'We want our money back.' The mills will just die all over again.'' **********Imports by Companies **********American steel producers may do some importing of their own, if executives of some of the major companies have their way. The idea, bitterly opposed by the union, is to ease out of some production - particularly the expensive business of producing slabs and ingot - by buying slab overseas and concentrate on finishing bars, sheet strip and other products. **********Shipments of semifinished steel are not counted in the import control program's attempt to limit foreign steel to 18.5 percent of the American market. Semifinished steel accounts for about 3 percent of total foreign market penetration in the United States. **********Tom Graham, U.S. Steel's chief operating officer for steel, told a trade magazine recently that the marketplace for steel in the United States ''would accept a finishing operation in this country with remote steelmaking. The economics are so powerful that if we can overcome national chauvinism, it's almost as sure as death and taxes.'' **********U.S. Steel's plan to turn its Fairless Works near Philadelphia into a finishing operation met strong union opposition and other difficulties and was eventually dropped. But the company is believed to be still interested in cutting a similar deal with a foreign supplier. **********Not all steelmakers are interested in seeing more foreign semifinished steel enter the country. Mr. Trautlein, speaking as chairman of the industry trade group, recently called for strict observance of the 12.7 million ton limit on semifinished imports that was part of the import-control program imposed last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/business/l-the-market-197440.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Market", "print_headline": "The Market", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********There were more truths in your story (''How the Institutions Rule the Market,'' Nov. 25) than I've seen in a long time.

As the northernmost country in the drought- stricken belt between the desert and the African jungles, this country, about the size of France and Spain combined, is the front line, but it has now been almost totally taken over by the dunes marching southward. **********Even if rain should return tomorrow, Mauritania's 1.7 million people will be reliant on food aid until well into the next century, and the aid, according to relief officials, will still be cheaper than fighting the desert. **********No one, they said, is dying from starvation, in part because Mauritanians have shown a remarkable unity in sharing the aid. But, in a more subtle tragedy, an entire desert culture going back thousands of years may already be dead. The desert is virtually emptied of what had been one of the world's largest nomadic populations and their seemingly timeless caravans. **********In a tent camp at Tignarg oasis, about 10 miles southeast of here, on the edge of the Road of Hope, and in camps up and down its length across the country, hundreds of thousands of these once-proud herders have been forced to become squatters, and the road is the lifeline for Government food and water. **********The capital, Nouakchott, 140 miles down the road from here, has become what relief officials say is the largest refugee camp in Africa. **********A village of just 5,000 people when it was founded 25 years ago, the capital's population has more than tripled in the last eight years to nearly 500,000. **********The grounded nomads are people like Alioune Ould Tounsi, age unknown, a tall, erect black Moor. ''We used to breed animals and counted on ourselves,'' he said, sitting under a woven wool tent. ''Now a father with a family has no food for his children, no job, no animals, nothing.'' **********Around him on a blanket and straw mat were half a dozen other men wearing turbans and flowing, if tattered, robes of pale blue or white.

Their hierarchical structures, internal Moslem education and sharing is being lost. Shacks are replacing tents, and a whole generation of youth is being raised without desert skills. **********'Ready for Whatever Comes' **********The clan at Tignarg held out much longer than most, finally moving to the road a year ago. Of their several hundred animals, they said, they are down to two jackasses and several goats. **********''We are ready for whatever comes from God,'' Mr. Tounsi said, reflecting a Moslem fatalism that relief workers say has allowed these desert wanderers to face the drought, and the desert itself, for so long. **********Eighty percent of the population is made up of black and white Moors, most of whom were nomads. Southern tribes make up the remainder of the population. **********''Nomadism was equal to civilization,'' said Majoub Ould Boye, a former Planning Minister and now delegate to the United Nations, as he sipped mint tea under a white tent in his Nouakchott yard. But now, he said, even crime in what had been a largely crimeless Moslem society has grown. **********The change has come as a shock. Rainfall last year was 25 percent to 30 percent of the 40-year average before 1972, relief officials said. The Senegal River, which forms Mauritania's border with Senegal and is Mauritania's only year-round river, reached its lowest point since recording began in 1904. **********Before the drought struck, Mauritanian farmers were annually growing 100,000 tons of sorghum, wheat and other grains, enough to feed the country. Last year, they grew 15,000 tons, or little more than 6 percent of total consumption. Some grains were imported, but fully two-thirds of what Mauritanians ate came as donations, with the United States the largest donor. **********''It is a question now of national survival and getting worse as we are more and more incapable of meeting our needs,'' said Mohammed Ould Babetta, deputy head of the Government's food agency. **********The Mauritanians say they need 140,000 tons in food aid this year, but the donors, working in unison, say that because of surpluses left from last year, 112,000 tons are enough. Mauritanians worry that, whatever the level of aid, it discourages self-production. **********There have been whiffs of corruption. When the ruling junta's new President, Col. Maouya Ould Sidi Ahmed Taya, took over in a palace coup in December, he jailed some food officials for purported misuse of aid. Western diplomats said that the diversions were small, however, and that the jailings were in part political. **********Scientists list many causes for the disaster. The atmospheric pressure systems driving the rains north from the Gulf of Guinea have been weak. But man has compounded the impact. **********Overgrazing of Grasslands **********The Sahel is a dry and ecologically fragile grassy plain. The nomadic herders greatly increased their numbers of livestock during the relatively wet 1950's. They tried to maintain the herds after the drought set in between 1968 and 1971 by overgrazing in ever more marginal grasslands, helping turn the lands into sand. **********Desertification dates back at least 2,500 years, when the Sahara itself was mostly grass, and Carthage, in Tunisia, was the bread basket of the Roman Empire. Mauritania's large caravans over the centuries helped denude the prairies, and Europeans in the 18th and 19th centuries destroyed the gum forests that ran the 400-mile length of Mauritania's now desert coast, according to research by the American National Academy of Sciences. **********Before French colonizers created modern Mauritania by drawing lines on a map and giving it independence in 1960, the nomads would have migrated to the greener pastures of what are today Mali and Senegal. **********Thousands have already migrated with their herds in the last two years, but the borders are growing tense. Mali has forbidden the crossing of any more Mauritanian animals, and the Senegalese are grumbling. Conflicts have also been reported within the country between the nomads and southern agricultural blacks. **********Efforts to fight back - the desert is moving south at about four miles a year - have shown little success. Two dams costing more than $1 billion are scheduled to open before the end of the decade, but scientists doubt they will be enough. **********Colonel Taya promotes pumping the ground water up from under the desert. ''That way the population can continue to live where they are,'' he said in an interview. But foreign experts say the underground pools are deep, difficult to get at and easily depletable. **********Projects are under way to stabilize the dunes, but the efforts seem pitifully daunted by the challenge. **********And all the desert development projects are based on what relief workers in this region say is an outdated assumption that the nomads who have left, some as many as 15 years ago, will go back. ''There has been an urban revolution in this society that few have acknowledged,'' an American said. **********Dependent on Iron Ore Exports **********Economic development in other areas could allow Mauritania to import more food. But world prices for iron ore, Mauritania's principal export, are low, and the country is deep in debt. Fishing is promising, but Mauritania has no navy to control the huge Soviet and Spanish fishing fleets overfishing its grounds. Officials have turned to oil, but extensive drilling by foreign oil companies has been in vain. **********''In the long term, this country may be condemned,'' a senior foreign diplomat said, ''but no one wants to talk about it. You can't tell the American Congress and the American people that you are going to be paying food aid forever, so you propose more projects. It helps convince yourself you're doing something.'' **********The despair of educated Mauritanians was reflected in a poem recently published in a newspaper. ''The singer of dry sounds has won,'' the poet wrote, adding, ''Has it been written that we will wander forever?'' **********Ecologists say defeatism is an obstacle itself. But in Tignarg, such considerations are far from Mr. Tounsi. He bridled at suggestions that he even look into his future. There is only one option, he said: ''Inshallah.'' It means ''Whatever God wills.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/07/business/western-union-pact-is-announced.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WESTERN UNION PACT IS ANNOUNCED", "print_headline": "WESTERN UNION PACT IS ANNOUNCED", "body_text": " **********Negotiators for the Western Union Corporation and a union representing 6,500 workers reached an agreement late Tuesday calling for concessions, ending a 10-day-old nationwide strike, a union official said. **********''The strike ends immediately, so we're telling people if they work the midnight shift to go back at once,'' said Richard Brockert, international president of the United Telegraph Workers Union, which represents technicians, operators and clerks. **********The agreement is subject to ratification by union members, and union officials will recommend that it be accepted, Mr. Brockert said. **********Agreement Reached at 11:45 **********Warren R.

The last Soviet leader to meet with an American President was Leonid I. Brezhnev, who met with President Carter in Vienna in June 1979. At the time, many Russians were embarrassed by Mr. Brezhnev's behavior, which they said showed signs of senility. **********Diplomats said Mr. Gorbachev probably hoped to use his affable political style to foster an image of the Soviet Union as an amenable and peaceloving nation in the eyes of Westerners, and Americans in particular.

Under current arrangements, the Government is scheduled to decide in November whether to deploy 48 Tomahawk cruise missiles on its soil, according to a 1979 NATO decision.

It asked for an urgent meeting of a multifactional security committee to discuss a cease-fire designed to end three weeks of heavy fighting in the Lebanese capital. **********The announcement was made by Elie Hobeika, the chairman of a 10-member executive that commands the Lebanese Forces. The step was seen here as a gesture to try to improve relations with Syria and create a good atmosphere for a projected conference between the Lebanese President, Amin Gemayel, and the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad. **********Syrian Role Is Favored **********It is also fulfills a political manifesto issued by Mr. Hobeika this month in which he declared the militia's intention to abandon all links with Israel in favor of a Syrian role in Lebanon. **********Mr. Hobeika issued the declaration after he was elected to the top post in the Lebanese Forces, rising above the militia's chief of staff, Samir Geagea. **********The declaration constituted a radical shift in the position of Christian militants, who on March 12 staged a revolt against President Gemayel and his pro-Syrian stance. **********The change has been attributed to a military defeat suffered by the Lebanese Forces in the hills east of Sidon last month at the hands of Syrian-backed Moslem militiamen. As a result, thousands of Christians fled their villages and took refuge in Jezzin, a stronghold about 15 miles east of Sidon. **********Another reason is that the Government in Israel has decided to disengage totally from internal Lebanese politics after withdrawing its troops from Lebanese territory that Israel invaded in June 1982, Office Opened in 1982 The Lebanese Forces opened its liaison office in Jerusalem in 1982 and sent a key activist, Pierre Yazbek, to head it.

It is flanked from the north and east by Syrian troops and from the south by Moslem Shiite and Druse fighters. **********Mr. Hobeika's overtures have drawn only lukewarm response from the Moslems in Lebanon and from Damascus. **********The militia's decision to disengage from Jezzin and the security strip north of the Israeli border is aimed at dissociating itself from another Christian militia, the 1,500-member Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/26/business/the-in-colors-of-87-are-being-picked-in-85.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Belkin", "pub_date": "1985-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE 'IN' COLORS OF '87 ARE BEING PICKED IN '85", "print_headline": "THE 'IN' COLORS OF '87 ARE BEING PICKED IN '85", "body_text": " **********In a small, brick-walled office on Lexington Avenue it is already the winter of 1987. **********Outside, stores are filled with berry red dresses, catalogues show raspberry pink sweaters, people rush by in jet black slacks - the ''in'' colors for the current season. **********But at the offices of the American Color Association, the present is passe. Color experts have been gathering here for the last two weeks to nibble smoked turkey, sip Champagne and predict what the chic shades will be two years hence - a bluer purple, a mocha brown, Army khaki and gun metal gray, among others, ''The colors are in the air, you have to catch them,'' said Marielle Bancou, executive director of the association. ''We use a little art, a little science, some economics, some psychology, some fortune-telling.'' **********''Whatever the choice, it is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' added Margaret Walch, an association director. ''If enough of our members follow the advice, that is what you see in the stores.'' **********Color sells, those inside the $57 billion apparel industry say, and the 70-year-old association is the oldest of about a dozen organizations in the country that sell color. It is fortune-telling in its purest sense, because fortunes often rest on the results. **********''When a woman sees garments hanging on a rack, if she doesn't like the color she doesn't look at the garment,'' said Virginia Borland, a member of the color committee, and until recently fashion coordinator for Avtex fibers. About 1,100 fabric mills, designers, clothing manufacturers and retail stores receive the association's forecasts and use them, and those of competing color forecasters, in creating their new lines. **********''We spread them all out on a table and look for an overall effect,'' said a designer for Liz Claiborne Inc. ''It's remarkable how often different groups reach the same conclusion. Then we add our own instincts.'' **********''No one wants to have a card full of orange when everyone else's card is full of blue,'' Mrs. Walch said, ''unless, of course, the big seller that year turns out to be orange.'' **********One day last week, nine color experts assembled at the association's offices, representing such companies as Milliken Inc., R. H. Macy & Company, Federated Department Stores, Chaus Inc. and the Reliable Textile Company. The wall behind them was stacked with boxes of swatches - the forecasted colors dating from more than 50 years ago - and the table in front of them was piled high with lunch. **********In the space of three hours they would select about 40 shades designed to guide manufacturers in creating their new lines. This committee was composed of specialists on women's clothes; other committees will tackle children's wear, men's wear and home furnishings. All are planning now for the fall and winter of 1987, because production schedules in the apparel industry dictate that work on a line begin almost two years before the final product appears in the stores. **********They were offered Champagne, with apologies that it was not French; they had second helpings of ratatouille, complimenting Miss Bancou, who made it, and they opened their party favors, agreeing that the delicate pastel crayons were appropriate for the event. Then they cleared the plates, removed the bright red tablecloth because its brilliance was distracting, complained that the Norwegian light bulbs installed for the occasion were artificially perfect, and got down to business. **********June B. Roche, chairman of the group and a corporate fashion director at Milliken, argued that a growing interest in personal colors - the idea that certain colors are best for certain personalities and lifestyles -would bring a new interest in blues, grays and greens. Robert Abajian, vice president of merchandising and design for Counterparts, a garment manufacturer, predicted that warm dazzling colors, such as those in the recent exhibit from India at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, would be popular. Eleanor Douglas, fashion director of Federated, believed that khaki, green and purple would become more important. **********A Uniform of Sorts **********Marina Victor, art director of Chaus, suggested that consumers wanted their clothes to be a uniform of sorts, a barrier between them and the outside world. ''There's too much going out there, there's a feeling of 'Don't touch me,' '' said Joan Weinstein, fashion director of Concord Fabrics Inc., a textile manufacturer. Eventually, the entire group agreed, and they proceeded to find specific hues to express the general theme of ''protective colors.'' **********''The goal is to give our members a feeling of the direction that colors are taking,'' Mrs. Walch explained. ''Each hue is important, the value of that hue, whether it is light or dark, is important, and the chroma of that hue, how it is being cast, the saturation, is terribly important.'' **********''Two years ago the purples were red,'' she added. ''Today this group is looking to a blue cast to the purple. That's a significant difference in coloration.'' **********The group spilled scraps of fabric, bits of string and a host of unlikely but colorful objects on the table and debated which ones provided exactly the feeling they sought. Just the right brown was found in the coffee-colored chocolates served with dessert. The perfect purple was discovered in the tissue paper used to wrap the crayon party favors. The khaki came from the official book of swatches used by the United States Army. **********The gray proved somewhat more elusive. ''I can't find it anywhere,'' said Mrs. Victor, sorting through boxes of fabric samples - more than 20,000 are collected by interns each summer - marked ''blue grays,'' ''brown grays'' and ''black grays.'' ''I went through the gray boxes; I went through the blue boxes; I'm looking for a gun metal color; I don't think it exists,'' she added. **********Taped to Poster Board **********A satisfactory shade was finally found, in a book of swatches from the 1940's, and the approved hues were taped to a piece of white poster board, like a child's school project. The overall collage was heavy on greens and green blues, considered by the committee members to be the ''in'' shade for the fall and winter of 1987. **********Finally, Miss Bancou scooped up the poster board and put it away for safekeeping. Soon it will be sent to a fabric mill commissioned to duplicate the shades on uniform sized swatches and produce a sleek final product from the makeshift mock-up created by the committee. **********The resulting card will be sent to the association's members, who pay nearly $500 to join, and the process will begin again. ''In a few months,'' Mrs. Walch said, ''we'll be working on the spring of 1988.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/24/jobs/emerging-careers-a-new-world-of-telecommunications-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1985-03-24", "snippet": "WITH last year's breakup of the Bell System, companies that once provided strictly local phone service are now in effect data-processing companies too.

Equipment companies that used to manufacture telephone sets have turned to building sophisticated electronic switchboards that can remember numbers and route calls over the least expensive circuit. Long distance, which was the exclusive preserve of A.T.& T. is now brimming with competitors large and small. **********It should be no surprise, then, that there is a growing market for professionals in today's telecommunications industry, which can offer nearly $30,000 a year to start with the right engineering degree and some experience. Although new technology is, in some instances, reducing staffing needs, the growth in demand for telecommunications services is causing shortages in a number of highly technical job categories such as radio engineers, data-communications specialists, computer programmers, communications systems based on optics, and others. **********''Everything I have seen in terms of forecasts indicates that the demand for technical people in communications will far outstrip the supply,'' said Thomas W. Green, a vice president for development and placement at the GTE Corporation, the nation's largest independent phone company. ''There is a real question of whether we can get enough people to get the job done.'' **********But openings also exist for numerous categories of business people, such as marketing and financial specialists, strategic planners and experts in the area of government regulation. ''Because of the changing environment we can use almost every type of skill imaginable, from marketing to finance to the inventive skills,'' said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Continental Telecom Inc., a big independent phone company. **********More precisely, though, he and other industry experts agree that certain skills stand out as particularly attractive to employers in telecommunications - local phone companies, long-distance carriers and equipment makers. And while thousands of job classifications exist, for a person seeking a job in telecommunications it's probably easiest to organize one's search in terms of the technical side and the nontechnical side. **********On the technical side, the most common preparation for a career in telecommunications is, of course, to earn an engineering degree. Last year, for instance, GTE hired about 360 engineers directly from college. It expects to hire 400 this year. Many will be electrical engineers but increasingly the company has been hiring physicists and chemists to explore new communications transmission media, and computer designers and programmers in recognition of the tightening connections between communications and data processing. The jobs these people hold are as varied as the persons themselves. Engineers design communications equipment such as solid-state switchboards and big switches for telephone company central offices. They help build the long-distance network of GTE Sprint, the company's discount long-distance arm. And they work in GTE's independent phone companies automating local offices. **********GTE's practice is to hire engineers directly from college. But it does not always do so, and it would be wise for a prospective candidate to check its experience requirements beforehand. A.T.& T., for example, places a big premium on experience, obtaining some 80 percent of its new recruits from other jobs. Moreover, of those joining A.T.& T. directly from school, a hefty 40 percent have advanced degrees. And if it's a plum job a technical person is seeking - for example, with the company's elite A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories - the company expects job candidates to be in the top 25 percent of their graduating class. **********The nontechnical side of telecommunications, on the other hand, typically requires a business degree or M.B.A., and offers opportunities for traditional business people to use their skills in telecommunications applications. Marketing executives at the MCI Communications Corporation, for example, sell that company's discount long-distance network. Marketing executives at the Rolm Corporation, a big equipment maker in Santa Clara, Calif., sell telephone switching systems for offices. And Government regulation means dealing with the Federal agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission, that oversee phone companies' operations. **********Then, too, there are opportunities for licensed professionals. For example, nearly all the telecommunications companies - phone companies, equipment makers and long-distance companies - hire lawyers and accountants. Some even have architects on staff for the design of communications systems in buildings. **********Salaries are in line with what could be earned using one's skills in other industries. Business majors, for instance, generally start in the range of $20,000 to $25,000 annually. Engineers with baccalaureate degrees start at around $28,000. Those with an M.B.A. degree can tack on an additional $7,000 in starting salary. The top earners, those with both technical and business backgrounds, can earn well over $40,000 to begin. **********It's this last group of people, in fact, who are most sought after to become telecommunications managers - men and women responsible for designing, overseeing the installation of and managing a corporation's telecommunications network. In the past, big companies relied heavily on consultants for this task, but increasingly they are bringing the work in-house. So, for example, many of the major New York banks, such as Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, have telecommunications managers. Big oil companies like Diamond Shamrock have them. And as communications become more important in high finance, growing numbers of Wall Street firms are hiring communications managers to build systems and monitor costs. **********But having technical training and business experience is not enough to get one of these plum jobs. As is the case for most managers, having good ''people'' skills is critical too. According to Marcia Freedman, author of a study called ''Training for Telecommunications Occupations'': ''The job has more to do with relating to vendors and the minutiae of contracts than it does with supervision of workers or other standard managerial tasks. Telecommunications managers must have first- rate interpersonal and verbal skills; a knowledge of business and finance, including budget and cost analysis; elements of traffic engineering; and sufficient technical familiarity to know how the equipment works.'' **********''Things are moving much faster,'' said Charles J. Sherrard, a senior recruiter at A.T.& T. ''The demands to be aware of competitors are greater. You have new products coming out every month, and you've got to be ready. It's by no means boring.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/25/world/the-un-s-anniversary-reagan-klinghoffer-visit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  REAGAN-KLINGHOFFER VISIT", "print_headline": "THE U.N.'S ANNIVERSARY;   REAGAN-KLINGHOFFER VISIT", "body_text": " **********The White House announced today that the family of Leon Klinghoffer would visit President Reagan on Friday in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Reagan wanted to express his condolences to the Klinghoffer family while the President is in New York.

''That argues for secretaries training other secretaries and managers training other managers.'' **********However, adds Bonnie Johnson, a psychologist and office systems planner at the Intel Corporation, such informal training must take place within a corporate culture that stresses learning. It will not work, she warns, ''unless a company makes continuous training available to employees and learning is given priority status by high-level management.'' **********If those two conditions do exist, the amount of training, both formal and informal, will tend to have a snowballing effect. Miss Johnson tells of an Intel manager who spurned the personal computer the company gave him, preferring to do his financial spreadsheets and memos by hand. His secretary then transferred the data onto the computer. **********Although the manager claimed that he simply did not want to use the computer, he actually was frightened that he would not be able to absorb the new technology. Then he noticed that he was virtually the only one in the department who was not actively using the computer - and his reaction, as Miss Johnson recalls it, was if his peers could learn it, he could, too. **********Even as some tech psychologists study the impact of peer pressure on the spread of computer use, others study the exact reverse - that is, the impact of computers on interoffice relations. The growing use of electronic mail and computer conferencing, in which people ''meet'' by writing messages on computer terminals that automatically appear on other people's terminals, has attracted any number of researchers. ''Gathering and dispersing information is the lifeblood of any organization, which is what makes this topic so attractive,'' said Susan Dray, the Honeywell manager of human technology impacts. **********One recent experiment, conducted by Professor Kiesler and several Carnegie Mellon colleagues, turned up some rather surprising results on the ways in which computers affect communications. Several university administrators and managers from Pittsburgh companies were put into groups of three, and asked to make such decisions as choosing between two capital investments, one of which would deliver a small but certain return, the other of which was a gamble that offered a higher potential win. **********On half the problems, the groups were asked to use computers to communicate; on the other half, they relied on conventional face to face conversation. The researchers found that when they used the computers, the participants used fewer words to discuss their points. And they were less swayed by the idea of standing alone against the other two people in the group. ''Social cues - tone of voice and facial expressions - are absent,'' said Professor Kiesler. ''The result is that people are more likely to make independent choices.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/06/business/star-wars-gain-seen-with-allies.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1985-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 424, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'STAR WARS' GAIN SEEN WITH ALLIES", "print_headline": "'STAR WARS' GAIN SEEN WITH ALLIES", "body_text": " **********Two top Defense Department officials responsible for the Strategic Defense Initiative said today that European governments and corporations were growing more receptive to participation in research for the plan popularly known as ''Star Wars.''

Or is it just taking a holiday? **********William R. Rhodes of Citicorp, who has been head of the committee of banks negotiating with the Latin American countries over the rescheduling of their debts, warns against complacency that ''the debt bomb has been defused.'' **********''That characterization is too strong,'' he said at a conference on the third world at Duke University this week. ''The reality is that a great deal remains to be done before these countries get back on the road to the growth they have enjoyed in the past.'' **********Nevertheless, he said much progress had been made in the three major debtor countries, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. **********In dealing with Argentina, the creditor banks have committed to provide $4 billion of the $4.2 billion new-money facility. Argentina has also reached agreement with the Paris Club of industrial nations for refinancing principal and interest on Government and Government-guaranteed debt from 1982 through 1985. As a result, United States banking regulators have upgraded the status of Argentine debts that were substandard. But inflation, which has run at an annual rate as high as 1,000 percent in the past year, is still jeopardizing the nation's growth, and the Alfonsin Government is struggling to get the nation's economy back on a steady growth path. **********Mexico, whose reserves had been wiped out in 1982, has built up over $8 billion in gross international reserves, with its net reserves about $6 billion. The Mexican adjustment in 1983 was accomplished largely by severe import restriction, but in 1984 its imports from the United States climbed 40 percent, and a similar increase is expected this year. **********Brazil is also suffering from high inflation, with the rate of price increase still at about 60 percent a year. But its real economic growth potential is stronger than Argentina's. Brazil chopped its public-sector deficit from 17.6 percent of gross national product in 1982 to 8.7 percent in 1983 and 6.9 percent in 1984. **********The country achieved a $13 billion trade surplus last year, largely as a result of export growth rather than import restriction. Its trade balance was greatly helped by the decline in oil prices and by the structural transformation of the Brazilian economy. Domestic oil output nearly doubled in two years, surpassing imports. Brazil's bill for net imported oil fell to $4.6 billion in 1984 from $9 billion in 1982. But its inflation has also remained stubbornly high - at about 220 percent in the past year. **********The decline in interest rates has helped the position of all the debtor countries. Every 1 percent decline in rates, Mr. Rhodes said, has saved Argentina $450 million in annual debt service, Brazil nearly $800 million and Mexico $750 million. **********But declining oil prices have cut both ways, with Brazil and Argentina gaining and Mexico losing $550 million for every dollar reduction in the price of oil. **********The critical factor in the easing of the third world debt problem has been United States and world economic growth, and it is crucial that it continue. William R. Cline of the Institute of International Economics estimates that, with the industrial countries growing at an annual rate of 3 percent, even possibly as low as 2.5 percent, the world debt crisis can be contained and eventually solved, although it will take at least the rest of this decade to complete the readjustment process. **********The developing countries themselves must grow as a means of reversing the decline in their living standards during the past decade, dealing with their rapid population growth, and reducing their serious unemployment problems, which could wreck the movement toward political democracy in Latin America. **********For the debtor countries to maintain steady growth they will need to step up their rate of capital formation. That will mean both more domestic saving and a stronger inflow of foreign capital, whether from the United States and other Western banks, from private foreign investment or from governments and international bodies. **********The commercial banks are still hoping to reduce their excessive exposure in Latin America and other third world countries, and to cut back their ''involuntary'' lending. Mr. Rhodes urged the World Bank, regional development banks and export credit agencies of the industrial countries to do more for the developing countries, a position that is not popular in the Reagan Administration. **********Meanwhile, dangers remain, such as future swings in the price of oil, commodity prices and interest rates. The most serious threats to the debtor countries, and hence to the international economic system, are the trend toward protectionism and the danger of a shock to growth in the industrial world. The Western nations continue to give lip service to free trade, coordinated policies for growth and the importance of capital flows to the developing countries.

Seldom have things looked so bleak.Last year, drought and grasshoppers wiped out his crop. This year, the grasshoppers are worse - so bad that whole fields of sprouting wheat sound like rain on a tin roof as the growing predators munch their way through. A dozen can do as much damage to a square yard of farmland as a cow, and seemingly hundreds of jumping insects now occupy each one. **********''She's a bad one,'' Mr. Gill said, waiting for the afternoon wind to die down so he can resume the spraying he began at 4:30 A.M. ''A guy has to be just a little funny in the head to stay in this business.'' **********U.S. Export Subsidy Program **********These are times of quiet crisis for Canada's grain farmers. Crops are threatened; prices are down and likely to stay down. The reason is a worldwide oversupply of grain. In addition, the Reagan Administration is readying a $2 billion export subsidy program that can only hurt Canadian growers, just as the European Economic Community's already does. **********''Fundamentally, it's a depressed time in agriculture,'' David Kirk, executive secretary of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, said in an interview. **********The crisis has two time frames. One is the short-term, supply-and-demand situation. World grain production is growing and stocks have been increasing each year. At the end of the last crop year, the United States Department of Agriculture estimated global wheat inventories at 4 billion bushels and now projects a rise to 4.45 billion this year. **********World trends are crucial to Canada, since it exports 74 percent of its grain, compared with 45 percent in the United States. Accordingly, the Canadian Wheat Board - which markets more than 80 percent of Canadian grain - recently announced that it would make an initial payment of $3.18 for a bushel of wheat during the crop year beginning Aug. 1, down from $3.38 in the preceding year and a high of $3.91 in 1981. **********Lower Prices and Sales **********The bottom line is lower prices for less Canadian wheat. Exports are expected to plunge by nearly one-third this year, to 771.6 million bushels, while year-end stocks fall by more than a fifth, to 257.7 million bushels. Historically, year-end stocks have been more than 100 million bushels higher. **********On a longer time frame, what has happened parallels the American experience. Farmers in the late 1970's and early 1980's bought land at exhorbitant prices and borrowed at soaring interest rates. Even if they had not been caught in the current supply-and-demand crunch, they would have been walking a precarious tightrope. **********As happened south of the border, farmers have tried to renegotiate that debt, often succeeding. They also virtually stopped buying new equipment, preferring instead to buy the machinery of a financially distressed neighbor. ''You cannibalize the other man's failure,'' one local grower said, asking not to be identified. **********For a while, protests sparked, but that has largely faded into a generally somber mood. Crowds no longer gather to protest foreclosures. ''The morale among farmers is pretty low,'' said Stuart Thiesson, executive secretary of the National Farmers Union. **********The carnage is evident in the 551 farms that went bankrupt last year, and the more than 500 expected to go under this year. And the total value of the country's farms has dropped $6.4 billion, to $90 billion, since 1982. **********Farmers are less and less of the opinion that the Government can solve their problems. Farmers represent just 4 percent of the Canadian work force now and farm output accounts for just 2.1 percent of the country's gross national product. Even in Saskatchewan, source of 40 percent of Canadian wheat, just a fifth of the work force still farms. 11% Unemployment Rate The predictable result is a reluctance on the part of politicians to give more to agriculture at a time when the nation's unemployment rate sticks stubbornly around 11 percent. Canada's grain growers already get less from the Government than their international competitors do. One Government study showed that subsidies account for 4.5 percent of the price of wheat in Canada, compared with 10.5 percent in the United States and 15.3 percent in Europe. **********Moreover, the new Progressive Conservative Party Government of Brian Mulroney has indicated an apparent willingness to sacrifice farmers' demands to the larger goal of cutting the Federal deficit. In last month's budget, the Agriculture Department's budget was cut nearly $40 million; farmers are to be charged for a variety of services formerly performed by Government agencies, and such farm requests as interest rate assistance were denied. **********The only specific agriculture benefit given to farmers for the first time was a special break in capital gains taxes, if they choose to sell farmland. **********Canadian farmers are also hurt by growing protectionism in the United States. For grain growers, the threat is a still-undefined American strategy to promote grain exports through subsidies on specific sales. The result of a compromise between farm state legislators and the White House, which wanted to cut farm subsidies sharply, the new program seeks to use Washington's large grain inventories to sweeten export deals. **********Although the final American farm bill has yet to be passed, the size of the export subsidy program is generally estimated at $2 billion. **********''We simply cannot afford to play the kind of subsidy game the United States and the European Community have entered into,'' Charles Mayer, the minister in charge of the Wheat Board, said.

[Page D25.]  'Like Another Tax Cut' **********If oil prices decline, ''there are winners and losers,'' said John Brodman, director of the Department of Energy's Office of International Energy Analysis. ''But over all, it's positive,'' he added. ''It's like another tax cut.'' **********Over the weekend OPEC ministers, meeting in Geneva, agreed to a change in the group's marketing strategy, which will now concentrate on retaining market share rather than defending the $28-a-barrel benchmark price for oil. Market analysts said the decision could cause an oil price war that could have a beneficial effect on most businesses. **********Yesterday's New York Stock Exchange volume rose to 144 million shares, an improvement over Friday's already hefty 125.5 million. **********The performance of the overall market was slightly less impressive than the blue chips. The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.63 point yesterday, to 117.62, just short of the record set on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.26 points, to 204.25, barely topping the record of 204.23, also set on Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by 1,029 to 659. **********The previous best closing level for the Dow industrials also occurred on Wednesday, when they finished at 1,484.40. **********Big Gainers in the Dow **********The Dow was aided yesterday by a strong performance in Union Carbide, which rose 3 3/8, to 66 3/8, on the day's heaviest volume of about 2.8 million shares. The stock was reacting to an offer announced by the GAF Corporation, which is seeking control of Carbide. GAF's stock, meanwhile, scored the best price gain of the session, rising 10, to 57 5/8. Traders were guessing that Carbide might turn around and make a bid for GAF. **********International Harvester was another component of the Dow that rose sharply, gaining 1, to 8 3/8. It was the fourth-busiest stock of the session, with volume exceeding 2.3 million shares. An analyst from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. mentioned the stock favorably. **********International Business Machines, also in the Dow 30, rose 2 7/8, to 144 5/8, an all-time high. **********Anheuser-Busch was also active, gaining 2 3/8, to 40 7/8. Over the last few months the brewer has been mentioned as a potential takeover target. **********Oil Issues Drop **********Oil issues fell on the OPEC news. Texaco dropped 3/4, to 30 3/4; Occidental was off 1 7/8, to 32 1/4, trading ex-dividend, and Exxon was down 1 1/8, to 52 1/8, all in active trading. Less active were Chevron, down 2, to 36; Amerada Hess, down 5/8, to 27 1/8, and Amoco, off 2 1/2, to 63 3/8. **********For other shares, ''the oil news was a little icing on the cake,'' said Donald Kimsey, market analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Also feeding the market, however, were positive signs on tax revision and on a reduction in Federal spending, Mr. Kimsey said. **********Analysts said airlines are the most obvious beneficiaries of lower energy costs. But they said the impact would be much broader, with any energy-intensive industry feeling the gains. **********Most airline stocks rose sharply yesterday. UAL gained 2, to 51 1/4, for instance, while AMR rose 1 5/8, to 42 3/8. But T.W.A. gained only 1/8, to 19, after sources said the investor Carl C. Icahn was considering a change in his buyout offer for the company to include less cash. **********Midcon rose 2 1/2, to 54, while United Energy Resources rose 2 1/4, to 47 5/8. Shareholders of both companies will vote on a merger proposal this week. But Wall Street sources said the stocks were rising because Wagner & Brown, a privately held concern in Midland, Tex., has been accumulating Midcon and United Energy shares over the last few weeks. **********Further Advances Seen **********Even though the stock market is up sharply since the start of September, some analysts see the rally moving ahead unimpeded. **********Elaine Garzarelli, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, thinks the Dow could easily move into the 1,600 to 1,700 range. She said that if a reduction in oil prices led to lower interest rates, even that prediction could be conservative. **********Several other factors could also aid the stock market in the weeks ahead, according to analysts. The expiration later this month of stock index options and futures could cause the purchase of more equities, as could the expected rise in new Individual Retirement Accounts that generally occur in the first months of a new year. **********Takeover activity could also be given a boost in the near term by the Federal Reserve Board's plans to tighten regulations regarding the use of ''junk'' bonds in corporate buyouts. **********The American Stock Exchange index, which is heavily weighted with oil issues, fell 0.79, to 242.09. **********But in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq index rose 0.29, to 316.88.

Here, the countryside is still green. **********Up to 1.5 Million to Be Moved **********Since November, nearly 200,000 people have been moved hundreds of miles by plane, truck and bus from the northern region, which is the most seriously affected by drought, famine and civil conflict, to areas in the west and south of the country. Within a year the Government plans to move as many as 1.5 million refugees in what will be one of the largest and most ambitious resettlement projects ever attempted. **********To date, no Western government has been willing to endorse the plan. In an attempt by the Ethiopian authorities to gain support, about 70 diplomats and relief officials and several Western journalists were permitted to visit a handful of resettlement sites in the regions of Kaffa, Ilubabor and Wallaga. **********Talks with most of the foreign diplomats and relief officials who made the trip indicated that while some fears have been quelled, others have been heightened. **********Some Aid Said to Be Likely **********At the same time, some of them said, it now seems likely that many of the donor nations and aid organizations working here will give at least limited assistance to the program. **********In the view of Ethiopia's authorities, transmigration is the only logical response to what everyone agrees is a tragic situation. More than 300,000 people have died because of the famine in Ethiopia, according to the most conservative estimates. Nearly 8 million Ethiopian peasants are now said to be facing the same prospect. **********The answer, Ethiopian officials assert, is to move as many people as possible as quickly as possible to land where they can farm again. **********Initially, Western diplomats and relief officials were concerned that refugees were being forced to sign up for resettlement and that families were being separated. In addition, there have been persistent reports from the Sudan that hundreds of Ethiopian famine victims have arrived in that country, having fled from resettlement camps in and around Asosa. **********Among the select group of refugees interviewed on the Government-organized tours, however, no one expressed a desire to return to the north and those separated from members of their families said they had been assured relatives would join them soon. **********''Nothing is better in the north than here,'' said Babo Ararassa, a 42-year- old farmer who came here two months ago. ''Back home we knew always hunger, fighting and shame. As long as you can eat, wear clothes and live, what does it matter where you are?'' **********But the visit, many of the diplomats and relief workers said, did little to dispel concern that Ethiopia's authorities have an ulterior motive for promoting resettlement: to depopulate areas of the north - Tigre, Eritrea and northern Wallo in particular - where for years rebel groups have battled the Government and controlled large areas of the countryside. **********A Spur to Collectivization? **********Some also said they fear that Ethiopia's Marxist-Leninist rulers are using the resettlement program to recruit labor for the Soviet-style collective and state farms that are favored for reasons of ideology. **********''I think we want to be very, very sure,'' said one Western diplomat, ''that we are not financing the eventual enslavement of these people.'' **********Ethiopian authorities have responded by saying that none of the migrants are to be collectivized, at least not at this stage. Instead, they say, each family will be allocated about five acres of land as well as a home garden plot of about one-quarter acre. The peasants will not own the land they work, however, leaving the door open for collectivization at a later date. **********''How quickly that evolution will take place,'' said Dawit Wolde Giorgis, head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, ''will depend on the people themselves.'' **********Some diplomats and relief workers said that in the Ethiopia of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, popular consensus is generally determined through a subjective appraisal by the country's ruling elite. Just a few months ago, they said, the Government justified spending tens of millions of dollars for celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the revolution - while thousands were already dying of starvation - by saying that it was the people's will to mark a decade of progress since the revolution of 1974 in such a manner. **********One senior Western diplomat said: ''Certainly in a year or so we're likely to be informed that the people have unanimously expressed their desire to be collectivized. But we're not going to prevent that by refusing to dirty our hands with resettlement. On the contrary, the more we're involved the more influence we're likely to have.'' **********But the largest number of diplomats and aid officials now appear to believe that the Government's motives should not be the main concern. Instead, they said, a large resettlement program will have to be part of any overall rehabilitation plan for the coming years, given the relatively high concentration of people and the lessened ability of the land to support them in the environmentally degraded northern highlands. **********But they said they objected to the speed with which the Government is carrying out the program. By moving too many people too fast, without adequate preparation or sufficient resources and infrastructure in place, the critics said, the Government is not only endangering the success of the resettlement effort but also jeopardizing the continuing emergency relief program. **********Humanitarian considerations, they said, do not permit sacrificing the more than six million people who will be left behind in the north for the sake of the million and a half to be soon transplanted to the south. **********''We are still a long way from having the situation under control in the famine areas,'' said a senior relief official. ''By dividing the population at risk you only spread the famine, double the logistical problems and increase costs. For example, there are only so many trucks in this country. Divert them to carry settlers and you reduce your capacity to transport food to those who need it.'' **********The Ethiopian authorities assert that those who are moved south will be producing their own food within a year. Most Western experts dispute that, saying that food aid will have to be supplied to the resettled population for a minimum of five to seven years. **********'The Ground Is Too Hard' **********At resettlement sites visited on the recent trips, the peasants had not yet begun plowing or planting. Some complained that they would need bulldozers to clear rocks and trees and tractors to turn the hard virgin soil. **********''At least before the first season,'' said Babo Ararassa. ''Later we can do it on our own but now the ground is too hard. There are roots and stones; it will take too long.'' **********At most sites, wells for drinking water have yet to be dug - rivers are being used in the meantime - and medical facilities are not close at hand. **********Several diplomats noted that in each resettlement site on the Government- sponsored trip, from Metu in Ilubabor to Kishe, it was an official of the Workers Party of Ethiopia, a Communist party established last September, who gave the briefings. **********'Where Are the Agronomists?' **********''Where are the agronomists and foresters?'' asked one embassy official on the tour. ''Where are the agricultural extension officers, the water engineers, the public health officials and the ecologists to explain to us how they're going to prevent the kind of environmental catastrophe that took place in the north from occurring here? **********''It looks like it's the party bureaucrats and not the technocrats who are running this show and I'm not at all convinced they know what they're doing,'' the embassy official said. **********Other Western diplomats and officials counter that whatever reservations they may have and whatever shortcomings have come to light, resettlement is a policy that Ethiopia's officials have embarked upon - and they are unlikely to be turned back now. **********''In the final analysis, there's going to be a need here,'' said a high-ranking international civil servant. **********''And the moral position, I think, is to help fill that need,'' the civil servant continued, ''to save lives if we can. The moral position is not to punish the people for the sins of their rulers.'' **********Another experienced aid worker saw the situation differently, saying that ''right now this Government's priorities are wiping out the rebels, moving population south and maintaining a relief effort - in that order. **********''The attitude that we can't do anything about it so we had better accept it tends to be rather habit-forming,'' the aid worker said. ''Personally, I would rather stand up and get punched than lie down and be walked on.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/06/business/key-rates-170220.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/04/world/2-at-synod-defend-liberation-ideas.html": {"writer_name": "E.

''Nor does it apply European political ideology to Latin America. Nor does it break with Catholic theological tradition.'' **********Bishop Lorscheiter said that liberation theology ''presupposes a new consciousness of the context of oppression'' and also ''a conversion toward the poor and a commitment to their liberation.'' **********''Liberation theology is indispensable to the church's activity and to the social commitment of Christians, even if it carries with it risks,'' he concluded. **********His comments were striking because they appeared to be an almost point-by-point rebuttal of views expressed by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Cardinal Ratzinger's critique of liberation theology, issued last year, argued that it relied too heavily on Marxist ideas and encouraged class struggle. **********The proposals for a final document on Catholicism's future came amid indications of a struggle among contending forces at the Synod - called by Pope John Paul II to review the effects of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) - over how the bishops would express their conclusions. **********Synod Ends at Weekend **********A key debate appears to be shaping up over whether the bishops should issue only one general statement, or also a second, more specific comment, before concluding their work this weekend. **********Synod and Vatican officials said the second, detailed statement is being sought by bishops who want the Synod record to reflect the sense of a meeting in which issues have been freely and at times sharply debated. They want to insure that the meeting's generally positive assessment of Vatican II, the desire of many bishops for greater autonomy from Rome and the sheer diversity of viewpoints that have been expressed is reflected in a final document. **********Supporters of a more traditionalist line, according to some officials, may seek to avoid such a detailed comment, possibly by making some concessions to liberals in the general message that will be addressed to ''the Catholic people'' of the world. **********The debate on liberation theology, which emphasizes the church's obligation to support the social and political struggles of the poor, has emerged over the last several days in statements issued by Latin American church leaders. **********Although the Rev. Diarmuid Martin, a Vatican spokesman, denied today that there had been ''a rift, a split'' within the Synod over liberation theology, it has clearly been a contentious issue. **********Last Saturday, Bishop Dario Catrillon Hoyos of Colombia attacked liberation theology, suggesting that it envisioned ''a church with a machine gun.'' In addition, a group of conservative Latin American cardinals have signed a document supporting the Vatican's criticisms of the theology. **********An Attitude of Humility **********Support for the theology came from Aloisio Cardinal Lorscheider, Archbishop of Fortaleza, Brazil. He offered a vision of a church that would draw its inspiration from the poor and develop an attitude ''of listening, of humility.'' **********Today, the various small groups from the Synod, essentially subcommittees organized around languages that have met over the last few days, issued their suggestions to the Synod as a whole. **********They were striking both for their diversity and for the general support they gave to the church's ecumenical initiatives toward non-Catholics, the importance of local Bishops' Conferences and the desirability of seeking to root the church in diverse local cultures. **********The tone of the statements varied sharply. An English-language group headed by Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, the president of the American Bishops' Conference, touched on a variety of themes generally sounded by progressives, including the importance of ''Catholic women using their gifts in the service of the church.'' **********On the other hand, a German language group, headed by Augustin Cardinal Mayer, a top Curial official, spoke of ''confusion among the faithful'' and a ''decline in transcendence.''

The soldiers told the seven legislators that the area had been declared ''a closed military zone'' and that their parliamentary immunity did not apply there, an Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman said. **********The seven left peacefully but vowed to appeal the legality of the evacuation order to the supreme court. The order was signed by Brig. Gen.

They were joined late Monday by four other right-wing politicians, Dov Shilansky, Yuval Ne'eman, Haim Druckman and Benny Shalita. **********Victory for Peres **********Their eviction today was seen by political commentators here as a decisive victory for Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Mr. Rabin, who vigorously opposed the attempt by the Parliament members to expand Jewish settlement in Hebron. **********Hebron, 20 miles south of Jerusalem, is a densely populated Arab town, holy both to Jews and Moslems because the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, revered by both faiths, are buried there. **********The Hebron sit-in was viewed by political commentators as a test of Mr. Rabin's and Mr. Peres's resolve to halt the illegal expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank. The seven Parliament members were supported by the Likud half of Israel's coalition Government. The Likud Cabinet ministers Ariel Sharon and Moshe Arens both visited the apartment to demonstrate solidarity with the squatters. **********The eviction was a marked change from the usual sequence of events in the West Bank, where militant Jewish settlers have been able to illegally occupy buildings or land and then press the Government to give them approval to remain. **********In the face of the firm handling of the Hebron affair by Mr. Rabin, a Labor Party member, the Likud ministers appeared to refrain from any attempts to press the issue to the point of splitting the coalition. Mr. Shamir demanded at a Cabinet session Sunday that the Government approve the right of Jews to move into the Hebron apartment, but Mr. Peres blocked the motion. **********Vows to Continue Fight **********An angry Mrs. Cohen vowed not to give up the fight for the right of Jews to settle anywhere they wanted in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. **********''This is a very sad day for the State of Israel and a very shameful day for its leaders who decided on this evacuation,'' she told reporters.

The new system will need even fewer people, perhaps only 150, because the short-range stations will be automatic. **********The Eskimos have worried that the fragile Arctic environment might be polluted by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, left at dismantled DEW line stations. The toxic chemical is used as a coolant. **********Traces of PCB's have been found in the tissues of polar bears, seals and fish, though the source is unclear. The Canadian Government has started a $370,000 cleanup of PCB from 24 abandoned DEW line sites. **********After the new warning system was announced, the Baffin Islanders were upset by a report that small nuclear reactors would run the short-range radar stations. They said they feared a radioactive leak would contaminate the wildlife they rely on for food. **********Government spokesmen went on the radio to assure everyone that conventional diesel generators would be used. Even so, said Jim Bell, who works for Baffin Island's weekly newspaper, The Nunatsiaq News, ''People are worried about how the small warning stations will be powered.'' **********Such incidents underscore the extent to which a remote region like Baffin Island, which is as far north of Montreal as Florida is south, has become vulnerable to modern realities. **********Frobisher Bay, less than 200 miles below the Arctic Circle, was named for Sir Martin Frobisher, an English swashbuckler who arrived in 1576 under the misapprehension that he had found the Northwest Passage to Asia. **********The town itself, which now has about 2,500 inhabitants, sprang up when the United States built an airfield to refuel planes ferrying supplies to Europe during World War II. **********''Frobisher Bay wouldn't be here if the Americans didn't need it,'' said John Rizzotto, the town manager. The Americans pulled out in the early 1960's, but a couple of junkyards are still called the ''American dumps.'' **********Frobisher Bay's hasty wartime origins are still obvious. Weatherbeaten buildings are scattered along the shore. The Government often changed its style of row housing, but old-timers can look at a building and tell its vintage. Only a small Anglican cathedral, built of wood to resemble an igloo, graces the scene. **********Not a Place for Trees **********Government offices are ensconced in a fortress-like concrete high-rise on the top of the hill, prompting local quips about climbing cap in hand to seek Government largesse. **********Frobisher Bay lies too far north to support a tree. Mayor Bryan Pearson imported some grass seed and sheep manure from Montreal a few years ago. But his attempted greening of Frobisher Bay touched off one of the town's memorable controversies, because the seed and manure cost over $500. **********The town's beauty in the short summer lies in bright purple wildflowers that carpet the tundra and the mellow sunsets that flare into sunrises. **********To enhance the region's Eskimo character, the town council voted last year to change the name of Frobisher Bay to Iqualuit, an Eskimo word that means ''fish.'' The Federal Government is still studying the idea. **********The most talked-about topic on Baffin Island is the cost of living here, which runs at least 40 percent higher than in southern Canada. Most supplies, down to white fiberglass panels for the prefabricated schools, arrive aboard four or five ships, which ride in on the 30-foot tide in the summer and are unloaded when the low tide beaches them. Perishable goods must be flown in, and a head of lettuce in midwinter can cost more than $3. **********Spare parts get expensive or scarce, so the Eskimos, who make up the great majority of Baffin Island's population, lavish ingenuity on their snowmobiles, which have replaced dogsleds. **********''Stories circulate about the jury rigging of Ski-doos with caribou bones and sinews,'' said Ron Mongeau, who estimated that a tenth of the snowmobiles in Frobisher Bay were kept running with such improvised parts. **********Yet Eskimos have had trouble getting licensed as mechanics, because they could not pass a written English test drawn up in southern Canada. **********Mr. Mongeau, who is the executive officer of the Baffin Regional Council, said his organization finally pushed through its own licensing criteria so that self-taught mechanics are now tested and recognized where it matters in the Arctic - on the job. **********The improvisational nature of life on Baffin Island extends to the television shows pulled in by Frobisher Bay's satellite dish, which taps channels from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland. **********But the most popular show on Baffin Island, according to Aimo Aimo Nookiguaq, the manager of the Inuit Broadcasting Company, is a locally produced current-affairs program called ''Qagik.'' The word in Inuktitut means the entrance to an igloo. **********When television carried the pictures of Ethiopians starving on the other side of the world, the response from the Eskimos was startling. **********Frobisher Bay organized auctions of everything from homemade cakes to painstaking soapstone carvings donated by Eskimo artisans. It collected more than $31,000, a lot of money for a small town with many families on welfare. **********In the hamlet of Pangnirtung, which raised more than $4,500, Meeka Kilabuk knew friends who wanted to catch a seal and send it as food to Africa or who offered their sealskin boots to keep Ethiopian children warm. **********The 1,000 residents of Eskimo Point, west of Baffin Island, went even further. The territorial government had to restrain them from giving the municipal budget surplus of $36,000 to Ethiopian famine relief. **********The generosity, as several Baffin Islanders explained it, was rooted in the famine that many residents remembered from the 1950's, after the caribou changed their migration routes. **********''They understood it,'' Mr. Nookiguaq said. ''They understood the starvation and hunger.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/07/business/wausau-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wausau Plan", "print_headline": "Wausau Plan", "body_text": " **********The Wausau Insurance Companies said it had signed a plan of affiliation with the Nationwide Insurance Company.

Weinberger said today that the Reagan Administration had abandoned past American military strategies as ''obsolete'' and devised ''a new defense strategy for the 1990's.'' **********Mr. Weinberger, in a speech to the National Press Club, said the Administration's new ''conceptual arsenal'' rested on three ''pillars'' - the effort to invent defenses against nuclear missiles, a formidable buildup of conventional forces, and an arms control policy that depends on giving the Soviet Union incentives to bargain. **********Sounding what has been a recurring theme in the Administration, Mr. Weinberger said these changes in military policy were forced upon the United States by a huge Soviet arms buildup that previous administrations had ignored. **********He also warned Congress, where many lawmakers are questioning whether Mr. Weinberger's budgets bought much additional military strength, that Pentagon spending cuts cannot be made ''without increasing the risks of Soviet aggression and war.'' **********In response to questions, Mr. Weinberger called the latest Soviet arms control offer ''quite unsatisfactory'' and minimized the prospects for an arms agreement at the summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, scheduled for Nov. 19-20 in Geneva. **********The main value of the summit meeting, he said, would be the chance for the Soviet Union ''to see at first hand the kind of man the President is, the resolve that he has, the determination he has that America will retain its military strength.'' **********Pentagon officials, including Mr. Weinberger, had said the speech today would be a resounding defense of the Administration's strategic agenda, and also a rebuttal to critics who say the Pentagon is spending without a rationale. **********Mr. Weinberger's 45-minute address was primarily a reiteration of past Weinberger policy declarations that even some of his own aides said was dry and familiar. **********Mr. Weinberger said previous Administrations had devised their military policies, resting on the nuclear doctrine known as ''mutual assured destruction'' and on arms control, in an era when the United States had a clear military advantage. **********The purpose of the Reagan Administration buildup, he said, is not to regain military superiority but to reduce the risks of war by convincing the Soviet Union that it could not successfully exploit opportunities for aggression. **********''Our defense program, expansive as it has to be, makes no pretense of regaining our earlier position of superiority,'' he said. ''We now struggle simply to win from Congress the resources that will assure that we can deter the Soviet Union from aggression against our vital interests.'' **********Mr. Weinberger, describing what he called the new strategy, said the first ''pillar'' of the plan was scrapping the notion of mutual assured destruction, which holds that both the United States and the Soviet Union will refrain from a nuclear attack because of the certainty of mass retaliation. **********The growth of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, he said, has weakened the strength of this deterrent. **********''If the Soviet Union sees that in response to a limited nuclear attack by them, we have no response other than to trigger a sequence of events that might mean mutual suicide,'' he said, Soviet leaders may ''come to the conclusion that maybe we won't retaliate at all.'' **********Mr. Weinberger repeated his recent assertions that the Soviet Union has given up the notion of mutual destruction by starting a research program to seek a defense against missiles. **********The second ''pillar'' described by Mr. Weinberger is a continued buildup in conventional weapons.

From all quarters - labor, management and the universities - there is great dissatisfaction. Some firebrands have even called for the abolition of the board and the body of labor law that it enforces. **********There is no doubt that the board should improve its procedures to conform with a changed labor market and to afford the protection that Congress originally intended. Yet, the important insight of the Wagner Act of the 1930's - under which the board was established - remains: Competition in labor markets is imperfect and workers consequently should have available to them the option of union representation. **********Repeal of the labor laws would, for all practical purposes, eliminate that option. Strong unions capable of mounting an effective strike threat have never needed the N.L.R.B.; for other workers, however, the legal protection of the board is critical. **********Labor laws and the board have always been anathema to conservatives and spokesmen for business interests. In recent years, however, academics (once die-hard allies of the union movement) have begun to side with management, arguing that unions are simply a kind of cartel, artificially raising the cost of unionized labor and depressing wages in the nonunionized sector. **********Surprisingly, some union leaders have also urged abolition of the board and the laws it administers. Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., recently urged a return to the ''law of the jungle,'' in which unions would forgo the protection of the N.L.R.B., which now holds elections, reinstates workers fired for union activities and makes sure that management is bargaining in good faith. Presumably, the unions would then be freed of the law's restrictions on secondary boycotts, and thus could come to each other's aid. **********Labor's disenchantment has more to do with broad economic and social changes than with the board's administration of the law. Increasingly, unions have found that, in fields where they have previously been successful, they are now facing intransigent managements insisting on wage cuts and looser work rules. This has come about largely because many unionized companies can no longer insulate themselves from lower-wage competitors, as a result of deregulation, foreign competition and the persistent growth of the nonunion sector. **********At the same time, the American work force is changing - a shift away from ''smokestack'' industries and the old, unionized Northeast to the knowledge and service industries and the largely nonunionized Sun Belt. Many of the workers in these growth sectors are unreceptive to unions, usually because of ideology, social pressures or a perception that they are not union material. DESPITE the historical forces running against unions, it would be short-sighted to conclude that unionism and the protections of the N.L.R.B. are obsolete. For many workers, unions are still the sole means of insuring a fair shake. Even for nonunionized workers, the threat of unionization encourages management to maintain high labor standards. **********To preserve the union option for these workers, however, policy-makers must address serious shortcoming in the administration of our basic labor laws. Under current arrangements, it is too easy for an intransigent management, even after losing an N.L.R.B.-supervised election, to continue the fight through various agency levels and the courts. A litigated contest can last up to three years. By then, much of the union's support among the workers has been dissipated, and the board's remedy -an order to bargain in good faith -can do very little to restore the union's institutional momentum. **********The rules governing elections should be simplified to remove some of the sources of litigation. The current board has properly ruled that it will not set aside elections because of misrepresentations during elections. The board also should establish clear, simple guidelines for establishing bargaining units and protecting employees from employer harassment. **********More fundamental, the board's remedial authority has to be enhanced, so that its orders will have some bite and will deter flagrant violators. Greater resort to injunctive relief in the courts should be encouraged. **********Greater certainty is needed in the administration of the labor laws. The current board, not unlike its Democratic predecessors, has been bent on overturning previously established policies. This, too, fuels litigation and also breeds disrespect for the agency. **********Finally, the board has to adjust its rules to take account of changes in the American work force. The agency should show a greater receptivity than it has to in-house representation arrangements that permit a measure of self-representation to workers who do not want to join a union. **********This list is far from inclusive. For just one example, labor must accept the principle of basing wage gains more on productivity advances than on insulation from foreign competition. As for the N.L.R.B., it must be encouraged to take more seriously its responsibility for preserving the option of collective representation in a changing world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/business/a-miscellany-of-holiday-business-customs-around-the-world-245510.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1985-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 356, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A MISCELLANY OF HOLIDAY BUSINESS CUSTOMS AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "A MISCELLANY OF HOLIDAY BUSINESS CUSTOMS AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********With Christmas and New Year's falling on a Wednesday this year, most American office and factory workers will not have as much time off as usual for their traditional celebrations.

Customers will need to keep a combined average balance of $1,000 in checking and savings accounts to avoid checking charges, instead of the $2,000 balance required now. **********But the bank also announced that some fees would increase. For example, the charge for certified and cashier's checks will rise to $6, from $5, and money orders will cost $2 instead of $1.50. On certain other accounts, fee increases will accompany higher interest rates or lower minimum balances. **********Because of widely varying restrictions and fee structures, it is difficult to compare one bank's fees with another's. But most of Citibank's competitors said the bank was only matching or slightly exceeding the packages they offer. **********Free Checking at Chase **********Chase Manhattan Bank has been offering a $1,000 minimum requirement for free checking since January, according to Ken Mills, a Chase spokesman. Manufacturers Hanover gives free checking for consolidated balances over $1,500, said Patricia Simpson, a vice president for retail banking there. **********The Jan. 1 changes at Citibank will coincide with the date for the removal of most of the last Federal restrictions on the rates banks can pay on their checking and savings accounts. **********Jeff Neubert, general manager of Citibank's New York banking division, said that the changes announced yesterday would have ''a very modest impact'' on fee revenue. ''I hope it's a positive impact, but until customers take action we won't know, and it's very difficult to assess customer behavior in light of these changes,'' he added. **********''Our posture on this is that we're trying to simplify our pricing structure for the customer and trying to thank the customers who do more of their business with us,'' Mr. Neubert said. He also noted that the bank recently introduced a basic-checking account designed to appeal to low-balance customers. **********Mr. Neubert said the change in the minimum balance requirements would mean that about 10 percent more of the bank's customers would qualify for free checking with their current balances. **********Several major New York banks said they would not change their fee structures in response to the Citibank action. But some added that they were reviewing fees as the deregulation continued. **********''We're not going to respond to anything Citibank does, but we're looking at our whole pricing structure given that we're in the final stages of deregulation,'' said Ken Herz, a spokesman for Chemical Bank. **********Among the other changes announced by Citibank yesterday: **********Customers whose average consolidated balance falls below $1,000 in a given month will pay a $6 fee on their checking account, plus 25 cents per check or automated teller machine withdrawal. Currently, customers with balances below $1,000 pay a fee ranging from $3.50 to $6 a month, plus the per-transaction fee of 25 cents, depending on their balance. **********There will be changes in the interest-bearing checking accounts called NOW and NOW II, or Super NOW.

''They might survive as a political party, but it's not a theology anymore. They've lost the golden touch.'' **********As the frigid winds from the ice- clogged St. Lawrence River sweep up through this historic city, the political conversation dwells upon whether the Parti Quebecois is an idea whose time has come and gone. **********''What's happening is a groping for the center, which is not necessarily promising for stability,'' said Claude Ryan, the senior legislator of the opposition Labor Party in Quebec's National Assembly. **********Election Could Come Soon **********The public-opinion polls have lately suggested that the Parti Quebecois, which was voted into power in 1976, may lose to the Liberals in the next election. **********The mandate of the Parti Quebecois to govern does not run out until April 1986, but the Liberals are expected to start submitting no-confidence motions in the current Government when the legislature reconvenes next month. **********Party stalwarts like Bernard Landry, Quebec's Minister for International Affairs and External Trade, are not exclusively pessimistic.

It's only a matter of time before Bill 101 is unnecessary and is dropped like a ripe fruit.'' **********Levesque Stays Aloof **********Mr. Levesque has stayed aloof from such issues since he returned from the south where he was recovering from what his doctors diagnosed as exhaustion. **********But political commentators say he has yet to regain his old form. The Quebec press jumped on him for his performance at a dinner this month honoring International Youth Year. Mr. Levesque made what many considered tasteless quips about two staff members, and he called Silvie Bernier, Quebec's Olympic gold-medal winner in diving, a ''brat'' for having once pulled a cigarette from his mouth.  There has been speculation that Mr. Levesque is weary of politics. But he recently told reporters that he would stay on and confront the question of his leadership at a party caucus on Feb.  19-20. **********Recent opinion polls have shown that Mr. Levesque would not win the next election against Robert Bourassa, the Liberal Party leader in Quebec, but that Pierre-Marc Johnson, his 38-year- old Justice Minister, could.  Mr. Johnson, who has remained publicly loyal to Mr. Levesque, says he feels the Parti Quebecois must outgrow its image of single-issue separatism. **********In 1980 voters rejected by a 60-40 margin a request by the Parti Quebecois for a mandate to negotiate some sovereignty with the federal Government. Most recent opinion polls have shown that barely a fifth of Quebecers want such sovereignty association. **********Still, Quebec's notion that it is somehow special persists.

Ignatius Kung, was released from prison on parole today after spending nearly 30 years in jail, the New China News Agency announced. **********Bishop Kung, whose Chinese name is Gong Pinmei, is the best-known of the hundreds of Chinese clerics who were persecuted by the Communists in the 1950's for their refusal to bow to a movement that severed ties between the Roman Catholic Church in China and the Vatican. **********The movement, in effect, placed the church under Communist control. Despite the recent liberalizing of many aspects of Chinese life, that control is still in effect. **********Life Term for Treason **********The press agency said the Shanghai Higher People's Court made the decision to release the Bishop at a session today. It said that in setting aside the life term imposed on him in 1960 for treason, the court found that he had ''admitted his crime and showed repentance during the time he was serving his sentence.'' **********The agency added that the bishop ''said at the court that he would abide by the law and pledged allegiance to the country.'' **********The wording seemed to have been carefully chosen to imply that to gain his freedom Bishop Kung had foresworn the authority of the Pope and recognized the legitimacy of the ''self-governing'' Chinese Church, something he had repeatedly refused to do. But the ambiguous wording and the absence from the agency's account of any direct statement to that effect by the Bishop suggested that the authorities, not the Bishop, might have relented. **********Diplomats Assess Release **********The Bishop's continuing imprisonment has been a standing reminder of the realities of religion in China at a time when the Government here has fostered the notion that all faiths have been released from Communist Party control. Western diplomats said the leaders in Peking might have decided that keeping the Bishop in jail was too damaging to their credibility. **********Although the official rejection of the Pope's authority over Catholics in China has not changed, recent years have seen a new recognition by senior Chinese officials of the diplomatic power of the Vatican and of the affront that Chinese attitudes have given to Catholics in other countries. There have been a number of indirect moves toward improving matters, including the invitation earlier this year to Mother Teresa, the nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in the Calcutta slums. **********Mother Teresa met with high-ranking Vatican officials before coming to China, and while here spent time with Deng Pufang, head of the Chinese Handicapped Association, who is the handicapped son of Deng Xiaoping, China's pre-eminent leader. **********Under the revival of the ''indigenous'' Catholic Church in recent years, several hundred churches that had been closed have been reopened, some of them by priests who spent long terms in jail. But all are under tight control by the Catholic Patriotic Association, the organization created by the party in 1957 to supplant the Vatican as the church's controlling body. **********The Patriotic Association declared some years ago that the position of Bishop of Shanghai was vacant, and it appointed its own man to the post. **********No Reversal of Verdict **********Although Mr. Deng has acted to clear the names of party figures who were purged under Mao Zedong, it was evident from the wording of the news article on Bishop Kung that there is to be no reversal of verdict for him. The report carefully restated the reasons for his imprisonment, saying ''he was sentenced by the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court as a traitor who used religion as a cloak.'' **********According to records compiled by Amnesty International and other organizations monitoring human rights in China, as many as 10 other priests are still in jail here, including some who were released and rearrested after Mr. Deng took power in 1978. Several of those imprisoned in the 1950's, including at least one bishop, died in prison or labor camp. **********Mr. Deng's attitude toward religion is a matter of debate. While some diplomats have suggested he might be edging toward an accommodation with the Vatican, others consider it highly improbable that he would tolerate any alternative focus of loyalty to the party. **********Although he has instituted sweeping relaxation in many spheres, he has been quick to crack down on any challenge to the party's power. **********Bishop Seized in 1955 **********It is estimated that two million Catholics live in China, and thousands of them have long regarded the Bishop as a martyr. Appointed Bishop of the Shanghai diocese in 1950, he remained staunchly loyal to the Vatican at a time when many Chinese priests were being arrested - and some executed - for doing the same. In September 1955, he was seized during a nationwide campaign against ''counter-revolutionaries.'' Five years later, without being released, he was tried along with 13 other priests, who received terms ranging from 5 to 20 years. **********Another cleric who suffered a similar fate, Bishop Dominic Tang of Canton, fell sick and was released in 1980 after serving 22 years in prison.

Some people have suggested that the Government may have reached the limits of its drive toward market socialism. **********That view is premature, in my estimation. The personnel changes announced last week show that the pro-reform leadership is firmly in charge, and that predictions of an early end to reform were incorrect. The current retrenchment is a temporary adjustment, not a return to the old system. The Government almost certainly will renew its push toward market socialism after dealing with the excesses of the last few years and quieting public concern. **********The anxieties began earlier this year when the Government began to modify the policy of decentralization, reasserting control over local investments and imports. While 14 coastal cities were opened to overseas investment in 1984, only four (Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, and Guangzhou) still retain the autonomy to sign contracts for overseas investments without central approval. Higher import duties and new import restrictions have been slapped onto such items as motor vehicles and minicomputers. Other central regulations make it harder for local banks to grant loans for factory construction and for managers to give bonuses to employees. **********Just as worrisome has been the large-scale corruption by city and province officials. Numerous well-publicized examples of official corruption have begun to erode public support for reform. **********The policy shifts are a response to two sets of problems that were a natural outgrowth of Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang's gradual approach to transforming the centrally planned economy into market socialism. Gradual reform means partial reform during the transition. And partial reform creates perverse incentives and economic distortions. **********The danger of partial reform lies in the absence of the essential ingredient of risk. There is no serious economic pressure on enterprise managers to constrain spending. The Government continues to subsidize enterprises operating in the red rather than shutting them down. Banks give away loans with little expectation of collecting interest, let alone collateral, because neither bankers nor lenders suffer if the loans are not repaid. As the Chinese newspapers put it, enterprises continue to ''eat from the big pot of the state.'' **********The end result of partial reform has been an overheated economy and inflation. Partial reform has allowed managers and local officials to retain their after-tax profits and use them for investment or wage bonuses. The combination of profit incentives and greater autonomy has sparked local expansion drives. During the first half of 1985, industrial output increased 23.1 percent over the previous year, which strained supplies of raw materials, energy and transport. **********Officials and managers also embarked on an import-buying spree, depleting foreign exchange reserves and chalking up a record 60.8 percent increase in imports during the first half of the year. Managers indiscriminately granted large bonuses and wage increases to employees. These raises fueled inflation by creating a huge demand for consumer goods, which are still scarce. Now, even Chinese reformers agree that the economy must be cooled down with temporary central controls over local spending. THE second threat to the reform drive is corruption, which is the direct result of the failure to carry out price reform. In a centrally planned economy, prices set by administrative fiat bear no relation to supply and demand and are seldom adjusted. Indeed, prices for many Chinese products have remained unchanged since the 1950's and 1960's. Because of constant shortages, these administrative prices are generally lower than market prices would be. The gap is particularly wide for coal, iron ore and other raw materials. **********Although Chinese leaders recognize the necessity of price reform and have been discussing it for over a year, they have procrastinated because of the serious political risks (of which inflation is one). Instead of making all prices flexible, Prime Minister Zhao has chosen a more gradual approach. Products manufactured for the central plan must adhere to the set price, while above-quota production can be sold on the market at floating prices. This approach has created a dual economy with two different sets of prices. The disparity between the low administratively set prices and the market's floating prices has created many opportunities for trading and arbitrage. **********Drawn by the lure of high profits, many enterprises and Government bureaus have set up trading companies to buy cheap building materials at ''plan'' prices and sell them at market prices. Anyone who obtains within-plan automobiles and sells them on the market can triple or quadruple his money, and imported cars can bring even more. **********Because foreign exchange rates, like plan prices, are fixed at rates much lower than market levels, organizations that earn foreign exchange also are tempted to engage in arbitrage. In the biggest among several recent exchange-rate scandals, the government of Hainan Island bought $570 million from Guangdong Province (at a rate of 7.3 yuan to the dollar, over two and a half times the official rate) and then used the money to import 89,000 motor vehicles, 2,860,000 television sets, 252,000 video recorders and 122,000 motorcycles, all of which it resold for huge profits. **********While this scheme might not offend Western sensibilities, it was poorly received in a society that regards merchant trading as mildly corrupt and, of course, frowns upon any profiteering on exchange rates. Most of the traders are Government officials, and although the profits usually go into the coffers of their departments and not into their pockets, people resent seeing public servants behaving in this manner. **********The problems of inflation and corruption, as well as the recent crackdown, should not be interpreted as the beginning of the end for the reform drive. My interviews with Chinese officials, some of whom are close advisers to Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, left me convinced that the top leaders have the political will to carry through the reform process despite short-term setbacks. As Red Flag, the Party's main ideological organ, asserted, ''problems appearing in the course of reform can be solved only through continuing reforms.'' **********The history of previous ''mini-cycles'' of reform makes such public expressions of commitment credible. From 1980 to 1982, when reform policies sparked runaway spending, the central government temporarily tightened its control over finance, construction and foreign trade. But the leadership followed this retrenchment with a renewed decentralization effort during 1984. **********We should expect the reform impulse to survive the 1985 setbacks as well. But if future cycles are to be avoided, the next stage of reform initiative must introduce risk and price reform into Chinese life."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/15/business/itt-trimming-staff-by-350.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITT Trimming Staff by 350", "print_headline": "ITT Trimming Staff by 350", "body_text": " **********The ITT Corporation said yesterday that it planned to reduce its headquarters staff worldwide by 350 people, or 23 percent, as part of the company's drive to restructure. **********The reductions, to be completed by early 1986, involve staff in Brussels and at the company's base in New York as well as at regional offices throughout the United States. **********Ralph W.

As evidence, he cited Bulgaria's seizure of two Italian tourists, Paolo Farsetti and Gabriela Travesini, who, he feared, might be offered by Bulgaria in a trade for the release of Sergei I. Antonov, the sole Bulgarian defendant in the trial who is in Italian custody. **********''I was just acting in line with the external situation,'' Mr. Agca said.

''Let's say, many things were happening outside that concerned this trial.'' **********Mr. Agca said he gambled that Italy's press would get the letter, leading Italian officials to believe he enjoyed United States support. He said reports of his activities in Bulgaria and his involvement with terrorist figures, which were carried in the American press, led him to believe the American Government was aware of his importance. **********For White House, Agca Says **********''The American Embassy does not get mixed up in affairs as important as this,'' Mr. Agca said. ''This is for someone from the White House, if you think about it.'' **********When told by Judge Santiapichi that the letter was published by an Italian newspaper last January, Mr. Agca seemed startled. ''It was published?'' he asked. The judge replied: ''You missed that one. You better subscribe to that paper.'' **********In earlier testimony, Mr. Agca described how he and two other Turks drove with two Bulgarian diplomats to St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981, the day he shot and seriously wounded the Pope. **********But Mr. Agca made numerous changes from earlier testimony, and seemed unable to convince the judge, who cross-examined him, of the accuracy of numerous details. **********Asked whether alternative getaway plans existed, if the assassination attempt failed, Mr. Agca replied that the plan was to flee to the Syrian Embassy. **********Asked, however, to supply the embassy's address, he said he could not remember. **********''Mr. Agca,'' Judge Santiapichi said, ''don't tell me that a man who remembered dozens of telephone numbers all across Central Europe cannot recall the address of the Syrian Embassy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/world/1000-peking-students-march-in-resentment-against-japan.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1985-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 380, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "1,000 PEKING STUDENTS MARCH IN RESENTMENT AGAINST JAPAN", "print_headline": "1,000 PEKING STUDENTS MARCH IN RESENTMENT AGAINST JAPAN", "body_text": " **********Chinese students staged one of the biggest protest demonstrations here in years when they marched through Tiananmen Square today waving banners and shouting slogans against Japan. **********It was the first such demonstration in the square since thousands of people converged there on April 5, 1976, to protest the policies of a group of Mao Zedong's associates who were later purged as the ''Gang of Four.'' **********About 1,000 students from Peking and Qinghua Universities converged on the square in the center of the city from their suburban campuses and marched twice around the perimeter.

Tass, the Soviet press agency, had made a similar threat last month, though in a less authoritative form. **********The White House last month announced a decision to proceed with the first American test of an anti-satelllite weapon against an object in space. Officials argued that the test was needed to maintain a military balance with the Soviet Union. **********Reagan Gave 15-Day Notice **********On Aug. 20, the Reagan Administration gave Congress a 15-day notice of its intention to stage the test, as required by 1983 legislation. The 15-day period expires tonight. [In Washington, the Air Force announced that it planned to go ahead with its test of a new anti-satellite weapon this month, despite the Soviet Union's threat. Both the White House and the Pentagon issued statements saying the Soviet threat to deploy its own anti-satellite weapon had little practical meaning because the Soviet Union already has such a system. Page A8.]  Tass said Washington's decision to stage the test ''is nothing but an action directly leading to the commencement of the deployment of a new class of dangerous armaments - strike space weapons.'' **********Soviet Urges Prohibition **********The statement said Washington was acting despite the existence of Soviet proposals at the Geneva arms talks to prohibit such weapons. **********''In other words, to our restraint in practical actions, to our constructive proposals at the talks, the American side is responding with a demonstration of its unwillingness to reach agreements, to display mutual restraint,'' Tass said. It charged that both at Geneva and in diplomatic exchanges, the United States had ''flatly refused'' to consider any measure for banning or limiting anti-satellite weapons. ''Thereby it deliberately creates an artificial impasse in this question,'' it said. **********ABM Treaty Is Cited **********Washington's calculation, Tass said, was not only to acquire anti-satellite weapons, ''but also on developing, under the guise of testing anti-satellite systems, antimissile systems of air and other basing that are prohibited by the ABM treaty.'' **********The 1972 antiballistic missile treaty sets limits on systems designed to knock down incoming missiles. The Kremlin, as well as some American critics of anti-satellite tests, have asserted that such testing would erode the ABM treaty. **********Tass recalled that in August 1983 the Soviet Union announced a unilateral moratorium on launching or stationing any kind of anti-satellite weapon in space as long as other nations also refrained from such action. ''Tass is authorized to state that if the United States holds tests of anti-satellite weapons against a target in outer space, the Soviet Union will consider itself free of its unilateral commitment not to place anti-satellite systems in space,'' the statement said. ''The entire responsibility for the further development of events will rest entirely on the American side.'' **********The statement left unclear what Moscow intended to do concretely. According to American sources, the Soviet Union has tested an anti-satellite weapon that the Pentagon describes as operational, though most experts consider it much cruder and slower than the American system under development. **********The Soviet system consists of a ballistic missile that is launched into orbit and then chases down target satellites. **********Fighter to Launch Rocket **********The American system to be tested consists of a rocket launched from a fighter flying at high altitude. The rocket, in turn, fires a small homing missile at the satellite. **********The coming test is expected to use a defunct American satellite as target. **********The Soviet moratorium was announced by Yuri V. Andropov, the late Soviet leader, at a meeting with a group of American senators in August 1983. He said then: ''The U.S.S.R. assumes the commitment not to be the first to put into outer space any type of anti-satellite weapon, that is, imposes a unilateral moratorium on such launchings for the entire period during which other countries, including the U.S.A., will refrain from stationing in outer space anti-satellite weapons of any kind.'' **********The statement, however, did not refer to anti-satellite tests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/14/business/briefs-051420.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues *********** American Express Overseas Finance Co.

It is not satisfying much of Congress. Nor is it appeasing companies that want to share in a defense Budget that yielded returns on equity of nearly 26 percent for the top Pentagon contractors over the last five years. Increasingly, militant lobbyists and legislators say the military is moving neither fast enough nor far enough. **********''Defense contractors have the equivalent of a patent that never expires,'' said Donna Martin, an analyst for the Project on Military Procurement, a Washington-based Pentagon watchdog. Easier access to Pentagon contracts, says Michael R. Burns, a lobbyist for Business Executives for National Security, would bring down the cost of weapons by invigorating the bidding process. ''There are a lot of companies who would get in if the rules were up front and if they knew the guys with the best product and the best price would win,'' he said. **********Congress is starting to take matters into its own hands. Senator David H. Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat, introduced a bill on Wednesday that would outlaw sole sourcing of the majority of purchased military equipment. His bill comes on the heels of one sponsored several weeks ago by Representative Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, that attempts to rule out conflicts of interest in bidding by forcing military personnel to wait several years after leaving the military before going to work for a military contractor - or vice versa. And next week Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, is expected to introduce a measure that will require that competitive bidding be increased over a 13-year period until it covers 70 percent of all military contracts. The current percentage is less than 45 percent, the Pentagon concedes. **********Proponents of the bills say that the Pentagon's internal reforms have been cosmetic. ''We need a law with fangs, not just teeth,'' said Senator Pryor. Several Congressional staff members have warned of an impending ''constitutional crisis'' as the military (part of the executive branch) and the legislature come to loggerheads. **********The earliest fight is likely to be over the ''revolving door'' issue, the practice of Pentagon employees shuttling back and forth between jobs at the Defense Department and positions with military contractors. Critics say it has resulted in a strong anti-competitive network that rewards friends and holds outsiders at bay. **********COMPETITION lobbyists say that, partly because of the widely publicized cost-overrun scandals of recent months, some of the new measures, particularly the anti-revolving door legislation, stand a good chance of eventually passing. **********But those companies that claim they have been stonewalled by the Pentagon are not willing to wait. Many of them, ranging in size from giants such as the $3.68 billion Northrop Corporation, which already derives two-thirds of its revenues from Uncle Sam but wants more, to tiny one-man shops that seek their first contract with the Pentagon, are going public with their complaints. They are speaking at hearings, taking out advertisements, displaying their wares at trade shows, and opening their doors to media coverage shunned in the past. **********A Northrop official appeared on ''Sixty Minutes,'' the CBS television show, to complain about what was described as Northrop's inability to get the Air Force to consider the company's F-20 Tigershark plane as a cheaper alternative to General Dynamics' F-16. Alexis Guy Oblensky, who operates Bromion Inc. out of a converted stone gasoline station in Sloatsburg, N.Y., has tried to interest journalists in investigating his charge that the Army abruptly stopped buying a ''test set'' that his company makes to measure the effectiveness of voltage generators. Mr. Oblensky said the purchasing stopped after the device exposed too many Army generators as faulty. **********Several of the disgruntled companies have complained through a military hotline that the Defense Department itself set up recently to bring cases of unfair competition out in the open. And a few of their complaints have been corroborated. **********For example, the Inspector General's office investigated a hotline complaint made by B.H. Aircraft, a Farmingdale, L.I., maker of cut-rate jet engine components, that the Air Force had unfairly scuttled its bid for combustion chambers for jet engines, although the bid was $3 million lower than that of the nearest competitor. The company charged that the Air Force cited pending design changes as a reason for not ordering new chambers, but continued to take delivery on those already made under a contract with Pratt & Whitney and Belgium's Fabrique Nationale. **********''They would much rather continue going to the prime contractors and their hand-picked suppliers, no matter how much it costs,'' said Vincent Kearns, president of B.H. **********The Inspector General's report did, indeed, cast doubt on the Air Force's claims. It noted that if design changes were in the works, all existing contracts should have been put on hold, not just B.H.'s. The report concluded that the Air Force procurement bureaucracy does have a ''preference'' for Pratt & Whitney and Fabrique Nationale, a Belgian supplier that has a close relationship with Pratt. The Air Force says it needs the incoming orders for spares and is proceeding with its design changes. **********The Inspector General's office is currently investigating Mr. Oblensky's charges, too. And a study by the National Bureau of Standards has lent some support to his technical arguments. Now, he says, he is hoping that his test sets will be vindicated in time to give him a crack at contracts for test sets to go along with the $1.6 billion worth of generators that the Army plans to purchase over the next five years. **********B.H. and Bromion are dealing with relatively cut-and-dried situations -a canceled bidding process and a canceled product contract. Other companies say they face more subtle forms of Pentagon partiality. **********FRED NEUBERGER, president of Wedtech, a $70 million, publicly held Bronx-based contractor that makes motors and parts for the Army and Navy, says that on paper small companies have little trouble getting in the door. ''All you have to do is fill out a questionnaire to become an approved bidder, and anybody with a machine shop and no experience can go out and get a set of drawings and bid,'' he said. **********But competition is fierce among such companies, and the leap into the big leagues is often only a dream. Although the rules require that prime contractors send qualified subcontractors blueprints of any product that the Government paid to develop, in practice the primes rarely do, according to Mr. Neuberger. Thus, he says, the Pentagon too often relegates small companies to ''the morsels that fall from the tables of the big boys.'' **********The military still dismisses a lion's share of the complaints as sour grapes. A spokesman for the Army Materiel and Readiness Command responded to questions about Mr. Oblensky's charges, for example, by saying that some companies ''are peeved when their pet projects are rejected.'' **********But business lobbying in Washington is starting to show results. The Air Force, for example, is reported to be considering the purchase of several Northrop F-20's, which are selling for about $4 million less per plane than the rival General Dynamics F-16. And the stirrings in Congress could mean that the Pentagon's buying habits will have to change even more. **********A SPATE OF FOREIGN BIDS **********To make matters worse for budding military contractors, the surging dollar has made foreign companies formidable competitors for those Pentagon contracts open to price bidding from NATO countries, Japan and South Korea. **********Foreign-made machine tools are now in use in Washington's Navy Yard. American aerospace companies have lost contracts for components to European manufacturers. And American shipbuilding companies recently lost a lucrative repair contract to Burraud-Yarros, a small Vancouver-based shipbuilding subsidiary of Canada's Versatile Corporation. **********Burraud-Yarros, after losing out on eight repair bids in the last three years - ''Another two or three losses and we would probably have given up,'' says David Alsop, senior vice president -now has a $3 million contract to repair the U.S.N.S. Spica, a Navy supply ship. The Spica is only the third United States naval vessel to berth at a Canadian repair yard but, significantly, it is the second one this year. **********The Navy insists it is following the law by treating Canadian bids equally with those of American companies. But Scott Fitzwater, president of Dillingham Ship Repair in Portland, Ore., the second-lowest bidder on the Spica job, insists that the Navy has more leeway in bids than it admits and could keep the Canadians out if it desired. ''They can steer the ships where they want them,'' he says. **********The rhetoric is starting to fly, as the shipbuilders try to persuade Congress that more than money is at stake. ''The nation is at the point where national security is being jeopardized,'' says M. Lee Rice, president of the Shipbuilders of America. ''We do not have the capacity to support an emergency mobilization.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/business/house-unit-backs-curb-on-textiles.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Roberts", "pub_date": "1985-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOUSE UNIT BACKS CURB ON TEXTILES", "print_headline": "HOUSE UNIT BACKS CURB ON TEXTILES", "body_text": " **********Congress moved closer to a confrontation with the White House over trade policy today as the House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill that would cut back textile imports from a dozen countries by as much as 40 percent. **********But before passing the bill, the committee defeated by a single vote an amendment that would have significantly weakened the legislation by delaying the imposition of mandatory quotas while the Administration tried to negotiate new international textile agreements.

Yeutter, the Administration's trade representative, met with Republican leaders today and expressed a willingness to work with the lawmakers in refining and promoting their proposals, according to Mike Johnson, a spokesman for Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader. **********Change of Attitude **********Mr. Yeutter's attitude represents a ''dramatic change'' in the approach of the Administration, which until recently has opposed virtually all trade measures, Mr. Johnson said. ''They realized there was tremendous pressure building up for trade legislation,'' he explained. ''They found their own party on the Hill was running away from them.'' **********In another sign of White House sensitivity to protectionist pressure, the Administration is reportedly considering a policy shift that would reverse its long-standing opposition to trade adjustment assistance programs. The President's Cabinet council on economic policy, at a meeting today, discussed the possibility of backing a trade adjustment assistance measure approved last week by the Senate Finance Committee, Administration officials said. **********The measure would provide dislocated workers with vouchers for job retraining programs in other industries, which would be financed by a fee of up to 1 percent on the total value of United States imports. The officials said no final decision was made. **********The current program, which expires at the end of this month, provides benefits to American workers whose jobs have been lost as a result of import competition. **********Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers released a letter to James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of the Treasury, urging the Administration to organize a conference to examine exchange rates and the international monetary system. **********Representative Jack F. Kemp, an upstate New York Republican who helped draft the letter, said that fluctuating exchange rates and the strength of the dollar are ''at the heart of protectionist sentiment in Congress.'' **********Democrats as well as Republicans praised the Administration for calling a meeting of the five leading industrial nations last weekend and organizing an effort to have those governments intervene in the monetary system and help drive down the value of the dollar. But many legislators took a wait-and-see attitude toward the effectiveness of the effort. **********Industry Called Threatened **********During the Ways and Means debate over the textile bill, Representative Ed Jenkins, the Georgia Democrat who is the author of the legislation, argued that ''this industry is on the verge of going under if something is not done.'' Representative Raymond J. McGrath, a Long Island Republican, touched on the deep emotions evoked by the trade issue when he said, ''I don't particularly like my butt getting kicked'' by foreign competitors. **********But Representative Richard Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who sponsored the amendment that failed by one vote, said it would be far better if the problem were ''handled by treaty rather than legislation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/25/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   People", "body_text": " *********** Thomas J.

Beyond all else, that was the message of his speech tonight. **********Unlike the piecemeal changes that other Presidents pursued, such as Jimmy Carter's unsuccessful 1978 assault on the business lunch, or John F. Kennedy's sponsorship of the investment tax credit to stimulate business, President Reagan would revamp, wholesale, the income tax system that has developed since World War II. **********His new plan seeks a system that fosters smaller government, free markets, entrepreneurship and the accumulation of wealth, and also nurtures the American family - ''the bedrock,'' the President said, ''of our society.'' **********Debate Over Effects **********Even if the essentials of the President's proposal are adopted by Congress, analysts are widely divided over the possible effects on the economy and society. The White House believes that the plan will inspire a new burst of economic growth, as taxpayers plow more of their higher, aftertax incomes into savings and investments. **********But many economists note that consumers spent far more than they saved after the President last cut taxes in 1981. They also note that industry, which would assume a greater share of the national tax burden under the President's proposal, saves a far greater proportion of its earnings than consumers. **********''It's more religion than science,'' Roger E. Brinner, economist at Data Resources Inc., a forecasting firm, said of the Administration's theories. **********More than any President since Franklin Roosevelt, President Reagan has seized upon a propitious moment to try his new religion. The current tax system is universally condemned as confusing, unfair, economically counterproductive and such a monument to special interests that tax evasion has become a national pursuit among the millions who feel cheated. **********Partisans do not disagree over whether to change the system - but how. Even critics of the President's economic policies see some virtues in his tax plan. ''Would we have a better world?'' asked Joseph F. Minarik, a former analyst of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a tax expert at the Urban Institute. ''Yes. How much better? I don't know yet.'' **********No one, not even the Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, and his deputy, Richard G. Darman, who assembled the plan, can as yet offer any convincing evidence that all the thousands of elements of the plan will work in a way to assure the healthier economy or the more equitable society that the President has set as his goal. **********Nor, as yet, can anyone here predict with any certainty how the members of Congress, and especially the Democrats who control the House of Representatives, will modify the plan. **********The Toughest Going **********It is in the House that the President faces his toughest going. By granting detail-by-detail concessions to various interest groups, the President and his aides may have pre-empted the deal-making prerogatives of the Congress, and thus hurt the prospects for the overhaul that all, Republicans and Democrats, profess to support. ''Congress will do its thing,'' said Barber B. Conable Jr. the former ranking Republican member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. ''When they were in the White House,'' he said, ''Baker and Darman were used to cutting compromises at the end of the process. But with this they're doing it at the start.'' **********Of the various components of the plan, none illustrates the President's commitment to smaller government than his insistence upon repealing the tax deduction for state and local taxes. Only a half-dozen states, foremost among them New York, have raised objections to the provision, and those are big-government, high-tax states. **********By repealing the deduction and forcing taxpayers of those states to pay somewhat higher Federal taxes, President Reagan forces upon the states the same choice he has forced upon the Congress - to cut spending and services and reduce the size of government, or to turn instead to politically unpalatable tax increases. **********Such a provision seems contrary to the President's commitment to the family. But only a minority of taxpayers benefit from the deduction, because they are the only ones who itemize. And the President protects those families with the two most important exceptions he makes to pure tax reform -the preservation of the deduction on mortgage interest payments and his near doubling, from $1,040 to $2,000, of the personal income tax deduction. **********Concessions to Small Business **********The Reagan proposals also make important concessions to small business, in allowing them lower tax rates than bigger businesses. And it favors the young technology-based industries that invest relatively little in heavy equipment and currently benefit from fewer tax breaks than most of the giants of heavy industry that would now lose some of their special breaks. **********It was Apple Computer, the entrepreneurial wonder that two college students started in a California garage, not General Motors or Exxon, that the President singled out tonight as the example of the kind of enterprise that he believe his tax plan would favor. **********In effect, the President has turned his back on the giants of industry - but he makes an important bow to the high-paid executives who run them, and all other wealthy Americans. With the exception of those who rely heavily on the many of the tax shelters that the President would now repeal, the rich, like the working poor, stand to gain more personally from the tax plan than everyone else. **********One contentious element of the President's plan is a $5,000 limit on the deduction taxpayers are allowed on interest payments for loans other than home mortgages. But it applies to interest payments exceeding a taxpayers' investment income - dividend, interest and rental income from assets. **********No Real Constraint **********Thus, wealthy taxpapers with abundant unearned income from such investments face no real constraint, while middle-income taxpayers who borrow to buy second homes, autos and department store goods, but have no income-producing investments, could lose a part of their deduction. **********In addition, the President would reduce the tax on capital gains from which the rich derive much of their income. In reducing the maximum income tax rate from 50 percent to 35 percent, he would let taxpayers with incomes of hundreds of thousands of dollars, many of them Reagan supporters and campaign contributors, keep proportionately more, after taxes, than they do now. **********''From what I can tell, they have changed the progressivity of the system,'' said William A. Niskanen, a former member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and now chairman of the Cato Institute, a public-policy research organization here. ''It's more progressive from the poverty line up to incomes of about $50,000, and above that it's less progressive.'' **********Yet most individuals, even the middle-income groups who gain relatively less than the poor and the rich, stand to benefit from the President's plan. **********Individuals to Industry **********The President manages to reduce individual taxes, while at the same time generating the same tax revenue the Government now collects, by shifting more of the tax burden from individuals to corporations, especially those, such as banks, insurers, utilities, chemical companies, paper companies and others that currently pay 10 percent or less of their profits in taxes. **********But in shifting the tax burden from individuals to industry, the President may sacrifice another of his oft-stated goals - long-term economic growth. For the moment, the President does not believe it. **********''Go for it!'' he told television viewers tonight in an appeal aimed at the gut of the struggling family, not economist-naysayers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/30/business/hillenbrand-pact-with-bed-maker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HILLENBRAND PACT WITH BED MAKER", "print_headline": "HILLENBRAND PACT WITH BED MAKER", "body_text": " **********Hillenbrand Industries said it had reached a definitive agreement to purchase all the assets of Support Systems International Inc., a maker of wound-therapy beds, for $100 million in cash, plus contingent payments based on financial performance over a five-year period. **********Support Systems, which is based in Charleston, S.C., had revenues of about $98 million for the year ended Sept. 30.

Instead, the place was a suburb of Boston nearly 30 years ago, the runaway success was the minicomputer - a smaller, simpler, more economical machine than the expensive mainframes - and many thought that bigger, lumbering competitors would never catch up with the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********They were wrong. Now, after a painful four years in which Digital saw profit margins shrivel and the personal computer revolution largely pass it by, the world's second-largest computer maker is attempting a powerful comeback. One of the most important pieces of its strategy will fall into place Tuesday, when the company introduces its Microvax II, a computer that puts one of Digital's most successful minicomputers on a chip. **********The machine is a desktop version of the VAX 780, the star of Digital's minicomputer line. It will sell for a base price of about $20,000 - less than a fifth of the price of its older cousin. It is the second major VAX introduction in six months: Digital's new Venus machine, really a small mainframe, has sustained the company's earnings when other minicomputer makers have suffered mightily. **********The Microvax II will extend the VAX line in the opposite direction, toward desktop users rather than mainframes. A specialized version has been made for the computer-aided design market, now dominated by Apollo Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems and others. The new machine's biggest selling point is that it runs hundreds of programs available for the larger VAX machines, winning it enthusiastic reviews from engineers and scientists, long Digital's most loyal following. **********The question, however, is whether the new VAX machine, which can perform more than a million instructions a second, will attract a host of new users. If so, it will compete in the office market, a stronghold of the International Business Machines Corporation and Wang Laboratories. If not, it may simply cut into sales of Digital's more profitable minicomputers. **********''It's dangerous; there are a lot of things we don't know,'' Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's 59-year-old founder and chairman, acknowledged in an interview here today. Speaking at a company office set amid farmhouses and rolling hills off Route 128, Boston's high-technology corridor, he added, ''We know that in the long run, this is the direction Digital has to go.'' **********The strategy that Mr. Olsen outlined today runs counter to that of Digital's nemesis, I.B.M. While I.B.M. is exploring a host of new ventures and computer designs - opening new markets, but often making it nearly impossible to link different systems - Digital is quickly committing the whole product line to the VAX architecture. **********''We didn't go after digital watches, hand-held calculators, home computers,'' Mr. Olsen said, ticking off a litany of electronic failures. ''We are committing ourselves to picking the best projects, the toughest problems. Growing any faster,'' he said, rocking back in his chair, ''would be suicide.'' **********Analysts who a year ago openly voiced concern for Digital's future say they are cautiously optimistic about the new approach. ''We have seen DEC reverse itself completely in the past few years,'' said Frederic G. Withington of Arthur D. Little & Company, a Cambridge consulting and research firm. ''They have gone from selling just low-end machines to full networks, based on VAX. They are coming out pure - but slim.'' **********Mr. Olsen, an M.I.T.-trained engineer, seemed unperturbed at the thought that the days of Digital's spectacular growth may be over. He insisted that Digital's role, at a time when small computers have fast become commodity items produced in vast quantities, is to sell advanced work stations and sophisticated, if uncomplicated, networks. **********''Our contribution from the beginning has been to make very simple, fast computers,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''That was the M.I.T. approach, and it worked. The problem for us now is that computers are getting too easy to make. Anybody with a collection of integrated circuits and an instruction book could screw them together,'' he added, in a jab at I.B.M.'s use of off-the-shelf components to build its PC. ''What we have decided to do is far harder: a single, integrated system.'' **********While that might be the approach, it was not always the plan. At one point Digital had a dizzying panoply of products, each designed separately by as many as 38 development groups. The result was a range of approaches, which was one reason the company failed in the personal computer market. (Most of those groups were cut out in a reorganization two years ago that prompted many disgruntled executives to leave.) While the company has had several personal computer-like products, its best known, the Rainbow, was its most disastrous. It was never fully compatible with I.B.M.'s model, and it has been all but withdrawn from retail shelves. Mr. Olsen acknowledged today that the Rainbow was ''probably never profitable.'' **********''I was beaten up unmercifully in the press about our PC's, because they thought I was too old to understand the future,'' he said. ''But our real problem was that we made the Rainbow too expensively. We worried about putting the quality there, but for once people didn't care about quality. They bought on price alone. We didn't anticipate that.'' Future Products In the future, Mr. Olsen says, personal computers will be just a ''tool'' connected to bigger VAX machines -including the Microvax II - for communications and specialized processing. While Digital executives decline to talk in specific terms about future products, they hint broadly that the next model of their computers will be an inexpensive desktop machine -analysts look for a $5,000 model -that will use two processors to run both I.B.M. Personal Computer software and the range of VAX programs. **********''People are disillusioned about PC's right now,'' Mr. Olsen contended. ''The machines are great for working alone. But the future is in making them work together.'' **********Digital's more immediate problem, though, is to make up for lost time with the Microvax II. While the company insists that the computer is on schedule, the industry expected it last year. And in the meanwhile, a host of competitors have sprung up. **********The traditional ones include Apollo and Sun, specialists in ''work stations'' designed particularly for engineers with needs for high-resolution graphics, used in modeling everything from airplane wings to machine tools. I.B.M. is also becoming a potent threat in that area, as it attempts to build on its PC architecture, among others. **********Because the Microvax is also intended as an office machine - up to 21 terminals can be attached directly, more through a local area network -Digital is fighting office automation leaders like Wang. ''That could be the toughest,'' predicted Fred Cohen, who followed Digital for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. ''Those are markets where VAX has not been strong before, and DEC has to break in.'' **********A surprise element of Digital's Microvax announcement will be the industry's first compact optical disk reader, making it possible to store the contents of two complete sets of the Encyclopedia Brittanica on a disk about five inches in diameter. **********The disk looks exactly like the compact disks now used for high-quality music recordings. Like those systems, the disk is read by a laser. Because so much information can be packed on the disks, publishers are viewing them as a way of distributing multivolume legal reference books, large encyclopedias and dictionaries, and telephone directories. **********But unlike the magnetic floppy disks now used in personal computers, information written on an optical disk is there to stay: it cannot be updated. **********Digital's disk stores 600 megabytes, or more than 600 million characters of information. That is about 200,000 single-spaced typewritten pages, and about 600 times more information than can be stored on the most densely packed floppy disks. The disk reader is priced at $2,195. **********Digital is hardly the only company readying the technology. I.B.M. is rumored to be working on a similar device that could be marketed with its PC II computer when that is introduced this summer. The Atari Corporation said earlier this year that it would sell a $500 optical disk reader, but it has yet to show the device."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/12/business/investment-banker-for-unions.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1985-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTMENT BANKER FOR UNIONS", "print_headline": "INVESTMENT BANKER FOR UNIONS", "body_text": " **********When Brian M. Freeman, an investment banker, is negotiating a deal, he bluffs, he demands and, very calculatingly, he sometimes insults his adversary to gain the upper hand. **********The clients he so tenaciously represents, however, are neither deep-pocket takeover artists nor multimillion-dollar corporations. Instead, they are labor unions whose members may be willing to make wage concessions in return for profit-sharing and stock ownership. **********Oftentimes in troubled company situations, the unions hold the key to either  attracting an outside investor for an acquisition or accomplishing a turnaround  for existing management. Mr. Freeman views his role as that of getting the message across to them that the wage concessions of unions are ''no different than making a capital investment in a company.'' **********For giant corporations those concessions can amount to $100 million and more  a year. Using them as a bargaining chip is what Mr. Freeman refers to as ''the exercise of economic power.'' **********Mr. Freeman is one of only a few individuals who specialize in this emerging  niche of investment banking. As president of Freeman & Company, a small Washington-based financial advisory firm, he currently is representing, along with Lazard Freres & Company, the unions of Trans World Airlines. **********The three unions, machinists, pilots and flight attendants, are aligning themselves with Carl C. Icahn, the investor who is making a takeover bid that they believe promises more job security than a deal T.W.A. already has pending with the Texas Air Corporation. For four years, Mr. Freeman also has been the financial adviser to the 17 unions of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, the Government-owned line that is up for sale. And he is also the financial adviser  to the Labor Department on employee buyout plans. **********Millions in Fees **********Once the Conrail deal goes through, he stands to pick up as much as $4 million in fees for helping the unions, among other things, to receive a giant payback of their past wage concessions. And if T.W.A.'s unions are successful, his firm and Lazard Freres will split a $2.5 million fee. **********Most union leaders who have worked with Mr. Freeman say he is worth the price. **********''We can negotiate wages, hours and working conditions,'' said John Peterpaul, a vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. ''But when we play around in the financial world, we need someone like Brian Freeman. He fills a lot of voids.'' **********Robert Callahan, president of Eastern Airlines Local 553 of the Transport Workers Union, said that Mr. Freeman ''pushes the unions to come to an agreement as much as he pushes the company; it's good for us, even though some people think he oversteps his bounds of being an adviser at times.'' **********Known as a workaholic, the 5-foot-7-inch tall, 39-year old Mr. Freeman is routinely juggling several union negotiations at once. The last time he had a vacation with his wife and three children, he said, was a week at the Jersey shore two years ago. One union leader referred to him as a ''whirling dervish; he'll hang in there on weekends, through all-night sessions and keep coming back for more.'' **********Mr. Peterpaul credits Mr. Freeman with devising and negotiating the terms of  pacts the unions worked out with Eastern Airlines, Western Airlines and Republic Airlines. All three companies in the past two years turned over big chunks of their stock - 25 percent, 25 percent and 20 percent, respectively - and future profits to their employees in return for wage concessions that recently have helped earnings snap back. **********He Has Critics **********To be sure, Mr. Freeman has his detractors. His candid, brash personality offends some, as does his tendency to take charge of negotiations. And at Frontier Airlines, four out of five unions, with the exception of the machinists, want nothing more to do with him. **********Mr. Freeman represented the coalition of Frontier unions when they sought late last year to put together a deal with outside financing for an employee buyout of the airline. An employee buyout was subsequently arranged, but only after Mr. Freeman resigned as adviser to the unions, and the airline has laid off about 1,000 employees and sold off many of its parts. **********''He messed things up here,'' said Lorraine Loflan, the representative for the flight attendants at Frontier. She said that, if Mr. Freeman had produced outside financing, as he promised last December, wage concessions would have been made then that would have enabled the airline to recover without having to  sell as many assets as it has in recent months. Billy Walker, the head of the pilots association at Frontier, agrees, saying that ''the fact of the matter is  that Brian Freeman came in to do a deal and didn't get the job done.'' **********Mr. Freeman denies that he promised something he could not deliver. Donald Kendall, a managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, the firm brought in  by Mr. Freeman to help arrange the financing, backs him up, saying that ''the unions and management were never able to come together amongst themselves; the financing would have been available, contingent on such things as a new business plan that spelled out specific wage concessions and the makeup of a new management team.'' **********Serving as an investment banker to labor is a role that Mr. Freeman took on in 1981 when the Conrail unions wanted him to represent them in their plan to make a buyout bid for the company. Only a few years earlier, he had been on the  other side of the bargaining table, representing the Treasury Department in its  dealings with Conrail and its unions. **********Lockheed and Chrysler Roles **********Mr. Freeman's tenure at the Treasury Department began in 1976 when he helped  monitor the Lockheed Corporation bailout. He also served as the executive director of the Chrysler Corporation bailout, coming up with the idea of taking  stock warrants in return. Eventually Chrysler, after returning to health, paid the the Government hundreds of millions of dollars to retrieve them. **********Mr. Freeman's approach to negotiating is to be aggressive from the start. ''He who takes control pushes the process; people defer to him,'' he explained.  Although Mr. Freeman asserted that ''I'm just being myself'' when he uses blunt, sometimes abrasive language, he said that he ''often'' did so on purpose  to put his adversary on the defensive. **********Mr. Callahan of the Transport Workers Union described Mr. Freeman as ''tough, smart - a street punk with a Ph.D.'' He added that ''his fearless edge has not been blunted by his academic degrees.'' Mr. Freeman received a law degree and a  master's in business administration from Harvard before working at a New York law firm and holding a research appointment at Harvard's Graduate School of Business. **********Keeps Opponents Guessing **********Mr. Freeman also is known for a poker player's ability to keep his opponents  guessing about how serious he takes each of the many demands he lays on the bargaining table. Even when he insists that a certain point is ''a deal breaker'' if it is not accepted, Mr. Freeman admits with a smile that sometimes  even that is a ruse. **********The key to successful negotiating, he added, was persistence. ''Most people will cave if they know you will come back again and again on the same issue.'' **********Executives with whom Mr. Freeman has locked horns may find his style unnerving at times, but they respect his determination. Frederic Zuckerman, Chrysler's treasurer, said he found Mr. Freeman, ''very smart, unconventional, fun to work with and an intellectually stimulating adversary.'' Stephen Berger,  the chairman of the United States Railway Association, the Government agency that oversees Conrail, said that, ''at times, he can be a pain, but he's a good  negotiator and I think he has done well for the unions he represents.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/business/umw-selling-stock-in-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.M.W.

Shultz on Thursday and Friday. **********When Mr. Reagan was asked about the Red Cross contacts in his news conference, he said it was one of the delicate areas ''I can't talk about.'' Israel Ready to Receive Official In Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres said that he would be ready to receive a Red Cross representative on the United States' initiative. [Page A14.]  The American officials said they hoped the Red Cross could help end the crisis, without making it appear that the United States and Israel were striking a deal with the hijackers. **********The plan, according to the officials, is for the Red Cross to be told by Israel when it would free the Shiites, who were moved to Israel in early April from southern Lebanon. The information would then be conveyed by the Red Cross and the United States to Nabih Berri, the Shiite leader, to induce him to free the hostages in return for what would be a Red Cross promissory note, unofficially endorsed by United States. **********The White House, while announcing the Red Cross plan today, insisted that the United States was not asking Israel to free the Shiites in exchange for the hostages. **********Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman, said the Red Cross had been asked simply to get in touch with Israel ''to ascertain the status of the release'' of the Shiite prisoners. **********''We have not asked the Israelis nor will we ask the Israelis, through any means, International Red Cross or any other organization, to accede to the demands of the hijackers,'' he said. The Red Cross was first brought into the crisis on Saturday when the Trans World Airlines plane was in Algeria. At that time, the United States and Algeria hoped that the Red Cross could obtain the release of the hostages by assuring the hijackers that plans were already under way in Israel to free the Shiites. But before the talks could proceed, the hijackers flew to Beirut. **********On April 2, the Israelis moved 1,100 Shiites from the Ansar camp in southern Lebanon to Israel. The next day the United States said Israel had apparently violated a Geneva convention prohibiting the transfer of prisoners to the territory of an occupying power. At that time, the Israelis said the transfer was temporary and the detainees would be released as developments in southern Lebanon permitted. **********About 400 of the 1,100 were released subsequently, and 350 other were due to have been freed last week, but the transfer was delayed by a controversy between the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army and the United Nations peacekeeping forces, which was finally resolved on Saturday when Finnish soldiers who had been seized by the Israeli-backed troops were freed. **********In view of this background, American officials have been saying that, in contrast to the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979-81, conditions exist for an equitable resolution of the crisis. **********''This is not an impossible situation like in Iran when the students kept demanding the return of the Shah,'' a State Department official said. ''But it has the potential for trouble if the demands escalate or if Berri does not take our promise as sufficient.'' **********Mr. Speakes said that ''our diplomats are making it plain to the Shiite leader, Nabih Berri, that it is the hijackers who stand in the way of the release of the Shiite prisoners held by the Israelis.'' **********The Red Cross, which regards itself as a humanitarian organization, not as a political broker, expressed concern itself in April about the movement of the Shiite detainees from southern Lebanon to Israel. American officials said that while it would not be feasible to ask the Red Cross to mediate on the hostage crisis, it could use its influence to ease the concerns of Mr. Berri and his followers. **********The Administration has been coming under conflicting pressures from within and outside the Government on how to respond to the hijackers' demands. Mr. Shultz's view that there should be not even the slightest bowing to terrorist pressure has prevailed, although White House officials have seemed more ready to point up possible areas of compromise. **********Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has publicly called on the Administration not to negotiate in any way with the hijackers and to reject all demands.

One of the fastest growing of the big banks until 1982, Continental last year dropped off the list of the 10 largest. **********Its assets plummeted by $11.69 billion, or 28 percent, to $30.41 billion, ranking it No. 12. At the end of 1984, before its near failure and Government rescue, its assets stood at $42.1 billion. Only three years ago, before its huge loan problems emerged, Continental was the sixth-largest banking organization in the country. **********Elsewhere among the top 10, the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles, a consistent strong earner, moved up two places, to No. 7, while the Bankers Trust New York Corporation and the First Chicago Corporation each moved up one to 9 and 10, respectively. First Interstate of California dropped one rank, to No. 8. **********Further Expansion Expected **********Citicorp, despite its already huge lead, and despite a policy to limit its growth, expects to sustain last year's rate of expansion. **********''There's no reason the momentum won't continue,'' said Thomas E. Jones, senior vice president and chief accounting officer. **********Citicorp's growth last year stemmed from the rapid expansion of its consumer-oriented activities in the United States. Assets related to its business with companies and governments actually declined. Mr. Jones said that was Citicorp's basic strategy and that it would continue. **********But he added that the pace of Citicorp's growth might accelerate this year if the dollar were to weaken in the foreign exchange markets. That is because Citicorp has billions of dollars in loans denominated in foreign currencies and if the dollar's value should decline, the dollar value of those loans would rise. **********Key Is Profit Performance **********To a greater extent than ever, the ability of a banking company to grow, whether the giant Citicorp or a smaller institution, depends on its profit performance. That is because bank regulators have been forcing banks and their parent holding companies to increase their primary capital in relation to their total assets. **********Primary capital consists mainly of equity, the stockholders' investment in the company, and reserves against loan losses. Unless a banking company decides to dilute the ownership of its existing stockholders, the only way to increase primary capital is to earn enough money to use profits to build reserves and to retain substantial amounts of net income. A banking company that fails to increase primary capital cannot grow. **********Concern About Loan Losses **********That helps explain why Citicorp, which had strong earnings last year, was able to expand its assets substantially, and why BankAmerica had to shrink. In fact, because of high loan losses, Federal regulators last year made BankAmerica's directors formally agree to bolster the bank's capital. **********''BankAmerica's equity grew a measly $12 million,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, first vice president and senior bank analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''In contrast, Citicorp's common equity rose $555 million, and its preferred rose another $100 million. Citicorp can handle the asset growth.'' **********As a result, the gap in size between the two banking giants widened to almost $33 billion, from $13.5 billion at the end of 1983. That $33 billion alone was bigger than the total assets of the Mellon Bank Corporation, the nation's 11th-largest bank holding company. **********Mcorp Surges by 74.2% **********In percentage terms, however, Citicorp's growth last year was not particularly great. As a result of a merger with the Bank of the Southwest in Houston, Mcorp of Dallas, for example, grew more than three times faster than Citicorp. The assets of Mcorp, which changed its name last year from the Mercantile Texas Corporation, soared to $20.7 billion, up 74.2 percent from the end of 1983, which made it the nation's 22d-largest banking company, from the 28th. **********The NCNB Corporation of North Carolina reported the second-largest percentage increase: 22.4 percent. That was achieved in part by a merger with the Ellis Banking Corporation of Florida. **********The Manufacturers Hanover Corporation also posted a big rise in assets, 17.7 percent, to $75.7 billion. That increase largely reflected its acquisition of the $7 billion asset C.I.T. Corporation. **********Among those that showed the strongest growth in rank were the Bank of Boston and the First Bank System of Minneapolis, each of which rose three spots. **********Part of the Bank of Boston's rise to 16th place reflected its acquisition the Casco-Northern Corporation of Maine, but Alan L. McKinnon, executive vice president, attributed the expansion primarily to loan growth.

Unlike the reaction to the release of the American hostages from Iran, the mood yesterday was not celebratory - flags, champagne, yellow ribbons - as much as it was deliberate and, often, vengeful. **********Few Dissenting Voices **********The four terrorists represented, and raised memories of, so many attacks against Americans that went unanswered and offered only shadowy or suicidal perpetrators - the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran, the bombing of the American military headquarters in Beirut. The seizure of the terrorists, in turn, touched the desire in many Americans for a government that would strike back. **********Some dissenting voices wondered if the American action would not encourage more, retaliatory terrorism, but they were largely lost in the chorus of approval for what Jolene Tanty, a Chicago nightclub owner, called ''Reagan Rambo.'' ''It's about time someone stood up and said, 'We've had enough,' '' said Mayor Steve R. Thrower of Norman, Okla.

''This is a real tonic for the United States. It shows we won't tolerate terrorism.'' **********Beyond words, the reaction showed in a variety of ways. There were cheers in San Francisco's Federal Building and toasts at Joe's, a tavern in Iowa City. At the corner of 7th Avenue and West 53d Street in Manhattan, Peter Hallock sold 150 extra papers from his newsstand, papers with headlines like ''We Got 'Em,'' ''We Bag the Bums'' and ''About Time.'' **********And at the Dew Drop Inn in York, Pa., Tony Mehassie celebrated by dropping a quarter into the jukebox to play ''Hang 'Em High.'' **********'They Should Burn' **********Indeed, the desire to mete out swift and bloody justice to the hijackers ran through conversations from coast to coast. ''The country should be more like Teddy Roosevelt,'' said Robert Hector, a Miami stockbroker. ''We should've shot down the plane,'' said Don Hagen, a construction worker in Los Angeles. **********''They should burn,'' John Hicks, a sign hanger from Manhattan, said of the four terrorists. ''I wish they were here and not Italy. I wish they'd give 'em to me for a minute. I'd put 'em in a room with the families of all the people they hijacked.'' **********Editorial opinion in newspapers across the country reflected the relief and rage of the populace. The Tribune in South Bend, Ind., hailed the capture of the ''bloody-handed thugs'' and The Journal in Lincoln, Neb., described the terrorists as both ''cowardly pirates'' and ''human rodents.'' **********''After years of seeing Uncle Sam the hapless victim of a host of international terrorists,'' The Indianapolis News said in an editorial, ''Americans across the nation have to be walking a little taller today at the news of the bold apprehension of four hijackers.'' **********'It'll Take a Lot More' **********But some Americans characterized the capture as only a partial solution to a vast, worldwide problem. **********''It's high time we did something,'' said Lois Slate, an advertising salesman from Dallas. ''My only fear is that they'll be tried, put in prison and some American will be held for their release.'' **********''It'll take a lot more to stop terrorism,'' said Mr. Hallock, the Manhattan newsstand operator. ''This is only the first time we've struck back and hijackings have happened to us too many times for us to be celebrating.'' **********In Arab-American communities, particularly, praise for the American action was tempered with criticism of the nation's Middle East policy. **********''Nothing justifies what the terrorists did,'' said John Hakbash, a Lebanese immigrant who manages a drug store on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. ''A tragic death should never have happened. But people in the Middle East look at things differently. The Palestinians are homeless.

Now, however, this important safeguard of shareholder democracy is threatened. Earlier this year, a study group appointed by John J. Phelan Jr., the exchange's chairman, broke with tradition in recommending that listed companies, with shareholder approval, be permitted to create two classes of common stock with disproportionate voting rights. **********The recommendation is a long way from adoption - it still must be approved by the exchange and then by the Securities and Exchange Commission. And Congress, with its oversight role and affection for issues of corporate governance and legitimacy, will be keenly interested in how the S.E.C. reacts. As debate proceeds, we need to be clear both about the reasons for the change and about its potentially profound long-term effects on the securities markets and the economy. **********The issue takes on added importance because the Big Board, as the exchange to which most companies have traditionally aspired, exerts a powerful influence on all public companies. While neither Nasdaq nor the American Stock Exchange imposes the ''one share, one vote'' standard, most of their companies would meet that requirement. **********Why is the New York Stock Exchange contemplating the change? Most of the pressure comes from corporate management, which sees nonvoting common stock or common with diminished voting rights as the ultimate defense against hostile takeovers. Until the 1960's, shareholder democracy didn't pose a significant threat to management. There were occasional proxy contests, but the level of activity remained consistently low between 1950 and 1980, no doubt because only about 15 percent of all challenges succeeded. **********Hostile takeovers were a different matter. Beginning in 1969 with Saul Steinberg's attempt at Chemical Bank, the uninvited bid took hold gradually through the 1970's and became a fixture in the 1980's. **********Some Big Board companies - including Dow Jones & Company, Figgie International and the Coastal Corporation - have recently issued two-class common, and at least six companies in recent years have been delisted for doing it. Increasingly, Nasdaq and the Amex are viewed as acceptable alternatives. **********These competitive pressures may tempt the Big Board to approve some change along the lines of its study group's recommendation. The issue will then be framed for public debate before the S.E.C., which should address a number of questions. **********For example, the study group has recommended that a company be required to gain the approval of two- thirds of its shareholders before issuing two-class common stock. Would this justify the shift? Should the votes of management affiliates be counted? Senior managers, as employees of the company, have different interests from other shareholders. **********Does the issue transcend the rights of shareholders, calling into question the legitimacy of vesting so much of our nation's wealth and resources in the hands of bureaucracies made virtually immune to the threat of hostile takeovers? Would such a practice weaken our entrepreneurially driven, competitive economy? Or would the economy be strengthened if corporate managers were free to employ long-term strategies that, under the old rule, might have left them prey to a takeover? **********Will the marketplace function efficiently to penalize corporations that diminish the voting rights of their common stock? Recent experience suggests that it would. For example, Dow Jones's creation of two classes of common prompted a stock price decline of 12 percent. **********WILL the growing class of institutional investors constitute a marketplace restraint on management's freedom to entrench itself? This is a real possibility. In a recent survey by the Big Board, 77 percent of institutional investors said they were against dropping the ''one share, one vote'' requirement. Moreover, a number of institutional investors have refused to retain or buy securities of companies that adopt takeover defenses. And many seek to block those proposals. **********There are uncertainties as to the authority of the S.E.C. in matters of corporate governance. Forceful arguments can be made, however, in support of the S.E.C.'s power to disapprove a Big Board change in the ''one share, one vote'' principle and to impose that principle on the competing marketplaces. **********Regardless of how the question of authority is resolved, the S.E.C. can and should hold public hearings on the ''one share, one vote'' principle. Management's willingness to use two-class common to protect itself against hostile takeovers may be signaling a ''sea change'' in our system of corporate governance that - if unchecked by market forces - could damage economic efficiency. The question whether the New York Stock Exchange should be allowed to facilitate this change by dropping its ''one share, one vote'' rule deserves the closest scrutiny.

But there are so many factions involved in this thing, it could spin out of control when the moment comes to transfer the hostages to some other party.'' **********His comment, echoed by others, was prophetic. **********This morning, when the 39 hostages were gathered for a roll-call in preparation for a move to Damascus, four hostages were missing - four that American officials believe have been held for the last two weeks by the Party of God, among the most radical of the Shiite factions. That group, which is in open opposition to Mr. Berri, is believed by Administration officials to have instigated the hijacking. #4 'Out of Joint Control' **********''Everybody's been bothered that those four people were in the exclusive hands of the Hezbollah,'' one official said this morning, using the Arabic name of the Party of God. ''The other hostages were under joint control, but those four were out of joint control. When you surveyed the scene, there was always that factor that bothered us.'' **********An additional element injected today was a demand for an American pledge not to retaliate once the hostages were released. This condition was apparently linked, according to Amal sources, to President Reagan's threat in Chicago Friday to hold to account ''terrorists and those who support them.'' **********One senior Administration policy-maker discounted the demand as coming from fringe elements and not the key leaders, like Mr. Berri, with whom he said a deal had been made for the release of the hostages. **********But other Government analysts were more troubled by that development. They suggested the new demand apparently originated with the Party of God faction that was reportedly holding the four missing hostages and that was evidently fearful of American military reprisals against it once all the hostages from Trans World Airlines Flight 847 were released. **********''There may be other factors at work here,'' said one Middle East specialist. ''But the Hezbollah people seem clearly to be scared. And there does seem to be a linkage between the President's comments and their holding up on the four hostages. The Hezbollah are holding up on those four hostages because they want some assurances there won't be retaliation, and this is forcing Nabih Berri to adopt that demand.'' **********Interest in Berri's Success **********Mr. Berri's hand is strengthened by the fact that the main outside powers close to the hostage crisis all have some political interest in his success, which they presume would add to his internal political authority at the expense of more radical rivals like the Party of God and a pro-Iranian faction within his own Amal movement. **********Syria is his principal outside political patron. The Israelis have been pleased to see his militia turn against the Palestinians and hopeful that he could keep Palestinian guerrillas out of south Lebanon. The United States, with a close channel to Mr. Berri through the United States Ambassador to Lebanon, Reginald Bartholomew, is reported to have encouraged him to step into the situation when the hijacked T.W.A. plane was brought to Beirut. **********But virtually all Administration officials acknowledged that his power has been limited by internal opposition and by the need to negotiate with his rivals to put together a deal for releasing the hostages. **********''There have been two bargaining situations, one inside and one outside,'' said one official today. ''The first is the one that goes on between Berri and the outside world. The other is the one that goes on between Berri and his own Shiite world in Lebanon.'' **********Mr. Berri inherited the problem of having to negotiate with rival factions the moment he offered to serve as a mediator on June 16, two days after the T.W.A. plane was hijacked on a flight from Athens to Rome. His mediation, one hostage told reporters today, was undertaken at the urging of the United States Ambassador. **********Several Factions Are Involved **********In the first place, officials here noted, the three original gunmen had no political connections to Mr. Berri's Amal militia but were drawn from the Party of God and possibly also from the pro-Iranian radical faction of Amal. **********From accounts of more than 100 released passengers and cabin crew members, American officials learned that as soon as the hijacked plane first landed in Beirut on June 14 another dozen or more armed gunmen, representing at least three rival factions of Lebanese Shiites, boarded the aircraft and helped guard the hostages. Because all three had custody of the hostages, all three were part of the political bargaining for their release, officials here say. **********For the Reagan Administration, the physical control of the hostages has been a critical and delicate element in the effort to arrange their release. Only gradually was Mr. Berri able to assert increasing access and control of the hostages by his own militia. **********Last Tuesday night, the T.W.A. hostages were gathered in one group for an inspection visit by two representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. But American officials said that was apparently a special occasion and that normally the hostages were split up in several groups and scattered in the south Beirut area, at least until late Friday. **********In his own public comments during the negotiations this past week, Mr. Berri made it clear that his relatively moderate faction of the Amal militia does not have physical control of the 39 Americans involved in the T.W.A. hijacking, let alone seven other Americans who disappeared or were taken captive previously and whose release Secretary of State George P. Shultz demanded on Wednesday. **********'This Is Not My Problem' **********''I don't have control for the 39 but I have responsibility,'' Mr. Berri said in an American television interview broadcast Friday. ''About the seven, I don't have any interfere. This is not my problem.'' **********Moreover, when most of the hostages gathered for a feast Friday night to celebrate what they thought was their approaching release, some were missing, foreshadowing the problems that arose this morning when they were all to be moved to Syria. **********Because of the connections of some of the radical Shiite factions to Iran, Administration officials have been on the lookout for any evidence that the Iranian Government was trying to influence or block the negotiations. **********Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, has asserted that the hijacking plot was set in motion by the Iranian Government, that one of the hijackers had been trained recently in Iran and that the Iranian Martyrs' Foundation had passed $32 million to the Party of God leaders last month, a figure his office reduced today to $3.2 million. **********Administration specialists have seen links between Iran and some elements involved in the hijacking but are skeptical that Iran originated the plot or is manipulating a key faction of the hijackers. ''The elements involved in this hijacking have Iranian connections,'' said one government official. ''But we don't have specific evidence that Iran said, 'Go ahead on this.' '' **********In contrast, the Administration has been banking heavily not only on Mr. Berri but on Syria's influence both with him and with other Shiite elements, largely because Syria has an estimated 30,000 troops in Lebanon and physical control over the Baalbek region, where the most radical Shiite groups have their headquarters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/business/ford-matches-7.9-gm-rate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORD MATCHES 7.9% G.M.

More than 700,000 people, including prominent government officials and business executives, are expected to attend the show. **********There will be about 1,000 exhibitors from 32 countries besides the United States, including the Soviet Union. The Paris police are responsible for the security of the perimeter of the show but each exhibitor is responsible for security within its pavilion or chalet. **********The embassy message warned that certain terrorist groups, notably the Red Army Faction, Action Direct, Cellules Communistes Combattantes and the Portuguese FP-25 have been ''outspokenly opposed to what they called ''Western imperialism,'' the aerospace industries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********Previously, the message said, an explosion ripped through the Marseilles International Trade Fair in September 1983, killing one man and wounding 26 people. ''The bombing was claimed by four terrorist groups, including the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction,'' it said. **********Terrorist Attack in Lisbon **********Last March, 10 terrorists entered the Lisbon Trade Fair, incapacitated an armed police officer and killed an exhibitor while visitors were kept at bay by the terrorists' weapons. **********''What should be observed is how easy it was to accomplish the mission,'' the embassy message said. ''Bombs and armed gunmen and gunwomen are the primary methods used in terrorist attacks.'' **********A copy of the message was obtained by The Armed Forces Journal, a monthly magazine circulating in the military industry. An article on the terrorist threat in Paris will appear in its June issue, an advance copy of which was made available. **********List Found in Police Raid **********The embassy message, written April 15, said the names of the four American companies on the Red Army Faction's hit list ''surfaced during a police raid.'' **********A spokesman for Boeing said ''we take it seriously'' but had no comment on what precautions would be taken. **********At Hughes Aircraft, a spokesman also said the message was being taken seriously and that Hughes executives, employees and guests in Paris would be advised to ''keep a low profile.'' **********A spokesman for Lockheed said security planning for the company's exhibit had begun before the message was received. ''We do have considerably more security than in years past when the main concern was gate-crashers and drunks,'' he said. **********At Northrop, a spokesman said the company had been apprised of the embassy's message but said, ''We don't comment on matters pertaining to security.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/12/business/union-pact-at-big-board.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Union Pact At Big Board", "print_headline": "Union Pact At Big Board", "body_text": " **********The union representing New York Stock Exchange workers called off a scheduled strike yesterday morning after all-night negotiations with a Federal mediator produced a tentative new contract.

That compared with a loss of $1.16 billion in 1983, when the company was shutting down outmoded capacity and streamlining operations. **********Analysts Less Pleased **********The company expressed satisfaction with the results, but analysts were less pleased with the fourth- quarter performance, pointing out that extraordinary items such as a profit from the sale of assets buoyed the bottom line. **********David M. Roderick, chairman and chief executive, said the 1984 results were achieved ''despite a soft market for steel and lower prices in the petroleum industry.'' **********''It was a much better report than we were able to make a year ago,'' he added. ''And yet it seems that the painful decisions of 1983 were partly responsible for the better showing in 1984.'' **********Sales for 1984 totaled $19.1 billion, up from $17.5 billion in 1983. For the quarter, sales equaled the $4.7 billion recorded in the 1983 period. **********On a per share basis in the fourth quarter, U.S. Steel showed a loss of 1 cent a common share after providing for preferred stock dividends. **********The $29 million reported income in the quarter was after an extraordinary gain of $42 million from the repurchase of debt. Without that the quarter would have shown a $13 million loss. **********Other Gains **********In addition, there was a $68 million favorable impact from inventory liquidations and a $31 million gain from the sale of barge lines and other assets, a total of $99 million. **********''They lost a lot of money in the fourth quarter which they didn't identify,'' said Charles A. Bradford, a steel analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''Tack on the $99 million to the $13 million and they really had a net loss of $112 million.'' **********John C. Tumazos of Oppenheimer & Company said that one surprise was the size of the company's oil exploration expense in the fourth quarter. ''We knew the barges were sold,'' he said, ''we knew about the bonds being repurchased and knew there would be a LIFO inventory credit of some magnitude. We didn't know how bigger the exploration expense was going to be.'' **********The exploration expense at the company's Marathon Oil unit in the quarter soared to $119 million, compared with $69 million in the period a year earlier. **********Steel Called Disappointing **********As for steel operations, Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said she was disappointed. Steel and related resources, including coal operations, showed an operating loss for the quarter of $27 million, as opposed to operating earnings of $249 million from oil and gas. The steel loss was ''much higher than I was looking for,'' she said. **********At a news conference in Pittsburgh, Mr. Roderick called the fourth quarter ''harsh'' for steel and said that orders have improved since. **********Mr. Bradford said he was estimating U.S. Steel's 1985 earnings at $5 a share, ''including asset sales, a big recovery in steel and not very strong oil results.'' **********Other analysts are also looking for a pickup in the steel business later this year. **********U.S. Steel said that for the full year, its steel and related resources produced an operating profit of $142 million, or $12 a ton, in 1984, with steel shipments increasing to 11.8 million tons, from 11 million in 1983, when the company lost $55 a ton. In that year the operating loss was $610 million. **********Loss on Steel **********Mr. Bradford said that the company lost $10.70 a ton in the fourth quarter, however. ''They don't say that the fourth quarter was a catastrophe,'' he added, speaking of steel operations. **********Mr. Roderick said that steel operations improved for the full year ''despite a flood of steel imports.'' He said that for the first 11 months of 1984, imports took more than 26 percent of the domestic market. **********He said the Government's program to reduce steel imports to 18.5 percent of the market for the next five years must be ''closely monitored and vigorously enforced'' if the domestic industry is to benefit. **********For the full year, net financial results included gains on the sale of assets of $265 million as well as extraordinary gains of $79 million net of tax on the repurchase of debt securities. Partly offsetting those gains were $47 million in losses from a Canadian mining operation and an oil and gas drilling and exploration company,"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/06/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1985-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   People", "body_text": " **********Joseph M.

His status has remained a mystery since. **********Earlier this year he was said to have been named head of the Warsaw Pact forces, but that has not been confirmed. More recently he has been been said to command a newly formed Soviet western theater of operations. Last month the current Chief of Staff, Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, said Marshal Ogarkov held a senior position and commands troops. **********WANTED PALESTINIAN.

What happened to the 3-day-old baby taken at gunpoint from her mother's arms on Oct. 20 outside Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn? **********The police are seeking a woman described as 25 to 30 years old, Hispanic, about 5 feet 1 inch tall, with bleached blond hair who abducted Marlene Santana. But the trail is cold. ''We're getting few calls from the public - not even the usual crank calls,'' a police supervisor said. ''It's almost as if the baby never was.'' **********STOLEN MASTERPIECES. What happened to the nine major Impressionist paintings stolen at gunpoint from the Marmottan Museum in Paris on Oct. 27? **********The paintings, including five Monets and two Renoirs, have not been found. Since ransom is the motive for many major art thefts, it is a leading theory in this case. Yet the museum was not insured - a fact that the thieves may not have known - thus making ransom for insurance impossible. Another theory is that the works were stolen on commission by a private art collector. But experts say this is most unlikely. A third theory - backed by some because of the show of force and swift professionalism of the thieves - is that the works were stolen by terrorists who hope to use them as bargaining chips."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/world/pole-gets-asylum-in-denmark.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLE GETS ASYLUM IN DENMARK", "print_headline": "POLE GETS ASYLUM IN DENMARK", "body_text": " **********Justice Minister Erik Ninn-Hansen of Denmark announced today that Jozef Zimnicki, a member of the Polish Communist Central Committee, had been given political asylum. **********Mr. Zimnicki, a steelworker who arrived in February with his wife and two other relatives by Baltic Sea ferry from Swinouscie, Poland, had been put on the Central Committee under the military regime in 1981. **********Western diplomats and Polish political sources in Warsaw said he was a member of the hard-line Katowice Forum faction of the party, which sought more orthodox rule than provided by the military Government of Gen.

They said those steps include accommodating blacks in the political system. **********Warning the Government against entering ''a state of siege'' in response to political pressures, the organizations, both black and white, said political stability coupled with reasonable after-tax returns was of major concern to both foreign and domestic investors. **********Response to Trading Halt **********''The critical problems facing South Africa in these areas cannot be resolved by retreating into economic isolationism and a controlled economy,'' the organizations said in their response to the suspension of trading on foreign exchange and stock markets in South Africa. **********The trading halt, which is to end Monday, was a reaction to pressures by foreign banks for repayment of loans now considered too risky to extend. Economists said such demands, coupled with the threat of a black miners' strike Sunday, constituted a severe threat to the South African economy, which had just begun to recover from three years of recession. [Page A13.]  To seek help in the repayment crisis, the head of the South African Reserve Bank, Gerhard de Kock, will travel to the United States Friday. Because of the political implications, his mission may embarrass such institutions as the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund. [Page A13.]  Increasing Criticism The four organizations that issued the statement today are the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa, the National African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the South African Federated Chamber of Industries and the Urban Foundation. They have been increasingly critical of the Government's political policies amid the continuing unrest. **********While the organizations include some Afrikaner companies, they are overwhelmingly English-speaking. The group does not include the American Chamber of Commerce, which belongs to a separate organization. **********South Africans of British descent tend to be less committed to the racial policy of apartheid than the Afrikaners, who are descended from the original Dutch settlers and furnish the support for the governing party. **********The long statement today represents an attempt both to nudge Pretoria toward peaceful negotiation with its opponents and to lobby for the coalition's particular prescription for normalization of the economy. **********''Our survival depends on making the necessary structural changes to uphold the political, social and economic values pursued by our major trading partners which represent, in essence, the great democracies of the world,'' the statement said. ''Should we fail to do so, investors and traders will increasingly shy away from South Africa without any formal laws forcing them to do so. **********''The politics of negotiation apart, the organizations have serious misgivings about a possible negative economic policy reaction by the domestic authorities to the pressures which currently abound,'' the statement said. ''Organized business would seriously warn against the danger of the country entering a state of siege in response to the threat of local boycotts, trade union strikes and stayaways and international sanctions and disinvestment. **********''Extended use of direct controls and rationing devices in the areas of foreign exchange, imports, prices and wages will fundamentally reverse the current trend away from bureaucratic intervention in private business decision making,'' the statement continued. ''In addition, the loss of direct access to international markets, finance and technological transfer will lead inexorably to a decline in international competitiveness.'' **********Business Organizations Gain **********Political analysts say organized business has increasingly flexed its political muscle during the Government of President P. W. Botha. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Botha has encouraged business to involve itself in politics and has sought business endorsement for moves that he wished to make, these analysts said. Although the business community is now involved, it is apparent from the statement today that the involvement is not necessarily in the way the President had hoped. **********The group's comments do, however, reflect the currrent attitude among many in the South African business community after Tuesday's suspension of trading on financial markets. While many business executives welcomed the move as necessary to gain time to devise new strategies, they nonetheless linked any real betterment of the economy to reduction in the current political instability. **********At the same time, several expressed anxiety over the uncertainty surrounding the measures the Government might put into effect, and said the authorities had failed to carve out a clear economic path for the nation. Some also criticized as selfish and short-sighted the pressure by foreign banks on local borrowers for immediate repayment of short-term debts. **********Mirroring in some ways the sentiments of the commerce and industry groups, Gavin Relly, chairman of the Anglo American Corporation, the giant South African mining and industrial concern, said any economic measures that the authorities might introduce ''will have no more than a short- to medium-term effect unless they are also accompanied by a new political dispensation.'' Above all, he said, it was necessary for the Government to enter into real negotiations with representatives of all groups in South Africa for a ''new political system of genuine power sharing.'' **********Citing what they said was the Government's fundamental commitment to securing a new constitutional dispensation through negotiation, the business organizations set out various recommendations. Most notable were lifting the state of emergency imposed last month, setting an agenda for formal talks with blacks and negotiating with leaders in the black community, even those currently in detention, such as the jailed nationalist leader Nelson Mandela. **********If the Government instead reacts to political pressures with a siege mentality, the group said, it will be treating ''symptoms rather than causes.'' **********Economic Implications **********The statement said: ''The panoply of discretionary government control which it implies will lead over time to lower standards of living for all South Africans, depressed average rates of growth, a poor investment climate leading to little new domestic investment, coupled with limited entry of new entrepreneurs into the economy, especially of small businesses, whether black or white, a high rate of unemployment, strong inflationary pressures.'' **********The group said it would remain heavily involved in exploring various constitutional options and an urbanization policy aimed at creating a substantial number of jobs, and an end to laws that control the influx of blacks into urban areas. In addition, the statement said the individual groups would work to develop fair policy guidelines for privatization, deregulation and the formation of formal and informal business enterprises. **********Among other efforts, the group said it would also move to eliminate roadblocks to blacks gaining citizenship. Political analysts say that, while organized business has come out in favor of major reforms, it has stopped short of demanding a political system of one man, one vote, fearing that such a system would lead to revolution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/business/unilever-increases-offer-for-vicks-to-60-a-share.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1985-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNILEVER INCREASES OFFER FOR VICKS TO $60 A SHARE", "print_headline": "UNILEVER INCREASES OFFER FOR VICKS TO $60 A SHARE", "body_text": " **********In an 11th-hour attempt to rescue its offer for Richardson-Vicks Inc., Unilever N.V. raised by $4 a share the price it would pay for the Wilton, Conn., consumer products company. **********The new $60-a-share offer, which would amount to a total price of about $900 million, comes after Richardson-Vicks has waged a determined campaign to turn away Unilever, the giant British-Dutch concern. **********Wall Street sources called Unilever's action highly unusual. It is the second time the company has raised the ante with no sign of other bidders. **********The sources said the higher bid was apparently intended to increase public pressure on Richardson-Vicks's board and bring the company to the negotiating table. **********One of Unilever's biggest problems, however, is that the list of outsiders who own Richardson-Vicks stock is shrinking dramatically. **********Besides authorizing a preferred class of stock with super voting powers, Richardson-Vicks, along with the founding Richardson family, has been actively repurchasing company shares in the open market. **********The legality of the preferred stock was challenged by Unilever, and a Federal court in New York listened to arguments yesterday on whether the move should be stopped. **********Richardson-Vicks said this week it had repurchased five million of its shares and had authorized the acquisition of another two million. **********Family Also Stockpiling **********Meanwhile, members of the Richardson family and trusts they control also have been stockpiling shares. More important, however, is that, as the company acquires and retires the stock it purchases, the voting power of the family increases. **********In the latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Richardson family members said they own 6.41 million shares, or 36.2 percent, of shares outstanding. **********But after Richardson-Vicks acquires the other two million shares, the family's holdings will bulge to around 41 percent of all shares, which then will stand at about 15 million. **********The block of friendly votes amassed by Richardson-Vicks could become an impenetrable obstacle for Unilever, especially since the company already has a staggered 16-member board of directors and requires the approval of two-thirds of its shareholders to effect a merger, according to Wall Street sources. **********The sources say the best Unilever could hope for in an unfriendly tender offer would be to capture enough shares to elect a class of directors in each of the next three years. But this would prevent Unilever from gaining ultimate control of the company until 1987, when it finally would have a majority of the board seats. **********Unilever's move was intended to be an olive branch, according to one Wall Street source familiar with the situation. He believes Unilever is sending out the message, ''Let's sit down and be gentlemen, and let bygones by bygones.'' **********In its brief news release issued yesterday morning, Unilever's United States subsidiary said that the company ''reaffirmed its desire to meet with Richardson-Vicks at any time.'' **********Richardson-Vicks did not comment on the new offer, but sources said the company is unlikely to be swayed. A particular sticking point for Richardson-Vicks, the sources said, is that Unilever continued its threat to pay only $48 a share for Richardson-Vicks stock if the bid does not receive the backing of the company's board. **********Wall Street reacted favorably to Unilever's move, pushing the price of Richardson-Vicks stock $5.50 higher, to $53.125, in active trading of 1.7 million shares. **********Traders said the stock also rose because speculators felt that if the court should rule against the issuance of the preferred stock, the company and the Richardson family might be forced to re-evaluate Unilever's bid or seek the help of a friendly bidder. **********There was also the hope on Wall Street, traders said, that Unilever might get even more generous if Richardson-Vicks agreed to negotiate. That view, however, was dealt a blow by a source familiar with Unilever. **********'The Top Offer' **********''It's the top offer,'' he said, adding that the European company ''really wants to put its best bid on the table'' before Richardson-Vicks takes other actions to make it less attractive. **********Unilever can also afford to raise the price it is offering because it now has to buy fewer Richardson-Vicks shares, thanks to the company's own stock repurchases. The $56-a-share offer was made when Richardson-Vicks still had 23 million shares outstanding and would have cost Unilever as much as $1.35 billion. **********The other side of the equation, however, is that, should Unilever prevail, it would assume a sizable amount of debt, generated by Richardson-Vicks's stock-repurchase program. **********Meanwhile, Unilever is believed to be among the companies invited to make an offer for the General Foods Corporation, but a source familiar with Unilever said such an acquisition might be too expensive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/13/business/business-people-port-authority-names-maritime-unit-director.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Port Authority Names Maritime Unit Director", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Port Authority Names Maritime Unit Director", "body_text": " **********James J.

''Typically, in cross-ownership cases, the company has been given a year to divest,'' said William Russell, a spokesman for the F.C.C. **********Allowed to Keep WPIX-TV **********The rule came into effect in 1975; because The Daily News in New York owned WPIX-TV, Channel 11, before that, it was allowed to retain ownership. **********Mr. Murdoch, who earlier said that he expected to have two years to make a choice between The Post and WNEW-TV, said yesterday that he was examining his options. He is reportedly seeking a waiver of the rule. In the past, however, a divesture has always been required. ''No company or individual has ever been allowed to keep both,'' Mr. Russell said. **********Mr. Murdoch's two other New York-based publications, The Village Voice and New York magazine, would not be affected by the Metromedia purchases because they are weeklies. However, a prospectus for the sale of The Voice was drawn up on Friday, setting a minimum price of $55 million, which would help finance the purchase of the Metromedia stations. Rivals Called Likely Buyers: Members of the newspaper industry and analysts suggested that the likeliest buyers of The Post are the publishers of its competition, the Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News, and the Times-Mirror Corporation, which owns Newsday. Newsday, which is based on Long Island, introduced a New York edition in 1983. **********In the event of the acquisition by the Tribune Company or the Times-Mirror Corporation, The Post's printing plant and business operations might be combined with those of the rival tabloid, industry analysts speculated. Alternatively, The Post might be bought and shut down altogether. ''I'm not sure what the incentive would be for a merger,'' said Bruce Thorp, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a Washington-based investment company. ''A joint operation doesn't strike me as very plausible.'' **********However, some analysts suggested that Mr. Murdoch would be unwilling to sell to the Tribune Company, a longtime rival. Spokesmen for both the Tribune Company and the Times-Mirror Corporation declined to comment. **********The Post had been gaining circulation since it was acquired by Mr. Murdoch in 1976, but has been down by 100,000 copies daily in the last two years. Daily circulation dropped by 60,000 copies, or 6.4 percent, to 901,313, between April 1, 1984, and last March 31, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. **********In the same period, the circulation of The Daily News rose 1.2 percent, to 1,390,955, and The New York Times's daily circulation increased by 4.4 percent, to 1,013,211. Newsday's circulation grew by 9,000 daily copies, or 1.6 percent, to 542,073. That included about 45,000 copies of the New York edition. **********Amid speculation that the paper might be closed, the mood in The Post's newsroom was gloomy yesterday. ''People are worried about what's going to happen,'' one longtime reporter said. He noted that The Post's financial straits had provoked periodic rumors that the paper would shut down, ''but this is a different kind of pressure,'' he added. **********Indifference at The Voice **********Staff members at The Voice, which has kept its liberal-to-radical politics through several changes of ownership, expressed indifference to the speculation on the sale of their publication. ''The integrity of The Voice depends on the belief that all the owners come from Office Temporaries,'' said Jack Newfield, a senior editor who has been at The Voice since 1964 under four owners. **********Mr. Murdoch also owns some weekly newspapers in Houston, the home of another of the Metromedia stations. As weeklies, however, they are exempt from the F.C.C. rule. As for New York magazine, ''it is not for sale,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch. **********Under the F.C.C. rule, if Mr. Murdoch decides to keep WFLD-TV, Metromedia's Chicago station, he would have to sell The Sun-Times, which he acquired in January 1984 for about $100 million. As of March 31, the daily circulation of The Sun-Times was 639,187, up 1.7 percent from the year before but still below its 1983 circulation. **********The Sun-Times was marginally profitable when it was acquired and is still thought to be making money. If the paper goes on the block, according to Mr. Thorp, possible bidders might include the Sun Publishing Corporation of Canada, which expressed interest in the paper before Mr. Murdoch bought it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/27/world/alberta-premier-quits-as-head-of-governing-party.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALBERTA PREMIER QUITS AS HEAD OF GOVERNING PARTY", "print_headline": "ALBERTA PREMIER QUITS AS HEAD OF GOVERNING PARTY", "body_text": " **********The Premier of Alberta resigned today as head of the province's governing Progressive Conservative Party, a step likely to lead to his departure as government leader as early as September. **********The Premier, Peter Lougheed, 56 years old, had served as head of the party for 20 years and as Premier for 14. Political observers say they expect his resignation to lead to a hotly contested leadership convention in early fall followed by an election before the end of the year. **********The Conservatives hold 75 of 79 seats in the Alberta legislature. When Mr. Lougheed first assumed the party leadership, they held none. **********Ending of an Era **********His resignation marks another step in closing an era in Canadian politics. First, Pierre Eliott Trudeau, a Liberal and a bitter foe of Mr. Lougheed over such issues as energy prices, resigned as Prime Minister in February 1984. **********Then, William G. Davis resigned as Premier of Ontario last October, beginning a process leading to an election that toppled the Conservatives after nearly 42 years in power. His successor, David Peterson, a Liberal, was sworn in as head of a minority government today. **********Last week, Rene Levesque, Premier of Quebec since 1976, resigned, sparking a leadership battle and a likely election this fall. **********All these men dominated their generation of Canadian politics, an era that saw the second largest country in the world struggle to find a more commodious way to stay united as a single country. Just as Mr. Levesque tested the limits of provincial political autonomy, Mr. Lougheed pressed what he viewed as Alberta's economic rights. **********The province, with a population of 2.3 million, produces nearly 90 percent of Canada's oil and gas. Under Mr. Lougheed's leadership, it amassed a provincial trust fund from oil royalties valued at more than $10 billion. **********Fought Trudeau Plan **********In particular, Mr. Lougheed strenouously fought Mr. Trudeau's 1981 program of exerting more federal control over energy pricing and production. In the most bitter stages of the debate, he ordered oil companies to reduce their oil production to put pressure on Ottawa. **********The Alberta Premier was successful in forcing Mr. Trudeau's government to make several concessions. His energy victory was complete with the election of a Tory Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, who earlier this year removed most of the other energy policies to which Alberta objected, including a tax on oil and gas revenues at the wellhead. **********Mr. Lougheed was also successful in beating back a Trudeau plan to return Canada's Constitution from London. He rallied support from other provinces to require provincial consent to any such move. **********Recently, he has been devoting his attention to Alberta's future. He has produced a white paper on industrial and science strategy for the province, pushed back-to-basics education and become a leading proponent of a Canadian free-trade pact with the United States. **********Many officials say they expect Mr. Lougheed to go into private business, although rumors have been common in Alberta that he might be offered the ambassadorship to the United States.

Federal Reserve data showing a small $100 million increase in the nation's money supply, to $577.8 billion in the week ended May 13, had little effect on trading, as market participants expect that any adjustments to the Fed's monetary policy will be based on economic conditions, not money supply. **********''The market is in a period of consolidation, with no major moves expected until more is known about the economy and the Fed's response to the economic numbers,'' said Keith Jarrett, an economist at the Technical Data Corporation. Opinions circulating on Wall Street now range from forecasts of a recession, with additional declines in interest rates, to forecasts of a substantial economic rebound, with rising rates later this year. **********With no major economic releases yesterday, and very light trading activity, some analysts attributed the erratic movements in Treasury issues to developments in the House of Representatives, where legislators finally agreed on a budget package that could shrink the 1986 deficit by $56 billion but is significantly different from the Senate budget package. **********''The House budget agreement is a plus for the market, I guess,'' one government securities dealers said, emphasising the ''guess.'' Like other observers of the budget debate, he was glad to see progress on reducing the deficit, but was concerned that the differences between the House of Representatives plan and Senate plan would lead to fierce negotiations that could produce a deficit reduction in the fiscal year 1986 of less than the advertised $56 billion. **********Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank, said that even if Congress agreed on a package to cut $56 million from the fiscal year 1986 deficit, ''a weaker economy will keep the deficit high.'' He estimated that the fiscal 1986 deficit might still be near $200 billion if the economy expands at only a 2 percent rate next year. ''The housing industry will benefit from lower interst rates, but I don't see rate declines of one percentage point or even two pecentage points being enough to spark a new surge of business and consumer spending.'' **********Treasury bill traders said their market was briefly distorted by rumors - later denied - that banks in Argentina were to be nationalized. Three-month Treasury bills fell to a low of about 7.14 percent, before rising to about 7.23 percent late in the day. **********Among longer-term Treasury issues, the new 9 1/8 percent notes due in two-years were offered late in the day at 99 29/32, to yield about 9.18 percent, down from an average price at Wednesday's auction of more than 99 31/32, to yield 9.13 percent. In advance of next Wednesday's auction of new five-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the issue on a when-issued basis, to yield about 10.09 percent, down from 10.13 percent. **********In the long-term bond market, the 11 1/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2015 rose about 1/4 point, to an offered price of 103 2/32, to yield 10.89 percent. **********Although the $100 million rise in the nation's basic money supply leaves it well above the Fed's growth target of 4 percent to 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, economists said that money supply developments were not guiding monetary policy. **********''There is a clear division between economic data, which has been weak, and money supply growth, which has been pretty robust,'' said Raymond Stone, chief of financial economics for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''For now, the Fed is telling us that their greatest emphasis is on economic data.'' **********Mr. Stone added that the Fed might begin paying more attention to rapid money supply growth if it was matched by a rise in economic activity. From January through April, Fed data show that the M-1 money supply measure, consisting of currency and all kinds of checking accounts, grew at an 8.7 percent rate, while the economy grew at a much slower 6.3 percent rate, or only seven-tenths of 1 percent after inflation. **********In the two weeks ending Wednesday, borrowings at the Fed discount window averaged $1.07 billion, excluding extended loans to troubled institutions.

Spot market oil prices fell and, in a rapid domino effect, the value of the British pound tumbled, British bank interest rates climbed and share prices on the London stock market plunged. **********'Spoiling the Market' **********In a bitter outburst before reporters this evening, Egypt's oil minister, Abdul Hadi Kandhil, one of four non- OPEC ministers sitting in on the discussions, accused OPEC of ''spoiling the market'' by depressing oil prices through its show of disunity. **********In a lonesome sign of unison, the ministers did approve an auditing company to oversee the group's drastic plan to monitor its production and pricing policies. The proposal was endorsed in principle a month ago. **********Indonesia's oil minister and the conference chairman, Subroto, told reporters following this evening's closed meeting that the ministers discussed two proposals to narrow the $4 gap between OPEC's official prices for its grades of Arabian Light and the lower-priced heavy crude oil. Improved refinery techniques and lower oil prices have increased demand for heavy crude oils, putting suppliers of the traditionally more desirable light crudes at a disadvantage. **********Nigeria, he said, suggested narrowing the price spread to $2, while Saudi Arabia proposed a reduction to $2.90. **********Oil industry officials observing the meeting voiced skepticism that any adjustment could have a lasting effect in supporting oil prices, since even after changes of the magnitude discussed, spot, or noncontract, price levels would remain several dollars below OPEC's official prices. **********Detailed designs for achieving the cuts were leaked to reporters throughout the day, but Subroto emphasized that no agreement had been reached on the issue or on the key question of whether to leave untouched OPEC's benchmark price of $29 for a barrel of Arabian Light crude. **********Resisted by Several Members **********Earlier in the day, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, emphasized that the $29 price was ''not sacred.'' But several members, including Algeria and Iran, continued to staunchly resist any change. **********Spot market prices weakened further today. Prices for North Sea crude oil, for February and March delivery, dropped by 30 to 50 cents a barrel in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, traders there said. Those decreases will put more pressure on the British National Oil Corporation to cut the prices it will charge suppliers for crude they have supplied since Jan. 1. **********A remark by Nigeria's oil minister, Tam David-West, at this morning's meeting nearly broke up the gathering a little more than an hour after it began. What exactly the Nigerian minister said was not disclosed, but he later said that one of his comments was ''misunderstood.'' He said the comment referred to a market report presented by the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba. Sheik Otaiba burst out of the meeting visibly angered, and asserted as he left the Inter-Continental Hotel, surrounded by bodyguards, that Mr. David-West ''is stabbing OPEC in the back.'' **********Accusation on Output **********He accused Nigeria of producing 1.7 million barrels a day of crude oil, well above its quota of 1.54 million barrels under the OPEC production ceiling, and said Nigeria was ''undermining the pricing structure.'' He was later persuaded to rejoin the conference, but that came after reports of the incident had done their damage on oil and financial markets. **********Sheik Yamani, a champion of the auditing plan, said OPEC would sign a contract with an auditor this week and the work of auditing would commence in February. Industry sources said the lucrative contract for on-site inspection of all 13 members' production, pricing and exports was expected to go to the Amsterdam-based accounting company of Klynveld- Kraayenhof."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/27/world/plo-sends-arms-arafat-says.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 309, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.L.O.

The place was the conference hall of the Westpark-Best Western Motel at Tyson's Corner, Va., about 10 miles from downtown Washington. **********Dark suits were pressed and shoes polished to a high luster as more than 200 software engineers, systems programmers, electronic data processors and other high-tech job-seekers distributed resumes to smiling personnel officers manning booths labeled IBM, TRW, Rockwell, Advanced Technology Systems and Planning Research Corporation. **********This sort of fair is becoming a regular occurence in the Washington suburbs, particularly on the Virginia side of the Potomac, as dozens of high-tech companies, some of them newly located near the nation's capital, vie for skilled electronics workers in a city whose work force has been dominated by Government employees, lobbyists and consultants. **********''It's as if you were being auctioned off like so much meat,'' said R. Hawkins Dale, a recent Harvard graduate who has trained himself in ''C'' language, the hottest of the computer languages, and is planning to transfer to Washington from Charlottesville, Va. ''They were actually making money offers, and asking when you could start,'' he said. **********Mr. Dale, who is now contemplating three job offers, is among the tens of thousands of high-tech workers attracted to Washington in recent years as the city takes on a new complexity and a new reputation. Quite aside from its historic role as the Federal capital, the Washington metropolitan area is emerging as an industrial center, a sort of Silicon Valley of the East, as dozens of technology companies move into the outlying Virginia and Maryland suburbs. Most of the newcomers are involved in designing and developing new electronic components; some also do manufacturing, and a number have established headquarters here. **********The Planning Research Corporation, for one, moved its corporate headquarters here from Los Angeles in 1977. It now employs 2,600 persons - about one-third of its worldwide labor force - in its McLean, Va., plant, where engineers design and develop computer systems. **********The dramatic change partly reflects the desire of many corporations to wield greater influence in the scramble for Federal contracts, particularly the big contracts of the Reagan years. The military budget, for example, doubled, to an estimated $270 billion, in the fiscal year 1985, from $135 billion in 1980. Over the same period, contract officers increased their purchases from the Washington economy to $8 billion worth of goods and services from $4 billion. **********''We've found it an excellent place to grow,'' said William H. Borten, president of the Atlantic Research Corporation, which has a solid-propellent rocket manufacturing plant in Gainesville, Va., about 35 miles from downtown Washington, and makes cases for rockets in Alexandria. It also operates a major data communications division here, accounting for 25 percent of its business. **********Many technology-based companies - the computer services arms of Litton and Boeing, for example - operate the computer systems of such government agencies as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture and Labor. **********And lately the high-tech cluster has gotten big enough to develop what many here refer to as critical mass -meaning that the companies not only sell to the Government, but sell to each other as well. **********A. William Perigard, president of Comsat Technology Products Inc., said that 90 percent of its business is with the other communications companies in the region. Comsat is primarily a manufacturer of satellite communications equipment, which it sells to such carriers as Satellite Business Systems, MCI and RCA, all with operations here. Comsat came here in 1980 with about 25 people. Now it has more than 400 employees and is still growing rapidly. **********''The Washington metropolitan area is becoming the systems level communication center of the U.S.,'' Mr. Perigard said. The Federal Government's own requirements for military communications and for keeping in touch with other capitals has spurred much of the demand for communications services. THE National Institutes of Health has become another big source of revenue, paying out more than $130 million a year to local companies. Because the N.I.H. is in Maryland's Montgomery County, biomedical industries tend to cluster there. Companies that cater to the military are more likely to set up in Virginia, close to the Pentagon. **********One side effect of the growth in technology business and services is that Washington now leads the country in the number of scientists and engineers holding doctoral degrees: There are more than 18,000 - almost twice the number living in Boston or Los Angeles. And the city is enjoying low unemployment and continuing prosperity. Its per capita income in 1983, the latest period for which figures are available, was $16,173, far above the $11,687 figure for the nation as a whole. **********''Here you have this tremendous linkage with the Federal Government, which not only buys equipment, but finances research into applications of known technology,'' said Gail Garfield Schwartz, a development economist who last year published an extensive report on the region, commissioned by the Greater Washington Research Center. Developing new technological applications ''creates widespread and continuous job growth,'' she said, ''and you don't have to be a Ph.D. in electronic engineering to benefit. The vast majority of these jobs will be available to normal people. These are the factory jobs of the future.'' **********The stream of newcomers shows no sign of slowing. For instance, Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of General Motors, this month begins construction on a 202-acre site near Dulles International Airport. **********According to estimates by city and county governments, 1,200 technology-oriented companies, employing about 105,000 persons, are established in the 4,000 square miles that comprise the Washington metropolitan area, a region that embraces five counties in Virginia, five in Maryland as well as the District of Columbia. **********That's about half the number employed in California's Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, the biggest of the high-technology clusters that have sprung up in recent years around such other cities as Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Denver. **********Employment in the Washington area has risen steadily, even as the Reagan Administration has cut back Government jobs. Over the last five years the private sector has increased its employment by nearly 300,000, to 1.34 million workers, even though Federal employment has contracted by nearly 20,000, to 360,000. ''That's a nice healthy growth,'' observed Dick Groner, director of labor market information of the District of Columbia's Department of Employment Services. **********The Beltway, I-495, is the principal artery connecting the contract givers of the Pentagon, the National Institutes of Health and scores of other agencies with the companies - many of which go by a blend of alphabet-soup acronyms in towns like Tyson's Corner, McLean, or Reston, all in Fairfax County, and Wheaton or Gaithersburg in Montgomery County. ABOUT half the high-tech companies and half the employees are in Fairfax County, which until the mid-1970's was a sleepy Washington bedroom community. So far this year Fairfax has added 13,000 jobs. Unemployment in the Washington metropolitan area is 4.1 percent, but in Fairfax it is less than 3 percent. In California's Santa Clara County, which incorporates much of Silicon Valley, the rate is 6.1 percent. **********Silicon Valley, which manufactures semiconductors, the building blocks of computers, has recently been hard- pressed by competition from Japan. Nearly 6,000 jobs have been lost there since the start of the year. Its semiconductors are sensitive to foreign competition because they are highly labor-intensive, whereas more new chips are developed in Washington. **********''What we manufacture here are basically pre-production units with a high intellectual content, versus a high manufacturing-labor content in Silicon Valley,'' said Charles G. Gulledge, former chief executive of the Dynaelectron Corporation and now chairman of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority. ''They manufacture chips, we make them more intelligent.'' **********''But we're not a one-industry area a la Pittsburgh, Youngstown or Gary, Indiana,'' Mr. Gulledge continued. ''What has been happening here is truly balanced growth. We have structured a sound business environment that is a balance of public and private needs. We can't be totally dependent on defense requirements, because those go up and down with each Administration.'' **********Mrs. Schwartz surveyed 21 of the biggest companies in the region and found that 52 percent of their revenues were derived from the Federal Government and 41 percent from the private sector. Other customers were from state and local governments and foreign countries. **********Mrs. Schwartz, who in April was appointed to the New York State Public Service Commission, says that the private sector implantation that grew up around the capital is taking on a life of its own: **********''Firms can form consortia to bid on contracts. They can borrow, lend, or pirate personnel. As often happens on Federal service contracts, one firm can replace another as the contractor, but retain the expertise of those familiar with the job merely by hiring the employees already experienced with it.'' **********Partly for their predatory hiring practices, many of the smaller companies are known as ''Beltway bandits.'' The term, which is used almost affectionately, derives from a burglar who some years back commuted from break-in to break-in along the 66-mile freeway that rings the city. TO try to hold the high-technology lead, and insure an educated work force in the future, Fairfax County has opened the Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology in Annandale. This month a class of 360 entering freshmen began to use the school's five spanking new laboratories. The telecommunications lab includes a television station and control room, a radio station, a weather station and a satellite earth station and cost about $600,000. Local companies dug into their pockets to help pay for the new facilities. **********Secondary schools are not the only beneficiaries of the high-tech companies' largesse. George Mason University in Fairfax has just become the 12th university in the country to have a supercomputer center, joining such well-known names as M.I.T., Stanford and Princeton. The 28-year-old institution will use a $17 million Cray X-MP/24 supercomputer owned by Boeing Computer Services, which is granting time. The State of Virginia is also helping to fund the George Mason Center, in a program to transfer technology from university research laboratories to the local business community. The state views the project as a long-term investment in its own future, since the supercomputer center is expected to lure still more companies into the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/09/business/venture-capitalists-wary-of-tax-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1985-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VENTURE CAPITALISTS WARY OF TAX PLAN", "print_headline": "VENTURE CAPITALISTS WARY OF TAX PLAN", "body_text": " **********To America's entrepreneurs, the Treasury's tax simplification plan threatens to bring to an end the venture capital boom that has kept their cash-hungry businesses well nourished in the last several years. **********The fear in northern California's high-tech Sillicon Valley region - and in garages and basements across the country where upstart companies are born - is that, if the Treasury plan were accepted without modification, capital gains tax rates would rise. And venture capitalists contend that a low capital gains rate has been pivotal in attracting investors to what are inherently risky ventures. **********Earlier this week, the Treasury plan received a boost when Administration officials said that President Reagan would endorse a modified version of it. Even so, venture capitalists may receive a reprieve because one of the modifications under serious discussion is the continued preferential treatment of capital gains. **********Entrepreneurs, who represent the Apple Computers and the Federal Expresses of tomorrow, are lobbying to keep capital gains rates from going up. To them, the Treasury proposal to raise these rates evokes worrisome memories of the 1970's, when financial backers were nowhere to be found in the face of high capital gains taxes. **********'The Death Valley Days' **********''We call the '70's the Death Valley days for money going into the venture capital funding process,'' said Daniel T. Kingsley, executive director of the National Venture Capital Association, a Washington trade group. **********Venture capital - the lifeblood of these formative enterprises - virtually dried up after Congress raised the top capital gains tax rate in 1969 to 49 percent, from 25 percent. **********Not until the capital gains rate was cut in 1978 to 28 percent did venture capital start flowing again. After the 1981 Reagan tax cuts brought the rate down to 20 percent, the flow turned into a virtual flood. **********At present, 60 percent of the appreciated value of an investment held longer than six months can be excluded from taxes, which translates into a maximum tax rate of 20 percent on long-term capital gains. That is sharply below the top 50 percent rate on wages and other income. **********Under the Treasury plan, capital gains would no longer receive preferential tax treatment, but would be taxed the same as wages, at rates of up to 35 percent. The cost of the asset, however, would be adjusted for inflation, so investors would no longer be taxed on appreciation due to inflation. **********'Extremely Adverse' **********''The effect on venture capital would be extremely adverse,'' said Oscar S. Pollock, a partner at Ingalls & Snyder, a Wall Street securities firm. ''Venture capital would be hit the hardest of any sector of the investment spectrum, because there you are aiming for very large real gains.'' **********In the speculative world of venture capital, investors tend to invest in a number of companies, hoping that one or two will become big successes over the course of seven to ten years and more than offset the losses on the rest. The preferential tax treatment of their capital gain helps keep the after-tax reward attractive enough to be worth the risk and the long wait, Mr. Pollock said. **********As a result of the Treasury proposals, the venture capital community has once again been thrust to the forefront of the familiar debate, reignited by the Treasury plan, over whether special tax treatment of capital gains provides merely a windfall to wealthy investors, or a vital stimulus to investment. **********''One can say other factors were also involved, but the correlation between the capital gains rate reduction and the increase in commitments of venture capital money is unmistakable,'' Mr. Kingsley, the Washington trade group official, said. **********When the capital gains rate was raised in 1969, new private capital committed to venture capital companies plunged. It went from $171 million in 1969 to $97 million in 1970, to a scant $10 million in 1975, according to Venture Economics Inc., a research group. When the capital gains rate was cut in 1978, commitments jumped to $570 million, from $39 million in 1977. And after the 1981 Reagan cuts, committments surged to $1.8 billion in 1982 and $4.5 billion in 1983. **********Venture capitalists contend these figures demonstrate how critical the tax incentive is. **********''We were 36 hours away from bankruptcy in 1974,'' said Representative Edwin V.W. Zschau, a Republican from California who founded System Industries in 1968 and built the company into a $120 million-a-year computer data storage equipment manufacturer. ''It took me six months in 1974 to raise $750,000, and that was a drop in the bucket, but that was the way things were then.'' **********He added: ''In the early 1970's when my company was first getting off the ground, venture capital sources had pretty much dried up. What I did - and what so many other companies had to do - was to seek capital from foreign companies. But in order to get the money, we had to sell licenses or technology or go into joint ventures. Unfortunately, we sold a lot of our good stuff off.'' **********Incentive to Entrepreneurship **********Stanley E. Pratt, publisher of Venture Capital Journal, a trade publication, said preferential capital gains rates were essential to induce talented individuals to become entrepreneurs - as incentive for an employee to give up a guaranteed salary. **********Treasury officials argue, however, that a 35 percent tax rate on capital gains that have been adjusted for inflation will produce ''effective rates that are not substantially above'' the rates in effect during the venture capital booms that occurred after 1978 and in the 1960's. **********But Mr. Pollock maintains that, at present levels of inflation, the Treasury plan is far less generous than under current law. And, he said, the 35 percent Treasury rate ignored the impact of state and local taxes on capital gains. Those taxes become effectively higher under the Treasury plan, because they would no longer be deductible on Federal tax returns under the plan. **********According to the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company, New York City residents - who would be subject to combined state and city taxes on capital gains of up to 18.5 percent in addition to the top 35 percent Federal tax - would find the Treasury plan less generous if an investment's annual return was higher than 8 to 9 percent and inflation was running at 5 percent. Venture capitalists hope for a much higher return than 8 to 9 percent to make the risk worthwhile. **********But the Treasury also argues that tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds and foundations, and foreign investors have become a growing force in venture capital in recent years. Noting that these investors now account for roughly half the funds committed to venture capital, the Treasury contends these funding sources are unlikely to be affected by any changes in the tax treatment of capital gains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/business/casey-stake-in-capital-cities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Casey Stake in Capital Cities", "print_headline": "Casey Stake in Capital Cities", "body_text": " **********William J.

About 50 percent of all trade by members of the European Economic Community is with each other, and many also trade heavily with other European nations. **********Gerhard Stoltenberg, West Germany's Finance Minister, and Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, discussed the initiative in interviews today but declined to say how far they felt the dollar should fall. Mr. Lawson said the action was part of the Reagan Administration's battle against the growing mood of protectionism in Congress. **********He added, ''It is an overriding national interest of ours to prevent protectionism.'' **********France's Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, in an interview taped Sunday in New York and televised today, portrayed the joint statement as a vindication of French proposals for action that the United States had previously resisted. **********Oil Importers Are Pleased **********European countries that have heavy imports of oil and other commodities that are priced in dollars generally welcomed the prospect of a lower dollar value. **********''An orderly dollar decline is, on balance, favorable to the Swedish economy,'' said Sten Westerberg, chief economist at the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank in Stockholm. **********Any export markets that European companies lose to the Americans may well be balanced for many European companies in the near term by improved domestic prospects. **********''Both Switzerland and Germany are in a phase of expansion that would not be killed by a dollar decline,'' said Hans Mast, chief economist of Credit Suisse in Zurich. **********Economists also note that European nations, while talking of fiscal restraint, are gradually adopting tax cuts and other measures that increase domestic spending power. **********''We are getting gentle stimulation of most of the economies of Europe that should attract people out of the dollar,'' said Roger Hornett, who heads analysts following European developments for the brokerage firm of James Capel & Company. **********The dollar decline presents special problems for Europe's major energy producers - Britain, Norway and the Netherlands. All can expect less revenue from their oil and gas output. Mr. Lawson conceded today that the lost oil revenue will limit the scope for British tax cuts that have been a high priority in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic program. **********The key question remaining in European financial circles is how seriously committed the five cooperating nations' central banks are to jointly managing a dollar decline. Today's drop occurred without any evidence of concerted action, although the Bundesbank sold dollars for the first time since Feb. 20. **********''The markets are all wondering if they mean what they say,'' said Richard Jeffrey, an economist with the brokerage firm of Hoare Govett. Mr. Lawson, at his news conference here today, sought to put a damper on expectations. ---- Japanese Help Promised Japan's Foreign Minister, Shintaro Abe, pledged last night that Japan would ''further liberalize'' its financial and capital markets to help drive down the value of the United States dollar and diminish the trade imbalance between the two countries. **********Speaking at the Japan Society in New York, he cited the ''extreme gravity'' of resentment in both nations and said the Japanese must realize ''that the United States needs Japan's cooperation in sharing responsibilities to maintain free trade.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/07/world/denis-de-rougemont-famed-swiss-writer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DENIS DE ROUGEMONT, FAMED SWISS WRITER", "print_headline": "DENIS DE ROUGEMONT, FAMED SWISS WRITER", "body_text": " **********Denis de Rougemont, the noted Swiss writer who became a leading advocate of European unity, died today in a Geneva hospital after a long illness, sources close to his family said.

''We were criticized by the Americans for exchanging 1,150 Palestinians for 3 Israeli soldiers, so now let us see what they do in this position.'' **********Israeli officials quickly add, however, that they are very pleased with the hard line Washington has taken so far and certainly have no intention of freeing the Shiite prisoners under the pressure of the hijackers without an American request. **********Israeli officials made it clear that they sympathize with the predicament in which the Reagan Administration now finds itself. They indicated that they now want to make certain that if they release the Shiite prisoners, that it appear the United States is the party making the concessions to the terrorists, not Israel - that Israel is only doing a favor to the United States. **********As the Minister of Police, Chaim Bar-Lev, put it in a radio interview: ''The plane is an American plane, the hostages are American citizens, the crew is an American crew and it is parked in Beirut. We don't have to take any initiative. If there is an approach from the United States, directly and at an appropriate level, and they come with some questions or proposals, we will have to consider them seriously. But up to this moment there has been no request and we don't have to take any initiatives.'' **********Release Already Planned **********Israel had been planning to release the Shiite prisoners, all of whom were picked up in South Lebanon since Nov. 1983 on suspicion of carrying out attacks on Israeli troops or the Israeli-backed militia known as the South Lebanon Army. **********They are all being held in the Atlit prison south of Haifa. Israel had planned to free most of them last week, but the operation was delayed because of techinical problems with the Red Cross and because of the incident between the South Lebanon Army and the Finnish battalion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. **********Israeli officials have been trying to figure out the exact role of Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal militia, in this hijacking affair, since it could reflect on their relations with Amal in the south. **********Some analysts here believe that Mr. Berri was not responsible for the original hijacking. But either because he feared for the lives of the hostages or because he wanted to be in a position to benefit politically from the incident, Mr. Berri has maneuvered himself into the position of chief negotiator for the hijackers. **********At the same time, the Shiite leader is involved in an intense political battle with more extreme elements within his own Amal movement and other rival Shiite groups for leadership of Lebanon's Shiite community. **********''I don't think it matters anymore whether Berri initiated the hijacking or has taken responsiblity for it after the fact,'' said Yossi Olmert, an expert on Israel at Tel Aviv University. ''The point is that he cannot allow himself to be outflanked by the more extreme fundamentalist Shiites.'' **********But Mr. Berri may have outflanked himself. Now that he has taken responsibility for the hostages, as a minister in the Lebanese Cabinet and as someone with close ties with the United States, he could never allow any harm to come to them. **********But if the Israelis are convinced that there is no threat to the American hostages, said Mr. Olmert, they will probably be even less inclined to free the prisoner as part of any deal. **********As a result, Mr. Berri could find himself trapped, unable to harm the hostages and unable to muster a credible enough threat to gain any of concessions to the hijackers. If he should decide to do the Americans a favor and play the role of the ''good guy'' by freeing the hostages without getting anything in return, his extremist rivals would immediately use it against him. **********''Berri has taken the hijackers off the hook,'' said Mr. Olmert.

It is the highest national total in South America. More ominously, half of the cases have been identified this year, and medical experts say they expect the total to double by year's end. **********Health Minister Carlos Sant'Anna has said that AIDS is not a ''priority'' for his office compared with other tropical ailments, including malaria, that still affect millions of people. But in the face of what he called the public's ''massive hypochondria,'' the Government is developing a strategy to respond to the problem. **********Much of the panic among the public seems to stem from lack of detailed information about AIDS, with many ordinary Brazilians even asking whether they should still shake the hand or kiss the cheek of friends. Some women have also started taking their own nail clippers to beauty parlors to avoid what they fear may be one way of contracting the disease. **********Among high-risk groups, particularly homosexuals, there is the additional fear of ostracism by a society that in the past has been renowned for its liberal sexual mores. ''We've had calls from people saying, 'My neighbor is a homosexual so why don't you arrest him?' '' said Claudio Monteiro, a sociologist working with the Group to Support the Prevention of AIDS, an organization based in Sao Paulo. **********Some Brazilian newspapers have called for a ban on charter flights by groups of American homosexuals. In recent years, such groups have attended Carnival, the pre-Lenten festival, which includes special dances and parades for homosexuals. ''The Brazilian Government's duty is to inhibit the arrival of groups of high-risk AIDS carriers for the good of us all,'' an English-language paper, The Latin American Post, wrote this month. **********But although the first reported cases of AIDS in Brazil involved homosexuals who had traveled to the United States, medical experts said the greatest danger of an epidemic was now posed by the unhygienic environment in which much of the urban poor lives. ''We're getting more and more victims from the lower classes,'' said Dr. Teresa Kliemann, a member of a special AIDS task force set up in Sao Paulo. **********Official statistics show that of 415 known cases to date, 357 involved homosexuals, 27 hemophiliacs, 5 drug addicts and 17 people described only as heterosexuals. The balance were not classified. The country's two largest cities account for 378 cases. But while 323 have been identified in Sao Paulo, only 55 have been reported in Rio de Janeiro. ''We suspect that Rio must have many more unreported cases,'' Dr. Kliemann said. Until recently, only in Sao Paulo had state health authorities given special attention to the problem. Their AIDS task force, which was set up in September 1983, seeks to assure that there will be treatment for victims and has a telephone number for answering requests for information. ''We get up to 250 calls a day,'' Dr. Kliemann said. ''There's panic in the gay community, but we also get calls from companies, teachers, parents and doctors.'' **********Even in Sao Paulo, hospitals are poorly equipped to deal with AIDS cases, with only 35 beds available for its victims in a city of 12 million inhabitants. The Federal Government's Social Security Institute is unwilling to assume responsibility for patients with AIDS because of the disproportionately high cost of attending them. **********The Group to Support the Prevention of AIDS is composed of 34 volunteers who include both homosexuals and hemophiliacs.

Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said the changes announced by Pretoria -which were praised by President Reagan a few days ago - ''are not adequate'' and did not cover the most divisive issues in South Africa. **********White House comments today avoided direct criticism of South Africa. This evidenced a seeming difference in tone between the White House and State Department in recent days, but officials insisted there was no policy rift. **********Called Odious Practices **********Reflecting its growing exasperation toward Pretoria's handling of events since the crackdown began six weeks ago, the State Department said, ''Banning individuals and organizations from political activities is one of the most odious practices of the South African Government. **********''It offends the democratic values of free speech and assembly and accentuates the anger and frustration felt by all the opponents of apartheid,'' Charles E. Redman, a department spokesman, said. ''The South African Government's contention that it upholds Western values is belied by such actions. A society can never effectively come to terms with its problems by repressing dissent.

Although saying apartheid was ''repugnant,'' he praised the South Africans for a ''reformist'' policy and said many apartheid practices had been eliminated. **********On Tuesday night, however, Mr. Crocker, who is the Administration's top expert on South Africa, said that while there had been changes in South Africa, ''the changes we have seen to date are not adequate.'' **********''They don't satisfy us,'' he said, appearing on the CBS News program ''Nightwatch.'' ''More importantly, they don't satisfy the black majority in South Africa.'' **********''They haven't addressed the core political issues that must be addressed in South Africa,'' he said. ''We want to see apartheid ended, the sooner the better.'' **********Explains Reagan Comment **********Asked how Mr. Reagan could assert that South Africa had ''eliminated'' segregation, Mr. Crocker said: ''I think the President is reacting to the impression which we all share, that the South African Government has committed itself to remove petty apartheid, which means discrimination in tems of access to public facilities and so forth.'' **********But he said even those steps have ''not been fully implemented.'' **********''There are many things in South Africa that remain segregated,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''That's a fact.'' **********He said so-called ''petty apartheid'' was not the most important issue. **********He said that there was inadequate provision for free education in South Africa for black and mixed-race children, and that ''on the big issues, which are really most important, things like the Group Areas Act, and influx control, and power sharing and voting'' there was no indication from Pretoria of a willingness to change. The Group Areas Act and influx control prescribe according to race where people may live and work. **********Defends American Role **********Mr. Crocker, defending the Administration's ''constructive engagement'' policy, said the United States had a role to play in South Africa - ''to keep pushing, to keep using the levers of influence we do have by being there, by having some kind of a relationship, by having our investments there, by having lines out to all elements in the community.'' **********He said the current situation ''calls for statesmanship, it calls for guts, it calls for determination, it calls for sense of unity and consensus in your ranks to be able to make those healing gestures that are so vitally needed in South Africa.'' **********The Administration had hoped that President P. W. Botha, in a speech on Aug. 15, would signal clear moves toward reconciliation. The speech had been preceded by a meeting in Vienna between Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha of South Africa and Robert C.

For the entire month, G.M. car sales were down 13.2 percent and trucks were up 2.7 percent from last year, when sales were also depressed because of selected U.A.W. strikes against the company. **********The Ford Motor Company said its car sales in late October fell 26.1 percent on a daily rate basis, to 54,713.

And that appears to be the general reaction to recent news surrounding the Tribune Company: Rupert Murdoch's probable move to sell two papers that compete directly with the Tribune's flagship properties, and the Tribune Company's own plan to buy the Los Angeles independent television station, KTLA-TV. Both changes could mean good sailing for the Chicago-based media giant later in the decade, say analysts, but for the shorter run, the view is a bit more cautious. **********Speaking of the television purchase, Gregory C. Clark, vice president of Alliance Capital Management, a New York investment management firm that owns 1.3 million Tribune Company shares for its clients, said: ''I think it's an intelligent long-term move.'' But like many analysts, Mr. Clark thinks the price the Tribune paid to a group of private investors for the Los Angeles station may be a bit steep. In fact, the purchase price - $510 million - is the largest ever for a single TV station. **********Figuring that the television acquisition will dilute earnings, some analysts have been lowering their forecasts. John Morton, at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, lowered his firm's 1986 earnings projections by 50 to 60 cents, to $3.30 a share. That is not that far ahead of the $3.15-a-share or so some analysts project for 1985. In 1984, the company earned $2.35 a share. For its part, the Tribune Company acknowledged that the acquisition would dilute next year's earnings by 10 to 15 percent. **********Investors were not enthralled by news of the TV deal: They knocked the Tribune's stock price back 2 points, from its 52-week high of 48, the day after its May 16 announcement. Last week, Tribune was trading around 45. Its 52-week low is 28. **********Many analysts and fund managers are concerned about the stock's performance over the coming months, despite the generally high marks they give the company, which went public only two years ago. The Tribune may be a media powerhouse, with its big papers in New York and Chicago and major-market TV and radio stations, but analysts are increasingly wary of media stocks in general after the recent run-up in prices spurred by major media takeovers and restructurings. Paine Webber Inc., for example, is not recommending that investors buy the Tribune Company at its current level. **********''The group is hot and that makes me increasingly nervous,'' said J. Kendrick Noble, a Paine Webber vice president. However, because he believes the Tribune Company is an attractive long-term investment, he says investors who now own it should hold on: ''I would not sell it.'' **********Another thing that bothers some analysts is the very fact that the Tribune Company is buying a large TV station at the same time that Metromedia Inc. is unloading many stations. **********''The one thing nobody ever accused Metromedia of was being stupid,'' said Alan J. Gottesman, media analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. He believes that Metromedia's chairman, John W. Kluge, who announced two weeks ago his plans to sell six television stations to the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation's owners, Rupert Murdoch and Marvin Davis, will prove to be the smartest participant in the media transactions. **********Mr. Gottesman says that in talking to national network TV advertisers, he has found that the market for next season is soft. ''What I'm seeing is an unbelievable lack of exuberance,'' he said. And that may not bode well for the Tribune's expensive TV acquisition on the coast. **********Still, analysts are enthusiastic about the Tribune's long-term prospects. For one thing, they point to the expected departure of Mr. Murdoch from the newspaper scene in Chicago and New York. His New York Post and Chicago Sun-Times have competed head to head against the Tribune Company's New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune - and it looks as if Mr. Murdoch will have to unload both his papers to meet Federal restrictions against owning papers and TV stations in the same city. The main impact will likely be in New York: Should Mr. Murdoch be unable to find a buyer, and simply shut down The Post, as many analysts expect, that will prove to be a long-term boon to The Daily News. **********But even that could have some inimical short-term consequences for Tribune Company finances. Lynch, Jones's Mr. Morton says that should the Post simply cease operations, The Daily News undoubtedly would pick up much of the paper's circulation. That would increase printing and distribution costs for one to two quarters, he estimates. And he does not believe those costs would be offset by a comparable increase in advertising revenues. **********All this aside, the proposed acquisition of KTLA comes on the heels of a remarkably successful year for the Tribune Company. Last year was a record one for the Chicago concern, which also owns four radio stations and five TV stations, including New York's WPIX (Channel 11) - and the Chicago Cubs. Tribune Company revenues rose to $1.8 billion, and net income grew to $103 million in 1984. **********Wallflowers **********Since last summer, market watchers have said that one critical ingredient missing from the bull market scenario was the individual investor. The stock market could not enjoy a sustained rally, they said, without the participation of the retail customer. And according to statistics compiled by Salomon Brothers Inc., the elusive individual is continuing to sit out this dance. **********Salomon's figures show that, over the past year, there has been almost no increase in the number of small trades, which represent retail activity. In April, institutional block trades, those of 10,000 or more shares, increased slightly, from 49.3 percent of the total volume on the New York Stock Exchange one year ago to 51.4 percent. But trades of 200 to 400 shares accounted for only 3.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent one year ago. And trades of fewer than 100 shares in April represented only 1.1 percent, slighty less than the 1.2 percent in April 1984. **********Keeping It Shorter **********Last week, traders and investors in the bond market seemed to be saying that they feared the drop in interest rates was just about over. On Wednesday, the price of 30-year Treasury bonds fell sharply, after Salomon Brothers' top economist, Henry Kaufman, said he thought the economy would rebound in the second half and drive up rates. **********Madeline Einhorn Glick, who runs M.E.G. Asset Management in New York, an investment management ''boutique'' specializing in bonds, is one of those avoiding long-term issues. Mrs. Glick said she sees no reason to invest in long-term Treasury bonds: They do not offer enough of a yield premium over intermediate-term issues. In fact, she said that the largest concentration of her $350 million in client assets is in issues with maturities ranging from 2 to 10 years. **********She said that if she were convinced rates were going down, or even remaining stable, she would buy low-grade corporate issues in an industry that had experienced a shakeout. **********Anise C.

Thank you very much and welcome to the White House. **********I'm pleased to have this opportunity to be with you to address the pressing question of America's trade challenge for the 80's and beyond. **********And let me say at the outset that our trade policy rests firmly on the foundation of free and open markets, free trade. **********I, like you, recognize the inescapable conclusion that all of history has taught, the freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides for human progress and peace among nations. I certainly don't have to explain the benefits of free and open markets to you. They produce more jobs, a more productive use of our nation's resources, more rapid innovation and a higher standard of living. They strengthen our national security because our economy, the bedrock of our defense, is stronger. **********Critical Role Played **********I'm pleased that the United States has played the critical role of insuring and promoting an open trading system since World War II and I know that, if we ever faltered in the defense and promotion of the worldwide free trading system, that system will collapse, to the detriment of all. **********But our role does not absolve our trading partners from their major responsibility to support us in seeking more open, a more open trading system. No nation, even one as large and as powerful as the United States can, by itself, insure a free trading system. All that we and others have done to provide for the free flow of goods and services and capital is based on cooperation. And our trading partners must join us in working to improve the system of trade that has contributed so much to economic growth and the security of our allies and of ourselves. **********And may I say right here to the leaders of industry that my admiration for business in the United States is stronger than ever. **********The Economy Is Business **********You know, sometimes in Washington there are some who seem to forget what the economy is all about. They give me reports saying that the economy does this and the economy will do that. They never talk about business. And somewhere along the way these folks in Washington have forgotten that the economy is business. Business creates new products and new services. Business creates jobs. Business creates prosperity for our communities and our nation as a whole. And business is the people that make it work. From the C.E.O. to the workers in the factories. **********I know, too, that American business has never been afraid to compete. I know that, when a trading system follows the rules of free trade, when there is equal opportunity to compete, American business is as innovative, efficient and competitive as any in the world. I also know that the American worker is as good and productive as any in the world. **********And that's why, to make the international trading system work, all must abide by the rules. All must work to guarantee open markets. Above all else, free trade is, by definition, fair trade. **********When domestic markets are closed to the exports of others, it is no longer free trade. When governments subsidize their manufacturers and farmers so that they can dump goods in other markets, it is no longer free trade. When governments permit counterfeiting or copying of American products, it is stealing our future and it is no longer free trade. When governments assist their exporters in ways that violate international laws, then the playing field is no longer level and there is no longer free trade. When governments subsidize industries for commercial advantage and underwrite costs, placing an unfair burden on competitors, that is not free trade. **********Worked for Four Years **********I have worked for four years at Versailles and Williamsburg and London and, last, at Bonn to get our trading partners to dismantle their trade barriers, eliminate their subsidies and other unfair trade practices, enter into negotiations to open markets even further, and strengthen GATT, the international accord that governs worldwide trade. I will continue to do these things.  But I also want the American people and our trading partners to know that we will take all the action that is necessary to pursue our rights and interests in international commerce under our laws and the GATT to see that other nations live up to their obligations and their trade agreements with us. **********I believe that if trade is not fair for all then trade is free in name only. **********I will not stand by and watch American businesses fail because of unfair trading practices abroad. I will not stand by and watch American workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules. **********We have put incentives into our own economy to make it grow and create jobs. And, as you know, business has prospered. We have created over eight million new jobs in the last 33 months. Just since 1980, manufacturing production has increased 17 percent. **********But I'm not unmindful that within this prosperity some industries and workers face difficulties. **********Committed to Aid Workers **********For the workers who have been displaced by industrial shifts within our society, we are committed to help. To those industries that are victims of unfair trade, we will work unceasingly to have those practices eliminated. **********Just a few weeks ago, I asked the United States trade represenative to initiate unfair trade practice investigations - it's the first time a President has done this - and as you know, we have self-initiated three such cases that will investigate a Korean law that prohibits fair competition for U.S. insurance firms, a Brazilian law restricting the sale of U.S. high-technology products and the Japanese restrictions on the sale of U.S. tobacco products. **********I have also ordered the United States trade representative to accelerate the ongoing cases of Common Market restrictions of canned fruit and Japanese prohibitions on imports of our leather and leather footwear. But I believe more must be done. I am therefore today announcing that I have instructed Ambassador Yeutter to maintain a constant watch and to take action in those instances of unfair trade that will disadvantage American businesses and workers. **********A $300 Million Fund **********I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to work with the Congress to establish a $300 million fund that will support up to a billion dollars in mixed-credit loans. These funds will counter our loss of business to trading partners who use what, in effect, are subsidies to deprive U.S. companies of fair access to world markets. **********And I've asked that these initiatives be continued until unfair credit subsidies by our trading partners are eliminated through negotiations with them. **********I have further instructed Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to inform the participants at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank conferences in Seoul that we will take into consideration the trading practices of other nations in our deliberations and decision-making. **********A major factor in the growth of our trade deficit has been the combination of our very strong economic performance and the weak economic performance of our major trading partners over the last four years. This has limited our exports and contributed to the weakening of other currencies relative to the dollar, thereby encouraging additional imports by the United States and discouraging our exports. **********Provide Better Markets **********But yesterday I authorized Treasury Secretary Baker to join his counterparts from other major industrial countries to announce measures to promote stronger and more balanced growth in our economies and thereby the strengthening of foreign currencies. This will provide better markets for U.S. products and improve the competitive position of our industry, agriculture and labor. **********I have ordered the Secretary of State to seek time limits on negotiations under way to open up markets in specific product areas in Japan. **********I've instructed the United States trade representative to accelerate negotiations with any and all countries where the counterfeiting and piracy of U.S. goods has occurred to bring these practices to a quick end. **********And I look forward to working with the Congress to increase efforts to protect patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. **********And, finally, I am today directing that a strike force be established among the relevant agencies in our Government whose task it will be to uncover unfair trading practices used against us and develop and execute strategies and programs to promptly counter and eliminate them. **********Working With Congress **********I'm also looking forward to working with the Congress to put into place any necessary legislation that would help us promote free and fair trade and secure jobs for American workers. **********Among the topics that we should jointly consider are: *********** Authority to support our new trade negotiating initiatives that would, among other things, reduce tariffs and attempt to dismantle all other trade barriers. *********** To protect intellectual property rights, including trade in articles that infringe U.S. process patents, longer terms for agricultural chemicals, and eliminating Freedom Of Information Act abuses that will help our businesses protect their proprietary property. *********** To improve our antidumping and countervailing duty laws so that a predictable pricing test covers nonmarket economies, enabling our companies to have protection against unfair dumping from those countries; we should also improve these laws so that business can have full and rapid protection in receiving help against unfair imports. *********** To amend our trade laws to put a deadline on dispute settlement and to conduct a fast-track procedure for perishable items. We should no longer tolerate 16-year cases and settlements so costly and time-consuming that any assistance is ineffective. **********I'm also directing the Secretary of Labor to explore ways of assisting workers who lose jobs to find gainful employment in other industries and I look forward to working with Congress in this vital task. **********Suggestions Welcomed **********Additionally, I welcome the suggestions of the members of Congress on other potential legislation that has, as its object, the promotion of free and fair trade. I will work with them to see that good legislation is passed. Conversely, I will strongly oppose and will veto measures that I believe will harm economic growth, cause loss of jobs and diminish international trade. **********But I do not want to let this discussion pass without reminding all of our ultimate purpose - the expansion of free and open markets everywhere. **********There are some well-meaning in motive who have proposed bills and programs that are truly protectionist in nature. These proposals would raise the costs of the goods and services that American consumers across the land would have to pay. **********They would invite retaliation by our trading partners abroad, would in turn lose jobs for those American workers in industries that would be the victims of such retaliation, would rekindle inflation, would strain international relations, and would impair the stability of the international financial and trading systems. **********Lose Our Prosperity **********The net result of these counterproductive proposals would not be to protect consumers or workers or farmers or businesses. In fact, just the reverse would happen. We would lose markets. We would lose jobs. And we would lose our prosperity. **********To reduce the impediments to free markets, we will accelerate our efforts to launch a new GATT negotiating round with our trading partners. And we hope that the GATT members will see fit to reduce barriers for trade and agricultural products and services, technologies, investments, and in mature industries. We will seek effective dispute-settlement techniques in these areas. **********But if these negotiations are not initiated or if insignificant progress is made, I am instructing our trade negotiators to explore regional and bilateral agreements with other nations. **********Here at home we will continue our efforts to reduce excessive Government spending and to promote our tax-reform proposal that is essential to strengthening our own economy and making U.S. business more competitive in international markets. **********Encourage Trading Partners **********Further, we will encourage our trading partners, as agreed upon at the Bonn summit, to accelerate their own economic growth by removing rigidities and imbalances in their economies. And we will encourage them to provide sound fiscal and monetary policies, to have them fully participate in a growth potential that is there for all. **********We will seek to strengthen and improve the operation of the international monetary system and we will encourage the debt-burdened less-developed countries of the world to reduce and eliminate impediments to investments and eliminate internal restrictions that discourage their own economic growth. Let me summarize.  Our commitment to free trade is undiminished. We will vigorously pursue our policy of promoting free and open markets in this country and around the world. We will insist that all nations face up to their responsibilities of preserving and enhancing free trade everywhere. **********For the Benefit of All **********But let no one mistake our resolve to oppose any and all unfair trading practices. It is wrong for the American worker and American businessman to continue to bear the burden imposed by those who abuse the world trading system. **********We do not want a trade war with other nations. We want other nations to join us in enlarging and enhancing the world trading system for the benefit of all. **********We do not want to stop other nations from selling goods in the United States. **********We want to sell more of our goods to other nations. **********We do not dream of protecting America from others' success. **********We seek to include everyone in the success of the American dream. **********Thank you very much and thank you for coming."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/02/business/flourishing-treasury-market.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1985-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLOURISHING TREASURY MARKET", "print_headline": "FLOURISHING TREASURY MARKET", "body_text": " **********As the Treasury securities market has emerged from a Wall Street backwater to the forefront of the world's financial arena, the personality and style of the marketplace are being transformed by new participants, new products and, following repeated scandals, the possibility of Federal regulation. **********Today's market serves the same basic function - the financing of United States deficits - as it did a decade or two ago. But then it was a market dominated by a few dozen domestic banks and securities firms that sold Treasury bills and bonds mostly to large, sophisticated institutional clients like banks, pension funds and foreign countries. **********Today's market is a far cry from that. It encompasses not only the grand old names of yesterday's markets, such as Salomon Brothers, which made its mark as a Government bond house. But it also includes an unknown number of smaller firms - perhaps as many as a hundred - ranging from the recently closed E.S.M. Government Securities to Staley Financial Services, the financial subsidiary of a Middle West soybean processor eager to use its expertise in trading commodity futures contracts in the financial forum. **********The customer base has also expanded. The big banks and pension funds are still active, but so are individuals and foreign investors. **********Much of the new activity has been spurred by the explosion in United States debt. But new ways of trading that debt - from options and futures contracts on Treasury securities to zero coupon Treasury bonds - have also made owning and trading Government securities more attractive. **********Individuals, for example, can now buy zero coupon Treasury bonds for their Individual Retirement Accounts; although they pay no immediate interest, they compound over the life of the account. Other individuals may be drawn to the potential profits available in the Treasury futures market, where for a small investment an investor can participate in huge swings in the prices of Government bonds. Even Wall Street's biggest trading desks have found the new trading techniques useful. **********But the new prominence of the Treasury market has also been accompanied by growing pains. In particular, the failure of six firms in the last three years has cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars, and in the case of Drysdale Government Securities, some saw it as a serious threat to the stability of the financial system. Besides Drysdale and E.S.M., the other problems involved Comark Inc., Lombard-Wall Inc., Lion Capital Group and RTD Securities. **********Although the circumstances differed, all of these cases involved Government securities dealers that were not supervised by any regulatory agency. All actively used repurchase agreements, or repos. In a repo, a firm sells securities to a customer, promising to repurchase them later at a higher price. **********In many cases, the major customers of these smaller firms were unsophisticated municipalities with money to invest. They turned to these smaller Government securities dealers, bankers said, because the banks, subject to new capital standards, have been discouraged from entering into the large number of low-profit repurchase transactions the local governments seek. **********Dealers are proud of the new financing and trading techniques that have enabled them to handle the explosion in Government borrowings in recent years but are on the defensive against suggestions that their venerable and once trouble-free market needs more regulation. **********Problems With Smaller Firms **********Currently the only regulation in the market is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's oversight of the 36 primary dealers - the large dealers who report their transactions daily to the Fed and abide by certain informal Fed standards in trading and in Treasury auctions. The problems in recent years have involved smaller firms that have little or no regular communication with the Fed or any other Federal agency, **********''None of the problems have involved primary dealers, and it would be a disservice to shackle this market with unneeded regulation,'' Ralph Peters, chairman of the Discount Corporation of New York, said soon after the collapse of Drysdale. Because Government securities dealers are universally dismayed at the idea of regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, they have tried to head off such a solution by taking the lead in self-regulation. **********While many firms continue to trade Treasury issues actively without being designated as primary dealers, the number of firms reporting to the Fed continues to rise, even as mergers of major firms continue. The count of 36 primary dealers is up from 21 in 1964. And the list is certain to grow. Officials at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden; L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin; Wertheim & Company, and the Wood Gundy Corporation have all indicated their desire to join the ''club.'' **********Because the market is so huge, many of the new particpants are following a strategy of carving out a niche for themselves as specialists in particular segments of the market. The idea is not new. Firms such as Aubrey G. Lanston & Company and the Discount Corporation of New York, for example, have traditionally focused on short-term maturities rather than long-term bonds, where they are at a disadvantage to their competitors who also have corporate bond departments. **********But now, as the market grows there are more niches to fill. Lazard Fr eres, for example, is not a primary dealer but is so active in its specialty of zero coupon bonds that it does as much trading as other firms that are primary dealers. Carroll McEntee McGinley, recently acquired by the Marine Midland Bank, is known as a specialist in handling odd-lot transactions. **********''The proliferation of new products has produced hedging and arbitrage opportunities which allow smaller players to do bigger-sized trades,'' said Jonathan A. Bulkley, president at Moseley, Hallgarten. **********Firms that are not financial giants aiming to provide every service to every client can take advantage of the Treasury market's diversity, Mr. Bulkley said, ''by picking out a high- margin area or two of the market where you can be effective without the same cost structure as your competitors.'' **********Trouble With Innovation **********While innovation has served the market well in the last few years, some analsyts see potential for further trouble as firms move into new products. The rapidly growing use of over-the-counter options in Treasury securities, for example, has been identified by some participants as a cause for concern, but has not been addressed by S.E.C. officials, who regulate options. **********''It's a potentially abusive situation,'' said Robert H. Schumacher, vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, ''when you remember that big fees show up in financial statements as current income, while the potential liability is not stated.'' **********The significance of E.S.M.'s activity in the over-the-counter options market - where it earned sizable fees - was not lost on other dealers. Firms that participated in options with E.S.M. protected themselves against loss with offsetting transactions and margin requirements, but those standards are not universal in the industry. **********In the absence of universal standards, Government officials and industry executives continue to debate whether there is a regulatory approach that might prevent future problems in the Government market. **********The Primary Dealer Committee of the Public Securities Association has both endorsed the New York Fed's proposed capital adequacy guidelines and urged last May that the Fed expand its surveillance to include the nonregulated portion of the market. The Fed declined to follow the suggestion last May, except to collect voluntary reports monthly from no more than three dozen firms. But the earlier proposal is being reconsidered in light of the E.S.M. debacle. **********At yesterday's hearing in New York by the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Affairs, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, declined to endorse any particular plan for controlling the market until the completion of a new study within 90 days by the Fed, the Treasury Department and the S.E.C."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/24/world/quake-mexico-gift-washington-nancy-reagan-arrives-mexico-with-initial-1-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  NANCY REAGAN ARRIVES IN MEXICO WITH AN INITIAL $1 MILLION IN AID", "print_headline": "QUAKE IN MEXICO: A GIFT FROM WASHINGTON;   NANCY REAGAN ARRIVES IN MEXICO WITH AN INITIAL $1 MILLION IN AID", "body_text": " **********Nancy Reagan visited survivors of the earthquake disaster today, delivering a letter of sympathy from her husband and a $1 million ''down payment'' on United States Government disaster aid to Mexico. **********After meeting President Miguel de la Madrid at his residence here, Mrs. Reagan toured streets littered with rubble and smashed cars and met survivors at refugee centers and a Red Cross hospital. **********The First Lady was accompanied during most of her four-hour visit by Paloma Cordero de la Madrid, wife of the Mexican President. **********''We stand ready to assist in any way possible,'' Mrs. Reagan told Mr. de la Madrid after handing him the letter and a green check from the United States Treasury.

She went to a medical center emergency room and then to the main Red Cross center in the city's Polanco district, which was untouched by the two earthquakes. **********From there, she went to the United States Embassy, where she addressed its employees. **********''Whatever we're asked to do,'' she told them, ''we'll do.'' **********Before leaving Mexico, she spoke with reporters at the airport. **********''The whole day was emotional,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

Canfield Company was little more than a small, albeit successful, soft-drink bottler in Chicago. Then came the Diet Chocolate Fudge Soda craze, and things at 61-year-old Canfield's have not been the same since. **********In mid-January, Bob Greene, a syndicated columnist for The Chicago Tribune, extolled Canfield's 2-calorie Diet Chocolate Fudge Soda as the perfect foil for his chocolate habit. ''Taking a sip of the stuff is like biting into a hot fudge sundae,'' Mr. Greene wrote. **********Canfield's was flooded with calls. The privately owned company, whose home territory has traditionally been Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, has now signed franchise agreements with regional bottlers serving 33 additional states, mostly in the West and Southwest. **********And Canfield is on the verge of signing agreements with bottlers serving New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and eight other states. ''We even heard from bottlers in Europe, Saudi Arabia and Japan,'' said Alan B. Canfield, the 44-year-old grandson of the company's founder and the bottler's senior vice president. **********Sales Surge **********As agreements are negotiated, sales are beginning to leap. Canfield's has sold more than 25 million cans of fudge soda in the last four months alone, up from about one million cans for all of last year. The company would not disclose its total sales, but Mr. Canfield predicts shipments of 145 million to 165 million cans of the chocolate drink this year. **********''I've never seen a product come on and sell itself as strongly as this one,'' said Charles H. Whitaker, the controller of the Columbine Beverage Company, a private-label bottler in Denver for grocery chains and others. In February, Columbine signed the first franchise agreement with Canfield's and had eight 2,200-case truckloads of fudge soda shipped from Chicago. **********Another regional bottler that was deluged with calls for diet fudge soda was Texas Beverage Packers Inc. of San Antonio. ''Stores were begging us for the drink,'' said Stephen L. Hixson, Texas Beverage's general manager. ''Normally, you have to give up your first-born child to get stores to accept a new product.'' **********He added, ''We hadn't even tried the soda when we called Canfield's and said we were interested in getting the entire state of Texas.'' The company won the Texas franchise and recently added Louisiana. **********'A Little Ingenuity' **********''Canfield's proved that just when you thought that all the tastes were out there, a little ingenuity could create a whole new market share,'' said Jesse Meyers, who publishes the Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter in Old Greenwich, Conn. **********For all its success, Canfield's is still a drop in the barrel in a $23 billion industry estimated to produce 4.27 billion cases annually. Mr. Meyers estimates that regular Coca-Cola has about 22 percent of the market, with regular Pepsi-Cola at 19 percent. **********Still, Mr. Canfield says that his company has been living a soft-drink maker's dream. Facilities have been running full tilt since January. Leaping on a catwalk astride the high-speed canning line, Mr. Canfield said, as 1,250 cans a minute were filled amid a ferocious whir and hiss, ''That's how you make money.'' **********According to Mr. Canfield, innovation at the company began with his grandfather, who once created a bottle with a slightly wider mouth to differentiate Canfield's from the competition. ''There were hundreds of soft-drink manufacturers in Chicago in those days,'' Mr, Canfield said. ''Most of them went out of business stealing each other's bottles and we're still here.'' **********Today, Canfield's medal for creativity probably belongs to Emanuel Wesber, a flavor chemist who came to Canfield's in 1970. **********The atmosphere in the 64-year-old Mr. Wesber's laboratory is heady from the influence of dozens of aromatic chemicals. Standing in a crisp white coat, surrounded by countless beakers, he recalled Alan Canfield bringing a pound of fudge to him 14 years ago and saying, ''Make me a diet soda with this aroma and taste.'' **********It took Mr. Wesber nearly a year to conduct the delicate compounding of chemicals to simulate chocolate. And while Canfield's prides itself on the use of expensive natural ingredients, such as ginger root from Africa for its ginger ale, Mr. Wesber concedes, without a trace of apology, that the fudge soda is 100 percent artificial. **********Diet Chocolate Fudge Soda was introduced in 1972. But until last January, it was an unspectacular, though steady, performer in the company's troupe of nine diet soda flavors. The substitution of 100 percent Nutrasweet for saccharin in all of Canfield's diet drinks last summer made them more palatable, according to Mr. Wesber and Mr. Canfield, and increased sales of all of the company's diet drinks. But no one at Canfield's anticipated the surge in demand for the fudge soda this year. **********Mr. Canfield sees an inevitable peaking in demand. Nonetheless, he said, ''fudge'' may well survive other fads because it uniquely satisfies two of America's deepest, and most contradictory, cravings: for dieting and chocolate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/16/world/17-reported-slain-in-uganda.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "17 Reported Slain in Uganda", "print_headline": "17 Reported Slain in Uganda", "body_text": " **********Gunmen have killed 17 civilians in an area 10 miles northeast of Kampala in the past two weeks, the independent daily newspaper Ngabo reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/28/world/2-syrian-hijackers-surrender.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 SYRIAN HIJACKERS SURRENDER", "print_headline": "2 SYRIAN HIJACKERS SURRENDER", "body_text": " **********Two Syrians being deported from West Germany hijacked a Lufthansa airliner today and forced it to land here.

Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., was spotted by a sentry taking photographs through the window of a storage building on a restricted Soviet military installation. Tass said the officer was wearing camouflage gear. **********''Acting in strict compliance with military regulations, the sentry demanded in Russian and in German that the stranger stop,'' Tass said. ''When the latter failed to comply and tried to flee, the sentry fired a warning shot into the air. Since the intruder did not stop even after this, the sentry had to use his weapon. He fired and killed the intruder.'' **********The press agency said Major Nicholson had been spying, which it said was a violation of the agreement under which the four erstwhile occupying powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - maintain military liaison missions in their respective zones of Germany. **********'The tragic outcome of what happened on March 24 is regrettable, but the entire responsibility for it lies on the American side, which is now circulating a deliberately false version of what happened,'' Tass said. **********The report did not carry a heading that would identify special authority or origin. It was not presented as an official ''Tass statement,'' nor did it say ''Tass is authorized to state . . .,'' a formula that signals high authority. The fact that it was published as a regular dispatch indicated to diplomats an effort to keep the incident low-key. **********Tass said the Soviet Embassy in Washington had lodged a protest demanding that the United States ''take the necessary measures to insure strict fulfillment of the 1947 agreement on military liaison missions.'' **********Among Western diplomats here, the incident prompted comparisons with the downing of a South Korean airliner by Soviet interceptors on Sept. 1, 1983. Though the incidents differed in circumstances, scope and international effect, the diplomats thought the shooting in East Germany seemed once again to demonstrate the Soviet Union's concern with secrecy. **********After the South Korean airliner intruded into Soviet airspace and was shot down over Sakhalin Island, with the death of 269 people, Tass said ''leading circles'' of the Soviet Union expressed ''regret'' over the incident, but charged that the United States had sent the commercial plane over Soviet territory and was using the incident ''for unseemly political aims.'' **********The incident in East Germany, according to Tass, occurred Sunday about 4 P.M. near Ludwigslust. The press agency said that a stranger dressed in camouflage had entered a restricted installation and ''secretly approached the storage area, opened a window and taken pictures.'' According to Western reports, the storage area was a tank shed. **********Tass said Major Nicholson had driven into the military area together with Sgt. Jessie G. Schatz, ''despite the existence of clearly visible warning signs in Russian and in German.'' Tass said that while Major Nicholson was conducting his ''espionage operation,'' Sergeant Schatz ''remained in their vehicle and covered Nicholson's actions.'' The sergeant ''was apprehended by Soviet soldiers.'' **********American sources in West Germany said the sergeant was held for several hours and released. **********Tass said the two Americans had violated Article 10 of the pact on liaison missions, which it said forbids the movement of mission members ''in places where military units are stationed.'' **********The agency said Americans had violated the rules before. It cited an incident in August 1982 when Americans purportedly conducting ''military reconnaissance'' near Potsdam ''deliberately ran down a Soviet army officer, inflicting grievous bodily harm.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/18/business/business-people-wertheim-hires-rca-executive.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Wertheim Hires RCA Executive", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Wertheim Hires RCA Executive", "body_text": " **********Herbert S.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Leonard Silk is on vacation. **********Economic SceneGlenn C. Loury **********ALTHOUGH a matter of some dispute, it appears to many observers that there is a growing disparity in economic status among blacks. The class structure of the black population seems to be changing in a manner that has important political and policy implications. It looks as though blacks are increasingly divided between a relatively prosperous (by historical standards) middle class and an ever more desperate underclass. **********That the nature of racial inequality has changed in the past two decades is quite clear. Today, for blacks and whites alike, poverty is much more closely linked to family structure than was the case in 1960. The poor have come to consist mainly of women without a husband present and their children, while poverty rates among two-parent families have been reduced dramatically. **********But female-headed families are substantially more common among blacks than whites. Although the prevalence of such families has been increasing for both races, the gap between blacks and whites in percentage of single-parent families has grown wider. This factor has thus become more important in explaining economic differences between black and white families. **********On the other hand, a traditional source of racial disparity - employment discrimination - has diminished in significance during this period. The passage of civil rights legislation and the growth in enforcement activity by the courts and the state and Federal equal employment agencies have undermined the ability of private employers to discriminate in wages paid to their black employees. **********Statistical studies of discrimination uniformly shows significant reduction over the past two decades in the gap between black and white workers' compensation not accounted for by productivity differences. Indeed, in some specialized, highly skilled segments of the labor market, there may now be a slight premium paid to black workers. **********Thus it is at least arguable that, in some important respects, economic and social class position has become more important than race per se in accounting for black-white disparities. **********A history of racism and discrimination has helped to create an inner-city underclass that, because of economic and technological developments in American society at large, has become much more difficult to integrate into the economic mainstream than the urban poor of previous years. **********For blacks with job skills or a high level of educational attainment, many if not all of the historic barriers to achieving parity with whites have been removed. For those blacks who remain poorly educated and trapped in urban ghettoes, however, enormous problems remain. This distinction, between the economic positions of the black middle class and the black underclass, has great importance for the formulation of public policy. **********The key issue here is whether the extensive activities undertaken by government to promote racial economic equality are actually capable of reaching those blacks whose plight constitutes the core of the group inequality problem. **********There is evidence to suggest that they are not. Poorly skilled, poorly educated blacks have not gained as much from the efforts of the anti-discrimination agencies and affirmative action practices as have blacks with more education and skills. **********For example, between 1959 and 1979 the productivity-corrected ratio of black-to-white earnings among professionals and managerial employees rose to 90 percent, from 70 percent, while the comparable ratio for operatives and laborers remained constant at about 85 percent. **********During the 1970's the black-to-white earnings ratio for male college graduates rose to nearly 80 percent, from 70 percent, while blacks with one to three years of high school actually lost ground to similarly educated whites. **********Studies of the effect of affirmative action standards for Federal contractors suggest that black employees in the more highly skilled occupations have gained the most from the program. **********Nor does there exist a great deal of evidence to suggest that efforts to spur the growth of minority-owned business have generated much of a ''trickle-down'' for truly needy blacks. **********Most students who currently benefit from privately practiced affirmative action in college and professional school admissions are from middle-class homes, not from our poorest neighborhoods. **********None of this is to suggest that these policies are inappropriate or should not be continued. But such observations do raise questions about the extent to which today's racial inequality problems are likely to be solved by such practices. **********As differences between skilled blacks and whites in the labor force diminish but the gap between the relative numbers of blacks and white entering the labor force with sufficient skills widens, these questions will become ever more important. Although it is too early in the analysis of these issues to be certain, indications are that the more targeted effort to improve the skills of the inner-city poor may be the most effective way to narrow the economic gap now existing between the races."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/business/murdoch-is-buying-50-of-fox.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1985-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1094, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MURDOCH IS BUYING 50% OF FOX", "print_headline": "MURDOCH IS BUYING 50% OF FOX", "body_text": " **********Rupert Murdoch, the Australian publisher who has bought up numerous American newspapers and magazines, entered the motion picture business yesterday with an agreement to buy 50 percent of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation. **********Fox, now privately owned by Marvin Davis, a wealthy oilman, is one of Hollywood's best-known movie studios, but one that has suffered financial difficulties from a string of box-office disappointments. **********''They need the capital to get back on track with production,'' said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''It's been a rough period for them for the past one and a half or two years.'' **********The purchase surprised the Hollywood community, and raised questions about what effect it might have on the kind of films the studio produces. **********It was not immediately apparent if Mr. Murdoch's stake would give him firm control of Fox. But analysts said Mr. Murdoch would undoubtedly have a major say in studio operations. **********Mr. Vogel predicted that ''some people will be delighted and some people will be incensed'' at Mr. Murdoch's move into the film industry. **********In a joint statement with Mr. Davis, Mr. Murdoch said he would buy the 50 percent interest for $162 million, and would also advance $88 million to the studio's parent company to help pay debt and provide needed capital. **********Mr. Davis and a partner, Marc Rich, bought a controlling interest in 20th Century-Fox in 1981 for $722 million. Mr. Davis bought out Mr. Rich's half of the company last summer for a reported $116 million, after Mr. Rich was indicted for tax evasion and other charges in connection with his worldwide commodities operations. **********The purchase is the second announced change in ownership in the media and entertainment industry this week. On Monday, Capital Cities Communications Inc. agreed to acquire the American Broadcasting Companies for $3.5 billion. **********Among his holdings, Mr. Murdoch, through his News Corporation Ltd., owns The New York Post, The Village Voice and The Star, a national tabloid.

Isgur, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ''If he can have 20th Century's film library and distribution rights, that's not bad. He's also got an ego, and he wants to get into the business.'' **********Last year Mr. Murdoch tried to gain control of Warner Communications Inc., the parent of the Warner Brothers studio. He failed in that bid, but earned an estimated $40 million by selling his stake in Warner back to the company at a premium. **********A Series of Disasters **********Fox's last major hit was ''Romancing the Stone,'' more than a year ago.

Since then, the United States has become Ethiopia's largest supplier of emergency aid. More than a third of the relief food entering Ethiopia originates in the United States as part of a program costing more than a quarter of a billion dollars. **********American contributions of any kind are rarely acknowledged by the Government, however, while even small donations from the Soviet Union and other Communist countries are given prominence by Ethiopian officials and in the Government-controlled press. **********An American diplomat recently attended a small ceremony marking the start of a Washington-financed technical training program for Ethiopians. ''We wish to thank those responsible,'' an Ethiopian official said. **********The diplomat said, ''At no point could he bring himself to even mention America by name.'' **********For a few months this year, critical references to the United States virtually disappeared from the press. Recently, such language has become common again. **********For instance, an article in The Ethiopian Herald, an English-language newspaper, accused the Central Intelligence Agency of establishing a ''new hit list'' for Africa and went on to charge that ''reactionary quarters in the West'' were trying to ''sabotage'' the relief effort in Ethiopia. **********At the same time, the Ethiopian press routinely attributes adverse publicity about Ethiopia in the Western press to ''the Reagan Administration's familiar anti-Ethiopian campaign.'' **********Western journalists are now being granted visas valid for only 10 days. **********Beyond this, there has been what some European and other diplomats view as active harassment of the United States Embassy. Some Ethiopian employees of the embassy have been detained without charges. This spring, a United States Marine guard was attacked and beaten late at night on the grounds of an Addis Ababa hotel. **********''It was definitely a professional job,'' an American familiar with the case said. ''These weren't thugs or muggers.'' **********Addis Ababa is generally considered one of Africa's safest cities. **********The United States Agency for International Development office, which oversees a program now estimated at more than $262 million for financial year 1985, is limited by the Government to a staff of five, who until last month came here on visas that expired and had to be renewed every 30 days. **********Yet American economists, agriculture specialists, medical workers and others report that they have generally good professional and personal relations with their Ethiopian colleagues in ministries and commissions. **********According to some diplomats and Ethiopians, a struggle is under way in the ruling hierarchy between a moderate faction, composed mainly of military people, and a radical faction composed mainly of civilians with close ties to the Soviet Union. **********Others dispute that. ''There's no struggle anymore,'' an embassy political analyst said. ''The ideological types have already won hands down.'' **********The attitude of the ordinary Ethiopian contrasts markedly with the tensions on the official level. Westerners in general and Americans in particular tend to be treated with a hospitality and openness rarely encountered in other African countries. **********''Ethiopians know who their friends are,'' a law student at Addis Ababa University said.

Weinberger said the document demonstrated the ''very relentless'' nature of the Soviet buildup, and the need for continued American weapons modernization to match it. **********The Soviet Union dismissed the report as ''fiction.'' **********Senate Panel Takes Up Budget **********The publication of the fourth annual Pentagon assessment, called ''Soviet Military Power,'' came as the Senate Armed Services Committee began work on three versions of a military spending bill that would cut President Reagan's military budget by anywhere from $6 billion to $20 billion. **********At the news conference, Mr. Weinberger also made his sharpest attack to date on the Soviet Union for the killing of an American Army intelligence officer in East Germany. **********The Defense Secretary, departing from the more conciliatory tone taken by the State Department since the March 24 incident, said the death of the officer, Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., was not an isolated act but an expression of Soviet policy. **********Mr. Weinberger said the Russians ''presumably regret that they didn't get the sergeant'' who accompanied Major Nicholson on a picture-taking mission at Soviet military installation in East Germany.

''They apparently want a monopoly.'' **********The Pentagon report said the Soviet Union had more than 10,000 scientists and engineers working on laser weaponry. It said the Russians ''apparently believe'' that lasers, along with more remote technologies such as particle beams and radio frequency weapons, will be the future means both for attacking satellites and for defending against missiles. **********But the Pentagon acknowledged that the Soviet Union faced difficulties in turning lasers into a missile defense system. The report said that the operation of such a system ''is not likely in this century.'' **********The document included the first official reports of some new weapon developments. They were the flight test of an intermediate-range missile to replace the SS-20; signs of two experimental intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the first report and photograph of an advanced class of nuclear-powered attack submarine, the Akula. **********More SS-20's Reported Deployed **********The Pentagon report said the Russians were continuing to deploy SS-20's as the United States proceeded with its deployment of Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe. Pentagon officials said the number of SS-20's, each with three warheads, had increased from 378 a year ago to 414. **********In an expanded description of Soviet forces in Europe, the report spoke of two innovative ''operation maneuver groups'' that could be used for quick raids through enemy lines, and of a reorganization of the Soviet Air Force, reportedly intended to improve its capacity for a large-scale air attack. **********The report said that Soviet forces had stockpiled ammunition for 60 to 90 days in the western region, closest to Western Europe. That would compare with about 30 days of ammunition for American troops and only 5 to 10 days for the Western European allies. **********The report also said the Soviet Union was near deployment of two new ICBM's, the single-warhead SS-25 and the multiple-warhead SS-24. **********Soviet Calls Report 'Fiction' **********MOSCOW, April 2 (UPI) - The Soviet Union today dismissed as ''a fantastic piece of fiction'' a Pentagon report that said the Soviet Union was making rapid progress in arms technology. **********Tass, the official press agency, said the fourth edition of ''Soviet Military Power'' was aimed primarliy at persuading Congress to provide more money to the Pentagon. **********The agency said the 143-page book ''is a clearly fantastic piece of fiction, but absolutely not scientific, and to put it mildly, an unscrupulous one.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/22/business/winans-denies-money-offer-prompted-a-column.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1985-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Winans Denies Money Offer Prompted a Column", "print_headline": "Winans Denies Money Offer Prompted a Column", "body_text": " **********R. Foster Winans, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, denied in Federal District Court in Manhattan yesterday that the offer of money was one of the reasons that he wrote a particular column. That contradicted a sworn statement that he gave a year ago. **********Mr. Winans, who is on trial with two co-defendants for conspiracy and securities fraud, testified that the possibility of a big payoff from a stockbroker for a positive article about the Digital Switch Corporation ''had absolutely no influence on my news judgment or the news column that appeared.'' **********This rebutted his sworn statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission that ''it was a factor, yes.'' when he had been asked if the offer of a ''distribution'' of up to $100,000 ''was a factor in your determining to write the article.'' A tape recording of that statement was played in court yesterday. **********Mr. Winans said in his statement to the S.E.C. that a stockbroker, Peter N. Brant, had suggested that if the conspirators could make a killing on a particular stock, there could be distributions to each of them of as much as $50,000 or $100,000. Mr. Brant, a former broker with Kidder, Peabody & Company who has pleaded guilty to the government's charges, is the prosecution's chief witness. **********The Digital Switch Column **********The ''Heard on the Street'' column about Digital Switch written by Mr. Winans on Jan. 19, 1984, is the only one among several dozen in a stock trading scheme with Mr. Brant that the government thus far has contended was suggested by Mr. Brant. In its indictment, the government said that Mr. Brant had advised Mr. Winans that ''if he were able to sell his Digital Switch stock at a favorable price, the conspirators' volume of trading could increase.'' It added, ''Brant also suggested the basis for a favorable story about Digital Switch.'' **********Such a suggestion, Mr. Winans testified, was unique in the arrrangement he had with Mr. Brant. In the other cases, Mr. Brant bought a particular security only after receiving information from Mr. Winans that he intended to write about it. **********Mr. Winans acknowledged yesterday, as he had in his S.E.C. statement, that he got the idea for the Digital Switch column from Mr. Brant, but he said that he wrote it only after determining it was newsworthy and would stand on its own merit. **********He said he may have been ''mishearing the question'' from the S.E.C. investigator when he answered that Mr. Brant's inducement for writing a favorable article was a factor. On the day the column appeared, the price of Digital Switch's stock rose, enabling Mr. Brant to realize $11,250 more on his sale of 25,000 shares than he would have if he had sold at the previous day's closing price, the government has said. **********Two Unfavorable Stories **********To demonstrate Mr. Winans's independence from Mr. Brant on news judgment, Don Buchwald, Mr. Winans's lawyer, steered the testimony toward establishing that Mr. Winans had valid sources for his Jan. 19 article. On two other occasions, even though Mr. Brant or his clients owned large amounts of Digital Switch's stock, Mr. Winans testified, he wrote articles unfavorable to the company. After one appeared, Mr. Brant called to complain and ''I told him news is news,'' Mr. Winans said. **********Mr. Buchwald also sought to establish that Mr. Brant had a pressing reason for suggesting the tipoff arrangement. In questioning Mr. Winans, Mr. Buchwald showed that Mr. Brant and David W.C. Clark, one of his biggest clients whose profits and losses he shared, had seen the value of one of their biggest holdings plunge just before meeting with Mr. Winans on Oct. 12, 1983. It was at that meeting in the lounge of the Racquet and Tennis Club in Manhattan that Mr. Brant first suggested the idea of trading on the basis of advance information on his columns, Mr. Winans testified on Tuesday. **********The trial was recessed until Monday, when Mr. Buchwald is expected to finish questioning Mr. Winans and cross-examination by Assistant United States Attorney Peter Romatowski is likely to begin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/26/business/getting-fannie-mae-in-shape.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1985-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GETTING FANNIE MAE IN SHAPE", "print_headline": "GETTING FANNIE MAE IN SHAPE", "body_text": " **********The news that the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Paul A. Volcker, relayed in May 1981 could not have been more disturbing to David O. Maxwell, the new chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association. During their introductory lunch, Mr. Volcker said that Fannie Mae, as Mr. Maxwell's institution is known, was fast losing the confidence of big investors in its new debt issues. **********''He was concerned,'' said Mr. Maxwell, who until then had not been aware of the depth of the impending crisis. ''He asked that I look into it.'' **********It turns out that Fannie Mae did manage to continue to sell new debt -but just barely. With interest rates at historic peaks, Fannie Mae, which buys home mortgages from financial institutions so they can make new loans, was losing more than $1 million a day on its existing mortgages. Fannie Mae's purchases of new loans were also unprofitable. **********Picture Is Now Brighter **********Now, four and a half years later, the picture from Fannie Mae is brighter. For the first time since 1979, the company is reporting a positive spread, or profit, on its portfolio of mortgages. Fannie Mae also has reduced its sensitivity to interest-rate swings, is depending more on steadier fee income and has begun a successful program of selling and guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities. **********To be sure, challenges remain. Fannie Mae's loan losses continue alarmingly high. Mr. Maxwell has been unable to stem heavy turnover in the executive suite (both the president and the chief financial officer have resigned in recent years) and the company faces an identification problem - many Americans either have never heard of Fannie Mae or confuse it with a Chicago candy company, Fannie May. **********This identity crisis is surprising. With nearly $97 billion in assets, Fannie Mae is the nation's third-largest corporation. After the Treasury, it is the largest borrower in the capital markets. And it owns or guarantees 10 percent of the nation's home loans. **********Fannie Mae was created by Congress in 1938 to provide money to the housing industry by buying up home loans from banks, savings and loans, and mortgage bankers. Although it was sold to the public in 1968 and its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, many investors still view Fannie Mae as a Government agency - because it still has a Federal mandate to buy home loans in good times or bad. That has prompted calls for heavier regulation. **********Even with problems, however, Fannie Mae has made significant progress, Wall Street professionals say. **********Preparing 'to Do Better' **********''Maxwell is preparing the company to do better in the future,'' said Gary Gordon, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********For decades, Fannie Mae operated in the black because the returns on mortgages it bought generally exceeded what it paid for money. Even in the mid-1970's, when high interest rates produced widespread loan defaults, Fannie Mae was able to stay ahead because rapid inflation in home prices enabled it to recover its money in foreclosure. **********The 1980's, however, brought twin evils for Fannie Mae. Record-high interest rates meant that Fannie Mae had to finance a portfolio of fixed-rate, low-paying mortgages with some of the most expensive money ever. Then, the slowdown in the rate that housing prices were rising - and the outright decline in prices in some areas - meant Fannie Mae could no longer look to the proceeds from the sale of a foreclosed home to recover its investment. The resulting losses were enormous. In 1981 and 1982, Fannie Mae's ''negative spread'' -the difference between what it earned on mortgages and its cost of funds -approached $1 billion. **********''Every mortgage we acquired was underwater from the moment we bought it,'' Mr. Maxwell said in an interview at his offices here earlier this month. ''We had to build a new type of portfolio, and we had to do it fast.'' **********Much of Fannie Mae's subsequent efforts have thus been aimed at revamping its balance sheet to make the corporation less vulnerable to the vagaries of interest rates. **********Stretching Out Long-Term Debt **********To reduce the effect of sudden surges in rates, Fannie Mae has been steadily stretching out maturities of its own i.o.u.'s - to nearly six years for the $36 billion in long-term debt issued in the 11 months ended Dec. 1, a much longer maturity than is typical for a financial institution. **********To make sure it earns a market return on the mortgages it buys, the company has been increasingly buying adjustable-rate mortgages, whose yields fluctuate with market rates. At June 30, they stood at 20 percent of Fannie Mae's loan portfolio, up from 15 percent a year earlier. **********Most important, Fannie Mae has been relying more and more on fee income. Commitment fees that Fannie Mae receives for agreeing to buy mortgages more than doubled in the nine months ended Sept. 30, to $145.8 million. Fees that it receives to guarantee payment of principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities will reach an estimated $107 million in 1985, up from $16 million in 1982. **********The result, say experts on financial institutions, has been a marked reduction in Fannie Mae's susceptibility to swings in credit costs. Although the company lost money in two of the last three years, it earned $16.4 million, or 24 cents a share, in the nine months ended Sept. 30, with most of the profits coming from fee income. Despite rising loan losses, which were cited for a drop in the price of its stock in recent days, Fannie Mae's shares still closed at $25 a share on Tuesday, considerably better than its level in mid-1984, when it traded as low as $10. **********''Maxwell has definitely moved more steadfastly and aggressively than previous management in addressing Fannie Mae's problems,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. **********Mr. Maxwell's Role **********Indeed, if Fannie Mae does come roaring back, most experts agree much of the credit will belong to Mr. Maxwell, a soft-spoken chief executive who was chairman and chief executive of the Ticor Mortgage Insurance Company before taking charge of Fannie Mae. From 1970 to 1973, he was general counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. **********Mr. Maxwell's steps to whip Fannie Mae back into shape, however, have not been without controversy. Some analysts say that, in opting to buy adjustable-rate mortgages, Mr. Maxwell has exposed Fannie Mae to a greater peril: large numbers of mortgages going sour. **********So far, no one has proved that adjustable loans are the root of the problems. But the company has reported a frightening surge in its number of foreclosed properties: It now owns nearly eight million homes, up from three million in December 1983. Losses on those foreclosures have also soared: from $38 million in 1983 to an estimated $109 million this year. And it is still not clear how large Fannie Mae's losses will be as a result of its decision to buy roughly $100 million in mortgages from the Equity Programs Investment Corporation, the real estate syndicator whose collapse last summer roiled the financial markets. **********''Fannie Mae may be in better shape, but the company has traded one risk for another,'' said Mark Alpert, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Tougher Rules for Home Buyers **********Mr. Maxwell's response, made earlier this year, was to tighten the rules under which Fannie Mae will buy loans. Essentially, the company said that the loans it bought would have to have a larger down payment or the down payment could be kept at 5 percent but the home buyer would face tougher income requirements. **********The new rules caused an uproar in the housing world, where many argued that the changes would cause a reduction in home sales and starts. The National Association of Home Builders said there was ''no particular evidence'' that persons who devote more of their income to housing are more apt to default. And the National Association of Realtors said Fannie Mae's problem was not low down payments but bad appraisals. **********Mr. Maxwell, however, insists the tighter rules were necessary to protect the home buyers from burdensome mortgages and to shield Fannie Mae from bad loans as it continues to dig itself out of a deep hole. **********As one measure of the progress made, Wall Street analysts and Mr. Maxwell himself say Fannie Mae will again be in the black this year. The profit, Mr. Maxwell said, won't be a record, but considering where the company was four years ago, there will be cause for encouragement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/business/finance-minister-quits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Finance Minister Quits", "print_headline": "Finance Minister Quits", "body_text": " **********Colombian Finance Minister Roberto Junguito has resigned and has been replaced by central bank governor Hugo Palacios, President Belisario Betancur said tonight.

''We continue to share this wish, which is also our duty.'' **********But John Paul, who is a traditionalist on church doctrine, also reiterated a view widely held among conservatives: that a proper appreciation of the Vatican Council depended on being wary of misreadings of its documents and intentions. **********''It is necessary to announce at this moment, before all, in a strong and unified voice, certain things about the Second Vatican Council and the heritage of its copious body of work,'' the Pope said, ''so that we can overcome any false interpretations.'' **********Other Faiths **********John Paul also declared his commitment to ecumenical openings to other Christians. And in a passage that Vatican officials said was added only in a final draft, he also made a special call for fellowship with Moslems and Jews. **********The Pope said the church was a symbol of ''intimate union with God, and of unity with the entire human family.'' **********This, he said, demanded that the church pursue ''relations and rapport with all men of good will,'' including ''those who profess non-Christian religions.'' **********He said this was important ''especially with those who profess a monotheistic faith, as for example the Moslems, and in a special way with those who are most closely joined to us because of the divine revelation of the Old Testament.'' **********In his speech, the Pope referred to three major conclusions reached by the bishops during their deliberations. These are included in a report that the Pope said he would release publicly. **********Break With Recent Practice **********The decision to make the report public marked a break with recent practice and with an important symbol of the Synod's assertion of its own independent voice. **********''The Synod was to have voted on whether to ask the Pope to make the report public,'' said the Rev. Diarmuid Martin, a Vatican spokesman, ''but the Pope precluded the balloting by saying he would do so on his own.'' **********Father Martin said the Pope's announcement won prolonged appluase and reflected the wishes of an ''overwhelming majority'' of the bishops. **********In his address, the Pope referred to the Synod's call for a universal catachism as a guidebook for local churches; a study of the theological basis of national conferences of bishops, and a new code of canon law for Eastern Rite churches. The Eastern Rite churches maintain allegiance to the Pope, but follow practices similar to those of the Orthodox churches. **********A Compromise **********The call for the catechism and for the study of the role of conferences of bishops reflected a kind of compromise at the Synod. **********Church liberals had sought to emphasize the role of national bishops' conferences partly as a way of emphasizing diversity and some autonomy from Rome. **********Conservatives, who were joined eventually by some liberals and many African bishops, had sought the universal catechism as a way of clearing up what they saw as errors and misinterpretations of church doctrine. **********In his comments, the Pope expressed his satisfaction at the outcome of the Synod. He said it served as a sign of ''variety in unity'' and noted that each bishop had been ''able to express freely his own thoughts.'' **********Vatican officials expressed satisfaction, and in some cases relief, that the Synod was ending on a note of unity. **********Bridging Differences **********The church is sharply divided over matters ranging from basic doctrine to sexual morality and politics. But while the bishops at the Synod expressed a wide range of viewpoints, they appeared eager to avoid overt clashes and moved to bridge their differences. **********A Vatican official said the Synod demonstrated that neither the Pope nor Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the conservative prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, intended to ''roll back'' Vatican II."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/20/business/an-ice-cream-wins-japanese.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1985-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 983, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AN ICE CREAM WINS JAPANESE", "print_headline": "AN ICE CREAM WINS JAPANESE", "body_text": " **********To be young and fashionable in Tokyo this summer is to be seen with a Haagen-Dazs ice cream cone. **********In the swank neighborhoods of Harajuku and Aoyama, where teen-agers flock on weekends to parade their designer clothes, lines stretch outside the red-and-white ice cream shops. Outside one of them, young men in oversized linen jackets or black leather pants strut about, their tough look undermined by the ice cream cones in their hands. **********''I guess people who chase after fashion like this ice cream,'' said Masanobu Endo, a 26-year-old computer games designer who hastened to say he was only eating Haagen-Dazs because he liked it. **********All quite a tribute in a country where 88 percent of those in a recent poll could not think of a single American product they would buy. Indeed, Haagen-Dazs, made in Woodbridge, N.J., and introduced here a year ago, has scored a quick success in a market that many other American companies have found excessively frustrating. 4,000 People a Day While Suntory Ltd., Haagen-Dazs's joint-venture partner, will not disclose the company's sales, it estimates that each of its three shops serves about 4,000 people a day, 5,000 on weekends. **********At the minimum price of 76 cents for a single-scoop cone, this comes to at least $9,120 a day. Signs advertising pints and quarts of Haagen-Dazs (pronounced ha-gen-da-tsu in Japan) appear in coffee shops and groceries around the city, in areas where it is rare to see other foreign products. **********It is early to judge whether this year's ice cream fad will be next year's cliche. But Haagen-Dazs appears to have gained its running start by following what marketing analysts have identified as the keys to success in the demanding Japanese marketplace - being the first to present a ''new'' product, maintaining high quality and working with Japanese assistance. **********Like successful American fast-food outlets here, such as MacDonald's or Mr. Donut, Haagen-Dazs entrusted operating responsibility to Japanese partners. Fifty percent of Haagen-Dazs Japan is owned by Pillsbury (Haagen-Dazs's American owner), 40 percent is owned by Suntory Ltd. and 10 percent by a Japanese dairy company. **********The Marketing Focus **********Suntory is known in Japan for its marketing skills. Understanding the Japanese taste for the new and exclusive, Suntory set about positioning Haagen-Dazs as the ice cream for the young, affluent and fashion-conscious. The Japanese are believed to have a special weakness for brand names: The Gucci belt, the Louis Vuitton bag or the Ralph Lauren shirt are almost regulation attire. And it is no small measure of Suntory's marketing flair that it has managed to convince many Japanese that Haagen-Dazs can be for ice cream what Arnold Palmer is for golf accessories. **********''It's the designer ice cream,'' said Kuninobu Nakajima, assistant manager in Suntory's marketing division. **********American ice cream was already well known here. Baskin-Robbins's 31 Flavors has branches throughout Japan, and and Frusen Gladje is also distributed. But Suntory labored to set Haagen-Dazs apart as a luxury ice cream. **********It worked to create that image in several ways. First, the company billed Haagen-Dazs as a new product - a ''superpremium,'' rich-tasting ice cream in a country where much of the ice cream tastes, to put it kindly, like watered-down ice milk. For consumers who insist on top quality, Haagen-Dazs pointed to its all-natural ingredients and its carefully monitored factory in Gumma prefecture. **********The company decided early not to do any direct advertising, relying instead on word-of-mouth. ''We didn't want the message to get to everybody,'' said Tamio Yamamoto, manager of outlets for Haagen-Dazs Japan. ''We targeted it at the 18-to-35 year-old age group, the rich and fashion-conscious.'' **********Gradual Expansion **********So the group opened the first store in Aoyama, a chic district known for its fine stores and French restaurants. Later it expanded to Harajuku, a trendier, younger area, and then to Yokohama, a neighboring city. Although additional shops are planned, Mr. Yamamoto does not want to build too many, for fear that the ice cream will lose its cachet. **********While Haagen-Dazs is aimed at the affluent, it is priced for all. A single-scoop cone, at 76 cents, is less expensive than the $1-plus price that the ice cream generally commands in the United States. In addition, while other luxury ice creams usually sell at $4.26 a pint, Mr. Yamamoto said, Haagen-Dazs is priced at $3.40. **********And the most-popular Haagen-Dazs flavor in Japan? Vanila, same as in the United States. **********Mamoru Kato, executive managing director of the Japan Ice Cream Assocation, said Haagen-Dazs had capitalized on the growing popularity of rich-tasting ice cream among Japanese youth. The ice cream market in this country is about $2 billion. Not only was the idea of a luxury ice cream a relative novelty, he said, but Haagen-Dazs was the first to introduce a variety of toppings, which are popular at all its shops. **********The company's first customers were foreigners who knew about Haagen-Dazs, or Japanese who had sampled the ice cream on trips to Hawaii, Mr. Yamamoto said. It was not unknown for Japanese tourists to board planes with quarts of Haagen-Dazs packed in dry ice for the trip home. **********The word spread. Now, Mr. Kato said, Haagen-Dazs is quite popular among its target customers. ''Ice cream has become a prop for young people's performance on the streets of such fashionable towns as Aoyama, Harajuku and Roppongi,'' Mr. Kato said, referring to their parading. ''To just eat Haagen-Dazs is less valuable than to walk on the streets while eating Haagen-Dazs.'' **********At least for some people. At Harajuku the other day, 16-year-old Makiko Kunita stood demurely in place as she ate her ice cream cone. ''My mother always told me that it was bad manners to eat and walk at the same time,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/12/world/no-headline-074141.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1985-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Last weekend, when the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Yankees to clinch the Eastern Division of the American League, it was as if Canada's biggest city had come of age. For Torontoans, the baseball team's successes in two of the first three playoff games against the Kansas City Royals has only heightened the sensation. **********''It wasn't just that the Blue Jays had achieved the improbable,'' said Trent Frayne, who writes a sports column for The Globe and Mail. ''It was also that they'd beat the Yankees to do it, the damn Yankees, a team that has become a legend in America's game, a game that each year becomes a little more Canadian too.'' **********Last Monday, 25,000 screaming baseball fans gathered at a rally in front of City Hall. The screech of bagpipes was a reminder of the dour Scots who settled this place; the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario conveyed greetings from Queen Elizbeth, and Brenda Lee's rendition of ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' was roundly applauded - a far cry from the boos that greeted ''O Canada'' at Yankee Stadium three weeks ago. **********The way the politicians were talking, one would have thought the Jays had already defeated the Royals for the pennant and moved on to the World Series. In Toronto, it seems to have been forgotten that the Montreal Expos reached the National League playoffs in 1981, only to lose. **********''I remind you that this is the first time there has been a real World Series, and this time Canada will win!'' shouted David Peterson, the Premier of Ontario, smartly attired in a Jays warmup jacket. **********Mayor Arthur Eggleton says he has never seen enthusiasm as high in Toronto. In addition to ''Blue Jay fever,'' he says a big part of the reason is a giant new development project he has championed. **********At 3:30 Tuesday morning, the Toronto City Council gave its final approval to a $2 billion plan to turn 200 acres of railroad tracks into offices, apartments, stores and, most pertinent to today's obsessions, a $150 million domed sports stadium. **********In an interview, Mr. Eggleton exuded superlatives about the project, which will ultimately link downtown Toronto with Lake Ontario. He called it ''massive in scope, but people-oriented in scale,'' promising it would be ''alive by night and by day.'' **********If that sounds like campaign rhetoric, it is. The Mayor is running for his third term in an election set for Nov. 12. His opponent is a classic Toronto reformer, Anne Johnston, an Alderman for 13 years. **********In the style of Jane Jacobs, the urban expert who moved here from New York in the late 1960's, Mrs. Johnston prefers small to big, demands that any project include more low-income housing than the rail lands proposal and worries that the whole thing will inexorably lead to the north-south freeway that community activists here have fought for years. **********''I think it stinks,'' Mrs. Johnston said. **********Her views are supported by more than 100 petitions to the Ontario provincial government to reverse the City Council decision, as well as by downtown ministers who on Sunday urged their parishoners to oppose the project unless more housing is included. **********Once, many residents say, this city of 2.1 million had a reputation for being safe, clean and a bit boring. **********With a murder rate one-eighteenth that of Detroit, it still seems safe. **********That it is clean was evident earlier this year when Sonny Grosso, the director of a movie being filmed here, ordered up a pile of garbage to make a street scene look more like New York. When the film crew came back from a coffee break, they found city workers had cleaned up the trash. Mr. Grosso had to order more. Toronto is certainly no longer boring. The principal reason is the waves of immigrants who have transformed what was once viewed a sort of New World Glasgow, straitjacketed in prudish Presbyterianism. Nearly a majority of Toronto residents were born outside Canada, and 56 languages are spoken here. **********The transplanting and rubbing together of cultures sometimes leads to tensions. The fastest growing group, those from the Indian subcontinent, have brought their ancient animosities here. A few members of the second most rapidly growing group, the Chinese, have kept Hong Kong gangs alive on the streets of Toronto. **********More often, the results are positive, sometimes even beautiful. In June, the United Way of Greater Toronto invited the Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar to perform. She filled 12,000 seats, raising $150,000 for the charity. **********On Sunday, at Hanlan's Point on Toronto Island in the middle of this city's harbor, a plaque was unveiled. It honored Babe Ruth's first home run as a professional. **********On Sept. 5, 1914, the Babe swatted a three-run homer over the right-field fence into Lake Ontario, a sort of afterthought to the one-hit game he was in the process of pitching. The 19-year-old was playing for the Providence Grays, a minor league club. **********The commemoration of America's greatest baseball hero did strive for a bit of Canadian flavor. The Maple Leaf was proudly flown, and bagpipes, of course, were played. Still, the event served to underline what sometimes seems to be Canada's schizoid relationship with its southern neighbor. **********Although no Canadians wear the powder blue Jay uniforms, the team is without doubt the hottest ticket in town. Exhibition games of the Maple Leafs, Toronto's legendary hockey club, drew smaller crowds than usual. Canadian football, which, with its own rules, has been called the only true Canadian sport, is also down. **********Then there is the matter of some Toronto residents' feeling compelled to satisfy all those silly American preconceptions about Canada. Some have suggested importing snow for the World Series from Buffalo, which gets a lot more of the stuff. Others think it might tickle American fancies to put out the word that up here, the pitchers' bullpen is known as the moosepen. **********Still others find the whole affair deliciously ironic. **********''We are proud of our country and demonstrate it by going to American movies, watching American television and cheering madly for Americans we have hired to play America's national pastime,'' wrote the columnist Joey Slinger in The Toronto Star.

The well-publicized differences had threatened to split the party just five months before the elections. **********''There are no significant disagreements in the orientations for the near future,'' Michel Rocard, the leader of a strong minority in the party that has been questioning traditional party doctrine, said after the announcement this morning. ''This shows that the modernization of Socialism is proceeding well in our minds and in our texts.'' **********The party congress, held five months before legislative elections scheduled for March 1986, was marked by rousing speeches and thunderous applause, traditional ingredients of the gathering, held every two years. **********'Comrade' Used in Greeting **********Reflecting the origins of the party in the Marxist Third International, from which it has markedly departed over the decades, delegates called each other ''comrade,'' and the speeches were filled with slogans about solidarity, the Socialist transformation of society and greater rights for ''those who are excluded.'' **********Still, as the conference approached, the Socialists were widely seen as having to deal with several new circumstances. **********For one, the meeting was the first since the French Communist Party, which for 12 years participated in a ''union of the left'' with the Socialists, split from the Government and went into virulent opposition. **********Indeed, one theme of the congress, stated by leaders of several party factions, was that the Communists were in what one called an ''irremediable decline.'' If true, that makes the strategy of leftist unity that had enabled the Socialists to become the majority power in Parliament is a thing of the past. **********Secondly, the meeting came during a deep debate by two factions over several of the fundamental tenets of French Socialism. **********Differences in Approach **********On one side are mostly traditionalist members, led by the party's secretary general, Lionel Jospin, who said the platform should stress the party's successes of four years in power. **********Mr. Jospin had maintained the more standard leftist line by appealling to the main Socialist constituency of workers, salaried people and intellectuals. He has also contended that the party must maintain itself as a clear leftist alternative to capture voters disillusioned with the Communists. **********The other Socialist faction is a smaller but rapidly growing group, led by Mr. Rocard, a former Minister of Agriculture who is one of this country's most popular political figures. In votes held by local party federations on alternative platforms before the party congress, Mr. Rocard increased his strength and emerged as a strong candidate for the presidential nomination in 1988. **********In various statements in the last few months, Mr. Rocard has said the policies of economic austerity followed by the French Government since 1983 represent a shift in party policies that should be openly recognized. He has said that only by acknowledging that the party has made ''mistakes,'' and at the same time emphasizing that it has changed its fundamental direction, can it regain credibility with the electorate. **********Strong Contrasts Emerge **********The difference between the two men appeared clearly in their speeches here this weekend. Mr. Jospin, in an address on Friday that was wildly applauded by the 1,400 delegates, called for ''renewal, but not renovation'' of the party. He maintained that while parts of the party program could change, the basic appeal to ''the majority on the left'' should not be altered. **********By contrast, Mr. Rocard suggested that the party had already changed its basic economic policies away from spending on social programs and had adopted an attitude of austerity. **********''It is necessary to finish once and for all with the notion that there can be one discourse for Socialism in opposition and another for Socialism in the Government; one for management and the other for utopia,'' he said. **********The platform compromise announced this morning after all-night negotiations was praised today by both men as having preserved the party from a serious split. **********The new program combines elements drawn from Mr. Rocard and Mr. Jospin, often obscuring their differences by changes in wording. One important section says the party will not serve as a ''backup force'' for the rightist opposition, whatever the results of the March elections. **********Polls show the Socialists are virtually certain to lose their majority in Parliament, and that some combination of rightist parties are expected to gain the right to form a new Government. **********Facing that prospect, some members of the Socialist Party have argued that the party should try to forge a coalition with one of the rightist groups. This notion was opposed by Mr. Jospin, whose view seems to have prevailed in the platform adopted today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/business/charter-settles-sec-charge-on-inflated-profits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHARTER SETTLES S.E.C.

Those holding policies from the Charter Security Life Insurance companies of New York, New Jersey and Louisiana will now have them guaranteed by Metropolitan, the nation's second-largest life insurance company. **********In settling charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Charter neither admitted nor denied guilt but accepted findings that it had inflated its profits for the years 1981, 1982 and 1983 by a total of $28.7 million, or 29.6 percent of the $96.9 million reported. **********The commission said Charter had inflated its profits by improperly accounting for its sales of single-premium annuities. The company was not, however, forced to restate its past profits, apparently because it had filed for bankruptcy. It will have to make note of the settlement in the next annual report. **********$7 Million Cost Cited **********In a second charge, the commission said the company had not properly disclosed the $7 million cost it incurred when, in 1981, it exchanged some outstanding annuities for those paying higher interest. **********In a brief release, Charter, which is based in Jacksonville, Fla., acknowledged the settlement and its terms but offered no further comment. **********Charter, whose roots were in oil refining and marketing, diversified into insurance and began selling single- premium deferred annuities in 1979. By 1983, it had become the largest writer of these policies for individuals. **********With one of these annuities, an investor pays a lump sum; taxes are not paid on the interest that accumulates until withdrawals start, usually at retirement. Charter sold about 190,000 of these policies with a value of $4.5 billion. Redemptions have since reduced the number to 130,000 policies that total $3.1 billion. **********Accounting Challenged **********Charter's accounting for the annuities was what the Securities and Exchange Commission challenged. It said the company had accounted for the policies as if they were insurance products instead of investment contracts. **********As such, whenever Charter sold an annuity, it immediately booked 35 percent of the profit that it expected to earn over the life of the policy. The commission said the profits should not have been recognized until they were actually earned. **********The commission said Charter overstated profits in 1981 by $6.2 million, in 1982 by $16 million and in 1983 by $6.5 million. In those years, Charter reported net income of $7.7 million, $35.3 million and $53.9 million, respectively. **********The commission did not name Peat Marwick, Charter's auditor, in its complaint.

The 3.2 million A.T.&T. stockholders received one share in each of the seven regionals for every 10 shares of A.T.&T. they held while retaining their original number of the parent company's shares. **********The last day that A.T.&T. traded in the form of the ''package'' containing all the pieces was Feb. 15, 1984, when the old stock finished at a price of $63.50. **********As of yesterday's market close, investors who simply held onto their A.T.&T. and accepted the regional companies' stock owned a package worth $84.44, according to Neil D. Yelsey, telecommunications analyst for Salomon Brothers. **********''Moreover, the total return in a period of slightly more than 15 months amounted to 43.32 percent,'' he said. ''This compares with a total return of 26.43 percent for the S.&P. 500-stock index.'' Total return includes dividends as well as price appreciation. **********Initially, a generous dividend payout in the context of a jittery stock market lent luster to the shares of the regional holding companies. As late as last July, for example, their average yield was around 9.4 percent. **********More recently, the persistent decline in interest rates has buoyed the shares of these companies, which have moved to record prices. Their yields now average slightly more than 7 percent. In the first quarter of 1985, after adjustment for nonrecurring items, earnings rose for all seven companies. **********''We expect the group's earnings to continue to increase, with second-quarter earnings advancing by 10 percent from the year-earlier period and 3.3 percent from the first quarter,'' Mr. Yelsey said. ''Full-year earnings on average should rise by 9 percent from 1984 and by an additional 6.6 percent in 1986.'' **********Over the next 6 to 12 months, Salomon Brothers expects most of the Bell regionals to match the performance of the S.&P. 500.

His favorites are BellSouth, Pacific Telesis, Nynex and U S West. **********''We remain constructive toward the Bell regional stocks while recognizing that they have dramatically outperformed the market in the past 15 months,'' Merrill Lynch said. The firm's telecommunications team of Leonard S. Hyman, Richard C. Toole and Rosemary Avellis rates all seven regionals - as well as the slimmed-down A.T.&T. - as ''O.K. to buy.'' The analysts also cited ''healthy dividend increases'' declared earlier this year by all seven regional companies. **********The present version of A.T.&T. has gained favor in the investment community while holding its annual dividend payout to $1.20 a share. In mid-1984, the stock sold as low as $14.875. On Monday it hit a new high of $24.25 and finished yesterday at $23.625, down 37.5 cents. The shares yield about 5 percent. But Alice J. Bradie, an analyst at E.F. Hutton & Company, said that a key appeal of A.T.&T. is its technological expertise in entering new fields, such as communications-based equipment. **********A.T.&T. earned $1.25 a share in 1984. Merrill Lynch estimates this year's profit at $1.75 to $2 a share, while Salomon Brothers sees earnings of $1.80 a share. Miss Bradie of Hutton, whose estimate is well above the Wall Street consensus, said earnings could reach $2.15 a share. **********Before the divestiture, A.T.&T. stockholders had the option of exchanging their shares, for a fee, for units of the Americus Trust. This trust was formed essentially to let the shareholders separate the potential for capital appreciation from the right to receive dividends. The trust units were themselves separated into ''Prime'' and ''Score'' components, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange along with the units. All three securities recently set new highs. **********Holders of Prime certificates, the conservative component, receive essentially all dividends paid by the underlying common shares. They will get the first $75 of principal value in the form of underlying stock when the trust terminates Oct. 24, 1988. Holders of Score, who are betting on a rise in share prices, will get all the market appreciation above $75 - also in the form of stock. **********Within the last 52 weeks, Prime traded as low as $53.75. It closed yesterday at $70.125, off 12.5 cents. Score finished at $12.75, down 25 cents. This compared with its 52-week low of $4.625. **********''Given the current level of interest rates, Score is undervalued relative to Prime,'' said A.

As in 1984, low inflation is widely cited as a reason that rates will not rise much, but there is disagreement about whether low inflation will be enough to produce lower bond yields by year- end. **********''Interest rates and the Fed's posture the past few years can be explained just by looking at the economy,'' said Michael Bazdarich, vice president of the Claremont Economics Institute. Money-supply growth and the strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets are closely studied by economists, but do not seem to have had as much influence on the course of interest rates as the waxing and waning of economic activity have had. **********Last year, for example, when the economy grew at a rate of more than 8 percent after inflation in the first half of the year, both short- and long- term rates were rising through the end of May. Bond yields began declining in late May, though short-term rates did not turn down until September, when the Fed began easing monetary policy amid signs of a weakening economy. **********The recession predicted by some economists by late 1984 never materialized, and most forecasts now call for the economy to expand through 1985. Intra-year fluctuations in the economy are hard to predict, but many forecasters expect growth to be more evenly distributed through the year than in 1984 when quarterly growth rates ranged from more than 10 percent in the first quarter to less than 2 percent in the third quarter. Whether evenly paced economic growth is translated into less volatile interest rates remains to be seen. **********Paul W. Boltz, vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore money management firm, concluded in a recent issue of Credit Market Comments that the rebound in economic activity is not likely to cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy, nor are the strength of the dollar and low inflation likely to cause the Fed to ease policy. ''The Fed has apparently managed to nudge the economy to the promised land of 'sustainable economic growth,' and it is not expected to adopt any sharp policy changes as long as the economy does not slow down or speed up too much,'' he said. **********But the absence of any major shifts in monetary policy by the Fed has not been enough to keep rates on an even keel. **********Beginning in about mid-January, the Fed stopped fostering lower interest rates (although it has not tightened policy enough to make bank reserves noticeably scarcer), and short-term rates have increased. Three-month Treasury bills, for example, are quoted at about 8.4 percent, up from 8.15 percent last Tuesday and 7.68 percent Jan. 22. In the long-term bond market, the new 11 1/4 percent Treasury issue due in 2015 was offered Friday with a yield of 11.70 percent, up from 11.21 percent as recently as Feb. 14, but only modestly higher than the 11 1/2 percent yield for 30-year issues in mid-January. **********''We expected the Fed to tighten policy by spring, but it looks like the market has done the job for them,'' Mr. Bazdarich said. Short- and long- term interest rates will continue to rise through most of this year, he said, ''though a decline in inflation to less than 3 percent'' will keep bond yields from rising sharply. Higher prices and lower yields for bonds are still probable over the long term, he said, though the pattern of rising rates this year ''make it advisable that investors be defensive and shorten maturities.'' **********Much of the rise in bond yields has been attributed to the lackluster investor demand for new 10-year and 30-year Treasury issues sold in early February and the willingness of many institutional investors to sell bonds. Because of the brighter prospects for the economy, Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners, a securities firm, said many investors and traders ''appear to be shifing their focus of attention from favorable inflation prospects to the likely upward yield pressures that are normally generated by a strengthening economy, excessive monetary growth and expanding private credit demands on top of still huge Treasury financing requirements.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/29/business/advertising-bad-news-from-red-lobster.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 595, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising;   'Bad News' From Red Lobster", "print_headline": "Advertising;   'Bad News' From Red Lobster", "body_text": " **********RED LOBSTER INNS OF AMERICA, the only General Mills division to achieve its profit objectives in fiscal year 1985, will move its advertising to another agency in February. **********Backer & Spielvogel, which helped move the country's largest ''dinner house'' system of restaurants to record sales of $827 million, is being replaced by Grey Advertising.

Balestra, a 33-year-old working mother of three who lives in Pelham, N.Y., is aware of Philip Morris Inc.'s recent agreement to buy the General Foods Corporation. She also knows that the nearly $5.8 billion deal is only the latest of many takeovers that have occurred in the food industry in recent years. **********Is she concerned that this acquisition binge may affect her choices at the supermarket and the prices she has to pay for food? **********''Nope,'' said Mrs. Balestra. ''As a consumer, it's not going to affect me. If Philip Morris takes over General Foods and Jell-O goes up a nickel, I'll just buy Royal Pudding or a store brand. I don't care about the takeovers. **********''If I were a stockholder,'' she added, ''I would be a lot more interested. It is on that level that the drama is being played out.'' **********Mrs. Balestra has a point: Despite all the billions of dollars that have gone into food mergers, grocery shelves seem remarkably unchanged. There may be a new product here and there or a few cents added to or subtracted from the price of a favorite item. For better or worse, however, the overall shape of the American consumer products industry remains much the same - an industry dominated by a host of giant corporations, each with its own pantry of brands, all bolstered by heavy advertising. **********Fierce competition has generally characterized the grocery field, and virtually no one, including consumer advocates, sees signs that the competition is abating. **********''It's just going to be a battle of bigger giants,'' said Philip Kotler, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. **********To be sure, the mergers have brought some changes. But many of the biggest represent shifts within the business world and remain mostly invisible from the outside. Grocers may find that one particular company or another now commands a few more inches of shelf space. Madison Avenue agencies may applaud the extra advertising money a bigger company can pour into establishing a product, and they recognize the bigger discounts it may be able to command on rates. And people who work for the consumer products companies -managers and employees alike -may find their lives changed. **********Why do huge mergers of consumer product companies seem to have had little effect on consumers? And what about the worries of consumer advocates that growing dominance by a handful of companies in any industry spells trouble for the buying public? Corporations' Costs Vs. Consumer Needs Consumer advocates warn of bureaucratic, unresponsive corporate giants doing less for consumers while charging them more. Noting that Philip Morris is borrowing billions of dollars to buy General Foods, for instance, they question whether profits that might have gone into developing better products will instead go toward paying off debt. **********''Whenever you see the trend of consolidation, there has to be concern,'' said Joan B. Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, the consumer lobbying group founded by Ralph Nader. **********Economic theory suggests that there should be something to what the consumer advocates say - that consolidation should have wide repercussions. Marketing experts see some strong reasons to fear that the emergence of huge consumer-products companies will lead to higher prices. **********For one thing, as the behemoths grow in size, so does their bargaining clout with big supermarket chains. That situation, that, Professor Kotler noted, makes it harder for supermarkets to demand price concessions, and at least some of them could be passed along to consumers. **********Other analysts maintain that as big national companies buy up regional companies and then spend huge amounts to turn regional products into national ones, consumers will end up footing the bill. Consumers do pay a steep premium for nationally advertised food brands, according to a study by Willard F. Mueller, professor of agricultural economics and law at the University of Wisconsin and former chief economist of the Federal Trade Commission. **********One reason consumers have not seen striking changes like these is the fact that while the concentration of consumer goods companies has increased, it has not increased so much that the level of competition has diminished significantly. Tire and Beer Prices After Consolidation Five companies now control the tire market, for example, but consumers would never know it - price cutting has been the hallmark of that industry in recent years. **********The same is true of beer in the 15 years since Philip Morris entered that industry by buying the Miller Brewing Company. Philip Morris significantly stepped up beer advertising expenditures, turning Miller into the No. 2 brand. There has been dramatic consolidation but not dramatic price increases. **********''Just because you have what looks like an oligopolistic structure, with six brewers now controlling 94 percent of the market, doesn't mean you have an oligopoly,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. Since 1970, beer prices have doubled while consumer prices overall have tripled. As for variety, an influx of beer imports has meant many choices. **********Another reason why mergers do not seem to have sent prices of consumer goods soaring, as economic theory might imply, is that weak commodity prices, low-priced imports and the low level of general inflation have helped keep a lid on prices, at least for now. Grocery prices, for example, have risen only about 10 percent since 1981. **********Yet another reason that some of the dire predictions about mergers have not materialized, corporate executives say, is because there are benefits to be achieved through combinations, even though these often remain invisible to consumers. They mention such things as the efficiency of combined operations, resulting in lower costs, and the ability to conduct more research and development, resulting in the introduction of more products. A Merged Company's New List of Products Nabisco Brands executives, for example, cite an outpouring of new offerings from their company - ranging from a whole family of Wheat Thins crackers to their Almost Home cookies - as evidence that mergers can mean more new products, not fewer. The company, which was the result of a 1981 merger between Nabisco and Standard Brands, was purchased last month by R. J. Reynolds for $4.9 billion. **********Nabisco's spending on research and development will total about $50 million this year, up from the $30 million that the two predecessor companies together spent the year before they joined in mid-1981, according to Robert J. Carbonell, president of Nabisco Brands USA. New products introduced in the United States in 1985 will jump to 88, up from 49 in the year before the merger, he said. **********Connoisseurs of Celestial Seasonings' Lemon Zinger herbal tea have Dart & Kraft Inc. to thank for that new drink as well as three others recently introduced. Since Dart & Kraft bought Celestial in July 1984, the herbal tea company's research-and-development spending has increased tenfold, and its products are now available in about three-quarters of the supermarkets in the United States, up from about 60 percent when the company was acquired. **********Merger-related savings also enabled Nabisco to trim the wholesale price of its Planters nut line by 6 percent, and Mr. Carbonell said supermarkets passed this saving on to consumers in September. Even Nabisco executives acknowledge, though, that it can take a long time for operating savings to be realized. It took nearly three years at Nabisco, according to Mr. Carbonell. Some Food Mergers Fall Short of Success Moreover, the marriage of Nabisco and Standard Brands is widely considered to be one of the most successful food mergers. One of every three acquisitions usually ends up being sold, according to research by F. Michael Scherer, an economist at the Brookings Institution. **********But even when a merged company realizes cost savings by combining operations - using the same distribution operations to handle a much greater number of products, for example - not all those savings are necessarily relayed to consumers. **********The price of Lender's bagels and Celestial herbal teas have not dropped since Dart & Kraft purchased those enterprises, even though Joel D. Weiner, executive vice president for marketing services at Dart & Kraft's food subsidiary, boasts of the economies of scale in advertising, warehousing, transportation and purchasing that Lender's and Celestial enjoy as part of a bigger company. **********''The lower costs would be redeployed into brand building,'' Mr. Weiner said, explaining that besides making Celestial's herbal teas available everywhere, Dart & Kraft also aims to ''bagelize America.'' **********Similarly, although the H. J. Heinz Company has significantly cut the cost of producing and distributing Steak-umm, a thin frozen sandwich steak that entered the Heinz line of products when it acquired Gagliardi Brothers in 1980, those savings have been used to turn the item into the only national brand in that product category. Paul I. Corddry, president of Ore-Ida, Heinz's frozen food subsidiary, said it is ''not unusual for Steak-umm to sell at a 40 percent premium'' over competing regional products, which he attributes to a ''combination of brand recognition and us having a superior product.'' The Present Prospects Of a Bagel Price War Of course, consumers ultimately could benefit if Dart & Kraft's expansion plans start bagel and herbal-tea wars. That is a real possibility because two other food giants, Unilever and Sara Lee, are also expanding in these markets. If the history of other consumer markets is an indication, an increase in the size of the rivals can often mean more competition and not less. **********The big unanswered question, however, is whether further consolidation in consumer product companies will eventually result in higher prices and less choice for consumers. **********If the mergers so far have not pushed the industry to a critical point, it is hard to predict exactly when that would occur. Recent experience suggests that serious problems have not yet arisen. Both critics and defenders of the big food takeovers agree that the past few years do not provide a conclusive answer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/30/world/cuba-is-ending-state-s-ownership-of-homes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CUBA IS ENDING STATE'S OWNERSHIP OF HOMES", "print_headline": "CUBA IS ENDING STATE'S OWNERSHIP OF HOMES", "body_text": " **********For most of the last 10 years, Gina Rey, a 38-year-old architect and city official, has lived in a pleasant three-bedroom house with her husband, daughter and mother.

Many Cubans say home ownership will also satisfy a basic emotional need. **********''Everybody dreams of owning a house,'' Mrs. Rey said. **********Well, actually, she said, she had not given much thought to owning a house. That, she said, was more the way of thinking of her mother's generation than of those like herself who had grown up in Cuba under Fidel Castro. **********But, even so, she said, now that she will be able to own her house, no longer pay rent and pass the property on to her daughter, she is ''very pleased.'' **********Partly because Cubans cannot move from one town to another without Government approval, Havana does not have the sprawling slums of dilapidated shacks that most Latin American capitals have. But there are not enough houses and apartments to go around, and overcrowding is common. **********By Cuban standards, Mrs. Rey and her family live in an extraordinarily spacious house. But they are an extraordinary family. Both she and her husband, who died in a traffic accident a few months ago, had been among the fewer than 4 percent of all Cubans who, by invitation, were members of the Communist Party. **********He had a high political position, and she is director of physical planning for Havana. As a teen-ager, Mrs. Rey was a member of the Young Communists League, and when she was 29 she went for two years to supervise the development of new rural villages in Angola, where Cuba has had civilian advisers and troops since 1975. **********Until about a year after Mrs. Rey became the city's planner, she and her family lived in a small, dark apartment below street level with ''no running water and no ventilation.'' **********Now, Mrs. Rey said, that old apartment building has been ''beautifully restored.'' **********Many people, however, still live in substandard housing. **********Oscar Fernandez Mell, the Mayor of Havana, said in an interview that in some parts of the city residents did not have running water at all times of day and that about a third of the city was not served by the sewage system. **********The new regulation enabling people to own their homes is the first change in Cuba's housing laws since 1960, the year after Mr. Castro took power. **********Under the 1960 law, the Government seized tens of thousands of apartments and houses throughout Cuba from landlords. It permitted Cubans to retain possession of a primary residence and a vacation retreat, but title could not be transferred, and eventually the property became the state's. The Government also seized houses and apartments as they were abandoned by Cubans who fled the Communist system to live in other countries. **********The Government assigned families to live in most of the houses it took over and set the monthly rent at 10 percent of the salary of one worker. For many apartment dwellers, the main change was that they found themselves with a new landlord and, in many cases, the rent was lower. **********To take title to a house or apartment, Cubans will have to buy the property from the Government. But the Government will regard past rent as retroactive payment toward the purchase. So many people will be given titles automatically, and others will continue to pay the monthly 10 percent rent for a few more years. In most cases, the Government said, the sale price will be the equivalent of 15 to 20 years of rent. **********Under the new provisions, property owners will also be allowed to rent rooms for up to six months at a time at whatever rate the market will bear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/27/world/us-to-study-steps-against-nicaragua.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 831, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. TO STUDY STEPS AGAINST NICARAGUA", "print_headline": "U.S. TO STUDY STEPS AGAINST NICARAGUA", "body_text": " **********President Reagan directed his top security and foreign-policy advisers today to review possible United States measures against the Nicaraguan Government. **********The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said Mr. Reagan had requested a review of a ''full family'' of economic, political and other measures, which he declined to specify. **********Asserting that he did not want to raise ''scare tactics,'' Mr. Speakes said the possibilities did not include the use of United States military forces in Central America. **********The review was announced at the daily White House press briefing two days after the House defeated an Administration request for $14 million in aid to Nicaraguan rebels. **********A Bid to 'Take Initiative' **********Mr. Speakes, who said the defeat had ''compromised'' the United States position on Central America, said the Administration review was an attempt to ''take some initiative'' despite the House action, with the goal of ''influencing the behavior of the Nicaraguan Government.'' **********''Over the next several days, the Administration will be reviewing the full family of measures that can be taken to influence the situation in Nicaragua,'' he said. ''While we will not be specific on the options under consideration, they do include political, economic and other measures.'' **********He said the Administration would also be considering ''our own policies toward Nicaragua as well as ways to provide funding for the democratic resistance,'' or rebel forces. **********The review will be conducted by Robert C. McFarlane, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, and George P. Shultz, the Secretary of State. They are to be assisted, Mr. Speakes said, by all national security officials, including William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence. **********Trade Sanctions Expected **********Although Mr. Speakes would not reveal the measures that will be considered, other officials have said privately that trade sanctions are virtually certain. The United States is Nicaragua's leading trade partner, supplying about 20 percent of its imports and taking 18 percent of its exports, United States officials have estimated. **********Most of the policies under consideration would not require Congressional approval, Mr. Speakes said. **********Asked what the Administration hoped to accomplish in the review, he said: **********''The goal of the policy review is to influence the behavior of the Nicaraguan Government, influence the situation in Nicaragua, to achieve our policy goals there of a free society, ready to have free elections.'' **********''The immediate goal,'' he said, is to create ''an opportunity for the Sandinistas to talk with the people who have problems with the way they run their Government.'' **********The Administration has called on Nicaragua to make a series of changes that include the establishment of a pluralistic democracy, an end to exporting revolution to neighboring countries, a reduction in its arms buildup and a lessening of ties with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Communist-bloc countries. **********'Short-Term Basis' **********In asking for the review, Mr. Reagan set no deadline, Mr. Speakes said. But he said the officials would begin carrying out the directive this weekend and were planning to complete it on a ''short-term basis.'' **********Although Administration officials have vowed to continue the fight to secure funding for the rebels, Mr. Speakes admitted today that it might not be ''practical'' to seek a new vote on the measure soon. He said Democratic leaders would have to allow a new vote, a move he said was unlikely. **********''I think that it is now back on the shoulders of the Administration to execute its policy there, without Congressional cooperation, as evidenced by the House vote this week,'' he said. ''It is back on our shoulders to take some initiative.'' **********Nicaraguan Pledge **********In recent days, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the President of Nicaragua, has renewed a pledge to send 100 Cuban advisers home and to free many prisoners charged with subversion. The steps were played down by Administration officials as a public relations ploy to influence the Congressional vote. **********Mr. Speakes said today that he believed that some members of Congress were having second thoughts about opposing the Administration's funding request for the rebels because of other recent Nicaraguan Government actions. **********''We note with regret, with interest,'' Mr. Speakes said, ''that the very hour the House was defeating the Administration's funding request, President Ortega was on a visit to Moscow to seek additional funds and international support for the Nicaraguan Marxist regime from the Soviet Union.'' Although Mr. Ortega announced Wednesday that he would make a trip to the Soviet Union, he left only today. **********''In addition,'' Mr. Speakes said, ''at the same hour practically, the Nicaraguan Government was receiving a shipment of helicopters and other cargo, including military equipment from the Soviet Union.'' **********Although Mr. Speakes said the Administration was considering another funding request, he said contributions to the rebels from private sources were also possible. But later, after checking with Mr. McFarlane, he said private funding was not being considered by the Administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/23/business/about-real-estate-oldest-long-beach-hotel-to-undergo-conversion.html": {"writer_name": "Kirk Johnson", "pub_date": "1985-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 833, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  OLDEST LONG BEACH HOTEL TO UNDERGO CONVERSION", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE;   OLDEST LONG BEACH HOTEL TO UNDERGO CONVERSION", "body_text": " **********The history of this resort city by the sea - its rise, its decline, and its rebirth in the 1980's - has been intimately tied up with its hotels. The Paradise, the Nassau, the Royale, Waldman's Miami - they stood like surfside icons through the early part of the century, attracting the monied classes from New York, and capturing the spirit of an age of parasols, white tuxedos and jazz. **********Later, amid the blight that crept through this and other shore cities from the late 1950's on, the hotels came to symbolize faded glory -hulking reminders of a world that was gone. In the 1960's and 1970's, most of the old hotels became adult care facilities for the elderly and former mental patients. Long Beach was the only city in Nassau County with plenty of vacant and inexpensive rooms. **********Then, in the 1980's, with the rise of property values in Long Beach as a result of changed perceptions and the city's encouragement of developers, the hotels entered their third incarnation: as condominiums. **********The hotel residents who had been attracted by the ocean and the low rents, or who came here after being released from mental institutions, were forced to leave the city or move into other adult care facilities as building after building was converted. The social implications of displacing so many residents troubled some people here, but the conversion process, supported by the city and cheered by most residents, continued. **********Now, the oldest hotel here - and one that had seemed to many residents to be a symbol of both the good and the bad days in Long Beach -has shrugged off its gray years as well. The Promenade, a 300-room hotel originally called the Nassau when it was built in 1909, is being gutted and will be converted to 150 condominiums. The sprawling H-shaped building, near the center of the city's two-and-a-half-mile-long boardwalk, will be renamed the Ocean Club. **********City officials say that the $16 million project, being developed by the Lazar Group, a New York City-based company, is the biggest residential project in Long Beach in decades and the biggest current gut rehabilitation project on Long Island. Its success in selling out its apartments in less than a month earlier this summer is also a barometer, they add, of the renewed interest in the community by the affluent. Prices at the project, on which construction began several weeks ago, ranged from $130,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $270,000 for a duplex two-bedroom penthouse. **********Altogether, local officials say, more than 1,500 condominium units, including the Ocean Club, are in planning or construction at a dozen sites in Long Beach. Private homes are springing up on beachfronts to the west of the boardwalk as well. **********But the rejuvenation of the city, and of the Promenade Hotel, which until last November was the headquarters for the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center's Long Beach Clinic and home for 110 of its patients, has not been without some pain. **********According to Jeanneane Houpt, director of the clinic, the city and the local community groups were ''very supportive'' in relocating the patients who had been living at the Promenade. However, she added, ''many of these people had been severely traumatized already'' by repeated evictions from other converted hotels. **********''You'd talk to somebody there who had been at the Royale, then the Carmel, then the Paradise, then the Promenade, and they'd say, 'Where am I going to go?' '' she said. Of the 110 patients at the Promenade, who were given 30 days last fall to find new homes, most are still in Long Beach in other adult care centers, Mrs. Houpt said. The remainder have been relocated elsewhere in Nassau County. **********Of 1,200 formerly institutionalized patients living in Long Beach in the early 1970's, Mrs. Houpt said, only about 300 remain. The decline was partly the result of a state-imposed moratorium in the late 1970's and early 1980's on the placement of more former patients in the town. **********For the Lazar Group, which has built commercial and residential structures throughout the metropolitan area, the Ocean Club is its first project in Long Beach. But according to Matt Russo, an executive vice president of the company, the project's quick sellout has inspired Lazar to look for others. He said that most of the buyers at the project were middle-aged couples from Nassau and New York City, but that it was not possible to tell yet whether the apartments would be used for vacation homes or primary residences. **********The eight-story building, which is to be completed by September 1986, is being gutted to the frame, according to Herbert L. Mandel, the architect for the project. The old stone facade, he said, will be replaced with tan stucco to echo the Spanish architectural motifs that run through much of Long Beach's architecture."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/business/dow-moves-up-2.98-as-volume-eases.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1985-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 456, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW MOVES UP 2.98 AS VOLUME EASES", "print_headline": "DOW MOVES UP 2.98 AS VOLUME EASES", "body_text": " **********Stock prices moved only slightly ahead yesterday despite a modestly stronger bond market and a somewhat rejuvenated United States dollar. **********The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a 2.98 gain, at 1,284.01, as advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues by 814 to 714.

They see membership as a way of reaching across the Pyrenees to strengthen their young democracies and modernize their societies. **********''It means the culmination of a struggle of millions of Spaniards who have identified freedom and democracy with integration into Western Europe,'' Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain said in a recent interview. **********''Everything will change,'' Portugal's Prime Minister, Mario Soares, said in a separate interview. ''Portugal will be a completely different country in five years, and it will be better for all Portuguese.'' **********The effects on daily life will be many. In Spain, chocolates will be milkier, cars will belch less pollution and the Andalusian horned viper will roam protected - all under the 80,000 pages of Common Market regulations being printed by the Government. **********The treaty admitting the two countries to the Community was signed in Madrid on June 12. After ratification by Spain, Portugal and the 10 current members, it is to take effect Jan. 1. **********Political Boost for Gonzalez **********The political fallout is already being felt. According to recent polls, the treaty has improved Mr. Gonzalez's prospects in national elections that are likely to be called in the next 16 months. **********Mr. Gonzalez is hoping it has also aided his campaign to persuade Spaniards to stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Socialist Prime Minister, who has promised to hold a national referendum on the issue early next year, argues that NATO membership is a West European responsibility that Spain must accept along with the benefits it will get from Common Market membership. **********No immediate gain in support for NATO has been evident since the treaty was signed, and last week Mr. Gonzalez dismissed Foreign Minister Fernando Moran, a lukewarm supporter of NATO, as part of a Cabinet shake-up. **********Mr. Soares, also a Socialist, has suffered greater problems. The treaty helped him politically, but not enough to stave off divisions in his ruling coalition. Because of the divisions, Parliament will be dissolved after it ratifies the Common Market treaty this week, and elections will be held. **********An End to Isolation **********But it is the historical significance of the countries' new role in Western Europe that is most powerful in the Iberian mind. **********''Without doubt,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, ''the greatest benefit of Community membership will be the political transition, in the most noble sense, toward ending more than 150 years of isolation.'' **********Mr. Soares was more blunt. ''To go forward,'' he said, ''there is no other choice.'' **********Spain and Portugal dominated Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, when their explorers built empires that circled the globe. But spent by wars and resisting the social movements that swept Europe, they were left behind in this century, and they were cut off from the rest of Western Europe under the dictatorships of Francisco Franco in Spain and of Antonio Salazar and Marcello Caetano in Portugal. **********But in the democracies that emerged after Portugal's revolution in 1974 and Franco's death in 1975, almost every major economic and political decision in both countries has been tied to the issue of Common Market membership. **********Industries Are Streamlined **********Both countries have moved to streamline their outdated and inefficient national industries to compete once inside the Community. Spain's program, which involves closing some plants, combining others, and dismissing or retraining employees, is estimated by the Government to be costing more than $5 billion and affecting as many as 50,000 jobs. Among the results have been violent strikes in shipyards and steel plants that are being closed, and the cutbacks helped to provoke a national strike last month. **********The economic challenge to come remains daunting. Although Spain will have the Community's fifth largest gross national product and with 38 million people be its fifth most populous country, its per capita annual income is less than $3,800, compared with more than $7,100 for the current 10-member Community. Portugal, with a population of only 10 million and a per capita income of less than $1,900, will be one of the smallest and poorest countries in the Community. **********Inflation and Unemployment **********The clear consensus among officials and economists, moreover, is that one of the most immediate effects of Community membership will be a rise in inflation and unemployment in both countries. **********In Spain, unemployment stands at more than 21 percent, the highest in Western Europe, while inflation is around 9 percent, according to the Government. The Portuguese Government reports that its unemployment is around 13 percent and inflation more than 20 percent. **********The inflation rates are expected to rise by 1 and 6 percentage points because of the introduction of the Community's value-added tax, the setting of minimum farm price levels and the elimination of industrial subsidies. **********Some factories are expected to close, adding to unemployment, in the face of a barrage of imports as tariff barriers are eliminated. A trend of European investments to take advantage of cheap Iberian labor is under way and is expected over several years to create many more jobs than are lost. But the precise effect is one of the many uncertainties of the 10-year transition period that has been set for Iberian integration into the Community. **********Industrial tariffs will fall faster than agricultural ones, which will benefit the Community's current members. To help, the Community has promised to balance Spain's payments to and benefits from the Community's budget within six years. It has also agreed to give Portugal more than $700 million in development loans and $500 million in agricultural support. **********Worries in Portugal **********The Portuguese are still particularly worried. Though every parliamentary party but the Communists backs entry, Pedro Ferraz da Costa, head of the Confederation of Portuguese Industries, reflected business concerns when he said, ''The Common Market signifies the holocaust and destruction of Portuguese industry.'' **********Industries such as textiles and chemicals have yet to complete a transition from their former roles as suppliers to Portuguese colonies such as Mozambique and Angola, which won independence in the 1970's. **********Farmers, meanwhile, are beginning to question the conventional wisdom that they will be better off in the Common Market. Sevinate Pinto, a farm engineer and former treaty negotiator, said that despite a good climate and many workers, Portuguese farmers are only one-fifth to one-third as productive as the West European average and they, too, may founder. **********And then there is the Portuguese fear of the Spaniards themselves. An agreement between the two countries in May provides for Spanish access to Portuguese markets and to fishing grounds that many Portuguese charge the hard-fishing Spaniards will deplete. **********Franco's Economic Legacy **********Spanish entry into the Community is more complex. It is more industrialized than Portugal, and under the high tariff walls erected by Franco it became largely self-reliant. It also sends more than half its exports already to the Common Market, with which Spain had a trade surplus of $17.5 million last year. **********The treaty is expected to hurt such protected Spanish industries as automobiles, though Spanish industrialists say much will depend on the still undecided terms of the Community's compensation. **********Nearly a half million dairy farmers on Spain's northern coast, meanwhile, are likely to fare poorly in the face of better and cheaper dairy imports. Spain's fruit and vegetable industry is expected to be the big gainer. **********Spanish and Portuguese officials have appealed to their businessmen and union leaders to be more competitive with other countries as a basic solution. Mr. Gonzalez has been instituting more rigid work hours and loosening laws that protect workers from being dismissed.

We are extremely sorry. There was no intention whatsoever to deliberately shoot at newsmen. During the course of the war our interest has been to facilitate free coverage and safeguard journalists, taking them into Lebanon in armed convoys.'' **********Mr. Leiser said of the Israeli explanation: ''We got the first more or less complete explanation from their point of view, with maps, of what happened. They said that the tank fired at what they saw as movement and what they thought was a weapon being raised.

He added that the Lebanese witnesses said the Israeli tank commander was easily close enough to tell that the car had a press sign on it and that the men were taking pictures with cameras. **********Israelis Express Resentment **********There is a great deal of resentment within official Israeli circles over the reaction of CBS News to the affair and its strong and repeated denunciations of Israeli behavior. Even President Chaim Herzog today criticized the approach of CBS News, noting that when reporters entered a battle area they knew they were putting their lives in danger. **********CBS News has canceled plans to broadcast its ''Morning News'' program from Jerusalem during the week of Easter- Passover in protest over the killing of the two newsmen. According to The Jerusalem Post, CBS News had already invested more than $100,000 in advance preparation for the special. **********''CBS had a gut reaction,'' said a senior Israeli official, who declined to be identified. ''They came to their verdict, called us every name in the book, punished us, and then they said they were sending someone over to investigate what happened.'' **********At the same time, however, many Israeli officials concede, in conversations not for attribution, that the original Israeli Army statement about the incident was seriously flawed in that it contained few details about how the killing happened and was totally lacking in any sense of regret."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/08/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** American Paper Institute, a trade association, has elected as its chairman Roger W.

The challenge will be that the athletic footwear market is mature within the United States. What do you need in a mature market? A hot new product to excite people to go out and buy it. **********Because of the difficult conditions and the increasing competitiveness of the maturing market, they've had to support their brand rather heavily. At a time when manufacturers are battling for shelf space and some retailers have been hurt by discounting and dumping, they've had to keep up their advertising. If the customer sees something on TV he wants, the retailer is going to stock it. **********As a product becomes more mature, it becomes more segmented and that's what's happening to athletic footwear. If you're going to continue to grow, you're going to have to enter those segments and preferably get in early and establish your market share. **********They are being very careful about how they diversify and what they use their brand name for. They didn't get into skis. The didn't come out with a Nike line of toiletries for runners. I think everything they are doing is in their realm.

I think they're doing a better job. They're doing more market research, top management is traveling around talking to retail accounts, trying to get more feedback. There's a greater willingness to listen. It's natural for a company, when you're doing phenomenally well, to feel you've got all the answers. **********They quite rightly started looking to areas that were less mature, like apparel and international markets.

They say they do not want to foreclose tough public talk and subsequent military action. **********Similar arguments have pervaded United States policy toward Syria for more than a decade, beginning with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's arrangement of a Syrian-Israeli troop separation agreement on the Golan Heights in 1974. For five years after that, Syria got American aid. **********Low Period Began in 1979 **********But a low period began in 1979, when Syria condemned the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Later the Syrians were critical of American efforts to broaden the peace process in the Middle East, and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 led to clashes with Syrian forces. The chaos in Lebanon took the lives of almost 300 American marines and diplomats. **********Once the marines left Lebanon, some American diplomats said Syria and the United States had something in common in Lebanon, namely a desire to keep Islamic radicals and Iranian influence from taking over. But these arguments did not get far, in view of the United States position that Syria was playing a role in terrorism. **********Syria's help in bringing about the release of the 39 air hostages held in Lebanon gave the diplomats more room for their ideas. Their hand was strengthened when Syria said this week that it would work to improve security at Beirut airport and was maneuvering to obtain the return of the remaining seven Americans who were abducted or disappeared. **********Role in Terrorism Questioned **********This opened the door for some officials in the Near East Asian Bureau and the Office of Counterterrorism in the State Department to raise questions about exactly what Syria's role has been in terrorism. They concede that Syria could have stopped much of the terrorist activity, that some terrorist groups were being supplied through Damascus airport and that terrorists were operating in territory held by Syrian forces. But as one official said, ''There is no evidence of Syrian control, guidance or encouragement.'' **********Other officials, such as those on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, see evidence of Syrian participation at every stage, not least public statements by President Hafez al-Assad extolling the virtues of martyrdom through terrorist suicide. Most officials also agree that there is evidence of Syrian direction in an attempt to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan. **********Decision to Show Restraint **********In any event, officials said the combination of skepticism about Syrian terrorism from parts of the State Deparment and Syrian help on the hostages proved sufficient to convince Mr. Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz to show restraint. **********Officials in the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House who favor a harder line fear that a show of restraint may be read by President Assad as a sign of weakness, as a signal of Mr. Reagan's willingness to tolerate Syrian involvement in terrorism as long as it is not directed against Americans, or perhaps even then. **********These officials say that President Assad may be willing to help on the hostage issue for his own reasons, even if the United States persists in accusing Syria of supporting terrorism. **********''If he gets them free, it will prove he runs Lebanon,'' one official said. **********Those for and against a tough line agree on Syrian goals in Lebanon. These goals, they say, are Syrian predominance by maintaining a disproportionate political role for Lebanese Christians over Moslems, by limiting the power of Shiites whose primary loyalty is to Iran, and by avoiding a military clash with Israel. The officials agreed that all these interests overlap with American interests. **********But the weight of opinion in the State Department and on the National Security Council staff, according to officials, is that despite overlapping American-Syrian interests in Lebanon, Mr. Assad would not cooperate to free the hostages if the United States were to continue its public criticism of Syria. **********This argument has prevailed for the time being, but Mr. Reagan's future intentions are not known. **********The State Department has long felt that the United States can work with President on some matters. **********''He has not been erratic, we have,'' said one high-ranking State Department official. **********It is also being pointed out that Israel and Syria have managed to keep the peace on the Golan Heights. **********Mr. Assad, according to the State Department officials, wants Syria to be recognized as a power to be reckoned with. This means that he understands his only hope of being involved in a Middle East peace process is through the United States. **********Syrian Ties to Soviet Assessed **********They argue further that despite the close relationship with the Soviet Union, President Assad is not a puppet. **********''The Soviets need him more than he needs them,'' the high-ranking official said. ''He is their only entree to the Middle East now.'' **********These officials do not expect Mr. Assad to be helpful in peace talks or to clamp down on terrorist activity in general. Nor are they pushing for a fundamental shift in policy toward Syria. **********As is the way of diplomats, they want to deal with him. Geoffrey Kemp, formerly with the National Security Council staff and now at the Georgetown Center of Strategic and International Studies, explained: **********''Assad always wants to be considered important and to be wooed. He always tells of his hours and hours of meetings with Kissinger, and how the deals he made with Kissinger stuck. **********''It would be wrong to be optimistic, expect breakthroughs, to see him as the devil incarnate or a Soviet puppet; he is powerful with limitations.'' **********But those who are arguing for a working relationship with President Assad say they also realize that the United States has not been comfortable with ambiguous relationships generally, and in the case of Syria in particular."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/12/business/washington-watch-praise-for-trade-official.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1985-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH;Praise for Trade Official", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH;Praise for Trade Official", "body_text": " **********The United States trade representative, Clayton K.

Several other states once employed the system but have abandoned it in recent years. **********Under the system, the states levy corporate income taxes on multinational corporations on the basis of their earnings worldwide. For example, if 10 percent of a company's sales, payroll and property are in California, then 10 percent of its profits all over the world are subject to the state's corporation tax. **********The President proposed that the taxing authority be limited to earnings within the United States and its possessions. In addition, he said the Administration's legislation would ''address the question'' of whether it was equitable for states to tax the dividends paid to United States multinationals by their foreign subsidiaries. At least 32 states, including New York and New Jersey, now tax a portion of those dividends. **********Data Would Be Shared **********Mr. Reagan, in the statement issued by the White House, said he would also ask Congress to allow the Internal Revenue Service to collect detailed financial data from multinational corporations and to share that information with the states so that the corporate incomes in this country could be fully taxed. The unitary tax system was originally devised to prevent companies from manipulating their accounting to show, for example, paper losses on operations in America while channeling profits to foreign subsidiaries in tax havens. **********Senator Charles McC. Mathias, Republican of Maryland, has already introduced legislation that incorporates the main elements of the Reagan proposals. However, a dozen Senators, led by Steven D. Symms of Idaho, a Republican, and Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, have written the President opposing the proposal. **********California's unitary tax system predates Mr. Reagan's two terms as Governor. When the issue arose in 1967, while he was Governor, Mr. Reagan asserted that ''Federal intervention in state tax matters is objectionable in principle.'' During his first term as President, the Treasury suggested Federal restrictions on using the unitary tax method, but Mr. Reagan rejected the idea. **********Instead, he named a panel of business executives and state officials to study the problem. Last year, the panel suggested a voluntary arrangement under which the I.R.S., with additional staff and other resources, would collect financial data about the corporations and share them with states that did not have a unitary tax. The panel also rejected the concept of taxing dividends from abroad. **********That approach was generally acceptable to the states, but apparently it was not strong enough to satisfy America's trading partners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/06/business/economic-scene-preventing-debt-disaster.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1985-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 895, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Preventing Debt Disaster", "print_headline": "ECONOMIC SCENE;   Preventing Debt Disaster", "body_text": " **********THE huge expansion of private debt of recent years poses a threat to the financial health of major sectors of the American economy. **********The most immediately threatened sector is agriculture - and the banks that have lent heavily to farmers. The Farm Credit Administration now has 402 farm banks on its problem list, and the entire farm credit system is facing a potential debacle, which could deal a heavy blow not only to the farm economy but also to the national economy and banking system. Farmers owe their creditors a total of $213 billion. A critical issue facing the Reagan Administration is whether to prepare for what could become a bailout amounting to billions of dollars in bad loans, if the depression in agriculture continues. **********But is agriculture only the most conspicuously endangered sector resulting from the debt explosion? Nonfinancial business corporations have also been increasing their debts at a rapid pace. A study by the New York Stock Exchange notes that 1984 witnessed an outbreak of ''mergermania'' with the retirement of an estimated $84 billion to $100 billion worth of equity in merger exchanges of debt or cash for equity. Although $12 billion in equities were issued in 1984 - one of the biggest years ever - the corporate equity base declined by at least $72 billion. Mergers - or canceled mergers - last year offset all the equity financing of the last half-dozen years. **********Some economists fear that debt-financed mergers and leveraged buyouts withdraw credit from the rest of the economy. But Henry C. Wallich, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, argues that such fear is misplaced, maintaining that such operations do no more than reshuffle assets. The real danger, in his view, is the resulting change in the balance-sheet structure of corporations, causing a deterioration of their debt-equity ratios. **********Henry Kaufman, executive director and chief economist of Salomon Brothers, interviewed by telephone in London, expressed his anxiety over the weakened financial base of corporations. ''In the past year and a half,'' he said, ''the outstanding equity of nonfinancial corporations shrank by $53 billion, but the debts of the same corporations increased by more than $250 billion.'' The Fed's Flow of Funds data show a net increase of nonfinancial corporations' debt by $256.9 billion in 1984 alone, bringing their net outstanding debt to more than $2 trillion, more than double its level in 1977. Their short-term debt has soared to 51 percent of their total liabilities. **********Just how dangerous is this situation? Some economists contend that the danger has been overblown, arguing that the traditional ratios of debt-equity and corporate liquidity no longer hold because of the internationalization of credit markets, tax laws that encourage debt rather than equity and financial deregulation. But another school says the danger is all too real, holding to the principle that the only valid measure of a corporation's debt capacity is whether it could service its debt in a period of adversity. **********For much of American agriculture, the ex post facto answer is that it went far too deeply into debt. Obviously, nobody can simulate just what the cash flow of business corporations will be in the recession or, perhaps, in the next inflation. But business failures have been rising despite almost three years of economic expansion, and a downturn could only aggravate the financial vulnerability of corporations. **********What can be done now, other than for the Government to prepare for huge bailouts? One constructive step would be to reduce the Federal budget deficit that, together with the Treasury's effort to lengthen the public debt, has pushed up long-term interest rates, leading corporations to go increasingly into short-term debt. However, the outlook now is that the Federal deficits will remain high and may even worsen. The effort of banks to protect themselves by setting variable interest rates on long-term loans also means greater danger for the borrowers if inflation returns. **********Another way to strengthen the corporations would be to encourage greater internal financing. Here the New York Stock Exchange study charges that President Reagan's proposed tax revisions would have a damaging effect by eliminating the Accelerated Cost Recovery System and the Investment Tax Credit, cutting company cash flows. **********Mr. Kaufman urges increased Federal regulation to keep the growth of debt under better control. He would enhance the powers of the Federal Reserve System and set up a new National Board of Overseers to supervise all institutions that create credit, not just commercial banks. Indeed, he wants greater international financial oversight to cope with the immense and accelerating growth of international debt. Mr. Kaufman was in London this week pressing his case for such international oversight upon the Group of 30, a body of leading financial authorities. **********He is also calling for a new official credit-rating system. He contends that the private rating concerns cannot get as much information as can the Government to do an adequate rating job. If the Government published such reports, he contends, such disclosure would push managements to take strong remedial actions and preventative steps. **********Do such ideas come too late? No one can be sure, but remedial measures may be crucial if they are to prevent what is happening in agriculture from becoming a general condition of financial vulnerabilty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/business/days-inns-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Days Inns Units", "print_headline": "Days Inns Units", "body_text": " **********Days Inns of America Inc. said it had agreed to sell seven hotel properties  in California and one in Reno to California Days Ltd. for $62 million.

''The point at issue,'' he said, ''is restructuring the material and technical base of production.'' **********''The point at issue,'' he said a second time, ''is the perfection of social relations, above all economic ones.'' **********''The point at issue,'' he said for the third time, ''is also the development of the individual qualitative improvement of the material conditions of his life and work, of his spiritual makeup.'' **********It was as though the 54-year old Soviet leader was declaring his support of the line of criticism laid down during the Andropov regime by the reformist economists at the economic institutes, particularly those at the Siberian division of the Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk. **********Mr. Gorbachev appears most deeply concerned about Soviet failures to keep abreast of world developments in science and technology. ''We should, we are bound to attain within the briefest period the most advanced scientific and technical positions, the highest world level in the productivity of social labor,'' he said. **********Rhetoric and desire aside, the big question is whether the relatively young and vigorous Gorbachev can succeed in executing that strategic line, where the aged and ailing Andropov and Chernenko failed in the short time they had. **********The real issue is not simply one of youth and time - and Mr. Gorbachev, by using phrases such as ''speeding up'' and ''within the briefest period,'' has indicated that he means to tackle the problems forthwith, but whether he has the political skill and daring to break the resistance of the bureaucracy and the political establishment to change and whether he is up to trusting the people - and trusting them even with the most vital element in a modern, progressive society: information. In a speech last Dec. 10 he said, ''Extensive, timely and candid information is an indication of trust in people and of respect for their intelligence, feelings and ability to comprehend various events on their own.'' **********The problem of regenerating the Soviet economy involves not only internal structural and social reforms but the crucial macroeconomic issue of what share of its national resources the Soviet Union can devote to building up the domestic economy or the military sector. **********Mr. Gorbachev's accession to power comes just at the point when the Geneva arms negotiations with the United States are getting under way, and there is a vital relationship between the Soviet return to the bargaining table and its economic concerns. Mr. Gorbachev, in his acceptance speech, called for agreement on ''an immediate termination of the race in arms, above all, nuclear arms, on earth and its prevention in space.'' He did not explicitly link the arms race to Soviet economic problems, but the link is unquestionably there. **********Indeed that link between arms and the economy has been a critical element in the Reagan Administration's strategy vis- a-vis the Soviet Union. The United States arms buildup has been aimed at intensifying the pressure on the Russians. By its rapid increase in total military spending, and now by the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ''Star Wars,'' the Reagan Administration is confronting the Soviet regime with a rough dilemma: if it tries to match the American military buildup, it would starve the domestic economy for resources, physical, scientific and technological, and further arrest its growth; but if the Russians decide against pouring more resources into the military to keep pace with the Americans - and recent studies by the Central Intelligence Agency show a slowdown in the rate of Soviet military expenditures - the Russians risk the danger of letting military superiority, especially in nuclear arms and in space, pass to the United States. **********This unwelcome choice, dramatized by ''Star Wars,'' is what has apparently brought the Russians back to the bargaining table at Geneva. For if they can, through diplomacy, slow down or reverse the arms race, they can escape from the painful dilemma of putting desperately short resources into the military sector, especially in the high-technology areas where it is difficult for them to compete. **********The United States strategy is based on the proposition that the Russians' greatest vulnerability is in the economic area, and the Americans' greatest strength is in the area of technology. To the extent that this country can hammer home these lessons, the Reagan strategists believe, they can bring the Russians closer to arms reduction, both nuclear and conventional, as it becomes too expensive for them to compete. **********But this is an expensive strategy for the United States as well, with the Federal budget in deep deficit and ''Star Wars'' estimated to cost hundreds of billions of dollars - the figure of one trillion is commonly used these days - to develop and deploy. **********Some also consider that it is a highly risky strategy in two senses: risky in forcing the Russians to consider aggressive strategies if negotiations look as though they are going nowhere, or going against them, and risky in the sense that no one believes the vastly expensive ''Star Wars'' system can insure against a heavy nuclear attack. **********Even knowing the risks involved, Reagan Administration planners nevertheless consider that there is no satisfactory alternative to keeping the pressure on the Soviet Union.

Mr. Tabb manages this pooled fund of pension and profit-sharing trusts for his accounting clients who own various businesses. **********In 1984, the fund's total return - market appreciation plus dividends and interest reinvested - came to 12.9 percent. This compared with 6.3 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. And for the 10 years ended last Dec. 31, Capital Builders produced a compounded annual return of 24.9 percent. In the same time span, the comparable return for the ''500'' was 14.8 percent. **********Although the average person cannot buy into the fund, Mr. Tabb is perfectly willing to share the secrets of his success. **********''The fund's philosophy is to start with soundly financed companies,'' Mr. Tabb said. ''Typically, we want to see stockholders' equity equal to, or exceeding, 50 percent of total assets. We also like to see earnings growth of at least 75 percent in five years, along with dividend growth of at least 50 percent in this same period. We want the stocks to yield a minimum of 4 percent.'' **********He added: ''We look for a five-year and, preferably, a 10-year history of rising profits on a per- share basis, with no more than one down year for earnings over the last five years. We don't want to pay more than 11 times earnings per share for a company.'' **********In his investment approach, Mr. Tabb also avoids conglomerates - ''too many different industries to watch within a single company'' - and he does not play the takeover game. In general, he avoids high-technology issues and stocks with a very low dividend payout. **********Normally, the Capital Builders portfolio is at least 85 percent invested in common stocks. But, because of the difficulty of finding stocks that meet its criteria, the fund's equity stake has been cut to a shade under 80 percent. Its other assets are in cash and Treasury bills. **********''Whirlpool Corporation and Royal Dutch Petroleum are about the only issues that meet our criteria for new investment,'' the portfolio manager said. ''In January, we began buying Ford Motor, but we had to bend a little in our standards, because Ford experienced more than one deficit year in the last five years, and also the the company's total debt is heavier than I like to see in relation to assets.'' **********On average, Capital Builders keeps about 20 issues in its portfolio and most of these, of course, were bought initially when the respective companies met the fund's standards. Some of the largest present holdings include H.J. Heinz, the Standard Register Company and the USG Corporation, formerly U.S. Gypsum. ''We're heavy in Royal Dutch, and the position in Whirlpool is getting bigger,'' Mr. Tabb said. ''What I like about Whirlpool is that the company not only meets our standards, but also that management has a distinct plan for growth.'' **********Each year, some stocks are eliminated and other holdings are pruned, since no single issue is permitted to exceed 7 percent of the total. **********Even a carefully formulated set of standards is no guarantee against taking a loss in the stock market. Capital Builders suffered a 22 percent loss - its biggest one in 1984 - in the Brown Group, a shoe manufacturer and retailer. ''It was,'' Mr. Tabb acknowledged, ''a combination of faulty investment timing, as well as an unexpectedly poor year for domestic shoe manufacturers.'' **********Smaller losses were absorbed last year in holdings of West Point Pepperell, Gulf State Utilities and American Sterilizer. But these were more than offset by a big profit in Hannaford Brothers, a regional supermarket chain that was eliminated from the portfolio. Some profits were also taken in Standard Register, American Home Products, Jostens, H.J. Heinz, Coca-Cola, Standard Oil (Indiana) and Melville, among others. All of these issues remain in the portfolio. **********Since Mr. Tabb is an accountant, it comes perhaps as no surprise that he likes to study the back section of a company's annual report as part of his investment research. ''I'm a stickler for contingent liabilities that you can find in the footnotes,'' he said. ''As a possible warning sign, I want to see if the company has any major lawsuits pending or if there is a big contingent liability in the underfunding of its pension plan.'' **********The difficulty of finding new investment ideas at the present time makes Mr. Tabb wonder ''if the stock market is somewhere near a top.'' He does not profess to know the answer, but he remains cautious. As he said, ''I'm no cowboy, or what they call a gunslinger in Wall Street.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/22/business/credit-markets-a-holding-pattern-for-rates.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1985-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;A 'HOLDING PATTERN' FOR RATES", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;A 'HOLDING PATTERN' FOR RATES", "body_text": " **********Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, does not predict interest rates. When he comments on monetary policy and the outlook for the economy, however, credit market participants are quick to make their own rate predictions. **********Last week, after digesting the Fed's mid-year report to Congress on monetary  policy published late Wednesday and a host of fresh economic data issued Thursday, the credit markets concluded that the outlook for lower interest rates is not as bright as a few weeks ago. Consequently, rates rose, with Treasury note and bond yields up about a tenth of a percentage point and short-term rates up by a slightly greater amount. Most of the rate increases occurred Thursday. **********The rise in rates ''signifies a change in tone for the markets,'' according to Roger A. Froehlich, president of a bond market analysis firm in Mount Kisco,  N.Y. The expectation in some quarters that the Fed would soon move to ease monetary policy and encourage lower interest rates has been replaced, he said, by ''the realization that a holding pattern is about the best that can be expected at this time.'' **********A Change in Expectations **********The rise in rates was not a total about-face for the market, since hopes for  lower interest rates in the near future have been gradually eroding since early  July. **********On July 5, for example, when a weak employment report heightened expectations that rates would fall as the economy became more lethargic, the three-month Treasury bill rate was about 6.8 percent while 30-year Treasury bonds were traded with a yield of slightly less than 10 1/4 percent. By the end of last week, the three-month bill rate was up to 7.15 percent and the closely watched 11 1/4 percent Treasury bond due in 2015 was offered at about 106 7/8 to yield 10.49 percent. **********The rise in rates last week was justified, analysts said, by the Fed's projections of economic growth in the second half of slightly more than 4 percent, up from about 1 percent in the first half. In addition, second-quarter  data on the gross national product portrayed an economy that was stronger than the overall growth rate of 1.7 percent, after adjustment for inflation. **********Outlook for the Economy **********''The G.N.P. number does not reflect how much heat there is under the kettle,'' said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles. **********He maintained that the rapid money supply growth of 12 percent in the first half is a harbinger of a strong economy in the future and that employment levels and consumer spending are still strong enough to suggest a second-half growth rate that is faster than the Fed's projection of slightly over 4 percent. **********Other analysts noted that the G.N.P. growth was depressed by factors not related to the willingness of individuals to buy goods and services. A sharp contraction in business inventories, for example, reduced the G.N.P. growth by more than three percentage points. Measuring economic activity in terms of final sales of goods and services showed a growth rate of 5.1 percent - a vigorous increase that suggests no need for additional moves by the Fed to reduce interest rates. **********Although the trend last week was toward higher rates, the change in the credit markets was not dramatic because there is widespread uncertainty about the outlook for the economy. The Fed's crystal ball is just as imperfect as those used by other analysts, and a wide range of forecasts for second-half growth is circulating in the marketplace. **********Diversity of Viewpoints **********Last week the market seemed to agree with those analysts who expect an upward trend in rates during the second half of the year as the economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve either tolerates higher rates or makes some small moves in the direction of tightening monetary policy and raising rates. **********But there is another sizable group of analysts who expect the economy to remain weak enough to keep the direction of rates downward. ''The economy is unlikely to rebound enough to reduce unemployment,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. Continued weakness in the economy, he said, makes it ''very likely'' that monetary policy will be eased later this summer and interest rates will fall. **********In the midst of the Fed's mid-year report and the second-quarter economic statistics, market participants have not lost sight of the fact that Congress has still not agreed on a package to reduce the budget deficit. Nor have they forgotten that economic growth of less than 4 percent makes it even more unlikely that the Federal budget deficit and Treasury financing requirements will be reduced."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/31/business/caterpillar-to-cut-up-to-1400-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caterpillar to Cut Up to 1,400 Jobs", "print_headline": "Caterpillar to Cut Up to 1,400 Jobs", "body_text": " **********The Caterpillar Tractor Company said that a consolidation of operations could result in the loss of about 1,400 jobs at plants in Mapleton, Ill., and Davenport, Iowa. **********A company spokesman said the Mapleton plant, a foundry operating at a reduced capacity, may lose about 800 of its 1,800 employees ''over the next two to three years.''

''Turner's being realistic,'' Mr. Atorino said. ''It sounds like he's ready to back out, but we'll see.'' **********Lively Session **********Despite the obstacles faced by Mr. Turner, his customary self-confidence was much in evidence during a lively session with members of the Washington press corps that was his first major public appearance since making the offer to buy CBS. **********''If you fail in going after CBS, will you then go after NBC?'' he was asked. **********''Failure does not exist in my vocabulary,'' he said, lifting his arms to the audience and flexing his muscles.

Wyman; its broadcasting president, Gene F. Jankowski, and the CBS News president, Edward M. Joyce, for what he said was poor management, excessive spending and bad programming. **********During the question period, he was asked to respond to the statement ''CBS officials have said you did not have the moral character to run CBS and suggested you are a bigot.'' **********''I think Mr. Wyman made that remark at the CBS annual meeting,'' Mr. Turner said.

Analysts have placed the value more at $150 to $160 a share.

When it began in January 1984, the allies feared that the Soviet Union would use it in its campaign against deployment of new American medium- range missiles - the Pershing 2 and cruise missiles - in Western Europe. **********It was a time when the Geneva arms talks were broken off, and Foreign Minister Andrei A.

While the Soviet Union has focused on broad, declarative proposals involving the renunciation of force, the West has concentrated on what it describes as practical military and political measures that would lower the risk of war. **********West Relatively Optimistic **********The relative optimism among Western delegates relates to the fact that acceptance by the Soviet Union of any of the Western proposals would represent a net gain to the Atlantic alliance. With the Warsaw Pact's advantages in conventional forces, any new controls are considered advantageous. **********The first important development for the conference, signaling the possible shape of an agreement, was President Reagan's speech in Dublin last June in which he expressed the United States' willingness to affirm the principle of nonuse of force. Until then the West had said that such an affirmation would be redundant in the sense that it was already included in the United Nations Charter and in NATO declarations. **********Moreover, some Western delegates feared that the discussion of nonuse of force would open up what they consider other irrelevant issues being pressed by the Soviet Union, such as renunciation of a first nuclear strike and of first use of chemical weapons. **********Language Proposed by the West **********President Reagan's speech offered a means for the conference to move forward. The West has now made clear it will discuss language that would affirm the principle of renunciation of force, but without specific relationship to nuclear or chemical weapons. **********The Western countries have also laid out proposals in six areas involving the exchange of military information, annual forecasts of military activities, notification of military activities outside garrisons, observation of maneuvers, verification of compliance through inspection and establishment of hot-line communications links. **********The most striking proposal involves notification of exercises 45 days in advance for any out-of-garrison activity involving 6,000 troops, for the mobilization of 25,000 reservists and regular troops, or for any amphibious activity with 3,000 combat soldiers. **********The current arrangements, called for in the 1975 Helsinki accord, specify 21 days' notice and 25,000 men. The change, according to Western officials, corresponds to the realities of Warsaw Pact exercise patterns and would hamper the possibility of intimidation moves or surprise attack. **********Change in Observer Status **********The proposals also go beyond the Helsinki provisions in guaranteeing the presence of observers at all exercises. The present agreement allows the country holding the maneuvers to decide whether it will invite observers. **********James Goodby, the United States delegate, acknowledged that inspection and verification would be areas where it would be difficult to get Soviet agreement, and a Soviet military delegate, Gen. Valentin Tatarnikov, has already ruled out the likelihood of Soviet acceptance. In turn, the Russians have called for a ceiling of 40,000 troops on maneuvers, evidently aimed at NATO's large-scale fall exercises. **********Some of the Western delegations now say they believe that the Russians must choose what is acceptable to them within the area of practical measures and try to trade them down to a minimum against the background of discussions about the wording of a statement on renunciation of force. **********The Soviet Union's main motivation in trying to reach an accord may be its interest in a disarmament conference that would follow out of a successful conclusion of the Stockholm talks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/21/world/around-the-world-bush-details-obstacles-to-caribbean-initiative.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Bush Details Obstacles To Caribbean Initiative", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Bush Details Obstacles To Caribbean Initiative", "body_text": " **********Vice President Bush said today that Caribbean governments had not been doing enough to make a success out of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Reagan Administration's economic development plan for the region. **********''Let me be completely blunt about this - for C.B.I. to succeed as fully as it can, the C.B.I. countries have got to do more than they are doing,'' he said in a speech to the Miami Conference on the Caribbean. **********Mr. Bush, whose audience included five Caribbean Prime Ministers, said the area's governments should reduce taxes, streamline government regulations, improve services related to international trade, lower trade barriers within the Caribbean, denationalize industries and adjust exchange rates. **********There was no immediate comment from the Caribbean leaders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/21/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

As Nicolas A. Giordano, president of the parent exchange, explained: ''We chose  a European-style Eurodollar option because 60 percent of our volume in foreign exchange options comes from overseas hedgers and traders. Given the huge amounts of Eurodollars now being traded overseas, we expect a similar large percentage of our options business to originate there as well.'' **********While, technically speaking, Eurodollars are dollars held by foreigners, they are basically bookkeeping transactions between lenders and borrowers all over the world. Thus few, if any, of these funds, which are estimated to total at least $2 trillion, ever actually change hands. **********Essentially, there are three kinds of Eurodollars. One is a form of ''call money'' that has no fixed maturity and which the lender can withdraw on one day's notice. Another consists of negotiable certificates of deposit that are issued in bearer form, normally in units with a face value of $1 million. **********''What we are trading are options on the third form, $1 million 90-day time deposits placed in the Eurodollar market by lenders around the globe,'' said Arnold F. Staloff, president of the Philadelphia Board of Trade, whose operation was authorized by the Government last week. **********Despite the huge amounts involved, the buyer of these Eurodollar options will still only pay a relatively small premium for the right, without any obligation, to buy or sell the value represented by the option at a fixed price for a specified period of time. **********Because no Eurodollars actually change hands, the options that are exercised  are settled in cash, with the buyer holding a profitable contract getting the difference between the agreed ''strike price'' at the time of purchase and its value at expiration. **********''The Philadelphia options add a new dimension not only to the enormous global cash market in Eurodollars, but also to the Chicago Eurodollar futures and options markets,'' said John M. Blin, director of financial and foreign currency options operations at Lasser Marshall Inc., a unit of the Mercantile House Group of London, the leading international broker in foreign exchange and  Eurodollars. **********Mr. Blin, when he was a professor of economics at Northwestern University, designed Chicago's Eurodollar futures contract, which is now second only to Treasury bonds in financial futures trading volume. **********''The expansion of the various exchange-traded Eurodollar instruments will also help the far much larger and rapidly expanding 'upstairs' market in these funds,'' Mr. Blin added. ''As the upstairs cash market grows, the banks and other big institutions will need to lay off increasing amounts of risk they are  assuming each day. The Eurodollar futures and options can help in this respect.'' **********By ''upstairs,'' Mr. Blin was referring to the huge amounts of Eurodollars that are lent, borrowed and traded each day in financial centers around the world. These transactions are for cash, with the funds exchanged electronically  among the trading institutions. **********What is actually being trading in the upstairs cash Eurodollar markets is the cost of money expressed in interest rates. At last Friday's close in New York, for example, call Eurodollars were trading at a hair below 8 percent on an annual basis, while one-year certificates of deposit brought roughly 8.75 percent. **********Until the explosion of oil prices in 1973 caused dollar deposits on the books of domestic and overseas money markets to burgeon, most of these funds were largely dollars floating outside the United States. Oddly, the Eurodollar market was inadvertently created by the Soviet Union during the post-World War II deterioration in relations between Washington and Moscow. **********''Fearing that their funds might be frozen by our Government, as was later the case with Iranian funds after the hostage crisis, Moscow asked London bankers to hold their dollars in special accounts,'' Mr. Blin said. ''Because the Mideast oil exporters traditionally deposited their funds with London and other European banks, their post-1973 inflow of dollars swelled these funds.'' **********Today, he continued, banks and corporations around the world lend, borrow and trade these funds. ''Aside from today's more than ample supply of these funds, the unregulated transactions do not show up on balance sheets for a number of technical reasons, which is most convenient for many banks and corporations,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/business/greyhound-lines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greyhound Lines", "print_headline": "Greyhound Lines", "body_text": " **********Greyhound Lines would open its intercity bus operations to licensing and franchising programs, its parent corporation announced today.

They trumpeted good wishes through wooden horns, danced joyously and sang out in tribal languages, French, Latin and even the Pope's native Polish. **********Late in the day, John Paul exchanged greetings with leaders of the country's traditional animist religions. About 60 percent of Togolese subscribe to these beliefs, and many professed Catholics still practice some of the old rituals. **********Speaking at a shrine to the Virgin that faces Lake Togo and is near a forest that has powerful symbolism for animists, the Pope gave an unusual speech that emphasized the beliefs that animists and Christians shared. **********Animists venerate nature, often worship their ancestors and believe that plants, animals and totems can have spiritual powers. They also often emphasize the power of evil spirits. **********Cites Nature's Mystery **********Telling the animists that he was ''very touched that you have come to meet me and participate in the prayer of Catholics in this sanctuary dedicated to the Holy Virgin Mary,'' the Pope said: **********''Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life. It is this religious sentiment that animates you and one can say that animates all of your compatriots.'' **********But he also marked out differences between Christianity and animism by warning obliquely against a faith in evil spirits. **********''We believe that God is good, and that even nature, which has come from His hands, is good,'' he said. ''Fear comes rather from the evil which inhabits the heart of man when he turns away from God.'' **********Emphasizes Tolerance **********He also sought to emphasize Catholicism's tolerance for other faiths in an address at the presidential palace. **********''The church is not an enterprise of a purely human inspiration,'' he said. ''She is a stranger to every sort of temporal competition.'' **********In turn, the Pope won blessings from the priests of the College of the Grand Priests of Yehwe-Togbui-Nyigle, a reference to tribal dieties. **********In a document that they called a ''welcome of religious tolerance,'' the priests asked that ''the great God creator, transcendent and omnipresent guide you and protect you in your participation in the work of the rapprochement of peoples in a time as dislocated and troubled as ours.'' **********One of the chief priests who met the Pope bent down before him as he walked off a dock after a boat ride across Lake Togo. **********The incidents leading to the Pope's surprise stop at the mud hut underlined a perpetual hazard of papal travels: his need to be polite to national leaders without necessarily embracing them or their way of thinking. **********Visits President's Hometown **********The Pope visited the President's hometown at General Eyadema's request. He spoke from a balcony of the palace, which dominates a small community of mud and grass huts. **********He thanked the President for ''the warm welcome you wanted to give me in your beautiful country.'' **********The President, in turn, praised the Pope. **********John Paul next traveled to nearby Kara for an ordination mass. He met with the woman in the mud hut on his way to the airport for the trip to the capital, Lome, and to Togoville. **********The woman lives in a settlement of conical huts with about 30 other people.

In addition, he called for removing a provision that gives whites 20 seats in the legislature, which, the Prime Minister points out, gives them representation far out of proportion to their population of 100,000 in a nation of 8 million people. **********The Constitution was drawn up in 1979 in peace talks after a seven-year guerrilla war and is not supposed to be rewritten for another five years. **********When asked by reporters why he would risk Zimbabwe's international reputation by breaking the constitutional agreement, he said that when ''we believe we are right, the Western world can say what it wants.'' **********At the same time, he served notice to whites that those opposed to his policies would have to leave the country, and he suggested a further crackdown on the Zimbabwe African People's Union, which is led by Joshua Nkomo, the Prime Minister's longstanding rival. **********Firm Grip on Power **********Mr. Mugabe's words were those of a man holding a firm grip on power in the face of any opposition. Although the Patriotic Front's majority of 57 seats in the last Parliament allowed the Prime Minister to have a de facto one-party state with a few multiparty trimmings, he evidently views the gain of six seats last week as a resounding mandate and a referendum on his drive toward one-party rule under the protection of law. **********But for now he will oversee a Parliament divided, as the nation is, by race, ideology and tribalism into at least three distinct and intransigent camps. These factions are his followers; supporters of Mr. Nkomo, whose party now holds 15 seats in the legislature, and conservative whites in the party of Ian D. Smith, the last Prime Minister of Rhodesia. Mr. Smith's impressive election victory of 15 of the 20 seats allotted to whites shook the Prime Minister. **********More Hostility Feared **********Although Mr. Mugabe insists that the way to heal divisions is to pull all elements under one political umbrella, local political analysts say his drive may instead further fan the hostilities between his Government and Mr. Nkomo's party, leading to increasing violence and intimidation in a land whose history has been plagued with both. **********In addition, if Mr. Mugabe proceeds in a manner that appears threatening to whites, fear and dissatisfaction may spread among them. The Prime Minister may ultimately be forced to reconcile his aspirations in some way with those of his opponents, Western analysts say, as he tries to push through a system of government that has become more the rule than the exception in Africa. **********Mr. Mugabe has promised to step up his drive toward socialism, and local students of politics say that he has chosen a brand that is clearly more pragmatic than doctrinaire, allaying to some degree the concerns of Western donors. He inherited one of Africa's most sophisticated, industrialized and prosperous capitalist economies from the white minority that held power until the country gained independence from Britain. **********Moderation Indicated **********Mr. Mugabe's policies and his party's manifesto indicate that he will move with moderation in this area. For example, the manifesto calls for worker participation in decision-making in the private sector. It also urges increased state participation in the economy, but a demand for wholesale state control of the economy is noticeably absent. **********After three successive years of drought, good rains and a good harvest have helped bring about an upturn in the nation's economy, and last year's economic performance was one of the best since independence. Unlike many other African countries, a real growth rate of as much as 5 percent is expected here this year, and business confidence appears to be rising. **********Some local businessmen say economic improvement has come not only because of more beneficent weather conditions but at least in part because of improved financial management by the Government, imaginative monetary policy and a willingness to be more realistic in economic matters than the nation's political rhetoric would suggest. **********''Mugabe has got into the shoes of the whites and he has felt how warm they are, so it is not easy to throw them away,'' said a local journalist who has closely followed Mr. Mugabe's political career. ''Many of us are now into the salaries that the whites were earning. We have tasted the sweet soup of economic power and no one is prepared to say to hell with the salaries or to have the salaries reduced to meet the needs of socialism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/10/world/nakasone-giving-in-will-shun-shrine.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1985-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NAKASONE, GIVING IN, WILL SHUN SHRINE", "print_headline": "NAKASONE, GIVING IN, WILL SHUN SHRINE", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, yielding to sharp Chinese criticism, apparently intends to cancel a planned visit next week to a Shinto shrine dedicated to Japan's war dead. **********Mr. Nakasone touched off unexpectedly harsh denunciations in Peking when he made an official visit to the Yasukuni Shrine on Aug. 15, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. **********China's official press agency said a week later that the Prime Minister's action had ''pandered'' to Japanese who wanted to deny their country's guilt for World War II. Last month, students marched through Tian An Men Sqare in Peking, chanting ''Down with Nakasone'' and other anti-Japanese slogans in one of the biggest protest demonstrations there in years. **********Japanese newspapers reported today that Mr. Nakasone hoped to avoid prolonging the controversy by calling off another visit to Yasukuni scheduled during a fall festival at the shrine next week. His intention was said to have been relayed Tuesday night to members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party by Takao Fujinami, the chief Cabinet secretary and main Government spokesman. **********Shadow of the War **********The controversy, although rooted wholly in symbolism, demonstrates the extent to which Japan's wartime aggression shadows its latter-day foreign relations. Other Asian countries continue to look warily for possible signs of revived Japanese militarism, and Tokyo reacts with open edginess every time the issue arises. **********Officials here are especially uneasy when the complaints come from China, to which Japan owes much of its cultural heritage. **********The Yasukuni Shrine, near the Imperial Palace grounds, honors the spirits of nearly 2.5 million Japanese soldiers who gave their lives for their country in the last century. Among those whose souls rest there, however, are convicted war criminals like Japan's Prime Minister in the early 1940's, Hideki Tojo. **********In current political debate, officials who go to Yasukuni tend to find themselves accused as militarists by anti-Government critics. **********For years, governing-party politicians sought to deflect such charges by insisting that their visits were made as private citizens. But Mr. Nakasone, an ardent nationalist, added considerable fuel to the dispute on the Aug. 15 anniversary by becoming the first postwar Prime Minister to state that he had gone in his official capacity. **********'Thought It Only Natural' **********''I thought it only natural to pay homage to those who fought for their country and fell in the war,'' he said early this week in an appearance before Tokyo-based foreign journalists. **********Mr. Nakasone, 67 years old, was in the Japanese Navy in World War II. He saw little combat, serving mostly as a payroll officer, but his experiences and Japan's crushing defeat helped shape many of his nationalistic views. **********On the visit to the shrine, however, he apparently underestimated the depth of feeling in China, which puts its war dead at more than 20 million.

''We have large positions in both stocks in our managed accounts,'' he said. **********Like other producers of business forms, both companies turn out a number of printing-related and other items. Wallace, for example, is also involved in commercial printing and direct mail. Among its diverse activities, Standard Register produces forms-handling equipment. **********For its fiscal year ended July 1, 1984, Wallace earned $1.90 a share. Mrs. Suhl of Merrill Lynch expects earnings of $2.20 a share for the soon-to-end fiscal year and at $2.55 for the following year. The company, S.&P. said, has achieved record sales and earnings for 23 consecutive years. **********Standard Register showed a profit of $1.86 a share in 1984, adjusted for a recent 2-for-1 stock split. ''We're estimating earnings at $2.15 a share this year and at $2.45 a share for next year,'' Mrs. Suhl said. ''The company has increased its earnings for eight straight years.'' **********In yesterday's trading, Wallace eased 1/8, to 35 1/2, while Standard Register gained 3/4, to 32 3/4. **********Share prices for both issues have reached record levels so far in 1985. At the same time, like stocks of some other business-form producers, the shares have been discovered by money managers and their price-earnings multiples now are well above those of the overall market. **********As a result, Merrill Lynch carries a ''neutral'' opinion on Standard Register for the intermediate term of up to one year and an ''O.K. to buy'' rating for the long term. The brokerage firm rates Wallace as ''O.K. to buy'' on an intermediate-term basis and as an outright ''buy'' for the long pull. **********''People seem to have fallen in love with business-form stocks,'' one analyst said. These issues have become especially appealing to investors because they continue to show steady growth in profits in a generally lackluster economy. In addition, some leading business-forms companies have good balance sheets, a relatively high return on equity and a low percentage of long-term debt in their capitalization. **********The only business-forms company that Mrs. Suhl of Merrill Lynch rates as a ''buy'' for both the short and long term is the Reynolds & Reynolds Company. ''It carries the lowest price-earnings multiple in this group,'' she said. ''Management believes that Reynolds is the largest supplier of forms and computer services to automobile dealerships, which account for some 80 percent of sales.'' **********She estimates that Reynolds will earn $4.15 a share for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, and $4.80 the following year. In the fiscal year 1984, the company earned $3.61 a share. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Reynolds slipped 1/4, to 38 1/4. **********The Moore Corporation, based in Toronto, is the world's largest manufacturer of business forms and related products.

The effort started in the early 1980's when researchers found that the original calculations of the bomb's output were flawed. **********''It's kind of a detective story,'' said Wayne M. Lowder, an official at the Federal Department of Energy who oversees the American work. **********The effort now involves about 60 scientists from the United States and Japan and will eventually cost up to $15 million, Mr. Lowder said. The final results are expected early next year and are considered crucial for understanding the threat of radiation to human health. **********''There have been quite a number, about 500, excess cancer deaths recorded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki because of radiations,'' said Dr. Robert F. Christy, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology who is the scientific coordinator of the American program. ''This is the largest existing body of data on how radiation induces cancers in human beings.'' **********Risks of Radiation Exposure **********''What we're trying to do is make the maximum use of this data to set safety limits for human exposure to X-rays and gamma rays,'' Dr. Christy continued. ''This reassessment effort is going to lead to some significant changes in dosimetry, in calculating the amount of radiation it takes to induce cancers.'' **********The work has relevance not only to estimating the effects of nuclear weapons but to assessing risks of exposure to radiation wherever it occurs, in the workplace or in industry, for example. **********In particular, Federal officials say, the revisions might raise the risk estimates for exposure to gamma rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation of great penetrating power. They add that new risk estimates might also affect ongoing litigation involving American military veterans and others exposed to radiation during atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons in Utah and Nevada in the 1950's. **********In addition to raising legal and medical questions, the saga of the Hiroshima bomb hints at uncertainties faced by military planners who try to predict the human consequences of nuclear war. **********''The lesson is that we have no real idea of the extent of the biological effects of nuclear weapons used in wartime,'' said Dr. Hugh DeWitt, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. ''The consequences may be much worse than anybody in the Department of Defense believes.'' **********Differences in First Atom Bombs **********The Livermore laboratory is one of two United States facilities for the design of nuclear weapons. The other one, at Los Alamos, was founded in secrecy during World War II. **********Physicists from Los Alamos detonated the world's first atom bomb in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945. Twenty-one days later, on the morning of Aug. 6, their second atom bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. **********These first two weapons were very different in their design and construction, an important fact in understanding why the Hiroshima bomb remains a puzzle. The first bomb, known as ''the Gadget,'' used plutonium. Its fission reactions began when conventional explosives caused a sphere of plutonium metal to implode. Its detonation occurred in a controlled setting where many measurements were made of its strength and radiations. **********In contrast, the Hiroshima bomb used uranium. Its reactions were triggered not by implosion but by quickly bringing two separate pieces of uranium metal together when one was fired into the other in a gun-type assembly. The bomb, known as ''Little Boy,'' was detonated far from the scientific experts and instruments at Los Alamos. **********Few Tests of Uranium Bombs **********''After the war, the Government predominantly made plutonium devices because of their greater efficency,'' said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a co-author of the ''Nuclear Weapons Databook.'' ''With implosion you can get compression and it has a lower critical mass,'' the point where there is enough fissionable metal brought together to create a self-sustaining chain reaction. **********The upshot was that the Hiroshima bomb remained abstract from a scientific point of view. Plutonium bombs became better understood as they were tested and their strengths and radiations measured during nuclear detonations in the South Pacific and the United States. (The bomb dropped on Nagasaki, ''Fat Man,'' was also a plutonium weapon.) But the Hiroshima bomb remained a curiosity. **********''There was no test of the Hiroshima-type weapon and there has been no test firing of similar weapons,'' said Dr. Paul P. Whalen, a physicist at Los Alamos. **********In the decades following the explosion of the Hiroshima bomb, physicists used computers and the scant available data to try to fathom its mysteries. Their least reliable calculation concerned its strength. President Truman told the American public that the bomb was the equivalent of 20,000 tons of TNT, or 20 kilotons. But the scientists estimated that its strength ranged from 12 to 17 kilotons. Estimates of its radiation output were thought to be more certain, with Los Alamos physicists calculating that it emitted primarily neutrons. **********Debate Over Correct Calculations **********But in the early 1980's, Dr. William E. Loewe of the Livermore laboratory used his facility's increasingly more powerful computers to reevaluate the explosion and found the results sharply at odds with the conventional wisdom. His calculations showed that neutron radiation played almost no role at all, the bomb's output being primarily gamma rays. While radiation from neutrons and gamma rays cause damage by altering some of the crucial functions of body cells, these findings would mean that gamma rays are much more lethal than previously believed. **********A heated controversy followed as physicists argued over which calculations were correct. At the 1981 annual meeting of the Radiation Research Society, Seymour Jablon, an official of the National Academy of Sciences, summed up the frustration. ''It is really appalling,'' he said, ''to think that we stand here, 36 years later, debating orders of magnitude in the doses.'' **********The Federal Government soon embarked on an ambitious joint program with Japan to settle the question by supplementing computer calculations with as much data and as many measurements as possible. **********The research is financed by the Department of Energy, which builds the nation's atomic bombs and studies the health effects of radiation, and the Defense Nuclear Agency, which calculates the health effects of nuclear weapons. **********Building Replica of Bomb **********High in the mountains of New Mexico at Los Alamos, physicists built the replica of the Hiroshima bomb using decades-old materials found in a storage area in a canyon. **********The real prize in the pile of old hardware was an authentic three-ton bomb casing that had been manufactured during the war for the creation of another uranium weapon. The casing was very important. For a critical instant as the Hiroshima bomb exploded at an altitude of 1,900 feet above the city, the casing acted as a filter for the bomb's radiation until the expanding fireball tore the whole thing apart. One question is just what types of radiation it filtered. Another is how it broke up. **********''There has been a lot of argument about the timing of the thing,'' said Mr. Jablon of the National Academy of Sciences. ''How fast did it disassemble? If the casing broke apart a little sooner or later, it would change the radiations that got through.'' **********Creating a Chain Reaction **********In seeking to answer these types of questions, researchers at Los Alamos have carefully assembled a uranium core inside the antique bomb casing and brought its parts close enough for fission to ensue. In this reaction, a speeding neutron splits a uranium atom, releasing a burst of energy, and, on average, two more neutrons that go zooming off to continue the reaction. **********''There was no danger whatsoever,'' Dr. Whalen said. ''There are review committees that make darn sure any critical experiment is reviewed for safety. They even considered things like what would happen if an earthquake occurred.'' **********Preliminary results from the Los Alamos study show that the strength of the bomb was 14 to 16 kilotons, and that, as Dr. Loewe had suggested, neutron radiation seemed to be less important, and gamma rays more important, than previously believed. **********There is still much work to be done in calculating how the bomb's radiations affected humans in Hiroshima over the last 40 years. ''To translate that radiation into a dose, you have to take those gamma rays from the explosion, transport them through a mile of air, transport them through the walls of a building or whatever, and see what happens to a particular human organ,'' Dr. Whalen said. ''Then you compare that organ dose to what the person died of.'' **********Seeking Clues in Hiroshima **********To confirm what kinds of radiations struck the city, scientists are going back and examining such things as old insulators on Hiroshima telephone poles at the time of the blast. The insulators contained a sulfur compound that was activated by certain types of radiation. That activation is today being measured, revealing clues to the strength of radiations four decades ago. **********Here too, the results indicate that gamma rays are more toxic than previously thought. **********''The consequence of this is that the risk estimate for gammas is going to change, maybe it will double,'' Mr. Jablon said. ''That means for a given dose, the risk might be twice as great. I don't think it will be any more than that and it may be less.'' **********''It will probably change some of the risk estimates for some particular biological end points, such as leukemia and lung cancer,'' added Mr. Lowder of the Department of Energy. He said the work's implicatons will be widespread, affecting not only future risk estimates but perhaps ongoing litigation growing out of past exposures to radiation. **********''A common hope among the scientists on this project is that some good can come from what is otherwise an unmitigated tragedy,'' he said. **********The final results of the work are to be presented at a meeting next March of American and Japanese scientists. The researchers say they hope it will be the final chapter in a long quest. In the last 40 years, more than $100 million has been spent in trying to understand just what radiation did to the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. **********Dr. Christy added that no matter how much research was done, some of the mystery would probably remain. ''Science never stops,'' he said. ''Sometimes the money runs out, but we never solve all the problems.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/02/business/patents-limiting-movement-of-head-in-golf-swing.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-03-02", "snippet": "Two men who believe golfers should limit head movement when swinging at the ball have invented a sensor to let players know when this is happening.

Tikhonov, at 80 the oldest member of the Soviet leadership, retired today and was replaced by Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, one of the new younger generation of Soviet leaders. **********The official announcement said Mr. Tikhonov had asked to be relieved of his duties because his health had ''considerably deteriorated.'' His attendance had been reported at only one official function since early July, and there were unconfirmed reports that he had become partly paralyzed. **********Mr. Tikhonov's replacement by Mr. Ryzhkov, who turns 56 on Saturday, had been widely anticipated here, although the timing came as something of a surprise to diplomats. Most had not expected the shift before the next session of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, at the earliest. **********The announcement dominated the evening television news and the newspapers, and thoroughly overshadowed the meeting in Washington between President Reagan and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, which was reported only briefly on television and by the Soviet press agency Tass. **********'Mutually Beneficial' Meeting **********The Tass account of the Reagan-Shevardnadze meeting said the Foreign Minister had conveyed to the President a message from Mr. Gorbachev ''outlining his concrete considerations and proposals'' in connection with the November summit meeting, and described the encounter as ''important and mutually beneficial.'' **********Mr. Tikhonov was one of the last members of the ''old guard'' brought into the Kremlin leadership by Leonid I. Brezhnev. He had been Prime Minister - formally chairman of the Council of Ministers - since 1980 and had been a full member of the ruling Politburo since 1979. Though Mr. Tikhonov formally remains on the Politburo, his retirement from the top party council is expected. **********The elevation of Mr. Ryzhkov, marked another major step in Mr. Gorbachev's swift consolidation of Kremlin power. As a member of the Politburo, one of 10 members of the party Secretariat and the chief of the Central Committee's Economic Department, Mr. Ryzhkov was already the major administrator of Mr. Gorbachev's economic policies, and his appointment as Prime Minister had been generally anticipated. **********As chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Ryzhkov formally takes charge of the 90-odd ministries and state committees whose vast bureaucracies administer all aspects of the centralized Soviet Government. **********Economic Plan Examined **********The appointment was announced the day after the Politburo examined a draft of the ''Basic Guidelines for the Next Five-Year Plan and Beyond That to the Year 2000,'' a document that essentially amounts to Mr. Gorbachev's blueprint for the economy. **********The Tass account of the Politburo session gave few details of the draft, except to say that it outlined ''a large-scale modernization of all branches of the national economy, a more efficient utilization of the already-created production potential, steady growth of labor productivity and perfection of the entire system of management.'' **********It seemed probable that the decision to replace Mr. Tikhonov was made at this time so that Mr. Ryzhkov, one of the key architects and administrators of the new program, would be the one to present it to the Central Committee at a meeting believed to be approaching. **********Tass said the Politburo also discussed the draft of a new edition of the Communist Party ''program,'' or guiding policy. This, along with the economic guidelines, will be the central focus of the party congress set for February. The congress is viewed as a critical juncture for Mr. Gorbachev. **********Already in his six months in power, Mr. Gorbachev has gained considerably more control over the apparatus of Soviet power than any of his predecessors did in the same time. **********Gorbachev Installs His Men **********Since coming to power last March, Mr. Gorbachev has elevated three allies, including Mr. Ryzhkov, to full membership in the Politburo, and named a new Central Committee secretary for agriculture. He has ousted one member, Grigory V. Romanov, from the Politburo, and has replaced some 11 Government ministers and 24 regional party first secretaries. **********Last July, Mr. Gorbachev gave the longtime Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, the ceremonial post of chief of state and put Mr. Shevardnadze, who is younger than Mr. Gromyko, in charge of the Foreign Ministry. **********Many diplomats expect the changes to continue right up to the party congress. In the Politburo, two more Brezhnev appointees - Viktor V. Grishin, the Moscow party chief, and Dinmukhamed A. Kunayev, the leader of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, in Central Asia - are regarded as candidates for early retirement. **********Tass said Mr. Tikhonov had written to Mr. Gorbachev saying that his health had ''considerably deteriorated lately'' and that his doctors had urged him to retire. **********In his letter, Mr. Tikhonov seemed to take pains to laud the new order: ''I am boundlessly grateful to our Communist Party for everything it has done for me,'' he wrote. ''I want to make special mention of the warm, comradely atmosphere that has been created in the political bureau lately.'' **********The tone of the letter suggested that Mr. Tikhonov had not left under pressure. A colorless administrator, he met Mr. Brezhnev while a student in Dnepropetrovsk and followed him to Moscow in the 1960's. **********In 1976 he was made deputy to Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin, and when Mr. Kosygin retired in 1980, Mr. Tikhonov was named to succeed him. As Prime Minister, Mr. Tikhonov was considered loyal and dutiful, but not innovative or particularly effective. **********Tass said it was Mr. Gorbachev who nominated Mr. Ryzhkov to succeed Mr. Tikhonov.

Wood cooking fires burn in the small, oval huts made of saplings with straw mats on the floors. Water is drawn from efficient- looking concrete wells that dot the settlement. Pickup trucks are parked next to the oval huts of the 200-year-old tribe. **********Similar but less scrupulously tended elements of native life can be found at the Kickapoo's decades-old summer home, on a plot of city land in Eagle Pass, Tex., alongside the bridge leading to Piedras Negras, Mexico. **********In Eagle Pass, one drinking fountain provides water for a community of about 40 Indian huts, and the only toilets are in a trailer supplied by the city. **********Viewed as an Eyesore **********In Eagle Pass, the Kickapoo have stirred anger and concern from successive generations of city officials and residents, who have increasingly viewed the informal reservation as an eyesore and a health threat. **********This week, charitable organizations made the last payment on a 125-acre, $350,000 parcel of land intended to give the more than 600 Texas Kickapoo a permanent home in the United States. The land is along the Rio Grande about 8 miles south of Eagle Pass. But not all the Kickapoo welcome the new land, and some say they are wary that it will disrupt rather than stabilize their way of life. **********The Eagle Pass city housing coordinator, Arturo Delgado, called the land purchase ''a very historic moment'' for the Kickapoo, but added that their skepticism was understandable. ''After so long, you go down there and nothing has changed,'' he said. ''It's been promises, promises, promises.'' **********Mr. Delgado, who was a leader in raising the money to buy the land, said the plan could only be ''a long-term solution,'' largely because ''most of the tribe members say they're not going to move.'' **********A 23-year-old Kickapoo who goes by the name of Jay is a lawyer's aide with Texas Rural Legal Aid in Eagle Pass. He said some residents of the Eagle Pass settlement were concerned about the increased distance of the new area from shopping, health centers and other services. Others, he said, worried that the land could become a trap, because ''sooner or later the Government is going to want them to stay here permanently, and that's going to be a problem.'' **********The resettlement plan was part of a law approved by Congress in 1982. The legislation was intended to remove the Kickapoo from their legal no-man's land by permitting them to apply for United States citizenship and allowing them to receive Federal services. **********But many of the Kickapoo say they fear that by moving to a permanent area in the United States and taking advantage of the citizenship offer, they could lose their tranquil sanctuary on the Mexican side of the border. **********''Many people do not want citizenship,'' said Francisco Elisondo as he sat outside his hut in Nacimiento with his young son, repairing a bicycle. ''They're not going to let us come here, they say.'' **********Site of Secret Rites **********That would be disastrous to the Kickapoo culture. Nacimiento, where outsiders seldom venture, has been the site of the Texas Kickapoo's secret winter rites for decades. For more than a century it has been one of the most stable elements of an American Indian culture that, pushed in the early 1800's from its 13 million acres of territory in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, has wandered farther and farther south rather than submit to outside domination. **********It was the scattering of the tribe by a series of treaties and hostilities in the 19th century that led one band of the Indians to cross into Mexico, according to histories of the Kickapoo, whose name is spelled Kikapoo in Spanish. **********The wandering continues, although it now has a pattern. Mr. Elisondo, who is 48 years old, said he spent about seven months a year here but traveled north to the United States in the summer to pick cherries in Utah and sugar beets in Wyoming. **********Other members of the tribe divide their time more evenly among Nacimiento, Eagle Pass and the harvests. As a result, many speak English and Spanish as well as their native Algonquin dialect. No matter what their pattern, all gather here at the beginning of each year for their closely guarded religious rites. **********Supporters of the new United States homestead say it is a major advance for the Kickapoo. ''The land is very important,'' said Nakai Breen, a Cherokee Indian who has championed the Kickapoo cause. ''It is theirs - they are not squatters anymore.'' **********Mrs. Breen said that fears of ouster from the Mexican lands were unfounded. She said an agreement had been reached with the Mexican authorities to allow the Kickapoo to continue to use their land south of the border as long as some them remained Mexican citizens. **********''This is a tribe that doesn't want to give up the old ways,'' Mrs. Breen said.

It was also a significant gesture to President Gemayel in his struggle against Christian opponents who have challenged his authority and pro- Syrian policy. **********The ultimate usefulness of the declaration to Mr. Gemeyel was unclear, however. Political experts here agreed that the statement may calm Syria and Lebanese Moslems. But they said it could at the same time widen the cleavage in Christian ranks. **********The statement was made public after a four-hour meeting called by Mr. Gemayel at the residence of Antonios Butros Khoreigh, the patriarch of Lebanon's largest Christian sect, the Maronites, near the port of Junieh north of Beirut. It declared that Israel was responsible for stirring up Christian-Moslem clashes in the Sidon area in southern Lebanon. At the same time, the conferees emphasized Lebanon's links with the rest of the Arab world ''with a particular emphasis on the strong bonds between Lebanon and Syria.'' **********Fighting Around Sidon **********For the last three weeks, hard-line Christian militiamen have been battling Moslem fighters around the Mediterranean port of Sidon. Christian leaders are afraid that, now that the Israeli Army has left Sidon, thousands of Christians who reside in that area could be massacred or forced to leave their homes if fighting with the Moslem majority is not checked quickly. **********They uphold President Gemayel's view that only Syria, which has more than 30,000 troops in eastern and northern Lebanon, is capable of providing protection for the Christians against the more numerous Moslems. **********The meeting today was called under reported pressure from Syria, which became the main power broker in this country after the Lebanese Government a year ago scrapped a United States-sponsored troop withdrawal agreement with Israel that was regarded as tantamount to a peace treaty. **********The signers of the declaration today included former presidents, all of the Christian members of the national unity Cabinet, and spiritual leaders. **********Major Shift Since 1982 **********The statement marked a major step away from the Christian position in 1982, when there was active support and assistance to Israel before and during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. **********A number of Christian leaders who agreed to be interviewed noted that there were ample grounds for the Christian leadership to turn against israel. They recalled that Israel had let the Christians down by not lifting a finger to help them against Syrian-backed Druse fighters during the fighting in the Shuf Mountains in 1983. Now, they said, the Christians do not want the Shuf disaster to be repeated in the south. **********As many as 170,000 Christians fled their homes in the Shuf Mountains south of here a year and a half ago in the aftermath of fighting with Druse followers of Walid Jumblat after the Israeli Army had evacuated the region. **********After Mr. Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, abandoned the accord with Israel, Syria put the brakes on a Moslem military drive to oust him. Druse fighters stopped short of storming the Christian town of Suk al Gharb, the last stronghold defending the Presidential Palace in the hills overlooking the capital. **********Revolt by Christian Militiamen **********But Damascus saw its position in Lebanon threatened by a revolt staged last month by Christian militiamen led by Samir Geagea, a 32-year-old former student of medicine. **********Mr. Geagea's fighters seized control of Christian areas east and north of Beirut, and challenged Mr. Gemayel's Phalangist Party, generally viewed as the mainstream Christian political organization. Mr. Geagea and several members of a 10-member leadership group he established were known for their former collaboration with Israel. The fighting in the Sidon sector erupted only a week after Christian militiamen in the south declared allegiance to what Mr. Geagea called the ''uprising.'' **********The 42-year-old President Gemayel sought the support of Christian leaders after President Hafez al-Assad of Syria presented what news organizations here described as an ultimatum that unless the fighting in and around Sidon is checked promptly, Syria would intervene militarily to stop it. **********The declaration by Christian leaders, which was read to reporters by Bishop Nasrallah Sfair, the Maronite patriarch's secretary, called for an immediate halt to the Sidon clashes and for the termination of the country's 10-year- old civil war. **********Talks Are Proposed **********The declaration proposed Christian- Moslem talks as a means to insure national peace. **********It warned against what it termed ''the deteriorating situation in the south,'' citing ''instigation from Israel,'' and rejected the establishment of seperate cantons controlled by the various religious sects at the expense of the unity of the Lebanese state. **********This was taken as a reference to Israel's declared intention to create a security zone north of its border with Lebanon, to be controlled by the South Lebanon Army.

These days, the Big Board is still promoting share ownership, but, to its chagrin, is having to acknowledge that not all shareholders of some corporations get the same rights for their money. **********The discrepancy between two different classes of stock within the same company, in fact, is the subject of a heated debate between Congress and Wall Street that now appears headed for a showdown - and will shape the future control and ownership of many of the nation's largest corporations. It stems from the moves in recent years by prominent companies, such as the Coastal Corporation, Hershey Foods and General Cinema, that have issued a second class of stock with superior voting rights. **********In effect, the new class enables a management group of shareholders to gain voting control of the company even though its ownership of the total shares is less than a majority. What bothers some influential members of Congress is that  the issue smacks of shareholder discrimination. And the Congressmen have threatened a legislative assault if the major stock exchanges do not take steps  to stop the trend. **********That assault is growing increasingly inevitable. Indeed, four months after the Congressional warnings were sounded, the exchanges are no closer to agreement than when they huddled for the first and last time in June. **********Powerful Forces **********Those who expected a speedy resolution misjudged the forces at work. Congress's effort to preserve shareholder democracy, it turned out, came head-to-head against a heated competitive battle among the three major stock exchanges and pressure from corporations wanting to consolidate management control to protect against a wave of hostile takeover attempts. **********To be sure, in most cases shareholders, induced by special dividends or promises of greater long-term value in their stock, have generally granted management's wishes to set up the special class. **********Over the last 30 years, some 170 companies have issued a second class of stock with disparate voting rights. Most of those companies are traded over-the-counter or on the American Stock Exchange. While such arrangements have been forbidden for more than 50 years by the New York Stock Exchange, the Big Board is considering loosening its rules. **********The issue boiled to the surface more than a year ago when a half-dozen Big Board companies, including the General Motors Corporation, set up a second class of common stock. Fearing a loss of listings to the Amex and the N.A.S.D., the New York exchange put a freeze on the delisting of companies that were infringing on the rules and set up an eight-member committee to re-evaluate its standards. **********Backed as Essential Tool **********On one side of the debate, defenders of superior voting shares contend that they have become an essential tool to protect the long-term interests of shareholders against the threat of a hostile takeover fed by cadres of arbitragers and speculators who are seeking only short-term profits. **********''We've seen many companies in the greeting card field go under after they were purchased by people outside the greeting card business,'' said Allan J. Goodfellow, secretary and general counsel of the American Greetings Corporation, which issued a second class of stock in 1955 to insure that the founding Sapirstein family maintained control. ''I'm certain our company would have been  swallowed up under tender offers if it weren't for the establishment of two classes.'' **********On the other side of the debate, the issue has sparked fears that much of the nation's wealth and resources could one day end up controlled by entrenched managerial bureaucracies, whose majority voting power would allow them to rule their corporate kingdoms for generations unfettered by the threat of takeovers or the interests of shareholders. **********After studying the issue, The New York Stock Exchange panel recommended that  the exchange allow two classes of shares with unequal voting rights provided the plan is approved by a two-thirds vote of common shareholders, along with other conditions. No final decision has yet been made by the board of directors. **********Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, said the Big Board would prefer to retain its current standards, ''but the competitive environment may very well make it impossible for us standing alone to retain the one-share, one-vote rule.'' **********S.E.C. Move **********For his part, John S. R. Shad, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, pressed the N.A.S.D. and American Exchange to tighten their standards so that the Big Board would not feel compelled to loosen its own. **********On the Congressional front, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, submitted legislation that would mandate one-share, one-vote and vowed to press forward with their bills if the exchanges could not agree on a similar standard. **********Officials from the three exchanges met that one time in June, but no agreement was reached and no other meetings are planned. ''We hosted one lunch and we've heard nothing constructive since then,'' said Gordon S. Macklin, president of the N.A.S.D. **********The Big Board wants the other exchanges to raise their standards. Mr. Torrenzano said the New York Stock Exchange had no plans to take imminent action, but would see what the other exchanges do ''over the next few months.'' **********Study Extended **********The Amex has said it would go along if the N.A.S.D. did. But the N.A.S.D. board decided that the issue required further study. **********''The ball's in Macklin's court,'' Mr. Shad of the S.E.C. said the other day  when asked about the prospects for a resolution. But Mr. Shad said he hoped the  issue could be resolved by the end of the year. **********Mr. Macklin, however, said he did not believe it was possible to complete the N.A.S.D. study and come up with a decision before early next year. Although he said it was too early to predict ''the final outcome,'' he acknowledged that based on the N.A.S.D.'s analysis thus far ''there is very little evidence at the moment supporting'' a one-share, one-vote rule.'' **********Aides to Senator D'Amato and Representative Dingell said they had not yet decided what approach to take but had no intention of letting the issue drop. **********In the search for a solution, policy makers have turned to the academic community, which has conducted some recent studies. But opinions there are also  divided. **********Citing some mutual insurance companies and savings banks as examples, Joel Seligman, professor of securities at George Washington University's National Law Center, said there was evidence that self-perpetuating institutions did ''tend to be less efficiently run than when there is a risk of being taken over.'' **********In addition, he said, the stock was worth less when voting rights were diluted, since the chance for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares from a takeover offer was reduced if management had the voting power to reject all such offers. **********But Harry DeAngelo, associate professor of finance at the Graduate School of  Management at the University of Rochester, said that in scanning the list of major companies that have issued a second class of stock -including The Washington Post Company, The New York Times Company, Nike and Adolf Coors - one  would find well-recognized names and successful products, not evidence of management having grown lazy because of their voting control. Furthermore, he thinks superior voting shares can in some instances bolster long-term stock values - such as in the case of newspaper companies that need to remain in trusted, independent hands. **********''There are sensible economic reasons for these arrangements and stockholders and managers are perfectly capable of deciding under which circumstances they are appropriate,'' he said. **********Financial Motivation **********Research by Professor DeAngelo also indicates that management has substantial financial motivation to perform well even if they are legally entrenched. In cases where management has majority voting control, according to his research, they typically own at least a 25 percent financial stake in the company. Of 45 companies studied, he found only two instances where managers had majority control but owned less than a 10 percent financial stake. **********As for fears that large numbers of corporations would seek to grab voting power from their shareholders if the New York Stock Exchange changed its rules,  Wayne H. Mikkelson, a finance professor at the University of Oregon, said history had shown otherwise. ''On the American Stock Exchange, corporations have had the ability to do this for as long as I know and we haven't seen a rush among Amex-listed corporations,'' he said. **********No matter what the outcome, Robert B. Reich, professor of business and public policy at Harvard, is not worried about shareholders. Even if they lose voting control, he said, they still can ''vote'' by selling their shares, which itself  can be a powerful discipline on management. ''The vote is moment by moment, second by second.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/business/amc-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.M.C.

''And it's a defeat for the hard line the Comminists have chosen in these past months.'' **********The referendum was seen as a Communist attack on the political weak point of the Government's economic policy. The Communists were seeking to restore wage increases cut by the Government from the system of automatic pay raises - known as the ''scala mobile,'' or ''escalator'' - designed to compensate for inflation. **********The Government had reduced the increases in an effort to control inflation.

These traditionally conservative areas voted strongly for the Government parties a month ago, but may have been making an economic protest in the referendum. **********Still, Communists and their sympathizers have acknowledged that a change of strategy is in order. **********The referendum results were especially heartening for Mr. Craxi himself, who promised to resign if the referendum was approved.

That would bring Mr. Craxi's term to three years, a remarkable achievement in a country where Prime Ministers usually count their terms in months. **********Divided Union Movement **********On the labor front, the referendum divided the Communist-led General Confederation of Italian Workers from the other two big union federations, and even the confederation found itself split. For the Communists, according to Mr. Pellicani, the results could weaken Communist influence in the unions and on economic policy generally. That was one reason why the stock market went up so much. **********In this area, the Communists may have been helped by Monday's decision by the employers' federation to annul the existing wage agreements in an effort to push for smaller raises. **********Mr. Del Pennino said he regretted the employers' decision. ''It's the one thing that will allow the Communists to mobilize their base,'' he said. **********But this, he added, may prove scant comfort for the Communists. ''It's not so important that the Communists lost votes,'' he said. ''It's more important that the Communists now find themselves in a position of isolation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/world/7-die-in-india-bus-plunge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "7 Die in India Bus Plunge", "print_headline": "7 Die in India Bus Plunge", "body_text": " **********A crowded bus plunged into a ditch today, killing 7 people and injuring 60.

He was arrested by the Greek authorities after his two colleagues had hijacked the plane, but was later flown to Algiers to join the hijackers in exchange for some of the passengers aboard the T.W.A. plane. **********Two Training Camps Described **********Senator Helms said that according to information gathered by his own staff, one Iranian camp where Mr. Atwa was trained had Boeing 727 and 707 airliners parked on a runway to familiarize hijacker-trainees with cabin layout and controls. The other camp was what Senator Helms described as ''a special training center for suicide squads.'' **********According to his account, Mr. Atwa was aboard an Iranian C-130 Hercules plane that took officials of the Revolutionary Guards to Damascus, Syria, on June 8 or 9. **********''By June 10, it is believed that the Iranian officials were in Baalbek (Lebanon) working on the actual logistics and operations of the hijacking operation,'' Senator Helms said. Four days later the hijacking occurred. **********Senator Helms also said the Iranian Parliament appropriated about $65 million for an Iranian foundation that is believed to finance Shiite extremists in Lebanon. **********According to the Senator's account, Iran developed the hijacking operation through a group known as Hezbollah, or Party of God.

Senator Helms suggested that this was the main motivation for recruiting Ali Atwa for the hijacking. **********Monitoring by Helms's Staff **********Senator Helms, who is a ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said his information was based on his staff's monitoring of developments in Iran, Lebanon and Syria in recent months, especially in the last eight weeks. Aides said they had Iranian, Lebanese and other Moslem sources in the United States and overseas with whom they maintained contact. **********Based on this information, Senator Helms set out a detailed description of what he said was the ''infrastructure of terrorism'' established by Iran's ruler, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, throughout the Middle East. **********Concentrating specifically on the latest hijacking incident, Senator Helms, declared that the American people ''have yet to learn of the deep involvement of the Khomeini regime in setting the hijacking in motion.'' **********He said that if the reports reaching his staff were accurate, Iran had designated June 14, the day of the hijacking, as the ''Day of Jerusalem,'' to be marked by Shiite Moslems. **********Senator Helms said there had been a transfer of $30 million from Iran to Lebanese Shiites in the weeks before the T.W.A. hijacking. **********The channel for the funds, he said, was the Iranian Martyrs Foundation, whose chairman, Hojatolislam Mahdi Karrubi, visited Lebanon twice, in early and in late May, for meetings with pro-Iranian Lebanese clerics in Beirut and Baalbek. **********The Senator asserted that the Iranian Parliament had appropriated the equivalent of $65 million for the Martyrs Foundation and that Hojatolislam Karrubi had transferred ''at least half of the money to the local radicals and leaving the other half with the Iranian Ambassador in Damascus.'' **********Foundation Described by Iran **********An Iranian broadcast, in reporting on a visit by Hojatolislam Karrubi to Lebanon, described the Martyrs Foundation as an agency for providing welfare and employment for the families of those who have died in the Shiite cause. American officials say they believe the families of Lebanese terrorists get funds from the foundation. **********The Iranian radio has reported monthly flights from Lebanon to Iran of people financed by the Martyrs Foundation, one arriving May 5. **********''Among this group was one Ali Atwa, whose brother had been killed in fighting two months before and who became one of the three original hijackers of T.W.A. 847,'' Senator Helms asserted. ''In Iran, Atwa underwent a rigorous terrorist training course at a center near Meshed.'' **********That was the training center with the airliners, Senator Helms said. **********''Later Atwa went to a special training center for suicide squads at Monzariyeh Park, close to Khomeini's residence in Teheran,'' the Senator said. ''It is reported he spent three days there.'' **********According to the account, the Iranian plane that delivered Mr. Atwa to Damascus also carried Mohammed Ali Avie, chief of staff of the Revolutionary Guards, and Moselem Reza Aghili, chief of the ideological or intelligence section of the Revolutionary Guards. **********''The purpose of the Avie and Aghili visit was to handle the actual logistics and operations of the hijacking of T,W.A. 847,'' Senator Helms said. ''By June 10, the two were in the Baalbek region of Lebanon in order to assist in the overall operation.'' **********At about that time, the Senator said, Mr. Kurrabi was sent to Damascus with Mohsen Rafiq-Dust, Minister of the Revolutionary Guards, to discuss the Lebanese situation, according to the Iranian radio. **********Iran's explanation for Mr. Karrubi's travels was that he intended to condemn the attacks by the Amal Shiite militia, headed by Nabih Berri, on the Palestinian refugee neighborhoods in southern Beirut and to resolve differences between Lebanese Sunni and Shiite Moslems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/24/business/at-t-cable.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

''There was no way we could ask them to do so under our system,'' he said. **********After Mr. Speakes made his remarks, spokesmen for the network news divisions said that they planned to broadcast the remarks but that the timing remained unclear. **********An ABC News spokesman, Tom Goodman, and Wendy Walker of Cable News Network said their networks would broadcast the speeches at 1 P.M. New York time. A CBS News spokesman left open the possibility that the network would broadcast the speeches on its evening news. An NBC News spokesman, Marylou O'Callaghan, said both speeches would be carried between 1 P.M. and 1:30 P.M., but that scheduling problems were delaying a decision on the exact time until Monday morning. **********According to the agreement, the President will be speaking during the time the main Soviet newscast is normally broadcast, when the largest number of people are watching television there, United States officials said. **********American officials could not estimate the potential number of Soviet viewers. They had said Mr. Reagan broadcast to a possible audience of 23.6 million in a 10-minute radio address carried to the Soviet Union by the Voice of America in November. **********Mr. Speakes said the Administration was ''reasonably sure'' the Russians would not edit the tape of Mr. Reagan's remarks, which he is make Saturday in his hotel suite here after his weekly national radio address. **********Mr. Speakes said Mr. Gorbachev was expected to make his tape this weekend. The tape will be taken to the United States Embassy in Moscow and then flown to the State Department in Washington, which will make copies available to the networks. **********The announcement today seemed to be a continuation of the warming in United States-Soviet relations that emerged at the Geneva summit meeting. **********The last Soviet leader to speak on American television was Leonid I. Brezhnev, who made a 47-minute taped speech in 1973. A year earlier, President Nixon made a televised speech to the Russians in Moscow. **********Statement on Afghanistan **********Meanwhile, in his statement on Afghanistan, Mr. Reagan said the resistance within that country had grown ''increasingly effective'' in fighting the Russians and was ''unswerving in their determination to resist the invader.'' **********''The resistance fighters are more numerous, better armed, and more effective than ever before,'' he said. **********At the same time, he said, ''The Soviet-supported regime in Kabul has failed to gain even a modicum of popular support or international acceptance.'' **********Mr. Reagan said that although the United States supported a negotiated end to the fighting, he told Mr. Gorbachev at the summit meeting that Soviet troops in Afghanistan remained an obstacle to improvement in relations. **********The President plans to spend two days in Los Angeles before making his usual trip to Palm Springs to spend New Year's at the Walter Annenberg estate.

Wexner, the chairman of The Limited, would probably keep Geraldine Stutz, who is the president and managing partner of Bendel and a pioneer in luxury retailing, in her current position. A spokesman for The Limited declined to comment on the reports. Miss Stutz did not return phone calls. **********While Bendel is currently owned by Miss Stutz and a group of European investors and is intimately identified with New York, The Limited would not be its first out-of-town corporate owner. Until 1980, when Miss Stutz's group bought the store for a reported $8 million, it was owned by Genesco Inc., a Nashville apparel and retailing concern that had previously also owned Bonwit Teller and the Plymouth Stores. **********The sale price being discussed with The Limited could not be determined, and the sources said it was unclear whether The Limited would purchase the land and the building. **********Miss Stutz has been running Bendel since 1957, at which point it was losing money catering to the carriage trade. **********She transformed the store to suit her own style, that of a trim, well-turned-out jet-age woman. She also made it profitable. **********Her most visible retailing innovation - now a much-imitated institution - was the store's Street of Shops, which carries an idiosyncratic selection of beauty, fashion and household accessories. **********Mr. Wexner is one of the most highly regarded managers in retailing.

Stork, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, a Chicago-based subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation that specializes in credit analysis. **********Techniques of refinancing vary from issue to issue, but the aim is usually the same - reduce interest expenses by replacing high-interest bonds with low-interest bonds. Corporations benefit because reduced interest expenses mean higher profits, and local governments and agencies benefit because lower interest costs mean more money for other uses or maybe even lower taxes. **********Drawbacks for Investors **********Investors, however, may not be pleased by refinancings of corporate bonds, especially if they decide to reinvest their money in new bonds at a time when interest rates have declined. Investors' distress may be alleviated if the old bonds are bought at a price well above par, but there are circumstances in which companies can retire bonds at face value. A research report by the First Boston Corporation noted that many utility bonds can be retired at par through sinking-fund payments or if the company sells assets. **********''Investors who believe they have noncall or nonrefund protection shouldn't be lulled into complacency,'' Mr. Stork said. ''Any clever financial executive can find his way around such indenture restrictions.'' **********For example, in 1983 the Archer Daniels Midland Company retired its 16 percent debentures due in 2011 even though many investors thought they were protected against that until 1986. The company was sued by Morgan, Stanley & Company, but a Federal court supported the company since the debentures were refunded with proceeds of a common stock sale. **********The South Carolina Electric and Gas Company has also attracted attention with an announcement that it would retire its 16 percent bonds due in 2011 at a price of 100 early this year. The company can retire the debt before the five-year call-protection period ends and at less than the specified call price because its bond indenture allows it to use ''proceeds of released property'' to make such redemptions. **********More recently, the New England Telephone Company and the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company are using the proceeds of new issues to retire high-interest instruments before the lapse of their five-year periods. The two companies are offering to pay $1,175 for outstanding $1,000 bonds bearing coupons of more than 15 percent, and are financing the purchases with new debentures yielding less than 12 1/2 percent. **********A different technique is being used by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which recently announced plans to call Pacific Telephone's 15 1/2 percent debentures due in 2020 at a price of $1,130.10 - the redemption price specified for the old bonds. **********Tax-Exempt Issues **********Refundings of tax-exempt bonds issued by local governments and authorities may not be so painful for investors as the retiring of corporate issues. In fact, investors may be pleased, since in some cases they will be left with holdings that have increased in quality and value. **********Examples of refundings of tax-exempt bonds include this week's $500 million financing by the Intermountain Power Agency, which will use the proceeds to refund bonds sold in 1981 that carry an interest rate as high as 14 percent. If market conditions are favorable, underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company said the Intermountain offering may be increased to refund other high-interest bonds. A similar $250 million financing by the New York Power Authority has been scheduled for Feb. 26 through Salomon Brothers to refinance 12 1/8 percent bonds sold in 1981. **********The old long-term bonds of Intermountain and New York Power will not be retired immediately. Instead, proceeds of the new bonds will be invested in Treasury securities that will be held in escrow and used to pay interest on the old bonds until they are retired at a price slightly above par on the first call date, usually 10 years from the date of issuance. Having the backing of Treasury issues raises the credit quality of the old bonds, and the new, shorter maturity means that the bonds sell with a higher price and lower yield than previously. Refinanced bonds backed by Treasury issues are known as ''escrow bonds.'' **********For state treasuries, the refinancings are quite attractive. A plan announced by the State of Washington calls for the sale on Feb. 13 of about $133 million of new bonds to refinance bonds sold in 1982 when the state's interest cost was 13.34 percent. M. Lyle Jacobsen, assistant state treasurer, noted that interest rates have declined enough that the new bonds might cost about 9 percent - that would save the state $14 million in interest payments during the life of the new issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/31/business/hambrecht-quist-loses-its-edge.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1985-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAMBRECHT & QUIST LOSES ITS EDGE", "print_headline": "HAMBRECHT & QUIST LOSES ITS EDGE", "body_text": " **********SAN FRANCISCO **********In the 16 years in which Hambrecht & **********Quist built itself into the technology industry's pre-eminent investment banker and venture capital firm, it has often witnessed the problems that can derail a high-flier. **********Such a company can be suddenly besieged by competition from larger companies and newer start-ups. It can grow too fast and lose control of its overhead. A cyclical downturn can send profits plunging. And the entrepreneur who founded the high-flier can prove incapable of running it as it grows, and must give way to more seasoned managers. To a greater or lesser extent, these problems affected Apple Computer, Convergent Technologies, Eagle Computer and many other companies that were backed or brought public by Hambrecht & Quist. **********But now, in a cruel twist of irony, the lesson is hitting closer to home. In textbook fashion, Hambrecht & Quist itself has fallen victim to the same problems. **********Competitors, including big brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Company and Kidder, Peabody & Company, have cut into the firm's business of underwriting stock offerings for high-tech companies. In addition, the market for technology stocks dried up last year, shortly after Hambrecht & Quist had completed a major expansion, increasing staff and opening new offices. And true to the pattern, co-founder William R. Hambrecht, always more a deal-maker and strategist than a manager, last month relinquished many of his day-to-day responsibilities to Thomas S. Volpe, a 33-year-old corporate finance whiz kid. **********All this has taken its toll.''Hambrecht & Quist is not playing the dominant role in its segment of the industry as it used to, or as it could have been,'' said a former company official, who asked not to be named. Agreed Norman Fosback, who edits an investment advisory letter on new public offerings: ''Now H. & Q. is just one of the pack.'' **********The company managed or co-managed only 14 public stock offerings that raised $352 million in 1984, an astonishing drop from a total of 56 deals, worth $2.2 billion, in 1983. And this year, only two stock offerings have been handled so far. **********With so few offerings, Hambrecht & Quist's revenues in calendar 1984 dropped 40 percent, to about $70 million, from $120 million, according to sources with access to the financial records of the privately held firm. Pre-tax profits plunged 80 percent, to $7 million, from $38 million in 1983. **********Morale has been low and turnover high. More than half of Hambrecht & Quist's 20 research analysts left or were fired last year. And some former executives say the company is undertaking questionable public offerings to drum up business, at great risk to its reputation. The quality of one particular offering now in registration - the Encore Computer Corporation, a company with a lot of promise but no product yet - is the subject of much debate in the investment community. **********Hambrecht & Quist vigorously defends its judgment. ''We think Encore is going to be a real company,'' Mr. Hambrecht said. ''Come back in two years and see if we are right.'' **********Mr. Hambrecht and his executives say that their firm's various problems are short-term ones caused by rapid growth and the downturn in the market. They say the low point has passed and a turnaround is in progress. ''I think the reality is a lot better than the perception,'' Mr. Volpe said. **********As part of the turnaround effort, Mr. Volpe last month took over from Mr. Hambrecht as president and chief executive of Hambrecht & Quist Inc., the investment banking subsidiary of the Hambrecht & Quist Group, the parent. Mr. Hambrecht, 49, remains president and chief executive of the parent company, but will concentrate on venture capital financings, his main interest. **********''I felt Tom was ready to take it over,'' said Mr. Hambrecht, adding that management ''is never a role I've been interested in.'' **********MANY experts agree that the market for technology stock offerings will improve later this year, giving Hambrecht & Quist's earnings a shot in the arm. They say there are already signs of improvement, although the firm is not yet out of the woods. **********But for Hambrecht & Quist there is more to a comeback than earnings. The big concern is whether it can recover its old stature and reputation. At one time, the Hambrecht & Quist name on the front of a stock offering prospectus was regarded by investors and technology companies as a Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Being brought public by Hambrecht & Quist put a company in the same league as some of its famous alumni, such as Apple Computer and Genentech. **********But events in the last two years have shaken that faith and raised questions about how much quality control underwriters should, and do, exercise in deciding whether to offer stock to the public. **********In the 1983 public offering frenzy, many high-tech companies sold newly issued stock to the public at top prices. Shortly afterward, the prices collapsed because of the shakeout in the computer industry or mismanagement. Investors were burned, and numerous shareholder lawsuits were filed against the companies and their underwriters. Hambrecht & Quist acted as underwriter for its share of such companies - Eagle, Diasonics and Wicat Systems, for example - although it was by no means alone. **********Mr. Volpe, who joined Hambrecht in 1981, about five years into a career as an East Coast investment banker, acknowledges that many such offerings probably should not have been made. ''We wear hair shirts a lot around here,'' he said. But he added that the company has tightened its procedures since then. A decision to do an underwriting must be approved by a committee composed of the heads of all Hambrecht departments. **********YET former officials and outsiders say the company is still **********straining to come up with attractive public offerings. Hambrecht & Quist had to cancel three public offerings last year, partly because buyers did not want the stock. The company last year also made a rare departure from technology to underwrite the initial public offering of Chalone Inc., a winery in which Mr. Hambrecht owns a 10 percent stake. Now Hambrecht & Quist is attempting to raise $30 million through an initial public offering for Encore, a company in which the firm has invested $2.2 million in venture capital. **********Encore has three founders with giant reputations - Kenneth G. Fisher, former president of Prime Computer Inc.; C. Gordon Bell, once chief technical officer at the Digital Equipment Corporation, and Henry Burkhardt 3d, a founder and executive at the Data General Corporation. But Encore is working on a risky new computer technology, has no product out and no profits. Yet the proposed offering would give Encore a market value of more than $130 million. Many liken the offering to that of Trilogy Ltd., a company that raised a huge sum of money in a public offering on the reputation of its founder, Gene Amdahl, but then failed miserably to develop its computers. **********Mr. Volpe defended the decision to take Encore public. ''All the risks are spelled out in hair-curling detail'' in the prospectus, he said. **********HAMBRECHT & QUIST has been right more times than not since its founding in 1968. At that time, Mr. Hambrecht headed the West Coast corporate finance office of Francis I. du Pont & Company, a brokerage firm that has since gone out of business. The late George Quist headed the Bank of America's venture capital operations. Over drinks at a bar, the two men, who had collaborated on some venture deals, decided to form their own company. The very next day, they raised over $1 million from wealthy investors. **********From the start, Hambrecht & Quist's business has rested on two legs. It is a venture capital company, meaning it invests in high-tech companies just getting started. A venture capitalist receives a large ownership stake in the company for a relatively small investment. Later, if the company is successful and goes public, or is acquired, that stake becomes worth many times the amount invested. One venture capitalist who invested $57,600 in Apple in its early days ended up with $14 million in stock when the company went public in 1980. **********Hambrecht & Quist is one of the largest venture capitalists, managing more than $450 million collected from institutional investors and wealthy individuals. It has expanded its venture operations overseas to Japan, Europe and Taiwan. The company collects a yearly management fee of about 2 percent of the total money it manages, plus 20 percent of the ultimate profits from the investments. **********The second business is investment banking, which also can be highly profitable. An underwriter might collect 5 to 7.5 percent of the total amount raised by a stock offering, although some of this must be split with syndicate partners. **********The two activities play well off each other. The venture business provides a stream of companies to take public - while taking a company public provides a way to recoup the venture capital investment. **********The arrangement has been criticized by some as having huge potential for a conflict of interest. The venture capital side might invest in a company merely to gain the underwriting business and might do an underwriting merely to improve the return on its venture capital business. Nevertheless, many brokerage firms have since started venture capital operations, in part to help them gain underwriting business. **********Hambrecht & Quist struck it big in late 1980, when it co-managed the initial public offerings of Genentech and Apple. But some company officials are most proud of another 1980 deal. The company ventured out of technology to underwrite the initial public offering of a new airline that no other investment banker would touch. **********''I think it was the best pure underwriting that's ever been done,'' boasted William R. Timken, an executive vice president. People Express Airlines must certainly agree. **********But success bred competition in the 80's. The three main competitors are Alex. Brown & Sons of Baltimore; L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin of New York, and Robertson, Colman & Stephens, a San Francisco company patterned in some ways after Hambrecht & Quist. These three, plus Hambrecht, are known as the Four Horsemen. **********All brokerages have seen underwriting profits dry up in the market downturn. But most of them, including Alex. Brown and L.F. Rothschild, offer a variety of financial services, making them less dependent on technology stock underwritings than Hambrecht & Quist, which has chosen to stay specialized. ''Our people wouldn't know a bond if it came in and bit them,'' said Mr. Volpe. Robertson, Colman is as specialized as Hambrecht, but has avoided costly expansion, operating with a staff only one-third the size of Hambrecht's. **********Hambrecht's staff started increasing three years ago, in an effort to allow the company to compete more effectively against the Morgan Stanleys of the world. The company has since opened offices in New York, Boston, Los Angeles and London, and grew to more than 370 employees last year, from 129 at the end of 1981. Since the middle of 1984, the company has slimmed to 340 employees through layoffs and attrition. **********THE rapid growth strained Hambrecht & Quist's management. **********That was especially true after the December 1982 death of Mr. Quist, who, as a numbers-oriented ''Mr. Inside,'' proved a stabilizing influence on the dynamic, but somewhat erratic ''Mr. Outside,'' Bill Hambrecht. **********Mr. Hambrecht is described by those who know him as extremely energetic and personable. He is a director of about a dozen companies that his firm has backed. A Princeton graduate, he is an avid Democrat and helped bring the Democratic convention to San Francisco last year. But his chief interest is growing things, as demonstrated not only by his venture capital efforts but by his hobbies - raising orchids and grapes. **********But Mr. Hambrecht, as a manager, often ran the company as if it were still a two-man outfit. And he hired people without traditional Wall Street experience, believing it was not as important as corporate experience. ''You can't just have financial types,'' he said. ''In the business we're in, we must understand the technology and the operating problems these companies might face.'' **********But sometimes that backfired. Robert Wall, a former chief financial officer of Cipher Data Products Inc., was hired as head of corporate finance in 1983, an arrangement that did not work out. And the firm has had four research department chiefs in 30 months, one of them being William Perry, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense. **********IN an attempt to remedy those staffing problems, the firm last fall acquired Woodman, Kirkpatrick & Gilbreath, a two-year-old San Francisco brokerage house that also specialized in technology stocks. Dean Woodman became head of corporate finance and L. Duane Kirkpatrick became head of research at Hambrecht & Quist. But some Hambrecht people resented the new Woodman people brought in over them. **********Turnover has been greatest in the research department, partly because of the constant change in research chiefs. In addition, many of the researchers had been hired during the boom in 1983 - with first-year salaries of $300,000 to $500,000, about twice what Wall Street technology analysts make. But when the year ended, they were told their high salaries would not be renewed. **********Mr. Kirkpatrick also forced out several analysts who were recruited when Hambrecht & Quist was a small firm. They had concentrated too much on long-term industry developments, which are important for a venture capitalist, but not enough on short-term stock movements, which are important for institutional investors, Mr. Kirkpatrick said. **********The constant turnover hurt Hambrecht & Quist's underwriting business. For a while after a company goes public, the only analyst following the company might be the one at the underwriting firm. It is thus important for both the company and the institutional investors that an underwriter have good analysts. When the Software Publishing Corporation went public last year, it chose two of the other Four Horsemen, partly because they had stronger analysts than Hambrecht. The turnover at Hambrecht also was a cause for concern, said Janelle Bedke, a founder of Software Publishing. **********Mr. Kirkpatrick acknowledged that the lack of research support also annoyed some companies Hambrecht had previously taken public, companies which might not use Hambrecht for subsequent underwritings. But now, he said, the research department is strong and customer complaints are being remedied. **********The venture capital side of the house has also had departures and setbacks, though on a smaller scale. Three of the four partners who used to run Hambrecht's venture capital operation have left, or plan to leave, to start their own funds. Hambrecht itself failed to raise all of the $100 million that it sought for a fund that it started last year. Leslie C. Gallaugher, who manages the University of California's endowment and pension funds, said Hambrecht rates better than most venture capital outfits, but only ''middle of the road'' among the companies to which the University gives money. **********Still, the venture operation has substantial strength. The departing executives are being replaced by big names in technology such as Bob Evans, a former top engineer at the International Business Machines Corporation, and Theo Heinrichs, former chief of Miles Laboratories Inc. **********Some of these executives are being used to help revive Hambrecht- backed companies that are floundering. To its credit, industry executives say, Hambrecht is one of the few underwriters that will try to rescue its companies. Stewart Carrell, a former Texas Instruments Inc. executive, is at the helm of Diasonics Inc. Q.T. Wiles, a turnaround specialist who is chairman of the board of Hambrecht & Quist, is now at work on several companies. **********Some suggest Mr. Wiles should spend more time on Hambrecht & Quist itself. But the company is confident. ''We're in a cyclical business,'' said Mr. Hambrecht. ''We'll be there for the next cycle - and that's what's important.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/04/world/9-us-mexico-crossings-are-closed-after-threats.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1985-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "9 U.S.-MEXICO CROSSINGS ARE CLOSED AFTER THREATS", "print_headline": "9 U.S.-MEXICO CROSSINGS ARE CLOSED AFTER THREATS", "body_text": " **********Security at border stations between the United States and Mexico was stepped up and nine border crossings were closed Saturday night after threats against United States Customs Service agents, officials of both countries said today. **********The actions were taken after what the Mexican Government said were anonymous threats of ''the possible kidnapping of some United States officials.'' The move was by agreement between the two Governments, a statement from the Mexican Interior Ministry said. **********Spokesmen for the United States Embassy and the Customs Service said the threats, details of which were not given, were believed to be linked to the increased pace of investigations into Mexico's drug trade since the abduction last month of a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar. **********''We've gotten some threats on customs agents,'' said Lee Johnson, the embassy spokesman, ''and so the Customs Office in Washington decided to close nine of the small, mostly one-person border crossing posts between our two countries.''

The agreement was signed Sept. 12, but Hisashi Shinto, the president of Nippon Telegraph, is currently visiting the United States, arguing to both politicians and business executives that American companies that understand Japanese telecommunications needs will have little difficulty in selling goods there. Disagreement in U.S.American telecommunications experts disagree. In several recent speeches Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, has charged that Nippon Telegraph has not lived up to a 1981 agreement calling for the purchase of more American telecommunications equipment. Such purchases, he and others maintain, actually leveled off or declined in 1984, and Mr. Yeutter has suggested that the agreement may have to be ''re-evaluated.'' **********Meanwhile, Nippon Telegraph has in recent weeks reportedly been negotiating the purchase of additional equipment from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Northern Telecom. In a speech yesterday to the Japan Society in New York, Mr. Shinto contended that Nippon Telegraph has ''the most open, competitive, non-discriminatory procurement system in the world.'' **********Under the agreement signed by Mr. Shinto and Takeo Shiina, the chief executive of I.B.M. Japan, the new joint venture company will be created by the end of the year. Its primary task is the creation of a ''value added network,'' a telecommunications system that enables companies to tap into remotely located computers and to exchange text, computerized images and graphics over telephone lines. **********Initially, I.B.M. said, the venture will employ only about 100 employees, mostly from Nippon Telegraph. The telephone giant, which has more than 300,000 employees in Japan, will maintain the physical network, while I.B.M. Japan will provide the software and computer terminals used in the systems. I.B.M. will also be responsible for marketing the system. Marketing Mostly I.B.M.  ''We expect the new company will market mainly I.B.M. products,'' said Nadine Fletcher, a spokesman at I.B.M.'s world headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. ''But the joint venture will be free to market other products as well, regardless of manufacture.'' **********Analysts said that the agreement was a coup for I.B.M. Japan, because Nippon Telegraph has established accounts with virtually every potential corporate computer user in Japan. I.B.M. was particularly eager to reach the agreement, they noted, because of a similar deal worked out in July between A.T.&T. and several leading Japanese computer manufacturers, including Fujitsu and Hitachi. **********Both A.T.&T. and I.B.M. offer similar networks in the United States, but so far they have met only lukewarm success. The chief users are banks, brokerages and insurance companies that want to disperse centrally stored information about clients to a number of field offices. **********Some Problems Overcome **********Creating such networks in Japan, however, has run into a series of problems. Nippon Telegraph has insisted that the communications standards, or protocols, used by its equipment would not match those used by I.B.M. and other American companies. After a two-year study, however, the companies concluded that the problems could be overcome. ''We have been working on computer software that would connect the I.B.M. and N.T.T. systems,'' Mr. Shinto said in New York yesterday, ''and that has now been completed.'' **********The Nippon Telegraph-I.B.M. agreement seems certain to draw some criticism in Japan, where fledging Nippon Telegraph competitors have already complained that a link with I.B.M. would reduce competition in the marketplace. Mr. Shinto dismissed those contentions yesterday. But a Nippon Telegraph spokesman said he ''assumed'' that at some point the agreement would be reviewed by the Japanese Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/world/hostages-lebanon-week-tension-israel-us-apparently-resolve-some-differences.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1985-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1298, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  ISRAEL AND U.S. APPARENTLY RESOLVE SOME DIFFERENCES ON HOSTAGE CRISIS", "print_headline": "HOSTAGES IN LEBANON: A WEEK OF TENSION;   ISRAEL AND U.S. APPARENTLY RESOLVE SOME DIFFERENCES ON HOSTAGE CRISIS", "body_text": " **********After a week of tension and virtual noncommunication between Israel and the United States, Israeli officials indicated today that the two countries seemed to have patched up at least some of their differences over the Beirut hijacking. **********Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the Israeli radio today, ''What we have heard up until now from the United States definitely matches our own position and views.'' **********His comments came after Prime Minister Shimon Peres spoke on Friday with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, and the two men reportedly reaffirmed their joint resolve not to give in to the demands of the hijackers. **********On Sunday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is scheduled to appear on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' and Prime Minister Peres on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' Both are expected to emphasize that America and Israel are standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the fight against terrorism and that any misunderstandings are now behind them, senior officials here said. **********Start of a Campaign **********The appearances by the officials appear to be the start of a campaign by Israel to explain its position and combat the information coming out of Beirut from the the Shiite militia Amal and from the hostages themselves. **********Until the phone conversation on Friday between Mr. Peres and Mr. Shultz, there are said to have been no high-level Israeli-American contacts about the hostage crisis, which was then eight days old, even though the two allies are deeply intertwined in the affair. Officials in Israel say there were several reasons for the communications lapse. **********Early in the week, Israeli officials say they felt they were getting mixed signals from Washington. Although publicly the Reagan Administration seemed to be taking a hard line, Israeli officials said they believed the American public and lower-level White House and State Department officials were blaming Israel for the crisis and were looking for the Israelis to take the United States off the hook by releasing the 766 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees, as the hijackers have been demanding. **********A 'Signal' Perceived **********''Rabin in particular had the feeling that the United States, instead of delivering a clear message, was using public opinion, Congressmen and senators and the families of the hostages to send the signal to Israel to release the detainees without being asked by Reagan,'' a senior official in Israel said. ''That was the main reason he got so testy with Ted Koppel on 'Nightline' and said, 'If you want us to do something, say so directly.' '' **********The Israeli radio reported today that President Reagan and Mr. Shultz had been insulted by Mr. Rabin's remarks on the ABC News program Wednesday night, and Mr. Peres is believed to have smoothed over the episode with something of an apology in his conversation with Mr. Shultz. **********A second problem, officials in Israel concede, is that Samuel W. Lewis, who was the American Ambassador to Israel for the last eight years, retired at the beginning of June, leaving the Tel Aviv Embassy in the hands of diplomats who are less experienced and have far less rapport with the Israeli leadership. **********Several officials in Israel said privately that they did not believe things would have got so out of hand had Mr. Lewis still been here. The Ambassador-designate, Thomas R. Pickering, the former American envoy in El Salvador, is not scheduled to arrive for several weeks. **********Low Profile Sought **********A third problem is that Israel knows that it is perceived by the rest of the world as holding the key to a resolution of the hijacking, if it would give in to the hijackers' demands to release the 766 detainees being held in Israel's Atlit prison. **********Given the policy implications of having to release the men under a terrorist threat, however, Israel says it feels it can hardly be expected to come forward and volunteer to do so. **********In hopes of getting the spotlight off Israel, the Cabinet voted last Sunday to take a low-profile approach. Prime Minister Peres called on all Government officials not to comment on the hijacking or on potential Israeli responses, in order not to draw attention to the Israeli role in what is perceived here as an American problem. **********But the Israeli Cabinet appeared to have underestimated the level of interest in the hijacking in the United States. In Israel, the public and the press have treated the hijacking as just one more terrorist affair in which Israel is only indirectly involved. At many hours, the events in Beirut are not the lead item in news reports, and follow stories about a textile strike or the border dispute with Egypt over Taba. **********Taken Aback **********Thus, Israeli officials were taken aback by the tremendous pressure from foreign and Israeli journalists to break their silence, and it was not long before the dam of silence started to break. **********But because the Israeli Cabinet is a fragile coalition, virtually none of the comments were coordinated. As a result, Mr. Rabin took a very hard line, particularly with the United States; Mr. Peres spoke in milder tones, and Mr. Shamir was somewhere in the middle. **********Because of the delicate relationships within the Cabinet, Mr. Peres's ability to impose a unified public line is limited. In addition, the day-to-day handling of the affair belongs to Defense Minster Rabin. **********Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin are longtime rivals for power, and each tends to let the other run his own affairs with a minimum of interference and advice. It is not clear how much Mr. Rabin, Mr. Shamir and Mr. Peres have coordinated their responses since the hijacking began, but it does not appear to have been a great deal. **********Difficulties in South Lebanon **********Although Israel is trying to keep a low profile regarding the situation in Beirut, it is finding it increasingly difficult to ignore the situation in southern Lebanon, where the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, has been involved in almost daily battles with Shiite forces near the Israeli border. **********Western security sources in southern Lebanon reported that at 2 A.M. today, a series of explosions rocked Hasbeya, a village that the South Lebanon Army controls eight miles north of the Israeli border, and that several ambulances from the militia's command post in nearby Merj 'Uyun were sent to the area. **********Israeli Army spokesmen no longer comment on events in southern Lebanon that involve the South Lebanon Army, although several hundred Israeli troops are still in the narrow strip, five to nine miles wide, that Israel refers to as its security zone north of the border. **********In addition, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force Lebanon, Timor Goksel, announced today that some 2,000 Lebanese Shiites from the villages of Yatar and Kafra had fled their homes since Thursday night under shelling by the South Lebanon Army. **********The refugees, who included some 700 children, have flocked to Qana, a village controlled by the United Nations force, where they were provided with blankets and food Friday night by the force's Fijian battalion. Most of the refugees are living in homes and buildings provided by the Qana residents, Mr. Goksel said. **********The South Lebanon Army, which has long been at odds with the residents of the two Shiite villages in southern Lebanon, has said that it shelled Yatar and Kafra, which are on the northern edge of the so-called security zone, in retaliation for roadside bombs and Katyusha rocket attacks that the militia said had been perpetrated by village residents against the militia's positions, according to Mr. Goksel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/30/world/per-monsen-of-norway-dies-was-journalist-since-1930-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Per Monsen of Norway Dies; Was Journalist Since 1930's", "print_headline": "Per Monsen of Norway Dies; Was Journalist Since 1930's", "body_text": " **********Per Monsen, a Norwegian journalist who was former director of the International Press Institute and editor in chief of the Norwegian news agency N.T.B., has died, his family said today.

Already, another Japanese company, Mitsubishi, manufactures Sperry's personal computers. **********Sperry's statement, however, contained no specifics about equipment that Hitachi might manufacture, and company officials refused to be interviewed on the subject. But the statement did say that the two companies ''have also agreed to a joint development effort looking at the feasibility of integrating, through acquisition of components or by license, certain Hitachi technology into Sperry's 1100 system architecture.'' The 1100 is Sperry's leading mainframe system. **********Analysts generally welcomed the news, saying Sperry would save tens of millions of dollars that it would otherwise have to spend in semiconductor and packaging technologies to develop high-speed circuits for its next-generation machines. Most credited the company's new president, Joseph J. Kroger, who has led the concern's troubled computer division. **********'A Plus for Sperry' **********''It's a plus for Sperry because they will have access to leading-edge technology,'' said Jonathan Fram, a technology analyst with Paine Webber Inc. Other experts noted that the agreement was particularly important to Sperry because of the failure of Trilogy Ltd., a Silicon Valley start-up company in which Sperry invested heavily to design very-high-density circuits on a single silicon wafer. **********''With Trilogy's technology out of the running, they needed some state-of-the-art technology, and Hitachi was the answer,'' said Thomas Crotty, an analyst for the Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., computer consulting group. **********The alliance also appears to broaden Hitachi's presence in the United States. Currently, the company sells its I.B.M.-compatible computers through the National Advanced Systems unit of the National Semiconductor Corporation. Now, it appears to be hoping to adapt much of the same basic technology to Sperry's architecuture, which differs significantly from I.B.M. designs. **********A Growing Movement **********The move also accelerates a growing movement among I.B.M.'s biggest competitors: to let others manufacture their equipment and concentrate instead on marketing and software. Honeywell, for example, also relies on Japanese suppliers for some key equipment. **********''It is really where the money is these days,'' Mr. Fram said. Others agreed, noting that I.B.M.'s tremendous manufacturing economies -stemming from the fact that the company is 10 times bigger than its next biggest competitor - made it nearly impossible for Sperry to keep up with price cuts and new technologies. **********Sperry also said that it was negotiating to purchase ''certain peripheral equipment'' from Hitachi that would be sold under Sperry's own label. That equipment would presumably include disk drives and printers. **********Separately, Hitachi said that it would establish a new manufacturing company, called Hitachi Computer Products (America) Inc. in Norman, Okla., to produce large-scale disk drives.

Responding to questions in Parliament, the Prime Minister called the matter of a possible Canadian refuge for Dr. Mengele ''repugnant and repulsive in the extreme to our citizenship.'' **********In Washington, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, said there was agreement within the Reagan Administration that the case should be examined, at least initially, by the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations. In 1983 the office, formed to prosecute war criminals who entered the United States illegally, investigated American intelligence contacts with the former head of the Gestapo in Lyons, Klaus Barbie, now awaiting trial in France. **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said he was appealing to the Central Intelligence Agency to check postwar intelligence files for the declassification and release of any information on the Mengele case. **********Listed as 'Joseph Menke' **********Army intelligence documents recently obtained by the Simon Wiesenthal Center under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that Dr. Mengele may have been arrested and released in the American zone of Vienna in 1947 and that he may have sought a Canadian visa from Buenos Aires under a pseudonym in 1962. American intelligence was informed of the visa application, made in the name of ''Joseph Menke,'' and replied to the Canadians with information about Josef Mengele but any subsequent followup has not been revealed. **********The Army withheld four pages of Canadian records on the ground of foreign government confidentiality. But they suggest, according to an official familiar with the case, that the man calling himself Mr. Menke actually gained entry to Canada. Whether or not that man was Dr. Mengele, however, remains unclear from the records. **********At a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal Center for the study of Nazi crimes, called for a full Government investigation. He said that if the records being withheld were not made public, the center would file suit in Federal court to compel their release. Senator D'Amato said that if necessary he would join in the lawsuit. **********Dr. Mengele, the chief physician at the Auschwitz death camp, where about four million people, most of them Jews, were gassed and cremated by the Germans, has been sought for arrest by West Germany since 1959. He was last known to be hiding in Paraguay. **********Meanwhile, a former inmate of Auschwitz recalled, on the eve of his departure for Poland for a commemmoration of the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the camp, that the Nazi doctor was an enigmatic figure who protected his human ''guinea pigs'' and showed a bizarre interest in Jewish culture. **********The former inmate, Marc Berkowitz, a 52-year-old furniture salesman from New City, N.Y., said he and his 12-year- old twin sister became experimental subjects for Dr. Mengele after their father and brother were executed by the Germans and they and their mother were shipped from Czechoslovakia to Auschwitz in 1944. **********'Something Terribly Wrong' **********He said he still suffered from the spinal injections and experimental surgery performed on him by Dr. Mengele and that the doctor ''knew he was doing something terribly wrong.'' **********But at the same time, Mr. Berkowitz said, the doctor ''wanted to keep us safe when they wanted to exterminate us.'' **********He said the doctor ''liked Jewish mannerisms and attitudes'' and delighted in using certain Jewish expressions, even affectionately nicknaming the youth for a Jewish sage. **********He was also the recipient of perverse acts of kindness, Mr. Berkowitz said. One day, he recalled, he was in a camp garden picking brussels sprouts for Dr. Mengele's dinner when he noticed a column of women marching through the dust to the gas chamber. Among them, he saw, was his own mother. **********''Dr. Mengele saw this and gave me a message to carry so I could follow my mother to the gas chamber.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/04/business/business-digest-thursday-july-4-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, JULY 4, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, JULY 4, 1985", "body_text": " **********Companies CBS offered to buy 21 percent of its stock, at a cost of nearly $1 billion, in a plan that appears to put Ted Turner's takeover offer in severe jeopardy.

He not only got these people, who were potential threats, to live within eyeshot but he forced them to spend a great deal of money on the pilgrimage, depleting their treasuries. **********The procedure was known as sankin kotai, and it came to mind for some Japanese today because their Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, had taken off for the United States this holiday season to confer with President Reagan. **********It amounted to a latter-day sankin kotai, some said, pointing out that the politicians of Japan's governing party pick a Prime Minister every other year, and then almost immediately - by habit, if not edict - he goes to America. Just like the feudal lords in their treks to Edo. **********Some Grumbling Heard **********There were people who grumbled that by now the Japanese should be beyond having to make these pilgrimages. ''If they were going to talk real hard, I could understand.'' one banker said. ''But this is just for courtesy.'' **********Some members of Mr. Nakasone's entourage were also known to be unhappy. After all, no matter what understandings he may reach with Mr. Reagan, regardless of anything the communiques will say, the real issue was that the Prime Minister had done something virtually no Japanese ever does in the first few days of January. **********He worked. **********New Year's may be a holiday in most countries. In Japan, it is a passion. **********People prepared for it in a frenzy of cleaning and shopping and mailing and gift-giving and - all too frequently - drinking, the Japanese having a custom of throwing memorable parties for the sole purpose of forgetting. The object is to obliterate the old year. This will soon be followed by another round of parties, to greet the new year before it has a chance to grow cynical with age. **********City Suddenly Transformed **********On Monday evening, all the activity came to a dead halt. It was like watching a whirligig suddenly frozen and somehow sent floating in space. All sense of motion ended. **********Few big cities could be transformed quite as startlingly as Tokyo is during the New Year's holidays. **********Businesses shut down, some for nearly a week. People fill the streets, as always, but they do not race as purposefully as usual, pushing the less driven out of their way, oblivious to everything except getting to wherever it is they are headed. If it is possible for crowds ever to be gentle, they become so in Tokyo at New Year's time. **********This is not, most people would probably agree, the prettiest of capitals. Its architecture is functional, and the dominant color is ferro-concrete gray. **********But in the last few days Tokyo has acquired a silky grace more captivating perhaps than inherent beauty. The whole city has become an Oriental Easter Parade - women in kimonos of colorful swirls, girls with fur wraps around their necks, men who left Western suits in the closets and ventured forth commandingly in dark-blue robes and wooden clogs. **********Shrines and Temples Thronged **********On Jan. 1, starting at midnight, millions of people poured into Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. The holiday is, foremost, a religious occasion, given to families and to reflection. **********Tradition was well-tended. More than 80 million worshipers - two out of three of all Japanese - will likely have visited shrines and temples by Thursday night. Today, by the many thousands, people crunched their way across gravel paths at Nijubashimae to enter the Imperial Palace grounds, where the 83-year-old Emperor, Hirohito, wished them yet another good year. **********Like most of Asia, Japan observes the 12-year zodiacal cycle borrowed from the Chinese. Unlike most other countries, however, Japan starts its year at its own pace - characteristically speeded up, on Jan. 1 instead of late February when the lunar year begins. **********By acclamation, 1984, the Year of the Rat, was deemed a dull year. No one said that as a complaint, mind you. The economy chugged along nicely, and when workers opened envelopes containing year-end bonuses - worth two months' salary, in many instances - they found they had done 5.4 percent better, on average, than in 1983. **********Now for the Year of the Ox **********This is the Year of the Ox, and the Japanese Zodiac Almanac, a popular publication produced by a group of astrologers, predicts that it will be marked by prosperity but also by economic tension between Japan and the United States. **********Then again, one did not need a fortune teller to figure that out. Almost any recent speech by an American politician or Government official makes much the same point. **********That is a big reason why Mr. Nakasone was in California with Mr. Reagan today instead of back home, working hard at doing nothing. **********His family would probably miss him, he said the other day, but his wife, Tsutako, took solace in being spared the usual stream of visitors to the Prime Minister's residence. Actually, Mr. Nakasone added jokingly, she might not consider it a bad idea if he made an American pilgrimage every year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/28/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " **********Comfed Savings Bank, Lowell, Mass., announced the appointment of Joel Rosenberg as senior vice president and treasurer.

''Our fathers and grandfathers have never been under the control of a foreigner. Our God says if a foreigner attacks you, you must fight. For that reason, we are willing to give the lives of our fathers, mothers, sisters and ourselves. **********''We are happy if we kill the Russians,'' he said. ''We are also happy if we lose our relatives and ourself in the way of God. In both cases, that is good for us.'' **********Bashir Ahmed Shadadyar is an Afghan resistance leader with an unusual mission: he wants to get Soviet forces out of his country by invading theirs. **********''If we attack the Russians inside their own territory, maybe they will leave our country more quickly,'' he said. **********With that in mind and initially armed only with 300 copies of the Koran and other Islamic literature, Mr. Shadadyar said, his followers began crossing into the Soviet Union three years ago from his home province of Takhar on the border. **********Mr. Shadadyar, a 28-year-old with gray eyes, a small pointed nose and a quiet, intense appearance, is a Tadzhik, an ethnic group whose members are found on both sides of the Afghan-Soviet border. In the Soviet Union, they live in the republic of Tadzhikistan. **********Crossing Point on River **********''There is a 12-kilometer stretch of the Amu Darya where the mountains come down on both sides,'' he said, referring to the border river. ''It was always a place where people crossed back and forth. The people on both sides of the river are Tadzhiks and dress and look alike.'' And, he said, they are also Moslem. He recalled that his men had floated across the river on inflated goat and cow skins as they pushed a wooden raft carrying the Korans to be distributed on the other side. **********After the first venture, ''we sent rebels across many times.'' Later, he said, they mined roads and killed some Soviet officials. ''I went myself once and stayed a week.'' **********Those on the other side, he said, told him that ''they have their own Islamic organizations but did not have enough equipment to fight the Russians.'' **********His private invasion ended last year when, after several unsuccessful attempts to destroy him with the use of Afghan soldiers, the Soviet troops mobilized a large tank and infantry force and encircled his bases in the mountains of Takhar. **********Reports 2,000 Villagers Killed **********In addition to 600 of his 700 fighters, 2,000 villagers were killed, he said, though his report could not be independently verified. He said that 32 of his commanders were in jail and that he had lost all his supplies. **********He took the rest of his forces to Pakistan for rest and resupply, he said, and while there, he gathered new recruits. They were trained in southern Afghanistan, where he had helped to organize the growing resistance movement after the 1978 coup. **********Now, he said, he has 300 men and is ready to renew his raids and distribution of the Korans inside the Soviet Union. **********''This is a military tactic,'' he said. ''When you are attacked, you reply by attacking the enemy. **********''If I can start an Islamic struggle there,'' he added, ''maybe they will become better organized and start a revolution inside their own country.'' **********The rebel commander, a butcher before he joined the resistance, sat in a grove of apple trees sipping tea with his followers and told of his strategy in fighting the Soviet troops. **********Once, he said, a Soviet general sent him a letter through a villager, offering to release two of the commander's fighters if he would agree to a truce. **********''I sent him back a letter saying I agreed,'' the commander recalled. ''The men were released, and the next day I attacked a Russian post and killed some Russians and destroyed a tank.'' **********The rebel leader, Sulfi Finder, is 50 and has a gray beard, a missing front tooth and the flat stomach of a man half his age. **********He operated a successful butcher stall in a bazaar near the village of Waliyan until the Communists seized power eight years ago. Then, he said, he gathered nine men with hunting rifles, pistols, knives and axes and began to attack Afghan Government offices in the area. **********A Reputation for Daring **********In the years since, he has gained a reputation among other rebel commanders for his daring, cunning and fierce hatred of the enemy. He is illiterate, but Mr. Finder says that is not important. **********''We learn from the Holy Koran,'' he said, ''that when an anti-Islamic foreigner comes into our country, you must fight against him. It does not matter if you are educated or uneducated.'' **********Now, he and his large group of followers operate from a base near Waliyan, which is on the highway between the large Soviet base at Qiligai and the Salang Pass tunnel through the Hindu Kush. **********Mr. Finder said four of his five sons had joined him; two were killed in Soviet attacks. He himself was wounded three times, he said. His fifth son, still a child, would join the war when he is old enough. **********As the circle of rebels listened, Mr. Finder recalled another of his experiences with the Soviet troops. **********Letter From Another General **********After the letter from the Soviet general, he said, he received another, this one from a general in the Afghan Army, who said he wanted to establish two defense posts along the highway to Salang. **********Mr. Finder said the general believed ''that I could be easily persuaded because I am not educated. **********''He said the posts would be good for the villagers because he would not attack them and they would be safe,'' he continued. ''I sent him back a letter saying I might accept and that I would meet him at a certain place to talk about it. I said he should come without arms. I sat in ambush on the way to that place and captured him and three other Afghan Army officers.'' **********Later, Mr. Finder said, Soviet commanders in the area offered to give him several captured rebels and 16 Kalashnikov rifles in exchange for the Afghan general. **********''I did not listen,'' he said, ''and the general and other officers were killed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/world/judges-reach-verdict-in-aquino-murder-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Judges Reach Verdict In Aquino Murder Case", "print_headline": "Judges Reach Verdict In Aquino Murder Case", "body_text": " **********A verdict has been reached and will be announced in eight days in the trial of Gen.

But the building, under construction since last September at 52 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, is also a vivid example of how community groups can use their influence at City Hall to reshape the plans of a developer. **********The story began two and a half years ago when the developer, the Sybedon Corporation, a New York- based mortgage banking company, proposed to build a 27-story tower on the property, which is only 31 feet wide by 80 feet deep and lies between the five-story mission and a 16-story cooperative building. **********The proposed structure was immediately labeled a ''sliver'' by the community groups that opposed it. **********Development of sliver buildings, often only as wide as a town house but rising far above neighboring structures, was restricted by the city last March. When 52 Park Avenue was proposed, however, the local outcry over slivers had only begun. It peaked last year over a 32-story Murray Hill sliver on Madison Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets. **********Moreover, the Park Avenue building, as originally proposed, was within the zoning regulations. There seemed to be little that civic groups such as the Murray Hill Committee, which led the opposition to the building, could do. **********Sybedon, meanwhile, under economic pressure to utilize the land as fully as possible, had applied to the City Planning Commission for a 20 percent space bonus under the city's Housing Quality Program. Under that program, a developer agrees to add certain quality-of-life amenities to a building in exchange for permission to build a larger structure. **********It was Sybedon's bonus application, city officials say, that provided the leverage - wielded by the Murray Hill community groups and the City Planning Commission - that ultimately induced Sybedon to voluntarily reduce the building's height to 21 stories. **********The company also redesigned the building's facade to make it blend more closely with the surrounding buildings, which are mostly limestone and brick, and it agreed to contribute $76,000 to the Park Avenue viaduct renovation. **********The result was a compromise in which everybody got something but gave up something as well. Sybedon got its bonus - a total of 6,000 square feet - which allowed it to build a larger structure on the same small plot, though not as large as it had originally planned. The community groups got the building reduced in size and ostentation but lost their bid to have the building permit rejected. **********The building, which is to be completed by the end of this year, is no longer classified as a sliver - by the city, by the developer or by spokesmen for the community groups. **********But for Donald M. Flaks, Sybedon's 50-year-old president and co-founder, the compromise itself created a problem: With only about 1,300 square feet of livable space on each floor, and with fewer stories in the building, the original mix of duplexes, triplexes and floor-throughs was beginning to look impractical, given the $13 million proposed cost. **********''We found that the best we could get on one floor was a nice one-bedroom,'' Mr. Flaks explained. ''We saw the market as wanting something larger.'' **********Last year the building was redesigned to contain all duplexes, a total of only 10 apartments, each averaging about 2,500 square feet. That makes them not only the largest apartments to be built in Murray Hill in many years but also the most expensive - close to $600 a square foot. Designed as three-bedroom units, they can be converted to two or four bedrooms. **********The building's architect is David Kenneth Specter. **********Richard Lamondin, a vice president at Marketing Directors Inc., which is in charge of the sales program, said the small number of apartments and the high prices had led to an unusual sales program: Mobile sales presentations will be taken to potential buyers' homes or offices. **********Mr. Lamondin said he expects sales to begin in April. Surveys have suggested that most of the buyers will be current residents of Murray Hill, which extends unofficially from 34th to 42d Streets and from Madison Avenue to the East River. **********Lawyers, in particular, have shown an interest in the building. **********''If we're totally successful, 10 people will buy here and the world will never know this building was marketed,'' Mr. Lamondin said. ''It will be the quietest sales program ever.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/08/world/defendant-in-plot-on-pope-seized-in-turkey-after-leaving-bulgaria.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1985-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 537, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFENDANT IN PLOT ON POPE SEIZED IN TURKEY AFTER LEAVING BULGARIA", "print_headline": "DEFENDANT IN PLOT ON POPE SEIZED IN TURKEY AFTER LEAVING BULGARIA", "body_text": " **********Bekir Celenk, one of eight people being tried here for purportedly conspiring to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, was detained by the Turkish police late Saturday night after he arrived unexpectedly in Istanbul from Bulgaria. **********Mr. Celenk, a 50-year-old businessman who fled to Bulgaria in 1980 after army officers seized power in Ankara, had been sought in Turkey on smuggling charges.

But they said there did not seem to be any obstacles to keep Italian officials from questioning Mr. Celenk in Turkey. **********Described as a Go-Between **********Mr. Celenk, a mysterious figure with broad business interests ranging from Turkey and Bulgaria to Switzerland and Britain, has been described by Mehmet Ali Agca, the prosecution's key witness in the trial here, as having served as a go-between for Bulgarian officials and members of the Gray Wolves, a right-wing Turkish group, in supplying money and logistical support to kill the Pope. **********Mr. Celenk has often been linked with Turkish underworld figures operating out of Sofia who are purportedly involved in drug and arms trafficking. **********In the 1970's, Mr. Celenk operated a small trading company in the Swiss city of Biel.

Roman Catholic and Government weeklies have been publishing long, virtually uncensored accounts of the trial that are passed from household to household. And a Government poll taken last week showed that nightly broadcasts of selected portions of testimony are being heard by 7 of every 10 Poles. **********The trial, the first public prosecution of the security forces in a Communist country, has stimulated responses here similar to those that were evoked by the Senate Watergate hearings in the United States. **********Wide Topic of Conversation **********Office workers, diners in restaurants and passengers on trains often talk spontaneously about what they know and what they think about the trial of the accused killers of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko. **********''Did you hear how the last witness said his department was concerned with Father Popieluszko because the priest violated the biblical precept to love thy enemy?'' asked a Warsaw writer in disbelief. ''He did not love his enemy, so they killed him.'' **********His comment was typical of dozens volunteered at every gathering. As details unfold in court here without necessarily clarifying the crime, hypotheses offered in public are also multiplying. One body of opinion tends to believe the key defendant, Grzegorz Piotrowski, who has asserted that the killing grew out of his attempt to intimidate Father Popieluszko into suspending his political activities and that this mission was inspired by his superior. **********Then there is a widely volunteered suspicion that Captain Piotrowski's admission is merely a false front intended to hide the fact that the killers set out at someone's orders to kill Father Popieluszko, even carrying stones halfway across Poland to weigh down his body. **********A Machiavellian Conception **********The exponents of this view usually say the defendants are still protecting the instigators. **********And there is also in circulation a Machiavellian conception advanced by some lay Catholics that the killing has been exploited if not inspired by the Government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski or by the people around General Jaruzelski in the hopes of subduing rivals in the security apparatus and raising the relative power of the army. **********However, the greatest wonder generated so far has not concerned such disclosures as police arrogance, abuse of power and ineptitude but rather the fact that the trial is taking place in public and receiving wide coverage. **********''I simply cannot understand it,'' said Adam Michnik, one of Poland's best known and most often jailed dissidents. ''It is remarkable and nothing like it has happened in the history of Communism since 1919.'' **********Other fulltime Government critics conceded that even if everything was not being revealed, much more was being presented then they had thought likely. One dissident said the disclosures were eroding the reputation of the police and that he had heard that people were now teasing police officials even while they waited in line to apply for passports. **********Some Propaganda Gains **********A Government lawyer who had been monitoring the trial for a propaganda agency declared that some evidence ''damaged reputation of the Ministry of Interior.'' He added, however, that such losses were more than offset by the credibility being gained for Polish justice and the Polish press both here and abroad. ''This is the first time that Western media are quoting Polish news accounts without irony.'' **********Not everyone accepts the relative openness at face value. ''Yes, the trial is being conducted better than other trials,'' said a woman associated with a church group that is monitoring the case. ''And, yes, the press has been better than usual.'' She went on: ''But what does it mean? You have to know that when they do something that looks right it is usually for a wrong reason. Let us wait before we give out any medals.'' **********Here in Torun the political ramifications of the trial have been buried under a storm of sometimes titilating, often incomprehensible details. On Tuesday, for example, five drivers, mechanics and dispatchers from the Ministry of Interior testified about a permit found after the murder in the car used to transport the priest's body. **********From the evidence it remains unclear whether the permit was issued to Captain Piotrowski by his superior to facilitate a trip out of town on the day the priest was killed 150 miles from Warsaw, or whether the document was forged to make it appear this way, or whether it was altered and thus obscured the fact that it could have been real. One of the investigators of the case was quoted as saying earlier that there appears to be ''a conspiracy within a conspiracy.'' **********Key Memory Lapses **********Today the trial inched along, with a Warsaw security official testifying laconically on meetings he had with two of the defendants about curbing the political activities of Father Popieluszko. For three and a half hours the witness, Leszek Wolski, claimed key lapses of memory about these conversations, which took place in the month and a half before the priest was killed. **********Under questioning, he acknowledged that he was aware of the talk about ''frightening the priest'' but insisted he took this to mean pressing church leaders to silence the cleric. **********In the end the witness, who said he had been detained for 48 hours in connection with the investigation, avoided implicating any of the accused or himself. For the most part he said he could not recall details, that departmental regulations simply precluded illegal action and that he had not heard statements that other witnesses said had been made in his presence. **********Such testimony raised the eyebrows of some of the priests in court and at one point Judge Artur Kujawa lectured the clerics on their behavior. He said that entry cards had been issued for members of particular professional groups but added that these people could leave if they found the proceedings offensive. There have been other moments when policemen in civilian clothes who were admitted to the court as members of the public have responded to testimony in whispers to each other that express amazement or doubt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/21/business/bhopal-leak-not-sabotage-report-says.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1985-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BHOPAL LEAK NOT SABOTAGE, REPORT SAYS", "print_headline": "BHOPAL LEAK NOT SABOTAGE, REPORT SAYS", "body_text": " **********Indian Government scientists, in a report issued today, declared that the Bhopal toxic gas leak last year was caused by a complex chemical reaction that could not have resulted from sabotage. **********The report said that important safety precautions were not taken at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, where the accident occurred, and that, to begin with, the plant was poorly designed. **********The 81-page report was the latest effort by the Indian Government to rebut the contention of the Union Carbide Corporation of Danbury, Conn., that the accident began when someone deliberately introduced water into a tank containing methyl isocyanate, a volatile and toxic chemical.

Nor did it conclude how water leaked into the methyl isocyanate storage tank, which Union Carbide says was the sole cause of the disaster. **********Rather, the report said that, based on experiments, it had concluded that water, in combination with certain ''metallic contaminants'' caused by corrosion of the metal storage tank, set off the reaction. **********Water itself could not have set off such a violent chemical reaction, the report asserted. **********A news release from the Indian Government tonight said that ''anyone wishing to cause an accident of this nature would have to be presumed to have very substantial knowledge and information.'' **********Union Carbide officials did not comment tonight. But in the past, company officials have dismissed the contention that only a person with a sophisticated scientific background would have known how to sabotage the plant. **********Carbide officials say that a saboteur would only have needed to know that the introduction of water would disrupt the system. This, they say, was known to most plant employees. **********Today's report was prepared under the supervision of Dr. S. Varadarajan, a chemist who heads the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Indian Government's central research organization. **********The report also outlined other safety problems at the plant, indicating that ''conditions were ripe'' for a runaway chemical reaction. **********Many of these problems have been acknowledged by Carbide, such as the shutting down of a refrigeration system for the tanks and the shutting down of a flare tower that was supposed to burn off excess gas. **********Exactly how the water entered the storage tank was not determined by the report, but it said a ''quite likely'' place was a series of pipes from a filter system that was being washed. Carbide has acknowledged that a worker washing the system had neglected to insert a metal barrier in one of the pipes that day. **********However, the company maintains that four other barriers were in operation in the pipe, and that the water would have had to travel too long a distance to get to the tank and cause the accident."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/business/a-regional-report-the-pacific-northwest-a-benchmark-case-on-comparable-pay.html": {"writer_name": "Kathleen Sharp", "pub_date": "1985-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A BENCHMARK CASE ON COMPARABLE PAY", "print_headline": "A REGIONAL REPORT: THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST;   A BENCHMARK CASE ON COMPARABLE PAY", "body_text": " **********NEARLY 10 years ago, the state of Washington asked Norman D.

Opponents of the Sandinista Government, including President Reagan, held up the Indians' plight as an example of official repression in Nicaragua. **********But the Government has now acknowledged that it mistreated and misunderstood the Miskitos, who share a vast, swampy rain forest in eastern Nicaragua with Sumo and Rama Indians, English-speaking blacks, Creoles and several other non-Spanish ethnic groups. **********On May 29, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra announced that the Indian refugees would be allowed to return to what they consider to be their sacred land. The announcement was greeted with some skepticism by the Indians. This week, they started home.  The Miskitos' journey back to the villages along the Coco, if completed, could have far-reaching political consequences. **********The Miskito guerrillas are part of the third group of rebels that has been battling the Government, along with the Honduras-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force and the Costa Rica-based Democratic Revolutionary Alliance. By allowing the tribes to return home, the Government is meeting a major demand of the Miskito rebels. **********President Ortega said he hoped the move would ''advance the search for peace on the Atlantic coast.'' **********The Government announced its decision to allow Indians to return just days after the collapse of six months of peace talks with a key Miskito leader, Brooklyn Rivera. **********Mr. Ortega's statement said the Government ''is willing to renew these conversations whenever asked.'' **********Mr. Rivera charged at the time that the Sandinistas were not serious about recognizing Indian rights. One of his senior aides said in an interview this week that rebel leaders would watch the progress of the Coco River resettlement before deciding how to respond. **********Once a Commercial Center **********For visitors to Waspam, where many of the Indians were returning this week, it was hard to believe that the place was once a thriving commercial center, the largest town on the river. **********''Churches, theaters, stores, markets, horses to ride, an airstrip, schools, clinics - we had everything in those days,'' said Diego Lucas, one of the Miskitos who returned. **********After Miskitos began to rebel, asserting that Sandinista laws were disrupting their ancient ways of life, the Government decided at the end of 1981 to clear them from the river bank entirely. More than 10,000 were taken to refugee centers that Mr. Rivera called ''camps for ethnocide,'' and the rest scattered in the interior or fled across the river into Honduras. **********Sandinista soldiers were sent to destroy more than 50 river villages so guerrillas would not be able to use them as bases. Some of the towns were only damaged, but others, like Waspam, were burned to the ground. **********The Miskitos who arrived this week at Waspam and at Saupuka, a few miles down the river, face overwhelming challenges as they start to rebuild. They lack food, medicine, tools, building materials and canoes for fishing. **********To make matters worse, no one has a weapon to kill the big jungle cat, possibly a jaguar, that slipped into a house in Saupuka before dawn today and ate a dog before being chased away. **********Singing and Crying in River **********But the obstacles have not dampened an outpouring of ecstasy by the returning refugees. **********''On the first day, people were running into the river with their clothes on, singing and crying,'' said Silvia Miguel, who for the last three years worked as a teacher in Puerto Cabezas, 80 miles southeast of here. ''We could never be happy outside this place.'' **********Over the last year, Sandinista leaders have pleaded ignorance in their treatment of the Indians and pledged to change their policies. **********''We had only a vague idea of what the Atlantic coast is,'' Interior Minister Tomas Borge said last week. ''We are not anthropologists.'' **********Miskito rebel leaders said their war with the Government was different from that being waged in the Pacific half of the country, where more than 90 percent of the population lives. The Indians said their goal was not to overthrow the Sandinistas, but only to defend their rights as indigenous people. **********Recognizing the international concern about the Miskitos' fate, the Government has appealed to private organizations to aid their resettlement. Groups from Britain, France, Sweden and Belgium have promised to help. **********The Government has also asked United Nations officials who supervise refugee camps in Honduras to encourage the 10,000 Indians there to return to Nicaragua. **********The Miskitos who have returned recognized that their immediate future will be grim. Until the crops being sown now are harvested at the end of the year, they must depend on the Government and foreign agencies for food. **********Today, the first 17 families to return to Waspam sat around small fires as they tried to absorb what has happened to them and their town. Everyone remembered where they had lived, and all said they would rebuild on the same plots. **********The Government has taken a considerable risk in allowing the Indian villagers to return. They clearly symphathize with the Miskito rebels and seem more willing to aid them now than in 1981. **********Miskito leaders say they believe their military pressure forced the Sandinistas to abandon their policy of keeping the river bank unpopulated. **********At the same time the Indians are beginning their move homeward, the Government is also moving to meet growing calls for autonomy for the Atlantic coast region. Officials have said that the autonomy plan now in preparation will allow Indians and other coast people to retain their traditions and elect their own regional government leaders. Many coast people remain deeply suspicious of the Sandinistas, however. **********Group of 42 Kidnapped **********The Miskitos, who have known little peace in recent years, face more daily tragedies as they come home. A group of 42 who were sent to help prepare their land was apparently kidnapped by an anti-Government band last week. In Santa Fe, a few miles west of Waspam, Miskito volunteers clearing land for planting struck a mine, and six people were killed and three wounded. **********Nonetheless, it is all but impossible to shake the Indians' conviction that everything in life is better if it is done near the Coco. **********''Suffering, hardship, sickness or even dying is all right as long as we are in our place,'' said Lamberto Chow as he hacked at the tropical foliage that has overgrown the plot where his house once stood.

Although the company failed to capture the hearts, minds and wallets of the computer-buying public, the Otrona did deliver some unique software. **********An accessory program called Valet allowed you to call up an appointment calendar, telephone directory and other on-screen aids without having to switch out of the main program, say word processing, that you happened to be using at the time. **********Valet vanished, ahead of its time, but now programs reminiscent of it are all the rage - so much so that 1985 is apt to go down in microcomputer history as the year of desk management software. **********Sidekick, from Borland International, started the trend last year, and at $49.95 it is still a bargain, even though one of its constituents, the ASCII (for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and pronounced as-kee) table, is something only a programmer would ever want. Popular though Sidekick remains, it no longer has the marketplace to itself. New and different features are being introduced by new and different manufacturers - although at a price. **********Three current contenders for the position of electronic desk manager are Spotlight ($149.95 from Software Arts, Wellesley, Mass. 02181, telephone (617) 431-6600); Pop-Up DeskSet Plus ($149.95 from Bellsoft, Bellevue, Wash. 98004, telephone (206) 828- 7282), and The Desk Organizer ($195 from Warner Software, New York City, 10103, telephone (212) 484-3070). All are designed for the IBM PC and its compatibles. **********The three programs are similar in intent, providing in common such electronic accouterments as a notepad, calculator and calendar. But their performance and individual appeal differ radically. My own inclination, for instance, is to avoid software that cannot be completely stored on hard disk, particularly if its competitors can. Not only is a program running off a hard disk much faster than the same program being read from a floppy, but when one has spent some time with personal computers, one finds as well that life has somehow become filled with disks. Anything that reduces the sheer number of floppies and the constant switching they require is a relief. Additionally, for individuals using a portable such as the Compaq Plus, on which I tested these programs, storage on hard disk means one less floppy to lug around - and misplace. **********Spotlight, because of its particular copy protection scheme, requires the use of a floppy disk even if you have a hard-disk system. It is also the most limited of the three desk managers. For instance, its ''Phone Book'' is simply a collection of the names and telephone numbers you have entered, that has been automatically alphabetized by the computer. The Desk Organizer, by contrast, will actually dial telephone numbers for you. In fact, it will even search through your notes or computer- resident documents for a given number and then dial it for you. Pop-Up DeskSet Plus goes a step further. It sends and receives computer data for you, assuming your machine is equipped with a modem. **********Because these electronic desk organizers run concurrently with other, larger applications programs, the way in which each of them presents its various task options is bound to affect your computing style. Take the notepad function, for example, which allows you to jot down brief memos to yourself and then, if you wish, transfer those notes to other programs. The Desk Organizer's pad takes up the whole screen. Spotlight's and Pop-Up DeskSet's notepads, on the other hand, occupy only a third of the screen, so you can still see a good deal of the main display. Speaking strictly for myself, seeing two-thirds of every line is not much better than seeing none at all, so I find myself switching back and forth from notepad to main application incessantly (two separate screens would be another story). Then again, other people may find two-thirds of a display quite adequate. **********The Pop-Up DeskSet calculator centers on a simple window showing each number as you enter it. A screen-image tape mimicking the real one of a standard calculator rises from this window, keeping a running record of your calculations. Although the program is limited to the four basic functions plus percentages, not only can you transfer the results of your calculations - up to 15 digits' worth - to another program such as a spreadsheet, but you can obtain a physical printout of the ''tape'' for a paper trail as well. Of course, the ''tape'' is the width of standard-size computer paper and cuts a rather wide swath in the accounting department. **********Spotlight's calculator is more elaborate, being a visual representation of a calculator keyboard. Each on-screen key is highlighted as you strike the computer keyboard. While the numeric display, 12 digits, is shorter than that of the Pop-Up DeskSet, the available functions are more numerous, including the use of constants and a calculator memory, in addition to the basic arithmetic and percent functions. **********The Desk Organizer's calculator is the most sophisticated of all. A particularly nice feature is its ability to read and utilize formulas written on the notepad. The functions made available for this purpose are both algebraic and trigonometric, including square root, exponent, logarithm, sine, cosine and tangent. **********Another feature found in the more encompassing Desk Organizer program is one called ''Stamps'' - a function that I suspect will become standard in all future ''Machine Friday'' software. ''Stamps'' allows you to create electronic versions of the old rubber stamp. Their messages can then be imprinted on any document that you might be working on. For instance, you could make stamps of commonly used addresses, salutations and even boilerplate paragraphs to be inserted with a few keystrokes wherever desired in the output of other programs. **********The myriad details and variants of the features of these programs are too numerous to cover here. Which package would be best for you depends on your needs and how easily and well a particular program provides problem-free answers to those needs. **********When it comes to overall ease of use and efficiency, Bellsoft's DeskSet Plus is probably the winner, though there are some oversights in the manual, such as when you are told to enter ''popdos'' to load the program allowing you to utilize DOS commands while simultaneously working with an applications program. Doing so will get you nowhere. As I discovered, poking around in the program, you need to enter either ''popdos 1'' or ''popdos 2,'' depending on which version of DOS your computer is using. **********The Desk Organizer is plagued by even more inconsistencies, between the instructions and reality. It also seems the most error prone of the programs, and I managed to induce it to lock up the computer several times by striking the wrong keys. **********A final caveat about electronic desk programs in general: They can be dangerous to your data. Since they run alongside other applications programs, they have to be able to get along with them. They will do so in most cases. But put two incompatible programs together in memory, and the result will parallel that of letting a cat loose in the canary cage. Something is bound to be swallowed - as you will discover only once the feathers start flying."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/11/business/city-stores-post-a-slim-sales-rise.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1985-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 359, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CITY STORES POST A SLIM SALES RISE", "print_headline": "CITY STORES POST A SLIM SALES RISE", "body_text": " **********Sales in May at New York's City's largest department stores rose by an average of 1.1 percent from the period a year ago, continuing the disappointing trend that has been evident for almost a year, a monthly spot-check found last week. **********Sales in the metropolitan area were up 1.2 percent, according to the spot-check. The gains in both the city and the area represent a year-to-year decline in real terms, when inflation is taken into account. **********''It was a very weak month,'' summarized one retail executive. Another observed, ''Dresses and jewelry were strong but everything else was weak.'' **********Retailers attributed the slow sales to a variety of reasons: concern about the President's tax revision proposals; warm, sunny weather over the important Memorial Day weekend, which sent consumers to parks and beaches and kept them out of stores, and a continuing interest in increasing savings. **********Promotions Unsuccessful **********Retailers conceded they were dismayed about the lingering slow period here. Even heavy price promotions, they said, were not pushing sales to what would be considered normal increases at this time of year. ''We had great expectations for our promotions in May but we didn't do as well as we hoped,'' one executive said. **********Five of the seven retail companies participating in the spot-check had either statistical sales declines or declines in real terms, taking into account an inflation factor of approximately 1 percent in department store merchandise. **********The same situation was true in the metropolitan area for four of the seven retailers. But two companies recorded relatively good increases in the city in May, with gains of 7.1 percent and 5.4 percent from May 1984.

Baker 3d insisted that no domestic issue was more important to President Reagan than enactment of a fairer, simpler tax code.  That reinforced the view, increasingly accepted here, that the President's commitment to a tax simplification program of some kind should not be taken lightly and that the prospects of such legislation are therefore much brighter than they appeared to be a few weeks ago. **********Mr. Reagan's commitment, his advisers say, grows out of a belief that tax simplification would be both good policy and good politics. **********Shortly after the Treasury Department's sweeping tax proposal was presented two months ago, a consensus developed among Republican and Democratic politicians as well as among tax theorists and business lobbyists that the plan could become law only if the President were prepared to use all his political skills on its behalf. **********Too Smart, They Were Saying **********When weeks went by without an enthusiastic response from the White House, skeptics started saying the President was much too smart a politician to risk taking on the myriad interest groups who have a stake in the present tax system. **********Gradually, however, things have begun to change. First, there was the word from the White House that Mr. Reagan would devote a large part of his State of the Union Message to the question of taxes. Then, there was the President's own endorsement, in his news conference last week and again in his Inaugural Address on Monday, of the principles of the Treasury's plan, if not the specifics. **********Then, today, when Mr. Baker listed in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing the economic ''challenges'' facing the Government, he mentioned taxes first - before deficit reduction, before fighting inflation, before international economic policy. **********''The goal is a very, very worthy one, and the President feels that very, very strongly,'' Mr. Baker said. **********'Sufficiently High Priority' **********Toward the end of his testimony, after he had been challenged by the Senators on nearly every aspect of the Treasury's proposal, Mr. Baker was asked whether it might not be wise to put off the whole tax matter until next year. ''The President,'' Mr. Baker responded, ''thinks this is of sufficiently high priority that he wants to do it this year.'' **********Why, given the resolute opposition of so many business leaders who have been his political friends, is the President willing to take such a stand? There is nothing Mr. Reagan would like better, one of his advisers said this week, than to get into a battle ''where he and the people are on one side of the issue and the special interests are on the other.'' **********Indeed, there seems to be a general feeling among the public, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, that the tax system is unfair. Almost half of all Americans, the poll shows, believe that they have to pay more than their fair share of taxes, and more than two-thirds believe that people better off than they are pay too little in taxes. Altogether, only 6 percent believe that people at all income levels pay a fair share. **********Elimination of Deductions **********A relatively small number of those questioned appeared to have a clear sense of the Treasury's proposal. By a 2-to-1 margin, however, they said it would be a good idea if ''income tax rates were lowered and most deductions were eliminated.'' That is the principle behind the Treasury's plan. **********Furthermore, while the vast majority of Americans would like to keep tax deductions for state and local tax payments and for charitable contributions, a large portion seemed willing to disallow tax write-offs for such items as business lunches, capital gains and interest on loans for vacation homes, credit card purchases and automobiles. **********The telephone poll of 1,534 adults was conducted Jan. 14 through Jan. 17. There is a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percent. **********However strong President Reagan's commitment to changes in the tax law, the questioning of Mr. Baker by the Senators today underscored the obstacles in the road ahead. Nearly every member of the Finance Committee took issue with one aspect or another of the Treasury's proposal. **********Questioning by Senators **********Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate's new Republican leader, and John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, wondered, in Mr. Chafee's words, whether the tax initiative would ''divert energy'' from efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit. The new committee chairman, Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, questioned the advisability of taxing fringe benefits as income. **********Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, expressed opposition to the proposal to disallow deductions for state and local tax payments. David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, wanted continued tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. Spark M. Matsunaga, Democrat of Hawaii, said it was essential to retain tax incentives for development of alternative sources of energy. **********John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said the plan would ''wreak havoc'' with charitable contributions. Several Senators, including Steven D. Symms, Republican of Idaho, and William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, declared that the plan would retard savings and investment and hamper capital formation. **********'Simply a Starting Point' **********Without dealing in specifics, Mr. Baker said over and over that the Treasury's plan was ''simply a starting point'' and that many of the issues raised by the Senators deserved ''a further look.'' **********But he did not concede a single point. And on the question of capital formation, which has received more lobbying attention than any other matter, Mr. Baker stood fast. He argued that the reduction in tax rates would offset other parts of the package that might not be conducive to investment. **********In some ways, the hearing today was reminiscent of those four years ago, at the beginning of the Reagan Presidency. Then, many of the same Senators were skeptical of the Administration's commitment to large, across-the-board tax reductions and deep cuts in popular social programs. Many did not think then that he had the political wherewithal to pull it off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/03/business/3-more-markets-for-sears-card.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 More Markets For Sears Card", "print_headline": "3 More Markets For Sears Card", "body_text": " **********The credit card subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company announced that it would introduce its Discover credit card in the Denver, Milwaukee and Albany-Schenectady-Troy areas on Dec. 29. **********The card has already been introduced in Atlanta and San Diego.

Revenues from licensing and other commercial ventures tied to Sesame Street's popular cast of characters covered almost 70 percent of C.T.W.'s expenses last year - and would have covered even more if some clumsy business moves had not stymied the money-making drive. **********C.T.W. is hardly alone in trying to generate new revenue through its own devices. Faced with Reagan Administration budget cuts and a change in the tax treatment of charitable donations, the nation's nonprofits are making an unprecedented foray into the often-shunned and unfamiliar world of commerce. Long known for doing good rather than doing business, the nonprofits are moving far beyond the Girl Scout cookies and glossy calendars that have been fixtures in the marketplace for years. **********The Bank Street College of Education in New York now sells what one distributor calls the best-selling piece of software in American schools. The Red Cross started selling first-aid kits through its chapters earlier this month. The New York area public television station, WNET, has moved a step closer to accepting advertising. And Planned Parenthood, too, tried to market condoms until its affiliates quashed the idea. **********''This is a new era for nonprofits,'' says Sandra Grymes, director of marketing for the Planned Par-William Meyers is a New York financial writer. enthood Federation of America. ''They can't depend on public funds to survive; they've got to turn to their own resources.'' Added Ben Shute, corporate secretary of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund: ''There are strong pressures on nonprofit organizations. They can't afford to let their assets underperform anymore.'' **********Indeed, with mixed feelings - and results - nonprofits are in hot pursuit of funds. The Federal Government cut aid to these organization by 20 percent between 1981 and 1984 - $12.5 billion in all - and private contributions from individuals, foundations and corporations came nowhere near making up the shortfall. Now there is an added threat from Washington. Tax-reformers are debating whether to reduce, for some taxpayers, the incentives for charitable giving - and that could further cut into nonprofits' revenues. **********''We would prefer to be a purely educational institution,'' says Joan Ganz Cooney, the co-founder and president of the Children's Television Workshop, ''but that's a way to die.'' Added John Jay Iselin, WNET's president: ''We've got to move into the new frontier of enterprise or risk losing ground.'' **********But there are risks of another sort as nonprofits try to become capitalists with a conscience. One danger is that the organizations may alienate contributors and lose donations by appearing too successful in their commercial ventures. Serious questions also have been raised of legality, propriety and ability. Small business owners and the Small Business Administration have argued that nonprofits have an unfair competitive advantage because their tax-exempt status, coupled with other benefits such as lower postal rates, often reduces their costs and thus enables them to offer products at lower prices than their profit-making rivals. **********Critics within the nonprofit community see the problem in a different light. Many are idealists who still recoil from the idea of any involvement with business - although they are reluctant to voice their dissent publicly in this new environment. They say that nonprofits, in entering the marketplace, risk blemishing their pristine image, which has long been important in winning contributions. **********What's worse, the management skills of nonprofit administrators have been questioned. ''nonprofit organizations are less skilled in enterprise than in delivering social service,'' said Edward Skloot, president of New Ventures, a New York based consulting firm specializing in helping nonprofits earn income. **********The end result, consultants fear, is that business mistakes made by nonprofits could affect an organization's very ability to fulfill its service-oriented or charitable mission. And others fear that nonprofits that rush too brashly into profit-making could lose sight of their original mission. **********''The stakes are great here,'' says Lester M. Salamon, director of the Center for Governance and Management Research at the Urban Institute, a public policy research group in Washington. ''If the nonprofit sector continues to lose government support and is forced to begin focusing on different types of money-making ventures rather than on its mission, its basic character could change. Its ability to deliver services over the long term could decline.'' ONLY about 10 percent of nonprofits are now engaged in commercial enterprises, according to the Urban Institute. But that list includes some of the most prestigious names in American cultural and educational life, like American Museum of Natural History, the Audubon Society and the San Diego Zoo. To be sure, that number has been held down because of the large percentage of nonprofits performing such social service functions as caring for the elderly or teaching the handicapped, groups that for the most part have nothing to sell. But the number of nonprofits entering the marketplace is expected to rise in coming years especially if Washington continues holding down social service budgets to reduce the deficit, which is likely. **********Although the business activities of nonprofits are limited by the Internal Revenue Service, consultants say, these organizations may well make a significant commercial impact because of their sheer size: According to the Urban Institute, there are an estimated 125,000 nonprofits in this country operating for the ''public benefit,'' excluding religious congregations, foundations and trade and professional organizations. The nonprofits employ 6.5 million workers, the Labor Department estimates, who account for one of every five service workers in the country. **********Already, many nonprofits say that, for better or worse, they must cash in on everything they've got - from the air rights above their buildings to a host of products connected with their overall mission. Some are even finding ways to capitalize on their ability to attract well-heeled patrons. **********At the Metropolitan Opera's opening night festivities last September, for example, Luciano Pavarotti performed Tosca. But then, a select group of the bejeweled and black-tie audience stayed on at the opera house: They were guests at a dinner and fashion show that introduced Chanel's newest perfume, Coco. At the gala, 25 models emerged from a 12-foot-tall bottle of Coco and for the right to reach the wealthy operagoers, Chanel contributed $250,000 to the opera and financed the party. For the Met, too, the night was a success: According to the opera, Chanel's corporate largess helped it raise $1.2 million in a matter of hours. **********If the entry of commerce into the long-sacrosanct halls of the arts has led to some criticism from purists, the opera's general manager says he sees it more realistically: In this new environment for nonprofits, he believes the needs of corporate sponsors must be taken into account. **********''There certainly is a limit here, a question of how much of this is a good thing,'' said Bruce Crawford, whose financial savvy has helped the Met reduce its deficit by about $6 million over the last two years. ''But you have to be prepared to deliver to corporations. If they give you $400,000 or $500,000, they don't expect you to take the money and run. You've got to provide something that's beneficial to them in a marketing sense.'' **********And a growing number of nonprofit administrators around the country seem to understand that they must sharpen their business skills during these trying times. and many are returning to school to study such business subjects as marketing, management and finance. **********IF you mentioned marketing to nonprofit people 10 years ago, they thought you were crass,'' said Alan Merten, associate dean of the University of Michigan's business school. ''Now they realize this is something they have to have.'' **********The Children's Television Workshop, which has been so successful in licensing its Sesame Street products, acknowleges that miscalculation and mismanagement recently caused it to stumble in the high-tech area. C.T.W., believing that the computer revolution would take off and sustain a line of educational Sesame Street software for children, assembled an in-house staff of some 50 program developers three years ago and also introduced a children's computer magazine. **********The project sailed smack into a collapsing market for personal computers, however, and C.T.W. lost close to $10 million from its ill-fated software activities between 1982 and 1985 , its management said. C.T.W. dismissed the executive responsible for this fiasco, and laid off virtually its entire software staff while merging the computer magazine into an existing one. Before this setback, C.T.W. had developed a host of electronic Sesame Street games and activities and some 33 of them are now on the market, distributed by Apple, Atari, CBS and Tandy. But today they bring in only 2 percent of C.T.W.'s revenues, far less than the organization had envisioned. **********C.T.W. executives say they have learned painful lessons from this ill-conceived experience. They have since embarked on a new - and more cautious - business strategy. **********''W **********E engaged in much too rapid a buildup of staff and commitment before we had enough evidence on the sales and revenue side,'' says David V. B. Britt, C.T.W.'s executive vice president, reflecting on his organization's software experiment. ''We still have to look for revenue-generating activities if we want to sustain Sesame Street and other programs. But we are not going to be making major financial bets anymore. We are pulling back in and simplifying and streamlining our lines of business. We don't have the legs or financial staying power needed to see every investment through.'' **********Of course, C.T.W. is continuing its successful licensing arrangements for Sesame Street products. It licenses some 1,600 items, ranging from a Big Bird battery-operated toothbrush to a Cookie Monster bulldozer, to 30 companies, including J.C. Penney and Hasbro. In all, revenues from all commercial endeavors came to $37.4 million last year, up from $29.8 million three years earlier. **********In sharp contrast to C.T.W., the Bank Street College of Education in New York has thrived in software. It held back and refused to commit major resources until it knew whether it had a viable business. In 1981, with a $70,000 foundation grant, it developed a word processing program designed to help children improve writing skills. Joining forces with a curriculum research organization in 1982 and keeping about 60 percent of royalties, Bank Street contributed $45,000 in cash and $35,000 in staff time to the project. When the software was perfected in 1983, Bank Street licensed it to Scholastic Inc. for sale to schools and to Broderbund for home sales. **********Today, according to Alan Gleicher, president of Soft-Kat Inc., a Los Angeles software distributor, the Bank Street Writer is the best-selling piece of software in American schools, with nearly 400,000 copies in circulation. Priced between $70 and $105, it generated close to $600,000 in royalty income during Bank Street's latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, the organization said. **********To be sure, there are risks for nonprofits as they assume their new money-making role - and one of the most serious involves their tax status. The Federal tax code exempts nonprofits from paying taxes on revenues derived from activities that are substantially related to their organization's primary purpose. Museums, for example, are permitted to reap tax-free profits from the sale of exhibition catalogs and posters. **********But tax lawyers, consultants and nonprofit administrators say that the code's definition is still open to interpretation. **********''It is a grey area because there is no strict permissibility ruling. It's not carved in stone what you can and can't do,'' said Mr. Skloot of New Ventures. ''But it's not opaque because nonprofit people generally know that the more overtly commercial they become, the more attractive a target they are for the I.R.S. and for private-sector competitors.'' **********The I.R.S. has ruled, for example. that the Red Cross does not have to pay taxes on profits generated from its $24.95 first-aid kits. But when Mark Ambrose, the organization's project director for special products, was asked why the Red Cross did not sell its kits in drug stores, he said that one reason was that such an arrangement could raise a question of tax liability because the outlets were so clearly commercial. ANOTHER risk that nonprofits are coming to terms with is a backlash against their commercial endeavors. One of the most bitter disputes is being played out in Manhattan over the issue of the organizations selling the air rights over their buildings. The controversy erupted in 1979, when the Museum of Modern Art allowed a developer to build a condominium tower over its structure on West 53d Street. Although this helped finance a $60 million expansion that doubled the museum's exhibition space, urban reformers opposed the transaction, concerned about the building's size and its effects on urban density. The dispute has continued in recent years. Civic activists are now fighting St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue and the Walden School on Central Park West over the same issue. **********Another aspect of that backlash has emerged in recent years from the Small Business Administration. The S.B.A. wants the code that governs nonprofits' tax status to be strengthened to give them less leeway, but so far the idea has not gathered much steam in Washington. **********''When they move into purely commercial activities, nonprofits have a tremendous market advantage,'' said Jeffrey Giancola, assistant chief counsel in the S.B.A.'s office of advocacy. ''It is time to reappraise the nonprofits' special tax treatment.'' **********The pace of nonprofit commercial activity has increased in recent years, according to consultants, but it has been going on for decades. The Girl Scouts have been selling cookies since 1934, the Sierra Club has been marketing calendars for two decades and the National Audubon Society has allowed companies to drill for oil and gas at its wildlife sanctuary on Louisiana's Gulf Coast for years. **********One of the first nonprofits to turn to commercial sales was the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which began offering photographs of its collection to the public in the 1870's. In 1908, it established a sales shop and by 1949, was making $100,000 a year from publications and reproductions. Today, the museum sells 15,000 items - from an Egyptian bas relief at $18.50 to a bronze copy of a first-century Greek horse at $1,500 - grossing over $37 million annually from its booming retail and mail order operations, which grew about 16 percent last year. **********Because nonprofits have for so long depended on goodwill to help finance their projects - and on relatively low-paid idealistic employees to do their work - image plays a critical role in how they structure their business strategy. At the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, for example, a well thought out and potentially lucrative plan to market condoms through drug stores was recently scrapped because many members of the organization feared such a venture would alienate constituents and tarnish its image. THE project was introduced on a shoestring budget of several hundred thousand dollars in the early 1980's and Planned Parenthood test-marketed the condoms at affiliates around the country for about two years. The results were encouraging, so the organization began meeting with packaged goods companies such as American Home Products and Warner Lambert to discuss licensing the condoms and selling them in drugstores. Marketers estimated that if Planned Parenthood entered the condom business, it could earn about $300,000 a year in royalties. There was even talk of a whole line of over-the-counter Planned Parenthood contraceptives. **********But local affiliates balked. ''The affiliates just weren't ready to license our name,'' says Miss Grymes of Planned Parenthood. ''In a for-profit company, the bottom line is how much you can make and how fast, not who wants to get involved. In a nonprofit, we've got to weigh a lot of other factors, like image and reputation, before we move on a project.'' **********Such concerns also are on the minds of executives at WNET in the New York area, which has recently decided to take what it calls ''general support announcements.'' Advertisers cannot directly promote their products in these spots; they can only show their goods while expressing support for either the station, a nonprofit organization or a social cause. Paul Sladkus, business manager of the metropolitan division at WNET, believes that, as a result, the ads will not compromise the station's image. **********''This isn't a wheel-and-deal atmosphere,'' he says. ''Nobody is hawking anything. It's not sell, sell, sell. It's support, support, support.'' **********VISITING NURSESIN BUSINESS **********Many nonprofits have turned to commercial ventures to help finance their philanthropic mission, but the Visiting Nurse Service of New York took its business strategy a step further. The organization, which has provided in-home medical help to New York City's aged and underprivileged for almost a century, two years ago realized that many middle-income patients - particularly those not covered by Medicare or Medicaid - were not taking advantage of its services. So it formed a profit-making unit, Partners in Care Inc., to cater to them. **********And Elsie Griffith, Visiting Nurse's chief executive, said Partners in Care can even provide care at a lower cost than Visiting Nurse's nonprofit unit. It can do so, she said, because it is not required to churn out reams of paperwork and other documentation that the Visiting Nurse Service's government-subsidized nonprofit unit must. As a result, she said, the cost for an in-house homemaker-aide runs about $10.25 an hour under the Government's Medicare plan, but only $6.80 when provided by Partners in Care. **********Partners in Care brought in about $11 million in 1985, or 10 percent of Visiting Nurse's total revenues. In 1986, the new subsidiary expects to make its first profit, which Mrs. Griffith estimates will total $150,000. This money will be used to enhance the organization's nonprofit activities. **********Because of its for-profit venture, Visiting Nurse is considered by foundations and consultants to be one of the country's most innovative nonprofits. And it plans to keep up that reputation. Mrs. Griffith said that the profit-making division will soon link up as an equal partner in a joint venture with a major hospital-equipment supplier.

The setback came after their Lebanese Shiite captors added a new demand, insisting that the United States guarantee that it would not retaliate militarily after the hostages were released. **********The Shiites' principal demand has been the release by Israel of 735 detainees, most of them Shiites. The new condition apparently grew out of the Shiites' reaction to a speech by President Reagan in Illinois on Friday, which they interpreted as a threat to take military action after the Americans were freed. **********Signs of a Shiite Rift **********At the same time, there were signs today that the Shiite movement Amal, whose leader has been acting as spokesman for the original hostage-takers, was at odds with the more militant Party of God over whether to release four of the Americans. **********Under the plan that was to have been set in motion today, the hostages, all from a Trans World Airlines jet commandeered over Europe, were to have been driven this morning from Beirut to the Syrian capital of Damascus. They were to rest there and hold a news conference, and then to fly to Frankfurt and freedom. A Syrian spokesman had announced that the crisis was ending happily because of the efforts of President Hafez al-Assad, and Vice President Bush had planned to fly to West Germany to meet the hostages. **********Instead, 35 of the hostages spent the day at a school near the edge of the Beirut airport, ringed by Shiite militiamen in trucks mounted with heavy machine guns. The hostages appeared increasingly depressed as the prospect of a speedy release ebbed. **********'We Are Awaiting Guarantees' **********''We are still awaiting guarantees that no retaliatory military strikes will be undertaken after the hostages are released,'' the Amal leader, Nabih Berri, told reporters at his home this evening. **********''If these guarantees are provided tonight,'' he said, ''they will be released tonight. If not, we are not in a hurry. Tomorrow, the next day, who knows?'' Mr. Berri made no mention of the seven other Americans reported abducted or missing in Lebanon over the last 15 months. On Thursday the United States demanded that they be freed at the same time as the airline hostages. Mr. Berri has said he has no control over those believed to be holding them. #4 Are a 'Political Problem' **********Amal officials said the four airline hostages who were not at the school today were still in the custody of the Party of God. Ali Hamdan, an Amal spokesman at the school, said they represented a ''political problem.'' He did not elaborate. **********The four are thought to have been separated because the hijackers believed they were military or diplomatic personnel or because they had Jewish-sounding names. **********They were identified as Robert G. Brown of Stow, Mass.; Jeffrey J. Ingalls of Virginia; Robert Trautmann Jr. of Laredo, Tex., and Richard P. Herzberg of Norfolk, Va. **********The problem involving the four hostages became apparent after the other hostages took a roll-call in the schoolyard and discovered them missing. Mr. Berri had pledged that if an arrangement were worked out, all 39 would be freed. **********Tonight, witnesses said the three T.W.A. crew members had been returned from the school to their plane at the Beirut airport, and Amal sources said the other 32 had been taken back to their hiding places, United Press International reported. **********Objections by Militants **********The principal reason that the hostages were not freed today, sources close to the situation said, was that the Party of God raised objections to the plan. Two Shiite gunmen, believed to be Party of God members, hijacked the T.W.A. plane June 14 as it flew from Athens to Rome. **********The no-retaliation issue became a major demand because of overnight reports of the remarks by President Reagan, which were given wide circulation in the Arabic press and radio broadcasts here. In his speech, the President referred to the hijackers as ''thugs, murderers and barbarians'' and said that ''terrorists and those who support them must, and will, be held to account.'' **********A senior White House official said Mr. Reagan had intended the remark as a general denunciation of terrorism. But the Shiites cited it as confirmation that he had not ruled out military retaliation. **********As for the detainees being held by Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres said today in Jerusalem that the release of the 39 Americans would clear the way for Israel to free them on its own schedule. The detainees, who were rounded up as terrorist suspects in southern Lebanon, have never been formally charged. Some have been in custody nearly two years. **********From the time Mr. Berri assumed the role of mediator between the hijackers and the United States more than two weeks ago, most of the captives have been in the custody of his Amal militia. The plane itself is under the control of the hijackers and their associates, along with Amal ''observers,'' according to Ghassan Siblani, the Amal security chief. **********The apparent impasse over the hostage transfer put Mr. Berri in a difficult position - and, given the ground rules of Lebanese politics, a potentially dangerous one. **********On the one hand, he could be seen as having placed himself in peril by embarrassing the President Assad, who had been deeply involved in the plan to free the hostages. **********On the other hand, Mr. Berri could face a serious challenge from more militant Shiite factions in Lebanon. **********News Conference Canceled **********Mr. Berri scheduled a news conference at noon today to announce the departure of the hostages for Damascus. The news conference was postponed to 3 P.M., then 5 P.M., and was finally canceled. **********The original plan had called for the departure early this morning of the hostages from Beirut in a convoy of buses and cars to Damascus. **********There, 40 rooms were reported to have been reserved at the Damascus Sheraton Hotel for what was seen as a three-hour stay, and a news conference was scheduled there for 1 P.M. **********The United States Ambassador to Syria, William L. Eagleton Jr., drove twice to the Lebanese border to greet the convoy - at noon and at 4 P.M. But the caravan did not materialize. **********On Friday night, most of the hostages had been given a lavish farewell banquet by their captors at a seaside Hotel in southern Beirut. **********The hostages were brought this morning to the Tahweiti Shiite school in the shantytown suburb of Burj al Brajneh. The schoolyard was surrounded by militiamen in an armored personnel carrier, one truck mounted with multiple tubes of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets, three heavy antiaircraft machine guns mounted on pickup trucks and an M-48 tank. **********As the day dragged on, the hostages - seen in the United States on videotapes made by the Cable News Network, acting as a pool for the rest of the foreign press here - appeared increasingly disconsolate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/business/reagan-reported-to-back-a-version-of-tax-overhaul.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1985-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN REPORTED TO BACK A VERSION OF TAX OVERHAUL", "print_headline": "REAGAN REPORTED TO BACK A VERSION OF TAX OVERHAUL", "body_text": " **********Administration officials said today that President Reagan would endorse a modified version of the Treasury's plan to overhaul the nation's tax system. **********They said the proposal would serve as a cornerstone for Mr. Reagan's State of the Union Message Feb. 6. **********Officials said he would adopt the basic philosophy of the Treasury's plan: to cut tax rates for individuals and corporations and to abolish many tax preferences. Final decisions on modifications had not been made, the officials said, but consideration was being given to changing the plan in regard to the tax treatment of depreciation, dividends, interest, capital gains, personal exemptions and charitable contributions. (Page D1.) **********Meeting on Strategy **********''As more and more people look at the Treasury proposal, it continues to hold up very well,'' a key White House official said today, after ranking Presidential aides met with Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan on legislative strategy for the tax changes. **********The Treasury's package was initially received coolly by Mr. Reagan, who has been noncommital about what tax legislation he might submit to Congress this year. **********Mr. Reagan, meanwhile, appeared to put distance between himself and the deficit projections of his budget director, David A. Stockman. Mr. Stockman, who heads the Office of Management and Budget, said last week that because of revised economic forecasts the deficit in 1988 was likely to be about $140 billion, more than $40 billion above the President's target. **********Estimates Subject to Change **********But Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that those deficit estimates were subject to change once the final figures for economic growth in 1984 were compiled. The growth estimates, which will affect projections of tax revenue, are to be available within several weeks. **********''The latest deficit figures that you've seen from O.M.B. have not been presented to the White House,'' Mr. Speakes said, ''and may very well not be borne out in the estimates once the final figures of the third and fourth quarter growth are in.'' **********On Capitol Hill, Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, who is set to serve as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told his colleagues that he was ready to cut the military budget and asked for suggestions. **********Goldwater and the Military **********''I am not opposed to military cuts,'' Mr. Goldwater said in a brief speech on the Senate floor. He said that if there were any reductions he would move first to close military bases and that closing 10 of them around the country would, after the initial cost of closing, save around $1 billion a year. **********The comments by Mr. Goldwater came on a day of some confusion not only about the budget for the fiscal year 1986 that Mr. Reagan will send to Congress on Feb. 4, but also about the deficit projections evolving within the Administration. **********''There are so many imponderables and variables on the deficit,'' said one White House official. ''This thing is changing so quickly. The emphasis is on fiscal '86, not on '87 and '88. Fiscal '86 is what Congress is interested in.'' **********Meetings on the Tax Plan **********What dominated several key meetings at the White House today, though, were the Treasury's proposals, issued in November, that would affect the income taxes paid by nearly every person and every company in America. **********In the afternoon, Treasury Secretary Regan met with key White House officials, including James A. Baker 3d, the chief of staff; M. B. Oglesby Jr., assistant to the President for legislative affairs; Mr. Stockman, and Richard G. Darman, a Presidential assistant. **********''There are two main items on the agenda - spending cuts and tax simplification,'' an Administration official said after the meeting. He said overhauling the tax system would serve as ''a cornerstone,'' and ''a major element'' of Mr. Reagan's State of the Union Message, which is now being prepared. **********Establishing an Agenda **********''What we're trying to do is establish the agenda for the year, and this is a major item on the agenda for the coming year,'' the official said. **********White House officials have said privately in recent weeks that the Administration's strategy in Congress was to press for relatively rapid enactment of the budget and then to focus on the tax overhaul. **********After a meeting on the budget this morning between senior White House officials and the House Republican leadership, one of the participants, Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, said agreement was reached that ''more consideration will be given to how tax reform fits into overall budget considerations.'' **********Encouragment of Growth **********Mr. Lott, who has served as minority whip since 1980, said: ''When you look at the budget you can't just look at cuts in spending. You have to look at how to encourage growth and what tax reform can do.'' **********''If you get a growing economy as a result of the tax code, you get more revenue coming in,'' Mr. Lott said. ''If we can find ways to do it, it'll be very positive.'' **********Mr. Lott voiced some reservations about the Treasury's tax plan today, and Administration officials as well as others on Capitol Hill have said that some changes are under consideration. These include retaining some of the rapid depreciation features of the 1981 tax law, called the Accelerated Cost Recovery System. **********Also under consideration is eliminating a proposal to allow companies to deduct half the dividends they pay to shareholders. **********Shifts on Capital Gains **********White House aides are also discussing altering the Treasury's proposal to treat all capital gains as ordinary income to the extent the gains exceeded the rate of inflation. The revision permits at least some capital gains to be excluded from taxable income. **********White House aides and others are also considering omitting the Treasury's proposal to adjust for inflation both the deduction of interest payments and the tax on interest income. **********Also under White House consideration are changing the Treasury proposal that charitable contributions be deductible only after they exceeded 2 percent of gross income. **********Senators Plan to Act **********In the Senate, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, prepared today to lead his colleagues in writing their own version of the 1986 budget. The aim was to include enough spending reductions to trim the deficits to about $168 billion in 1986 and to about $100 billion in 1988. **********White House officials denied that the move by Mr. Dole, which was agreed to in a meeting of Republican senators Friday, could effectively take the lead on budget and fiscal policy away from the Administration. **********''The move by Dole is not to map his own plan,'' said one White House official. ''We've been working with them for weeks. What they're talking about is developing the actual legislation that would be needed to implement a spending cut program. From our standpoint, that's all very positive and very good.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/28/business/gaf-plan-on-carbide-note-issue.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1985-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 805, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAF PLAN ON CARBIDE NOTE ISSUE", "print_headline": "GAF PLAN ON CARBIDE NOTE ISSUE", "body_text": " **********In an attempt to strip away part of the Union Carbide Corporation's antitakeover shield, the GAF Corporation disclosed yesterday that it would try to undo the restrictions that Carbide will attach to corporate obligations it will soon issue. **********In documents released yesterday, GAF said that in connection with an enriched $74-a-share offer it made earlier this week for Carbide, it was seeking voting control over the notes Carbide will issue. **********Those notes are to be given to shareholders who surrender their holdings to Carbide as part of Carbide's self-tender offer. Under that offer, Carbide would buy back 35 percent of its shares, offering for each share a package of $20 cash and notes with a face value of $65. **********Notes Carry Restrictions **********The notes, however, would impose limits on the amount of debt that Carbide can incur, on transactions between GAF and Carbide, on dividend payments and on the sale of Carbide assets. Thus they would make it difficult, if not impossible, for GAF to operate Carbide should it succeed in a takeover. **********In a novel twist, GAF earlier this week urged Carbide shareholders to tender their stock into the Carbide offer, saying that GAF would then, in effect, buy the package from the shareholders for $74 in cash. **********GAF said yesterday that by selling the package, the shareholders would be giving GAF the right to waive the restrictions attached to the notes. If GAF gets control of 80 percent of the notes it would be able to dissolve the restrictions. **********''This is a very clever tactic,'' said one investment banker who is not connected to the Carbide/GAF scrap. ''It's an interesting move. I don't know whether it's legal or not.'' **********Sources close to the situation say Carbide is likely to begin a court challenge of GAF's right to buy the packages from shareholders. **********While the behind-the-scenes maneuvering was complex, Wall Street professionals said that GAF's move to raise its offering price from the previous $68 a share had turned the situation into a simple decision for Carbide shareholders. Unlike in other such battles, shareholders will not have to decide which of two offers to back, and in fact, have been told by GAF to accept the Carbide offer. **********''You don't have to think,'' said the head of one Wall Street arbitrage department, who added that virtually all shareholders are likely to turn in their stock to Carbide. The arbitrager said GAF's offer to buy the Carbide package, formally called the purchase of proration pool rights, had ''taken away the worry about tendering into the wrong offer.'' **********Others agree. ''Assuming that the current situation still exists on Dec. 31, we would tender our shares to Union Carbide's self-tender,'' said Eric Rosenfeld, director of the arbitrage department at Oppenheimer & Company. **********Shareholders have until next Tuesday to tender stock to Carbide. The deadline for reselling the package to GAF is Jan. 9. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Carbide's stock fell 75 cents, to $72.625, and GAF shares rose $1.25, to $68.25. **********In other developments yesterday, the New York investor Ivan F. Boesky disclosed that he owns about 6.6 percent of Union Carbide stock, making him one of the company's largest shareholders. GAF owns about 10 percent of the company's shares. **********Mr. Boesky told the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had bought 4,459,200 common shares of Carbide and call options for 520,400 shares. He said the purchases had been for arbitrage purposes, and not an attempt to gain control of the company. **********Early this month, GAF, a maker of building materials and chemicals that is based in Wayne, N.J., disclosed its plans to take control of Carbide, which is based in Danbury, Conn. So far there has been no contact between GAF and Carbide, according to sources close to the situation. Samuel J. Heyman, chairman of GAF, has written to Union Carbide's chairman, Warren M. Anderson, requesting a meeting. **********Carbide said on Thursday that it would study GAF's new offer when details were received. The company had no further comment yesterday. **********Takeover specialists think Carbide might try to improve its own offer, perhaps by raising the price or increasing the number of shares it will buy back or eliminating the note portion of the package. **********One of the moves Carbide has made - its exclusion of GAF from its self-tender offer - is already being challenged in court. Yesterday, Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, head of Prudential-Bache's arbitrage department, said that GAF's latest action was another attempt to force itself into that Carbide offer.

Prigmore, 52, Sprint's president and chief operating officer, to take on the additional duties of chief executive. **********Mr. Pilz said he was leaving Sprint to pursue other business interests. In a telephone interview from Burlingame, Calif., where Sprint is based, Mr. Pilz said he was considering joining one of a number of high-technology companies starting up in the area. But he declined to provide any explanation of his departure. At GTE headquarters in Stamford, Conn., a spokesman said the company would have no comment. **********GTE analysts, however, said Mr. Pilz had resigned because he was being increasingly deprived of power. Last month, they noted, GTE brought in Mr. Prigmore to take control of Sprint's day-to-day operations. And only last week GTE announced a broad corporate reorganization that would have further eclipsed Mr. Pilz's authority. **********''It looks as if his powers may have been squeezed a bit,'' said Edward M. Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a Wall Street firm. **********GTE's tightening of control over Sprint reflects the fact that the long- distance unit has not been performing well recently. A shortage of transmission capacity early last year, for example, forced Sprint to turn away customers. Shortly afterward, Sprint's marketing vice president, Lee Franklin, resigned. Faced with increasing costs of connecting to local lines, Sprint lost an estimated $1.7 million in the third quarter on revenues of about $275 million. **********Before joining Sprint in 1980, Mr. Pilz spent much of his career as a finance executive in the steel industry, including a stint as president of the Kaiser Steel Corporation of Oakland, Calif. For some time, GTE has been rumored to want a Sprint chief executive with more telephone experience than Mr. Pilz had. **********''He didn't have the necessary background and training,'' said Robert B. Morris 3d, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc., a San Francisco brokerage house. **********Mr. Prigmore has years of experience in the telephone industry. Building communications networks is regarded as his forte. He joined GTE in 1958 and held numerous positions with its local phone companies before moving to GTE headquarters in 1969 as plant director. He then returned to the field, becoming president of GTE Southeast/Kentucky, a telephone company serving several Southeastern states, before moving to Sprint last December."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/23/business/big-florida-banks-in-merger-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1985-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BIG FLORIDA BANKS IN MERGER TALKS", "print_headline": "BIG FLORIDA BANKS IN MERGER TALKS", "body_text": " **********The Barnett Banks of Florida Inc. and the Southeast Banking Corporation said yesterday that they might merge.

Barnett Banks' stock was unchanged at $39.375. **********A merger of Jacksonville-based Barnett Banks and Miami-based Southeast Banking would create the largest bank in the Southeast and the 14th largest in the nation. It would have more than $23 billion in assets and would control roughly 30 percent of Florida's savings and checking accounts. **********Most important, analysts said, a merger would create a bank whose customer base would be so large and market value so high that it would be too big to be bought by a major money-center bank if interstate banking becomes legal. **********Concerned About Independence **********Banking experts say that the recent spate of other bank mergers in the Southeast - for example, the Sun Banks merger with the Trust Company of Georgia, and the Wachovia Corporation's combination with the First Atlanta Corporation - has been inspired partly by a desire of bankers to retain their independence. **********A merger of Barnett and Southeast would make a lot of sense, analysts said. They noted that they were strong in different parts of Florida. A combined company could also eliminate overlapping back offices and branches. Most important, analysts said, Barnett, which has been highly profitable in recent years, could impose its expense control on Southeast, which has performed poorly. **********''If the two banks are put together, it could be a powerful bank in a strong market,'' said Richard Stillinger, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. ''There would be a lot of room for operating efficiencies.'' **********'Considerable Distance' **********In a news release issued yesterday morning after word of its merger talks leaked out and traders began moving on the information, Southeast said: ''There is considerable distance between the parties on several critical issues. It is, therefore, impossible to predict at this time when, if at all, a mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached.'' **********Neither company would comment further, but analysts identified at least two stumbling blocks to a deal. The first is how Barnett, the likely buyer, could avoid seriously diluting its earnings in a merger, since it would probably issue shares to acquire Southeast. Second is the question of severance compensation for Southeast's managers, many of whom would likely lose their jobs in a consolidation. **********''In their past discussions about Southeast, Barnett management has said they would have to go in and do a lot of work,'' said Robert R. Gordon, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''That may imply layoffs and firings. They think it's a problem company.'' **********Florida in general, however, and the Southeast Banking's Miami base in particular are considered among the most attractive banking markets in the country.

Mr. Rifai had been handling Jordan's efforts to achieve a settlement. **********Mr. Rifai said then that he looked forward to closer understanding with the United States and contended, in reference to Palestinian guerrillas based in Jordan, that ''as long as Israeli aggression stands, armed struggle is legal'' against Israel. **********When Mr. Rifai was replaced as Prime Minister later that year, the shift was taken as an indication of the King's disillusionment with efforts to reach a Middle East settlement. **********When the King again named Mr. Rifai Prime Minister in 1970, it was as the head of what was called a ''Cabinet of reconciliation'' after confrontation between the Jordanian Army and Palestinians in Jordan. **********As Prime Minister in 1970, Mr. Rifai affirmed what he called the Government's feeling of brotherhood toward the Palestinian fighters.

The fast printers made shoddy copies. The letter-quality printers moved at a clankety- clank pace. And the laser printers that churned out as many as 120 letter-quality pages a minute carried price tags that hovered around a quarter of a million dollars. **********But now affordable laser printers are coming on the scene. Japan's Canon Corporation - of camera and copier fame - last year introduced a low-cost personal computer printer mechanism that uses a laser beam to print pages at the rate of eight a minute. The first model using this technology, Hewlett-Packard's LaserJet, hit store shelves last year and, at a retail price of $2,995, is selling fairly well. By the end of this year, at least 10 printers with the Canon mechanism will be available. **********Industry experts expect them to sell like hotcakes. ''There's a heck of a lot more personal computers out there than mainframes,'' says printer specialist David Glidewell of Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. Industry analyst Kenneth G. Bosomworth, president of Norwalk, Conn.-based International Resource Development, predicts that markets for laser printers selling for $1,000 to $20,000 should swell from $50 million today to $400 million to $500 million in five to eight years. **********Canon is unlikely to keep the field to itself. There will probably be competition from other Japanese companies such as Fujitsu, Matsushita and Sharp, as well as from General Optronics. And there are persistent reports that companies such as Xerox and I.B.M., which already have laser printers in the upper reaches of the low end, will introduce even cheaper models. ''If you think we're neglecting the low end, you are way off base,'' says Don Ramsey, a spokesman for Xerox. **********For now, though, Canon has a sizable jump on the competition. ''We are leading the market for the personal computer user by two years,'' claims Koichi Kadokura, product planning manager for the laser printer division of Canon, USA. **********Laser printers work by a process closely related to xerography. A rotating drum is charged positively and a blinking laser beam selectively neutralizes the charges. A negatively charged ink or toner is spread over the drum and develops an image by adhering only to the positively charged portion. The image is transferred to paper by pressure and heat. **********In the Canon mechanism, the drum, toning and charging systems are placed in a cartridge, which can be discarded and replaced if something goes wrong. The cartridge, together with the laser optics, constitute the printer's ''engine.'' Canon's customers - which include besides Hewlett-Packard such companies as Apple, Imagen, Corona and Quality Micro Systems - add the necessary electronics so that the unit can receive instructions from computers. **********Some of these models, which sell for up to $10,000, offer sophisticated graphics and easy conversion to a wide variety of typefaces. In general, says Mr. Glidewell, they provide ''a lot of power for a few bucks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/world/the-hostages-return-tv-in-the-hostage-crisis-reporter-or-participant.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Jones", "pub_date": "1985-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1006, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  TV IN THE HOSTAGE CRISIS: REPORTER OR PARTICIPANT/", "print_headline": "THE HOSTAGES' RETURN;   TV IN THE HOSTAGE CRISIS: REPORTER OR PARTICIPANT/", "body_text": " **********The role of television in the 17-day American hostage crisis promises to fuel debate that will be difficult to resolve. It is a matter that is troubling to many journalists because it appears to have set precedents for coverage of future such incidents. **********Almost throughout the crisis, television functioned not only as observer and reporter, the traditional journalistic capacity, but also at times as an actor in the unfolding events. **********In effect, the sophisticated technological mechanism that had been developed in the West to serve a free press entered into a symbiotic relationship with those holding the hostages. Thee captors were trading access to the principals in the drama for what they viewed as publicity, and interviews were conducted in the inhibiting presence of armed militiamen. **********Controlled Interviews **********In their role as a participant, the nation's networks broadcast statements and interviews with representatives of Amal, the Shiite Moslem militia that took responsibility for the hostages, and also transmitted interviews with the hostages that were carefully controlled by the captors. In some cases the material was broadcast without being edited at all. **********John Chancellor, senior commentator at NBC News, said, ''You have journalism, which is thoughtful and considered, and you have what I call 'electronics,' which is the use of our facilities to transmit pictures and words, but does not have a lot to do with journalism. **********''If by some miracle all the world's television networks had magically agreed not to cover the crisis as they did,'' he said, ''I suspect that one of the terrorists' demands would have been for a camera.'' **********The episode has served to point up the problem of being an aggressive provider of news, long considered a virtue among both print and broadcast journalists, without being exploited by the subject of the reporting. **********Question of Manipulation **********Print journalism, which by its nature requires editing, does not suit the purposes of terrorists nearly so well and, hence, is less vulnerable to being used by them as a vehicle for propaganda. But, during the crisis, newspapers frequently published transcripts of exchanges that had been broadcast on the networks because the exchanges themselves were the news. **********Journalists and others have raised questions regarding whether the television networks were manipulated by those holding the hostages. Statements by the captors were repeatedly broadcast, as were statements by hostages that seemed to cast the Shiite Moslem cause in a sympathetic light. **********Mr. Chancellor and others have said that the networks should have delayed broadcasting the material until it could be edited and accompanied by informed commentary that explained the context of what was being shown and the influences the hostages and reporters were under. **********Some Subjects Avoided **********Journalists in Beirut say there was great pressure not to inflame the situation by asking questions that might offend, for example by raising the issue of the murder of Robert Dean Stethem, a passenger who was an American Navy diver. The reporters, who were also interviewing people who were armed, realized that they themselves could have been seized by those holding the hostages. **********Whether statements by Nabih Berri and the hostages had much influence on American public opinion is still uncertain. Such coverage prompted a storm of public self-examination within the nation's news organizations, calling attention to the role that television in particular was playing and feeding what many think is a broad public sense that news coverage aided those holding the hostages. **********Some reporters and network executives speculated that the publicity given the situation may indeed have aided the hostages, in that it diminished the likelihood of harm coming to them. **********Intense Competition **********Adding to the controversy was an atmosphere of frenzied competition in Beirut among news organizations, and especially among television networks. **********All the networks committed enormous resources to the coverage, with dozens of reporters, platoons of drivers and translators, chartered airplanes to fly videotape to the nearest available transmission point, and intense pressure from network headquarters to produce something exclusive. **********The intense competition was given a sinister twist because of the atmosphere of lawlessness, anarchy and danger in Beirut, which contributed to what one reporter described as a ''jungle mentality where anything goes.'' **********Rumors have circulated widely among the journalists in Beirut of news organizations paying those holding the hostages for interviews and favored treatment, such as opportunities for exclusive access, although all of the networks deny paying for news. **********In addition, there has been a scramble for access to the families of the hostages that has prompted criticism from some journalists. ''There is no doubt in my mind that there was some 'Don't tell me what you're going to do with it, just do it' money being spent this week,'' said Fred Friendly, Edward R. Murrow Professor Emeritus at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. **********'Not One Penny' **********When a going-away dinner was given for the hostages in the Beirut hotel where ABC had its headquarters, other journalists charged that ABC had contributed money toward the dinner. Joanna Bistany, an ABC spokesman, characterized the charge as ''beyond the pale.'' **********''We have not paid one penny toward paying any interviews,'' Miss Bistany said, and added that the charges were ''an attempt to demean what was simply good, aggressive journalism.'' **********So intense was the pressure to be competitive on any news involving the hostages that, when other journalists learned that the dinner was under way, some of them risked their lives to travel across Beirut late at night amid roaming bands of heavily armed rival Lebanese who were exchanging fire with each other in a city where Americans have been singled out as targets. **********Yesterday, CBS and ABC criticized NBC for flying four families of hostages to West Germany and paying for their hotel accommodations in exchange for an interview. NBC responded by saying that it had beaten the other networks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/17/business/briefs-084581.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues *********** Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's thrift institutions, announced an interest rate of 8.30 percent for its $1.04 billion of bonds due Oct. 27, 1986, and a 9.55 percent rate for $655 million of bonds due Oct. 25, 1988.

They then beat the priest's driver, Khaled Krounfol, a Moslem, and locked him into the trunk of the priest's car. **********Then they raced off in the getaway car, firing wildly into the air to clear the way, witnesses said. **********Three other Americans are known to have been kidnapped, each, like Father Jenco, as he was headed for work in the morning, and all are believed still being held. They are Jeremy Levin, the Middle East bureau chief of the Cable News Network, who disappeared on March 7, 1984; William Buckley, a political officer of the American Embassy, who was taken on March 16, and the Rev. Benjamin Weir, an elderly Presbyterian minister, who was seized on May 8. **********Also, Peter Kilburn, 60, a librarian at the American University of Beirut, who is in poor health, has not been seen since Dec. 3 and is feared kidnapped. Friends say his cane and medicines were left in his apartment. **********No Claims of Responsibility **********No group has taken responsibility for kidnapping the Americans. However, they are widely believed to have been taken by a branch of the shadowy Islamic Holy War, the Shiite Moslem terrorist cells that asserted they bombed the American Embassy twice and the Marine garrison here. **********There has been considerable speculation that the Americans are being held as hostages to exchange for the 17 men, mostly Shiites from Iraq, convicted in Kuwait for truck bomb attacks on the American and French Embassies on Dec. 12, 1983. **********The series of attacks on Americans and others - the president of the American University, Malcolm Kerr, was slain in his office last February - and the mounting anarchy has driven most foreigners out of Beirut. **********Meanwhile, the Lebanese Government managed, after months of argument, to send 200 paramilitary policemen about 10 miles south of Beirut today in the first stage of a long-heralded peace effort. The mission of the policemen of the Internal Security Forceis to clear the way for the deployment of troops to open the coastal highway to Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon, which has been blocked by feuding Druse and Christian militias. **********Heart Ailment Adds to Concern **********A spokesman at the Catholic Relief Services's New York headquarters said yesterday that the agency was particularly worried about Father Jenco because of his heart condition. **********The spokesman, Beth Griffin, the agency's Communications Coordinator, said that medical tests on the priest were taken Monday and that results became available yesterday. **********A mass was concelebrated yesterday morning at the agency's headquarters for Father Jenco and for his abductors, Miss Griffin said. The principal concelebrant was the Rev. Robert Charlebois, Senior Director of the Catholic Relief Services programs in Eurasia. **********Father Jenco, who was assigned to the post in Beirut last September, had received no specific threats before the kidnapping, Miss Griffin said. **********She described Father Jenco as ''personable, level-headed and very intelligent'' and said he had been chosen for the Lebanese office because of his experience in dealing with large numbers of displaced people in Thailand and for his work in Yemen. **********Father Jenco heads a staff of 12 that includes another American citizen, a nun. The Catholic agency operates relief and rehabilitation projects all over Lebanon, providing direct assistance to individuals and to war-damaged institutions. **********Catholic Relief Services is the overseas aid and development agency of the American Catholiic community and provides humanitarian assistance to people in 70 countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/business/income-spending-up-in-june.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 465, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Income, Spending Up in June", "print_headline": "Income, Spending Up in June", "body_text": " **********The personal income of Americans rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported today.

The chief of the Soviet delegation, Vsevolod N. Sofinsky, complained in an interview that the American delegation had used ''lies, slander and disinformation.'' **********The Soviet Union wanted each country to confine itself to explaining its own progress on human rights, without pointing fingers at others.

''We talk about human rights and they talk about unemployment and racism,'' said Richard Schifter, the United States delegate. ''Rather than making them think we are running away from these issues, we need to respond clearly to them.'' **********On Wednesday, Mr. Schifter said that a human rights meeting was not an appropriate forum for social and economic problems, but that since the Soviet side had brought them up, ''let me say that we are prepared to join in that debate.'' **********Mr. Schifter charged that the Soviet Union's living standard was one-third that of the United States, that rationing of consumer goods was a fact of Soviet life, that housing space for Soviet citizens would approach current Western standards only in 150 years and that the Soviet Union led the world in per capita consumption of hard liquor. **********He concluded by cataloguing the privileges of the Soviet elite. ''All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,'' Mr. Schifter said, quoting from George Orwell's ''Animal Farm.'' The Soviet delegate replied by blaming the United States for the arms race. **********Last week, Mr. Schifter said in a speech that the United States was interested in better relations with the Soviet Union, including an arms control agreement. But he said the Soviet Union's performance on human rights was ''inextricably linked to all aspects of improved bilateral relations.'' **********Some journalists saw a linkage between human rights and arms control that Mr. Sofinsky picked up. ''Dead men are not very interested in human rights,'' he said. **********Mr. Schifter explained in a subsequent interview that he was not contradicting Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who said last October that arms talks would be kept separate from other Soviet-American issues. **********''I would say the arms negotiations in themselves stand on their own two feet,'' Mr. Schifter said. But he referred to remarks by members of the United States Congress who visited the conference recently.

The tariffs, to have taken effect July 6 but now suspended, were ordered in retaliation for what the United States has called preferential treatment that the Europeans have given to imports of citrus fruits from Mediterranean countries over American fruit. **********Retaliation on Walnuts, Lemons **********The European Economic Community, through its Foreign Minister, Willy de Clercq, a Belgian, countered with an decision to raise tariffs on its imports of American walnuts and lemons, effective today or Tuesday. **********Then Senator Pete Wilson, a Republican from California, proposed urging President Reagan to raise duties on imports of European wine - an action that would have greatly raised the stakes by pushing the value of the affected trade from tens of millions of dollars to close to $2 billion. **********Mr. Yeutter said he had been dealing with what he called ''a little pasta war'' throughout the weekend, mostly by telephone with Mr. de Clercq. He and European officials declined to say how they expected to settle the dispute. ''There are proposals out there that we are considering,'' Mrs. Krucoff said.  In the interview today, Mr. Yeutter said he expected protectionist pressures of the sort that led to the pasta dispute to worsen in the United States and elsewhere. ''The pressures on Capitol Hill will be for more protectionism because our trade deficit will almost assuredly widen'' from the record of $123 billion that it reached last year, he said. **********'Protectionism Everywhere' **********Protectionism is spreading elsewhere, too, especially among the developing countries, he said. To rehabilitate their economies, many of those countries now discourage imports. ''The composite of all that is a very heavy dose of protectionism everywhere,'' Mr. Yeutter said. **********He said that he ''absolutely'' opposed a broad surcharge on imported goods that many Congressmen support but that he endorsed the Reagan Administration's view that Japan and Europe should do more to stimulate their economies and thus increase their imports of American goods. **********Mr. Yeutter said it was too early to embark on multilateral negotiations to relax barriers to trade, an important objective of the Administration. ''We'll have a lot more discussions internally,'' he said. ''And we have a great deal more work to do on Capitol Hill before we're anywhere near ready to embark on that.'' **********He said that the American trade deficit was related to the strength of the dollar, but he opposed the French proposal for multilateral negotiations leading to tighter control over currency exchange rates. **********''In my judgment there is no chance whatsover that the rest of the world will accept the French approach,'' Mr. Yeutter said.

Pressed by severe liquidity problems, the holding company whose four subsidiaries supply electricity in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Missouri omitted its third-quarter dividend in late August. And the price of its stock has plunged by more than 35 percent since July. **********Inasmuch as many investors look to utility issues for dividend safety and generous yields, Middle South obviously is not for the faint of heart. But for people not averse to risk, the stock could hold appeal, according to some professionals. **********Salomon Brothers, for example, believes that this issue will outperform the market over the next 12 months. ''Middle South represents a high risk for an electric utility common stock investment,'' Gregory B. Enholm, an industry analyst, said. ''Associated with this risk, however, is the potential for high returns.'' **********The stock traded recently at a low of 8 1/8 after selling in July at 15 1/4, its high since December 1983. Yesterday, it closed unchanged, at 9 1/8. **********Middle South's liquidity problems stem from the inability to obtain rate relief from various regulators for its $3.5 billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear unit that began commercial operation on July 1. **********''In general, we believe that Middle South will recover from its current regulation-induced difficulties,'' Mr. Enholm said. **********The most likely scenario in his view is that the dividend will be passed again in the December quarter. Then, in the event of some rate increases and no liquidity problems, he expects that directors could declare a dividend - most likely 30 cents quarterly - at their next meeting in February. Previous payments were 44 1/2 cents quarterly, or at a yearly rate of $1.78 a share. **********If a $1.20 annual dividend rate is instituted in February, Salomon suggested that the stock could climb to 12 or 13 by mid-1986. **********''This is not a stock for investors who cannot tolerate high-risk levels,'' said John B. Kellenyi, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''But speculators who can afford to wait have a good opportunity to be rewarded.'' **********''I purchased Middle South when the stock traded at 8 1/4 in August, because I think it is a good speculation,'' a money manager for wealthy individuals said yesterday. ''I also purchased the $3.16 convertible preferred shares of Louisiana Power and Light at 18 and it closed Monday at 23, with a yield of 14 percent.'' **********Analysts agree that rate relief from various state regulatory bodies is necessary to nurse Middle South back to financial health. But the outlook here, Mr. Kellenyi of Drexel Burnham said, is far from certain. **********Two days ago, the Mississippi Public Service Commission granted a rate increase of $68.6 million to one subsidiary, Mississippi Power and Light, as the initial step in a series of increases. **********''But the big pending rate relief concerns the Lousiana Power and Light subsidiary - a matter that has gone from state and Federal courts to regulatory bodies and back to the state court again,'' said Mark D. Luftig, chief utility analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''By the end of September I expect a decision on some interim emergency relief.'' **********He also stressed that the situation at Middle South represented a new phase of nuclear-related problems for the industry. Starting in late 1983, shares of some utilities began to plunge because of problems related to unfinished nuclear projects. As costs increased for these power plants, dividends came under jeopardy. During 1984, such companies as Long Island Lighting, Consumers Power and Public Service of New Hampshire omitted their common dividends. **********''But Middle South has a nuclear plant that is already operating,'' Mr. Luftig said. ''So what you are seeing now is a switch from the earlier financing and engineering difficulties of nuclear projects under construction to regulatory difficulties affecting completed plants. And you will see more of this in the future as nuclear plants with large revenue requirements get completed.'' **********Middle South also has a Grand Gulf Unit 2 unit in which it has invested some $800 million. This week the Mississippi Public Service Commission voted to suspend the construction license for this plant in what some analysts see as a step toward its ultimate cancellation. **********The company has a third nuclear plant, Waterford 3, with commercial operation projected to start next month. Citing another potential problem that could hurt the stock price, Mr. Enholm of Salomon Brothers said that ''Louisiana Power and Light must convince the Lousiana Public Service Commission to cover the costs of this $3 billion plant.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/09/world/around-the-world-un-chief-meets-with-iraqi-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD ;   U.N.

Gromyko wound up a 28-year career as Soviet Foreign Minister today and was named President of the Soviet Union, a prestigious but in the past largely ceremonial position. **********Mr. Gromyko, who is 75 years old, was succeeded in the foreign affairs post by Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 57, the party leader of the Soviet republic of Georgia. Mr. Shevardnadze was promoted to full membership in the ruling Politburo on Monday. **********The changes in the governmental structure were set in motion in a session of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, as Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, nominated Mr. Gromyko for the presidency. **********In so doing, Mr. Gorbachev broke a pattern set by Leonid I. Brezhnev of combining the party leadership, which is the seat of authority, with the position of the nation's President. **********Choice of Georgian a Surprise **********The choice of Mr. Shevardnadze to succeed Mr. Gromyko as the Foreign Minister came as a surprise to diplomats since the Georgian official has no foreign policy background. **********As the Georgian Interior Minister, he was in charge of the police in his Caucasian homeland from 1965 to 1972, before being put in charge of all of Georgia's affairs as the Communist Party chief. **********Some diplomats thought that in selecting a person with little diplomatic experience, Mr. Gorbachev might be signaling that foreign policy would come from his office. **********The Reagan Administration is likely to get its first measure of Mr. Shevardnadze at the end of this month, when he is to meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Helsinki, Finland. The meeting is likely to focus on preparations for the meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and President Reagan in November. In announcing that the positions of party leader and Soviet President would no longer be combined, Mr. Gorbachev said that the daunting domestic tasks he has made the cornerstone of his administration required that he concentrate his attention on carrying the new policies, mainly in the economic sphere. **********Mr. Gorbachev himself was made a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, which is the Soviet Union's collective presidency, with its chairman - Mr. Gromyko - acting as the President. **********Mr. Gorbachev paid tribute to Mr. Gromyko as a man whose ''deep knowledge and varied experience are combined with principledness and consistency.'' On returning to his seat on the dais, Mr. Gorbachev reached across the Prime Minister, Nikolai A. Tikhonov, to warmly shake Mr. Gromyko's hand. Gromyko Betrays No Emotion Mr. Gromyko, in a brief acceptance speech, pledged to ''make every effort to discharge with credit my duty to the party, to the country, to the people.'' True to his reputation, he gave no hint in his bearing or his expression of his emotions. **********In accepting the presidency of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gromyko capped a remarkable diplomatic career that began as Stalin's 34-year-old Ambassador to Washington and ended as the longest-serving Foreign Minister in modern history. **********It was characteristic of Mr. Gromyko's career as a master diplomat that in assuming the presidency he left Western analysts divided on the meaning of the move. **********Some thought that he had been ''kicked upstairs'' as part of Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to bring a new team into the Kremlin. Yet from Mr. Gorbachev's demeanor and the tone of his address, it seemed as if the Soviet leader was rewarding a respected and deserving elder statesman, rather than sidetracking a political obstacle. Culmination to Arduous Career For Mr. Gromyko the presidency offered an honorable culmination to a long and arduous career. It was a position that guaranteed him a more prestigious role in Soviet history than he would have had as Foreign Minister, and a burial plot behind the Lenin Mausoleum instead of a niche in the Kremlin wall. **********Besides, Mr. Gromyko has hardly been eliminated from the political scene. As a member of the ruling Politburo, he will continue to have a voice in Soviet policy. As President, he will be responsible for meeting with visiting foreign chiefs of state and for making official trips abroad. Some diplomats thought that he might expand the functions of his office, and maintain an active role in foreign affairs. **********Yet the conclusion was unavoidable that Mr. Gorbachev had made a move that further tightened his grip on Soviet policy-making. **********Diplomats thought that Mr. Gorbachev might have wanted to bring a non-Russian into a visible Government position to foster the Soviet Union's image as a multi-ethnic state. **********The four million Georgians whom Mr. Shevardnadze represents constitute one of a hundred or more Soviet ethnic groups. The more important of these ethnic communities form separate republics or states, and Georgia, which borders on Turkey and the Black Sea, is one of the 15 states that make up the Soviet Union. **********Although no immediate changes are expected in Soviet foreign policy, diplomats believe that changes in style, and eventually in policy, are inevitable under a new generation of leaders. **********Mr. Gromyko belongs to a generation of officials reared during World War II and the cold war, men who view the world with suspicion and distrust. Mr. Gromyko, moreover, is a man who regarded international relations in terms almost exclusively of superpower competition. Focus of Interest May be Shifting While a master at the game, he often seemed uninterested in regions and issues that did not touch on the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Gorbachev, by comparison, has displayed interest in improving relations with China and has spoken about the importance of making the Soviet Union into a model for the third world. **********Some diplomats thought that as a member of a minority group, Mr. Shevardnadze might be more receptive to third-world issues than Mr. Gromyko. The Georgian's trips outside the Soviet bloc have been for the most part to developing nations. **********The Supreme Soviet session today followed a Central Committee meeting on Monday at which Mr. Gorbachev's most powerful rival in the Politburo, Grigory V. Romanov, was dropped from the leadership, purportedly on grounds of health. **********At the Supreme Soviet session today, Yegor K. Ligachev, one of Mr. Gorbachev's key aides, was named chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet of the Union, one of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet. The post has customarily gone to the second-ranking men in the Kremlin, and was last held by Mr. Gorbachev himself. **********Ligachev Seems to Rank Second **********The appointment confirmed that Mr. Ligachev, who is the national party secretary charged with ideology and high-level appointments, was Mr. Gorbachev's second-in-command. **********In making Mr. Gromyko the President, Mr. Gorbachev broke with a practice that was introduced in 1977 by Mr. Brezhnev when he dismissed Nikolai V. Podgorny as President and assumed the title himself. Previously, the positions of party leader and of the nation's President had been held separately. **********The rationale Mr. Brezhnev offered was that putting the party chief at the head of the state affirmed the principle of the primacy of the party. He also found it useful for protocol reasons to be chief of state when meeting with foreign leaders. **********Today Mr. Gorbachev said that the practice had been justified in the past, but that the urgency of the tasks now facing the Soviet Union required that he devote his energies to guiding the course he has chartered as the party leader. **********Mr. Gorbachev's predecessors have held a third office, too, that of chairman of the Council of Defense of the U.S.S.R., a shadowy body with a secret membership charged with overseeing national defense. Diplomats said there had been no indication whether Mr. Gorbachev had assumed that position."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/business/l-monetary-policy-106203.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 282, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONETARY POLICY", "print_headline": "MONETARY POLICY", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********There's never been a real connection between M-1 and G.N.P.

But neither do they see anything in recent economic data, or on the horizon, to suggest a sharp rebound, as many had hoped. **********''Our own view is that we're not heading into a recession as some people have thought, but we're not as bullish as some people either,'' said John B. Corey, chief economist at Armco Inc. **********Momentum Is Anticipated **********''Unless there is a loss of confidence on the part of consumers and business people,'' he said, ''everything we look at in the economy indicates that the pace should pick up from where it had been, and some of that momentum should carry through to the first half of 1986.'' **********The Government's first overall measure of the economy's performance in the quarter ending Sept. 30 will come Friday when the Commerce Department releases its ''flash'' estimate of the third-quarter gross national product. Although the flash figure is based on incomplete data and is subject to substantial revision later, it gives economists better insight into the economy's overall condition than they get from piecing together the monthly statistics reported for various segments of the economy, such as housing starts. **********Mr. Corey's forecast, in line with those of other corporate economists, shows the economy growing at an annual rate of about 2.5 to 3 percent in the present quarter and quickening to a 4 percent pace in the fourth quarter. **********Administration's Optimism **********That would be an improvement over the rate of growth in this year's second quarter (2 percent) and first quarter (three-tenths of 1 percent). But the projections are nowhere near as optimistic as those of the White House, which is predicting 5 percent growth for the second half of the year. **********After the Government issued reports on Friday showing a large gain in retail sales and higher industrial production, Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the data reconfirmed the White House forecast of second-half economic growth at a 5 percent annual rate. **********Indeed, the underlying economic trends over the past few months have been cause for some optimism. Interest rates are lower than they were in the first half. The dollar has declined. Auto sales are booming. Inventory levels remain cautiously under control. Figures for July hint that the trade deficit may be narrowing. Unemployment dropped sharply and industrial production edged higher last month. Meanwhile, inflation remains in check. **********Government Spending Cited **********Among the more optimistic business economists is Gordon B. Pye, chief economist at the Irving Trust Company, who predicts third-quarter growth of 4 percent and fourth-quarter growth of 4 to 5 percent. **********His optimism is based partly on the belief that the second half of the year will benefit from a pickup in local, state and Federal spending, particularly military expenditures. He also believes the trade deficit, narrowed by a decline in the dollar's foreign-exchange value, will not be as much of a drag on economic growth as it was in the first half. Another healthy sign, he said, is the pickup in consumer spending, particularly automobile sales. **********''Consumer confidence, by all measures, does continue to be at quite a high level,'' he said. ''We're past the period of pent-up demand that we had early in the recovery, but the confidence is still there. So if you give them a little nudge, then they are out there buying.'' **********Car manufacturers have nudged consumers with incentive programs that have drawn an enormous reponse over the past month. **********Detroit's Robust Report **********Last Friday the Commerce Department reported that retail sales, fueled by a large jump in auto sales, rose 1.9 percent in August, the best gain in four months. Later in the day, domestic auto makers reported that sales in the first 10 days of September soared 56.8 percent from a year earlier. **********But economists were not impressed by the retail sales data. The overall retail picture is not nearly as bright as the car figures indicate. Without the large increase in automobile sales, retail sales in August would have risen only four-tenths of 1 percent. Furthermore, many economists believe that present car sales, surging under the incentive programs, are merely being borrowed from future sales. They wonder how strong car sales will be if the incentives are removed. **********Thomas E. Swanstrom, chief economist at Sears, Roebuck & Company, said he expects improved general merchandise sales but not dramatic gains. He predicts that general merchandise sales in the second half will be up 7.2 percent from a year ago, compared with a 5.6 percent increase in this year's first half. **********Sears' Projection for 1986 **********Overall, his general economic forecast calls for 3 percent growth in the third quarter and 4 percent in the fourth quarter. For 1986, Sears is predicting growth of 3.2 percent, compared with estimated growth of 2.5 percent for 1985. **********The industrial production figure released last Friday was also disappointing to business economists. Although industrial output was up three-tenths of 1 percent in August, following no gain at all in July, the rise was far less than the increases posted in the early stages of the recovery and certainly nothing that would signal a strong rejuvenation of the manufacturing sector. **********Business economists see some improvement ahead in manufacturing, which has been hurt by foreign competition, but the gains are expected to be slow and modest despite the recent decline in the dollar. **********Effect of Dollar's Decline **********Although the value of the dollar, by one measure, has declined about 12 percent since March in comparison with the currencies of major trading partners, A. Nicholas Filippello, chief economist at the Monsanto Company, believes it will take at least another 12 percent decline ''to remove most of the competitive disadvantage caused by currency values.'' **********Not expecting such a decline to take place soon, Mr. Filippello believes economic growth in the third and fourth quarters will ''probably not be averaging much more than 3 percent.'' **********''It's just plain old stagnation,'' added Robert J. Corkhill, corporate economist at the Allied Corporation, who predicts growth of no better than 2.6 percent for the third quarter and 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter.

The newspaper said the documents had been obtained by French intelligence inside the Soviet Union and had been used by French officials to substantiate the spying charges in private conversations with the Russians. **********The documents, which were described in Le Monde today and over the weekend, are from the Soviet Ministry of the Aviation Industry and discuss technical information obtained through ''special channels'' in the West. **********''The positive experience we have had from abroad,'' one document says, ''has allowed us to proceed in a manner favorable to our country in perfecting new, higher-level technology, and this in a very short span of time.'' **********Savings of $56.5 Million **********That document, summarizing the record of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry in 1979, says technical information from the West enabled the Russians to bypass research and tests of their own, saving 48.6 million rubles, or roughly $56.5 million. **********The document says the figure represented an increase of 18.8 million rubles, or $21.8 million, over 1978. **********Western diplomats said they believed that the Soviet documents published here, along with photocopies of portions of the Russian originals, were authentic and consistent with what has generally been believed about the Soviet effort to acquire Western technological secrets. **********Nonetheless, the documents seemed to provide a rare glimpse into the functioning of the Soviet intelligence-gathering apparatus. **********The information tends to support contentions by the Reagan Administration that spying provides the Russians with a major means of improving military capability. The Administration has urged Western countries to impose tougher controls on high-technology products sold to the Soviet Union. **********Embassy Protests Publication **********The Soviet Embassy has protested the publication of the documents, asserting that it represented an act of ''flagrant disinformation'' aimed at ''awakening the suspicion of the French who participate in a vast enterprise of scientific and technical cooperation with the Soviet Union.'' **********Western diplomats here speculated that the Soviet documents may have been disclosed to the local press as a result of a high-level French Government decision to warn the Russians against industrial espionage here. **********Another possible explanation offered by officials was that the documents were made public by individuals who wanted to influence the mood of French-Soviet relations. **********In any case, information about the expulsion of the Soviet officials abruptly became available here, with French newspapers for the first time publishing a full list of their names and giving in some instances their new positions in the Soviet bureaucracy. **********61.5% of Material Is From U.S. **********The Soviet documents indicate that 61.5 percent of the material derived from ''special channels'' came originally from the United States, 10.5 percent from West Germany and 8 percent from France. **********In 1979, according to documents of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry, 156 ''samples'' and 3,896 technical documents were obtained abroad and studied by the ministry. **********One of the documents gives two specific examples of the use of technical knowledge gained in the West. In one case, the aiming systems of weapons aboard fighter planes was improved by studying Western mounting procedures. In another, detailed studies of air flow and wind resistance for the SU- 25, a Soviet fighter-bomber, were eliminated because Western studies were available to Soviet planners. **********''These are leading elements of technology where the Soviets are behind,'' a Western diplomat said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/04/business/business-digest-wednesday-september-4-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1985", "body_text": " **********Companies **********The Pentagon proposed canceling a Fairchild Republic plane made at a plant on Long Island, Pentagon and industry sources said.

''But I think we're surrounded.'' **********The rebels are members of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, which is based along the country's northern border with Honduras. Until recently, the group concentrated its efforts in the country's five northern provinces, Nueva Segovia, Madriz, Esteli, Jinotega and Matagalpa. **********It recently began supporting a small band of rebels fighting near the Costa Rican border, but they are not connected with those who are fighting in the central part of the country. **********The forces in Boaco and Chontales are believed to be Nicaraguan Democratic Force regulars who receive supplies and other support from bases along the Honduran border, which is 150 miles away. **********Hit-and-Run Attacks **********Although the rebels have carried out some dramatic attacks, they do not appear to threaten Government control of populated areas. Their pattern has been to sweep into lightly defended villages and then escape before Sandinista reinforcements can arrive. **********The insurgents have not been able to take important towns such as Santo Domingo because of the effectiveness of Sandinista defensive tactics. Government troops, who enjoy considerable numerical superiority, move constantly through the mountains. When they detect rebel units, they call in air and artillery strikes. **********Government troops are equipped with long-range artillery of Soviet manufacture. They are supported by aircraft including Soviet MI-24 helicopter gunships. The rebel force has no comparable weapons. **********Insurgents Halt Buses **********According to residents, religious workers and others who travel regularly through this region, rebel troops began to filter into Boaco and Chontales in December. Since then, they have built a force that local observers believe numbers at least 1,000 men. **********Rebel squads regularly stop buses on the road between Juigalpa, the capital of Chontales Province, and the trading outpost at Rama. According to many accounts, the rebels take away passengers dressed in military uniforms and any they believe to be security agents. **********Rebels forces are not able to operate in this manner on any other principal road in Nicaragua. **********Sandinista activists are main targets for the rebel squads in this area. The rebel radio station regularly broadcasts lists of people said to be members of local Sandinista defense committees or officials of other Sandinista organizations. **********When rebels attacked the town of Cuapa at the beginning of August, they overran a small army garrison and summoned residents to the town square. **********They asked townspeople their opinion of their Sandinista-appointed Mayor, Hollman Martinez, and were told that he was respected. The rebels carried him off, but released him unharmed a few hours later. **********Other Activists Are Shot **********Mr. Martinez is said to owe his popularity largely to the fact that he is a native of Cuapa. Sandinista activists assigned from other areas to govern the town, however, were marched into the woods and shot. **********The official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, said 12 people were executed after the Cuapa attack. **********''Among the murdered companeros,'' Barricada said, ''were the coordinator of the local junta, distinguished members of the Sandinista Capital Front and members of Sandinista Defense Committees.'' **********Mr. Martinez described the episode as ''a bestial crime.'' **********The attack on Cuapa, like most of the recent contra operations in this region, produced few combat casualties. But rebels struck a heavy blow by ambushing a truck carrying as many as 40 soldiers sent to reinforce the Cuapa garrison. Nearly all the soldiers were killed. **********The ambush struck close to home, residents said, because most of the victims were Chontales youths who had been drafted in recent weeks. **********Lack of Training Charged **********''What caused outrage in many families was that these kids were sent into such a situation without any real training,'' said the Roman Catholic Bishop of Juigalpa, Pablo Antonio Vega. **********''We know of two cases where the mothers destroyed Sandinista coffins and bought their own so their sons would not be buried as soldiers,'' Bishop Vega said.  Boaco and Chontales are the heart of Nicaragua's beef belt. Cattle graze on lush hillsides and herds being driven to market block main roads. Many ranches lie far beyond the reach of passable roads. **********''The contras decided to begin operating here for two reasons,'' said a cattleman who has lived in the region all his life. ''First, the terrain is ideal for them. Second, the campesinos in the mountains are often sympathetic toward them.'' **********Farm workers said that on at least two occasions in recent weeks brigades of contras numbering several hundred had arrived peacefully at ranches in Chontales and been given permission to rest overnight. **********In Juigalpa, a man shopping for insecticide at a farm supply store said the situation in this area was ''completely different'' from a year ago. **********''It's always been calm out here,'' he said. ''Now we feel like we're in the middle of a war.'' ----Civilians to Be Targets MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 1 (UPI) - The rebel Nicaraguan Democratic Force declared today that members of pro-Government civilian organizations would become targets of its attacks. **********The rebels' radio named the organizations as the Sandinista Defense Committees, the Luisa Amanda Espinoza Nicaraguan Women's Association, the National Union of Farmers and Ranchers and organizing committees of the Sandinista People's Militia.

KAUFMAN, HENRY SCHACHAR;   SHAKING UP PHILIPP BROTHERS", "body_text": " **********MARTIN N. KAUFMAN can hardly remember a time when commodities were not part of his life. The newly appointed chairman of Philipp Brothers, the commodities trading subsidiary of Phibro-Salomon Inc., grew up in Pittsburgh, where his father processed and traded scrap steel. Even as a small boy, he recalls, he was fascinated by ''the nuts and bolts, twists and turns'' of trading. **********But he is clearly not sentimental about his childhood memories: One of his first acts this October as chairman-designate of the respected, century-old commodity trading house was to take Philipp Brothers out of the steel scrap business and close its Pittsburgh office. **********In fact, Mr. Kaufman has been presiding over the most drastic shake-up in Philipp Brothers' history, one that will ultimately reduce the elite but troubled commodities trader to a third of the size it was when he was appointed on Oct. 28 and to less than one-fourth of its size four years ago. The massive layoffs that he initiated have been a wrenching experience for a firm that had been known for its paternalism. But Mr. Kaufman, who has been based in London for the last four years and is still there now, was able to find support in at least one quarter in the United States: Henry Schachar, his long-time colleague and newly appointed second in command, was with him all the way. **********Mr. Schachar (pronounced sha-KAR), the company's new president, and Mr. Kaufman present different images. Mr. Schachar has a slight paunch and a bit of a Bronx accent, while Mr. Kaufman is trim and polished. But they are both analytical, ambitious, brashly self-confident and young - each just turned 32. ''That's a tender age,'' commented a competitor, ''to take on a firm with Phibro's problems and with the problems in the industry.'' **********Indeed, the two men, who built formidable reputations in their brief careers as sugar traders at the firm, face a new kind of test now. Philipp Brothers, whose prestige was founded on its prowess in the globe-girdling business of trading commodities such as ores, metals, grains and fertilizers, has been badly jolted by deep structural changes in the industrialized world. The cooling of inflation in the last four years has sent most commodity prices tumbling, along with the profits of the firms that trade in them. ''Prices are about as low as I have seen, and I've been in this business for more than 50 years,'' commented Ludwig Jesselson, Philipp Brothers' legendary former chairman and currently an adviser and board member. **********And the current Philipp Brothers restructuring comes on top of other maneuverings that have damaged the firm's esprit de corps. Salomon Brothers, the investment banking powerhouse that Philipp Brothers acquired in 1981, has increasingly gained the upper hand at Phibro-Salomon, the combined company. Last year, Philipp Brothers' former chairman, David Tendler, was ousted by Salomon's chief, John H. Gutfreund, from the chairmanship of Phibro-Salomon. And rumors continue to surface - vehemently denied by Mr. Gutfreund - that Phibro-Salomon may sell Philipp Brothers. MR. JESSELSON wondered aloud whether a sale would be possible, if Philipp Brothers' current restructuring did not succeed.''If things don't work out now,'' he said, ''there may not be anything left to sell.'' **********But Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Schachar are spending little time worrying and a lot of time making changes. Besides slashing staff and operations, they are focusing their business away from America and toward newly industrialized nations. They are also getting out of inflation-dependent operations that require stockpiling and more heavily into commodities that can be traded quickly. **********While their goals are the same, their styles are totally different. ''Henry is a meat-and-potatoes, very straight, what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of guy. Marty has a little more flair. He's more of a planner, a thinker,'' said Mr. Gutfreund. **********Stuart Campbell, a sugar broker with Rudolf Wolff Ltd. in London, who has worked with Mr. Kaufman, recalled him as ''extremely bright, with a near photographic memory. Any move is thoroughly researched and thought-out. But once he's convinced his approach is correct, he doesn't pussyfoot around.'' **********Mr. Schachar sees many of those strengths as complementary to his own. ''Marty is by far superior when it comes to strategic planning,'' he said. ''He is more of a self-starter. Give him a blank piece of paper and he'll start coming up with ideas. I'm a problem solver, a tactician, a field commander.'' **********In fact, the two have worked together so closely that ''I almost view them as one person,'' said Alan Flacks, Philipp Brothers' outgoing chairman. ''They are both thorough businessmen and totally dedicated.'' **********They certainly have an unusual rapport - maintained, since Mr. Kaufman was sent to London, by long, daily telephone conferences. During an interview conducted when Mr. Kaufman was in New York, the two routinely finished each other's thoughts - a habit they are known for at the firm. **********Mr. Kaufman: ''We have worked very, very closely...'' Mr. Schachar: ...for seven years.'' Mr. Kaufman: ''We almost know what each other thinks...'' **********Mr. Schachar: ''...our wives are jealous of that relationship.'' **********Both are devoted family men. Mr. Kaufman has one child and another on the way. He loves living in London, he says - his mother is English and he is a self-proclaimed Anglophile -and he pins on the city his ultimate compliment: ''Excellent.'' He gets out frequently to the countryside and keeps fit with swimming and horseback riding. **********Mr. Schachar lives on Long Island and has three children. Free time? ''I'm boring,'' he said. ''I work.'' An Orthodox Jew, study is his pasttime. Each morning before work he attends a Talmudic study group conducted in Hebrew. Both he and Mr. Kaufman adhere to kosher dietary laws, but Mr. Schachar is the more devout of the two, they say. **********They both attended Yeshiva University in New York City in the early 1970's, where they combined religious with secular studies. Mr. Kaufman's secular major was history and Mr. Schachar's was psychology. At the time, Mr. Schachar expected to become a rabbi, until his father convinced him that he could pursue a business career alongside a life of religious study. ''My father is my confidant and adviser,'' he commented. ''My mother calls him my Kissinger.'' AFTER college, Mr. Schachar obtained a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. Mr. Kaufman, intent on going into the commodities business, attended New York University's business school after Yeshiva, but left before receiving a degree. **********The two joined Philipp Brothers, two weeks apart, in 1977. It was not until 1979, though, that the friendship started to form. That year, they both were assigned to Philipp Brothers' sugar trading desk, where they found themselves in a fiercely competitive, sink-or-swim environment. **********''We were all set up as competitors, and Marty and I thought we could do better together,'' Mr. Schachar said. ''We'd meet at 6:30 over coffee and discuss our responsibilities that day. If we wanted an understanding of the entire sugar business, we decided this was the way to work,'' Added Mr. Kaufman: ''We'd feed off of each other. The personal chemistry was very good.'' **********The strategic alliance worked. The two men took over the sugar department in 1981, a wild year of wild price gyrations. By 1984, their shrewd trades had turned sugar into the second-most profitable business at Philipp Brothers, after oil trading. **********Their success did not go unnoticed or unrewarded. When Mr. Flacks was brought out of semi-retirement last year to ''calm the waters,'' as he put it, part of his task was to choose the next generation of leadership. ''It was a question of keeping the thing together,'' he said. **********He invited Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Schachar to join a new executive committee that was analyzing how to rebuild Philipp Brothers, and gave each responsibility for running different parts of the firm. Mr. Kaufman administered trading in the so-called soft commodities - such as sugar, grain and fertilizer - from London, and Mr. Schachar, in New York, headed the non-trading, administrative areas. Both men advocated cutbacks throughout the company. **********Then Phibro-Salomon decided last August to withdraw from any dealings with South Africa. That hastened the end of Philipp Brothers' ferro-alloy trading business, which depended in part on South African chromium. And it also triggered the other cutbacks recommended by Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Schachar. CONSEQUENTLY, some 600 of the firm's 1,500 worldwide market and trading staff were let go, just as the two men were named to the firm's top jobs. Oil trading, the most profitable of Philipp Brothers' businesses, was previously split off in 1983 as Phibro Energy. **********Now the two will oversee the reduction of nearly 1,500 more from the payroll as the company sells off its scrap metal, pig iron and ferro-alloy businesses, and closes its Stockholm, Madrid, Milan and Dusseldorf offices. That will slash Philipp Brothers' staff to slightly more than 1,000 people, from 3,000. Its capital will shrink to about $100 million from more than $300 million. **********It is an enormous comedown for a company that, at the peak of its power in 1981, had capital of more than $1.25 billion and a staff of 4,600. Its net earnings that year reached more than $466 million. **********Although the company expects its pre-tax earnings to rise to as much as $75 million this year from only $13 million in 1984, that is still much lower than its 1983 pre-tax earnings of $107 million. And there will be another blow to its pride - the Phibro name will be dropped from the holding company's title. Next year, it will be known simply as Salomon Inc., and the Philipp Brothers' offices will be moved into Salomon Brothers' quarters in New York, London and Tokyo. Asked about Philipp Brothers' place within the group now, Mr. Gutfreund said simply: ''It's the commodity trading arm.'' **********Peter E. Butler, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., put it a bit more dramatically: ''The company is evaporating. It's down to a skeleton crew,'' he said. ''Gutfreund has eliminated all traces of the old business. It's only going to be a department of a big company now, and the new guys are department managers.'' **********Perhaps more important, Salomon Brothers has taken control of the little-known Commercial Finance division of Philipp Brothers. This is the Swiss-based kitty where, for tax purposes, Philipp Brothers had retained its offshore profits, which it used for short-term lending. The pot has swelled to more than $2 billion. Salomon will now use it for its own ambitious plan of international expansion, says a senior executive. **********That leaves Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Schachar with a much smaller domain than they may have aimed for years ago. But they are intent on rebuilding, concentrating on commodities that are traded on commodity exchanges and that thus offer more opportunities for sophisticated arbitrage and hedging strategies. The firm is particularly interested in expanding its use of the options markets, says Mr. Kaufman. **********Philipp Brothers will still be a principal in transactions, buying physical commodities and transporting them. ''In no way, shape or form are we paper traders now,'' Mr. Schachar insisted. ''The basis of the company is still the physical movement of raw materials.'' But he quickly added: ''The firm that we are running is less dependent on inflationary times.'' **********The two men will also move Philipp Brothers toward trade with newly industrialized countries. Significantly, they are not closing any of its operations in the Far East. **********Its international operations have already been a boon to Salomon, which is itself chasing new international markets. Recently, Mr. Kaufman joined Mr. Gutfreund on a visit to the Soviet Union. ''I must say I was very well greeted there,'' Mr. Gutfreund remarked. ''Now that's not because of the Salomon Brothers name, which they really don't know. It was because of the Philipp Brothers name.'' The subsidiary, he says, is a good ''door opener.'' **********If Philipp Brothers never regains a more important role than that, it will not be for lack of effort on the part of its aggressive new chairman and president. ''We are going to infuse it with a lot of new, young blood,'' insisted the stubbornly optimistic Mr. Kaufman. 'We're going to expand these businesses in a coherent, orderly way.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/15/world/koch-bids-banks-cut-pretoria-tie.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOCH BIDS BANKS CUT PRETORIA TIE", "print_headline": "KOCH BIDS BANKS CUT PRETORIA TIE", "body_text": " **********Mayor Koch sent out a letter to the presidents of 12 banks Friday, urging them ''to immediately suspend all banking activities in South Africa, to call in all your loans and to refuse to roll over maturing debts until the state of emergency is rescinded and apartheid is ended.'' **********Such an action, the Mayor said in his letter, would ''send a clear message to the South African Government that continued economic viability cannot go hand in hand with oppression.'' **********South Africa imposed a state of emergency in 36 districts on July 21 in an effort to control violent protests against apartheid in black townships. **********Also on Friday, Mr. Koch met at Gracie Mansion with Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; with Bill Cosby, the entertainer, and others to plan a National Day of Mourning for South Africa on Oct. 5. **********The Mayor announced that John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York, would conduct an ecumenical service to mark the event, and that a synagogue still to be chosen would also hold a service."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/world/un-speakers-deal-with-regional-conflicts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

But there were bitter confrontations with the Roman Catholic Church in the early 1960's and many Cubans say that even in recent years, with hostilities markedly diminished, professing to be a ''believer'' has often been a handicap to getting ahead in Cuban society. **********Now, however, the Government is trying to improve its relations with the churches and synagogues, stopping short of embracing them, but hoping to end the cool co-existence of the last 15 years or so and urging mutual cooperation. **********Castro Meets U.S. Bishops **********Early this year, Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, held a symbolically signficant meeting with the first group of American Roman Catholic bishops to visit Cuba since the he rose to power in 1959. The event was publicized in Cuba's Government-controlled newspapers and on national television and, later, Mr. Castro said he would welcome a visit by Pope John Paul II. **********A short time later, the Government announced the establishment of an Office of Religious Affairs as a department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. **********In a recent interview, Jose Carneado, the 69-year-old head of the new office, said he had been meeting with religious leaders on a variety of matters and working to discourage discrimination against believers in offices, factories, schools and neighborhood groups. **********''Not long ago, we co-existed separately,'' Mr. Carneado said, ''Now we have the possibility of living together, exchanging ideas, hearing the difficulties the churches encounter. We are cooperating together and we aim to make our differences disappear.'' **********Government 'More Relaxed' **********Mr. Carneado said the change was taking place because the religious organizations, especially the Roman Catholic Church, had shown ''a readiness to participate in our reality, to accept the revolutionary process.'' **********Jorge I. Dominguez, a Harvard University professor and authority on Cuba, agrees that the church has become more progressive and has tried to find common ground with the Government. But he said the Government had changed, too. **********''It is much more confident, much more relaxed, much more certain that it is not facing overthrow tomorrow,'' he said in a telephone interview from Cambridge. **********Mr. Dominguez and many Western diplomats here also see the shifting relationship with the church as another example of Cuba's efforts to win wider acceptance internationally. **********Prelate Notes Improvement **********No one expects all of this to lead to a great surge in attendance at religious services in a country where for the last quarter of a century atheistic, Marxist teachings have been the standard. But some religious Cubans said that they were beginning to feel more at ease in practicing their beliefs and that for the first time since the 1959 revolution they were seeing signs that religious life in Cuba might be enriched. **********Archbishop Jaime Lucas Ortega Alamino of Havana would not discuss the changes in detail, but in a brief conversation he said that ''the situation has gotten better and I think it is going to get better.'' **********Western diplomats said that the Archbishop was now being invited to some official functions and that it was no longer rare for him to meet with high party officials. The diplomats said that more Bibles and other religious books and publications were being brought into Cuba and that about a half-dozen foreign priests had recently been allowed to join the faculty of the small seminary in Havana, adding to the number of priests in Cuba, which for years had been frozen at about 230. **********Before the revolution, there had been perhaps two million Roman Catholics in Cuba. Now Mr. Dominguez estimates that of Cuba's 10 million people possibly 250,000 may describe themselves as Roman Catholics. Mr. Carneado said there may be as few as 75,000 Roman Catholics in Cuba. #52 Protestant Denominations Mr. Carneado said there were also 52 Protestant demoninations with small followings in Cuba. In addition, he said, there were many Cubans who believe in Afro-Cuban religions that are somewhat akin to voodoo. **********Some of the most concrete advances have come in the Jewish population, which is perhaps 1,200 strong, mainly in Havana, down from 12,000 to 15,000 before the revolution. There are five synagogues in Havana, but there has been no rabbi since 1958, no cantor since 1961 and no mohel to conduct ritual circumcisions since 1980, Jewish spokesmen say. **********Mr. Carneado and some of the Jewish spokesmen said the Government had recently given approval for rabbis and mohels to visit Cuba and for a Cuban to be sent abroad to study to become a rabbi. Mr. Carneado said further discussions were planned on permitting a foreign rabbi to live in Cuba permanently. **********The Government has started restoring the badly deteriorated Jewish cemetery in Havana and is considering allocating supplies to replace broken windows, missing ceiling tiles and tattered drapes at the largest synagogue and Jewish center, which is known as the Patronato de la Comunidad Hebrea. **********Kosher Restaurant Considered **********The Government, Mr. Carneado said, is also considering opening a kosher restaurant in the historic center of Havana, which is being developed as a tourist area and where Arab and Chinese restaurants have already been opened. **********Dr. Jose Miller, the president of the Jewish Coordinating Committee of Havana, and some of the other Jewish spokesmen said they had never felt victimized because of their beliefs. **********''I think you would only have problems if you wanted to be a member of the party,'' said Dr. Miller, who is in charge of oral surgery at a major hospital. ''You cannot be a believer and be a member of the party. There are no advantages in being a believer here. But there are no problems.'' Still, in all the years that the Jews of Cuba had been without a rabbi, Dr. Miller said, he and the others had ''never asked'' the Government to permit one to come. **********''We have not thought of it as a part of our possibilities,'' Dr. Miller said. **********Relations 'Much Better' **********Mr. Carneado said he did not know why there had not been a request for a rabbi. But he ventured, ''Perhaps the community itself has been inhibited in the past.'' **********In principle, he said, it would have been possible for a rabbi to have come earlier. But he acknowledged that ''perhaps'' such a request would have run into difficulties. **********But that, Mr. Carneado said, was the past.

Moreover, if it is broadly suspected that he will never regain full health, his powerful political machine may begin to seek a new leader or even drift apart. **********While the doctors' announcement did not appear to create immediate problems for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, it caused concern within the Government nonetheless.

He maintains control by virtue of his personal magnetism, his fund-raising ability and the size of his political machine, which is virtually a party unto itself. **********But he recently witnessed uncommon discontent within the ranks of his followers. **********Last October, a principal Tanaka aide, Susumu Nikaido, briefly considered challenging Mr. Nakasone for the party presidency. When Mr. Tanaka got angry, Mr. Nikaido backed off.

Both men were later jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. **********Mr. Tho said if news reports he had heard were correct, Mr. Kissinger was guilty of ''gross slanders'' about the numbers of political prisoners in Vietnam or the size of casualty figures in the wake of Hanoi's conquest of South Vietnam. **********''Because he smarted under the blow of defeat,'' Mr. Tho said of Mr. Kissinger, ''he is now showing himself as rather aggressive. He is trying to evade the facts.''

' **********From Mr. Mai's perspective exchanges with American delegations have have been fruitful and promising. Mr. Mai, who spent four years on the Vietnamese negotiating team in Paris and has been involved in setting up the Orderly Departure Program, which allows Vietnamese to emigrate legally to the United States, has also been involved in regular discussions on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Meetings on this issue have recently been increased from four to six a year. Last month Hanoi announced that the first joint American-Vietnamese inspection of a wartime crash site would take place in June. **********''There has been quite a lot of progress on M.I.A.'s,'' Mr. Mai said.

They are situated near the Israeli town of Qiryat Shemona. **********Warning to Shiites **********In Tel Aviv, the Israeli Defense Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said the raid was a warning to the Shiite militia not to carry its fight against the South Lebanon Army into Israel. The South Lebanon Army is an Israeli-backed militia that patrols a so-called security zone 3 to 12 miles wide inside Lebanon. **********The formal Israeli withdrawal ended three years of occupation of Lebanon. As the withdrawal proceeded, Israel raided Lebanese villages and detained hundreds of people on suspicion of involvement in guerrilla attacks. **********Today Israel released 113 detainees, most of them Shiite Moslems, from the Atlit prison near Haifa and sent them back to Lebanon.

[The Associated Press, quoting Lebanese police sources, said at least seven tanks, 20 armored personnel carriers and two helicopter gunships were involved in the sweep through Qabrikha alone.]  Israeli reports said the troops moved in at 4:30 A.M. and assembled the detainees in central squares for interrogation.

It said the Government ''has gone too far.'' **********With 90 percent of the labor force in the Histadrut, the entire country, including harbors and airports, is expected to be shut down by the strike. Services will operate on an emergency Sabbath schedule. **********Plan's Principal Elements **********The key elements of the 200-point economic reform package are an immediate 18.8 percent devaluation of the shekel, making it 1,500 to the dollar; price increases in Government-subsidized products such as gasoline, which will now sell for $3.44 a gallon; the dismissal of 9,000 Government employees within 30 days; a Government spending cut of $750 million, and a Government-ordered three-month wage freeze and price freeze for most goods. **********Israel's economic deterioration has its roots in a decade-long combination of mismanagement by several administrations and heavy spending on the Lebanon war and the West Bank settlements and other factors. **********But this is the first time an Israeli Government has used its powers of emergency decree - which do not require parliamentary approval - to take such comprehensive economic measures. **********Failure of Previous Efforts **********What prompted the Government to do so were mounting indications that voluntary wage-price arrangements the national unity Cabinet had worked out with the nation's manufacturers and the Histadrut in the past year had not stemmed the economic deterioration or dampened inflation. **********After having slowed for a few months, inflation was projected to hit a monthly record of 30 percent for June. Meanwhile, foreign currency reserves fell to less than $2 billion in June, well below the $3 billion regarded as a safe minimum. **********Having struggled with the economy for nine months and having unsuccessfully tried to carry out smaller-scale reforms, the Government seemed left with essentially no choice but drastic measures. **********Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said, ''If you want to recover, sometimes you have to undergo surgery, and we have nobody to operate on except the people of Israel.'' **********Washington officials have been pressing Israel to get its economy under control so as not to squander $1.5 billion of emergency economic aid the United States is providing this year. Asked today how he thought the Reagan Administration would react to the economic package, Mr. Modai said, ''They'll love it.'' **********Loss for Labor Estimated **********The same can not be said for Israeli workers. Yisrael Kessar, secretary general of the Histadrut, said laborers would lose more that one-third of their income as a result of the Government's emergency measures. The new package nullifies the three previously negotiated deals between the Government, labor and industry that were enacted by the Knesset and were supposed to run until Aug. 1. **********Mr. Kessar called the emergency decrees ''illegal.'' He said they constituted a ''direct attack on the workers'' and would result only in ''the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.'' He called for new talks between Government and union representatives. **********Union objections, however, did not deter Prime Minister Shimon Peres of the Labor Party. He announced the plan in a nationwide address this morning, declaring that there was ''a danger of economic collapse'' unless something was done soon. **********Criticism Over Inflation **********Before the long Cabinet session -which began at 9 A.M. Sunday and, after a few short timeouts, ended today at about the same time - Mr. Peres had privately threatened to resign if the austerity measures were not adopted. Having been elected last September promising to heal the Israeli economy, Mr. Peres recently encountered heavy criticism because inflation remained unchecked. **********In radio interviews today, shoppers described their reactions, now that the economic ax has fallen. Many expressed a sense of doom. **********''I don't know what I will do,'' said one woman shopper in a Jerusalem supermarket. ''I might not buy anything. Maybe I will just take sausages and eggs because that is the cheapest thing you can survive on. Pretty soon we will be eating rocks.'' **********An older woman in the supermarket told a radio interviewer: ''I don't know how the Government thinks. They fire workers - there is no work - and then they raise prices. What will be the end? What will happen to us? What do they want to do with us?'' **********A Trip to U.S. Is Postponed **********Esther Ben-Gigi, a new immigrant who was scheduled to leave for New York Tuesday on a family visit, said she had had to postpone her trip because of the general strike. **********In addition to today's economic measures, every Israeli leaving the country must pay a $300 travel exit tax, adding to the sense of claustrophobia many people seem to feel. **********''I can't believe it,'' Mrs. Ben-Gigi said. ''I was waiting so long to leave. The scariest thing is that I am starting to not want to come back, and I have no choice.'' **********The new economic package includes these features: *********** The working state budget of about $17 billion will be cut by $750 million. This is in addition to cuts of about $500 million that have already been made. *********** The shekel will be devalued by 18.8 percent - to 1,500 to the dollar from 1,260. *********** After a cost-of-living raise for June that was lower than usual, workers' wages will be frozen for three months by Government emergency decree. Most prices also will be frozen during the same period. Once there has been a significant drop in inflation, prices are to gradually increase. *********** Three percent of the employees in the public sector will be dismissed. This will affect about 9,000 people. *********** There will be a cut in the Government subsidies for some goods, with bread going up 75 percent in price (to 13.5 cents a loaf), dairy products 65 percent and fuel 27 percent. *********** The existing dollar-linked savings accounts will not be touched, but they will become one-way. Withdrawals will be allowed, but no new deposits can be made except in foreign currencies. So it will no longer be possible to deposit shekels in savings accounts and have them linked to the dollar to guard agaist inflation. **********'Ingredients of a Solution' **********The new package has ''the ingredients of a solution for the economy,'' commented Yaacov Fisher, a senior economist for the Bank of Israel, ''but its success will depend on how well it is implemented.'' **********It remains to be seen, he said, whether certain measures in the package may nullify certain other measures, whether the Government's various departments will actually carry out the budget cuts assigned to them and whether the Government will resist pressure from workers. ---- Reaction in Washington WASHINGTON, July 1 - Reagan Administration officials reacted cautiously to the economic package announced by Israel today, but Congressional aides said it could mean faster disbursement of the $1.5 billion of American aid to Israel. **********''They're fairly tough measures,'' said a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member. ''That's the kind of thing people on the Hill have been urging.'' **********''It sounds good if it's implemented,'' said a House Foreign Affairs Committee aide. ''We've been disappointed up to now because the earlier measures are not biting. They tried the gradualist approach, and it doesn't seem to have worked.'' **********''We'll just have to wait and see what happens,'' a State Department official said.

When he was asked whether he was nervous about facing Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Reagan said: **********''Not really, no. Maybe I am relying on past experience. Long before I ever thought I would be in public life in this way, for about 20 years, I did the negotiating for the union of which I was president. I am the first President of the United States who was ever president of a labor union. And I think I know something about negotiating. And I intend to go at it in the same manner.'' **********Mr. Reagan was interviewed by Martin Bell of the British Broadcasting Corporation, Dieter Kronzucker of West Germany's Second Television Network, Giuseppe Lugato of Radio Audizioni Italiano, Claude Smadja of Swiss Television and Jacques Abouchar of Antenne 2, a French television network. **********Not Just to Get Acquainted **********The President expressed optimism about the summit meeting although his advisers say there will probably be no substantive agreements. **********'I don't think this is just a getacquainted meeting, important though that may be,'' the President said. ''I think there are many areas for agreement here. And as I say, I am not pessimistic about them. I think we will sit and face each other and lay our cards on the table as to the fact that they don't like us or our system and we don't like theirs. **********''We are not going to try to change theirs. And they better not try to change ours. But we have to live in the world together. And we are the only two countries that probably could start World War III. We are also the two countries that could prevent World War III from happening.'' **********'Star Wars' to Be Sold at Cost **********On the United States' space-based missile defense program, popularly known as ''Star Wars,'' Mr. Reagan once again ruled out abandoning research. He said his dream was to end reliance on nuclear weapons and to make the missile defense plan available to the Soviet Union. **********''Let me give you my dream of what would happen,'' he said. ''We have the weapon. We don't start deploying it. We get everybody together and we say: 'Here it is. And here is how it works and what it will do to incoming missiles. Now we think that all of us who have nuclear weapons should agree that we are going to eliminate nuclear weapons. But we will make available to everyone this weapon.'' **********''I don't mean we will give it to them. They are going to have to pay for it, but at cost. But we would make this defensive weapon available.'' ----Protests Planned in the U.S.  UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 12 - A coalition of antiwar groups announced plans here today for demonstrations before the summit meeting to protest the missile defense program. **********The coalition, which is called the Stop Star Wars Initiative, plans to protest at universities and companies involved in research, speakers at a news conference said. Protests are planned in 14 cities, including Boston, Detroit, New York, and Washington. **********Ramsey Clark, former Attorney General and a member of the coalition, called the program the ''most expensive and dangerous'' in history.

Cash-settled stock index futures and options have been traded for several years. Nor are they upset that the Amex's gold option is the first on a physical commodity approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. **********What does bother many traders is the system the Amex plans to use. In fact, the Chicago Board of Trade petitioned the commission to outlaw the ''board broker'' system, saying it would undermine the existing method of trading futures and options based on futures. **********Last week, after the Federal regulatory agency approved the Amex plans, the Chicago exchange said it would not pursue its opposition, despite the many reservations it still has. **********The board broker system is a cross between the traditional ''open outcry'' trading method used on commodity exchanges and the specialist system used in the securities markets. **********''We can understand why our board broker system upsets our friends on other commodities markets,'' said Kenneth R. Leibler, senior vice president of the Amex and chairman of its new American Commodities Corporation, which will trade the gold options. **********''Under our system, the market makers on the exchange floor will not be able to trade for their own account, and because there will be no 'dual trading,' any special knowledge that the board brokers may have will be of no use to them,'' Mr. Leibler noted. **********Moreover, the Amex system would leave a clear ''audit trail,'' a most sensitive subject in the commodity markets. It is also a subject that the Federal regulators of commodity trading are scrutinizing. **********An audit trail is a system for recording the timing of trades. Because of the frenzied activity in some of the markets it has become almost impossible for floor traders and brokers to record the times at which trades occur. Last week, in a striking example of the pandemonium that often prevails, a trader in the Chicago Board's volatile Treasury bond futures pit bit another trader who had taken her place, causing a bloody wound, according to several traders who noted that while biting was unusual in this most active of all futures pits, pushing, kicking and elbowing occur routinely. **********Such trading conditions have led to an increasing number of lawsuits by traders and investors claiming they lost money because their orders were not executed in a timely manner or at the prices they wanted. **********Despite all that, the floor traders, who control the commodity exchanges, seem to thrive on the bedlam and many are vehemently opposed to seeing any changes in the way they earn their livelihood. **********And changes there would be under the Amex system. ''Aside from capturing the time-order sequence, the audit trail of our board broker system would also capture bid and asked prices as well as identify the floor broker who executed the order,'' Mr. Leibler said, ''so every trade can easily be reconstructed.'' **********There are no bid and asked prices on commodity exchanges, where trading is a continuous auction. Under the board broker system, all buy and sell orders would be executed in sequence at prices that would stand until matched, bettered or withdrawn, ''regardless of whether the order was for one option or a thousand,'' Mr. Leibler said. He added, ''We regret that some of our friends in the commodity market may be upset by this trading system.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/business/finance-new-issues-110-million-ohio-issue-in-book-entry-form.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " $110 Million Ohio Issue In Book-Entry Form", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;  $110 Million Ohio Issue In Book-Entry Form", "body_text": " **********The Ohio Public Facilities Commission is offering $110 million of bonds, with yields ranging from 5 percent for bonds due in 1986 to 7 percent in 1990, 8 percent in 1995 and 8.70 percent in 2000, through underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. **********Unlike most tax-exempt bonds, which are available in paper certificate form, the Ohio issue is offered only in book-entry form, where records of ownership are maintained electronically. **********To encourage use of a book-entry system, the commission said underwriters would have to pay a fee of $220,000 if they asked that bonds be available in certificate form.

Now another type of tax-exempt security, the municipal lease, is beginning to make an increasingly greater impact on the public. **********A municipal lease is essentially a short-term installment contract used by states, counties and cities to finance the purchase of equipment, which serves as collateral for the loan. This equipment -including sanitation trucks, computers, police cars, fire engines, telecommunications systems and other essential property - typically becomes the property of the municipality at the end of the lease period. An estimated $5 billion worth of these leases are likely to be issued this year, according to the Government Finance Officers Association. **********Among the reasons that state and local governments sometimes utilize leases rather than bonds are that they are not listed on the balance sheet as debt, the financing does not require voter approval and repayments correspond more closely to the useful life of the asset. Furthermore, the size of leasing issues, often below $300,000 and normally less than $1 million, is in most instances smaller than that of bonds. **********In such transactions, the governmental entity is the lessee and a securities firm, bank or other institution is the lessor. Individuals can generally acquire a portion of a particular lease by buying a certificate of participation from a brokerage concern for a minimum of $5,000. Or they can buy shares in a mutual fund that specializes in this field, with an initial payment of at least $2,500. **********''The investment is secured by a first lien on the equipment being financed,'' said Nancy Neuman, first vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities. ''And yields on tax-exempt leases are substantially higher than general obligations of a similar nature.'' **********The return on municipal leases is usually from one-half of one percentage point to three or more percentage points greater than on comparable municipal bonds. Thus the yield from a lease - which is federally tax-free but may be subject to state and local taxes - could range between 7 1/2 percent to more than 10 percent, depending on the entity. **********Such a larger interest rate is due principally to the fact that municipal leases are subject to annual operating budget appropriations by the lessee. On the other hand, general obligation bonds are backed by the faith and credit of the issuer. In addition, since there is a much smaller supply of municipal leases outstanding than municipal bonds, leases are less readily marketable, regardless of the specific risk-reward ratio. **********One of the ways that investors are partly protected against non-appropriation of the money each year to cover rental payments is the insertion of a non-substitution clause in the agreement. With this provision, if no funds are made available, not only can the asset be repossessed by the lessor -which would then usually try to sell or re-lease it -but the lessee is prevented from using an asset that performs the same function for a specified period. **********''Municipal lease obligations are a good way to earn higher returns, but they are buy-and-hold types of investments,'' said Steven Hueglin, executive vice president of Gabriel, Hueglin & Cashman, a New York firm specializing in tax-exempt securities. ''Yet because they are short-term, that's not so much of a problem.'' **********Most of these equipment leases are written for periods of from three to seven years. They are self-liquidating, so that the monthly or semiannual payments to investors include both principal and interest - similar to the procedure with Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, securities. Thus a five-year lease with payments made semiannually has an average maturity of slightly more than three years. **********Since last September, the Tax-Free Municipal Lease Fund of Santa Fe, N.M., has brought the mutual fund concept to municipal leases. It provides diversification, professional management, liquidity and the right to have dividends compounded automatically. In return, fund stockholders pay a sales charge of up to 4 3/4 percent and an annual management fee of three-quarters of 1 percent of assets. **********''We offer a better yield than other short-term investments, but we're not competing against long-term ones,'' said H. Garrett Thornburg Jr., president of the fund. ''And it does not make economic sense to come in and out in a year, because of the sales commission.'' **********With the expected growth of municipal leasing throughout the 1980's, the opportunities for participating in this market are also seen as growing. Therefore many individual investors seeking tax-exempt income could find that kind of financing arrangement another possible alternative to consider."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/26/world/result-is-clouded-in-honduran-vote.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1985-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESULT IS CLOUDED IN HONDURAN VOTE", "print_headline": "RESULT IS CLOUDED IN HONDURAN VOTE", "body_text": " **********With about two-thirds of the votes counted, the ruling Liberal Party appeared to retain this country's presidency today, if the rules set by a new election law are observed. **********But the result is already being debated in the streets and may well be challenged in the courts. **********In a show of emotion and differing interpretations of the results, activists of both the Liberal and National parties filled the streets of the capital tonight waving banners, honking horns and shouting, their candidate had won the presidency. **********The confusion was caused by the new law, which bases the outcome of the vote on the total number of votes for all the candidates of a single party, with the leading candidate of the leading party winning the presidency. **********This system favors the main Liberal Party candidate, Jose Azcona Hoyo. He appears likely to win because he and three other Liberal Party candidates seem to have received the largest number of votes for any one party. **********But when the race is looked at head to head, the leading candidate of the opposition National Party, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, was beating Mr. Azcona by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Mr. Callejas appears to have received about 41 percent of the total vote against 25 percent for Mr. Azcona. **********Liberal Party Leading **********According to unofficial returns provided by the National Elections Tribunal this afternoon, Liberal Party candidates, with 519,394 votes, had won over 51 percent of the presidential vote. National Party candidates had 459,080 votes, or 45 percent. But on an individual basis, Mr. Callejas was far ahead, with 423,040 votes, against 263,870 for Mr. Azcona, the leading Liberal candidate. A total of 1,015,409 votes had been counted out of an estimated 1.5 million cast. **********Since the total vote accumulated by National Party candidates seems likely to be be less than the total vote for the Liberal Party candidates, Mr. Callejas will not win the presidency under the terms of the new electoral law. This raises the paradoxical situation that the apparently most popular individual candidate is about to lose the election. **********The results focused attention on the validity of the election law.

From the anguish in his eyes and the awkward way he rose to his feet, it was plain he was no ordinary doctor. **********What brought Zhao Guomin to the Shanghai Municipal Prison was not medicine but murder. On Dec. 28, 1968, he and four other men beat to death the 38-year-old scientist who was head of the Shanghai Pharmacological Institute in a case that was swallowed up for a time in the general tumult of the Cultural Revolution. **********Now 43 years old, Mr. Zhao has about 18 months of an eight-year prison term still to serve, and he counts himself a lucky man. ''I could have been executed,'' he told a visitor. Tears welled in his eyes as he spoke of his victim's family and of the travails of his own wife and son as they await his return. **********Mr. Zhao's story is one of many in the forbidding edifice at 147 Changyang Street in central Shanghai that have their origin in the ''10 years of calamity,'' as the Cultural Revolution is officially known. When Mao Zedong set out in 1966 to turn Chinese society upside down, he unleashed forces that shattered hundreds of thousands of lives, and the legacy is still felt in every corner of the nation's life. **********A tour of the Shanghai prison is a sobering affair. More than 60 percent of the 3,700 inmates are under 35, men and women who belong to what Chinese call the ''lost generation'' of youth whose education and family life were uprooted when the Cultural Revolution closed schools, set children against parents and licensed mayhem against anybody standing for the established order. **********Cultural Revolution Is Blamed **********''What we have here in many respects are the victims of the Cultural Revolution,'' said Wu Jichen, the prison's deputy governor, as he led a visitor through workshops and classrooms that cluster around granite cell blocks built by the British between 1903 and 1923. ''They belong to a generation that was told by the Gang of Four that education was useless, so they grew up without culture, without any sense of right and wrong.'' **********''What we try to do is to engage in a process of remolding, to try and help the inmates distinguish what is right from what is wrong, what is beautiful from what is ugly, what is lawful from what is not.'' **********Similar accounts have been offered for many years in Chinese jails, but officials acknowledge now that much of what was said in the past was false or at least exaggerated. The picture that has emerged since the ascent of China's current leader, Deng Xiaoping, is one in which the country's vast network of jails and labor camps, indeed the entire legal system, was fatally prejudiced by arbitrariness and brutality. **********Not all of this has changed. In two years, under a crackdown on crime begun by Mr. Deng, thousands of people have been executed, some within days of their offenses. The central authorities' insistence on a broader use of the death sentence has led to thousands of executions since the autumn of 1983, nine in Peking on one day in January alone. Troubling questions remain about the fairness of court procedures, including limited opportunities for defense. **********Greater Effort Visible **********Nonetheless, a visit to the Shanghai prison suggests that greater effort has been made under Mr. Deng to give substance to Mao's instruction that prisons be turned into factories, farms and schools where inmates can prepare for a better life. A visitor passing through workshops where prisoners make clothing, electrical components and ornaments has the impression of generally healthy men and women unafraid to talk about their yearning for life outside. **********The prison sits off a busy street, shielded by a succession of three steel doors, by guards with automatic rifles and by a 20-foot granite wall topped by glass shards. According to Mr. Wu, the deputy governor, sentences range from 20 years to six months, with ''seven or eight'' inmates under suspended death sentences that can be commuted for good behavior after two years. **********The case of Dr. Zhao suggests that there is still much that is arbitrary in the sentencing. As he told it, he was press-ganged into joining an ''investigation team'' that came to the pharmacological institute to press charges of spying against the party secretary. Because torture was to be involved, the team wanted a doctor present, but as things progressed Dr. Zhao became an accomplice in the beating. **********Dr. Zhao said the death was covered up at the time, but the case was reopened at the widow's instigation after the overthrow of the so-called Gang of Four - Jiang Qing, who was Mao's wife, and her associates - in 1976. Two of the five assailants were tried, and Dr. Zhao received the stiffer sentence. After two years at hard labor and two more in another prison, he was assigned to the dispensary. On his release next year, he expects to be reassigned to medical work in Shanghai. **********Song Shows New Attitude **********Against this, other sentences seem relatively severe. Chen Jingcai, conductor of the prison orchestra, is serving a 15-year term for ''molesting women'' while interviewing them for posts with a Shanghai ensemble. Since there is a charge of rape under Chinese law, his offense evidently was less severe. Now he spends his days teaching prisoners the violin, flute and other instruments and rehearsing lusty renditions the ''Ode to Joy'' movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and American songs such as ''Oh! Susanna'' sung with Chinese words. **********Even in the orchestra, prisoners are expected to work at remolding attitudes. Zhao Derong, a former glassmaker serving a four-year term for stealing bicycles, exercises his strong tenor in a prison ballad he composed, ''Don't Worry About Me, Mother.'' In the refrain, he sings of his wish to study hard, learn skills and ''make my contribution to the motherland.'' **********Work is the center of prison life. Inmates labor eight hours a day, six days a week for three yuan, or $1.07, plus monthly bonuses of up to 20 yuan. All are required to attend classes and to work toward at least a junior middle school certificate, the equivalent of 10th grade. Each block has a television set, a library and a Ping-Pong table. A half-hour family visit once a month is permitted, and about a fifth of the prisoners are allowed to go home for a couple of days each year. **********At night, two inmates are locked into each of the cells, which measure about 8 feet by 5 and have steel doors and a sliding peephole that opens from the outside. Bedrolls stacked against the wall are laid on concrete floors. Regulations pinned to the wall forbid discussion of crimes and sentences between cellmates and command them to ''seriously repent'' their wrongdoing. **********According to Mr. Wu, the deputy governor, the last time anybody escaped was in 1975, clinging to the underside of a delivery truck, and he was caught in hours. Although guards are unarmed, officials say none have been attacked in memory. ''What we aim for is to achieve the kind of relationship doctors have with patients,'' said Mr. Wu. ''You can see for yourself, there is no hostility between wardens and prisoners.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/business/business-people-equimark-s-chief-resigns-two-posts.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Equimark's Chief Resigns Two Posts", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Equimark's Chief Resigns Two Posts", "body_text": " **********James D.

Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, said the hearings would start Feb. 27, and that among the first witnesses would be T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who in the past two years has started some of the most heavily fought takeover battles in the oil industry, including the fight for control of Phillips. **********Also scheduled to testify before the subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection and Finance are other prominent figures in recent takeover battles, including William C. Douce, the embattled chairman of Phillips; Frederick H. Joseph, managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager. The subcommittee is a unit of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. **********Legislative Effort **********Last year, it was Representative Wirth who spearheaded a rush effort to amend the Federal securities laws to curb such takeover and anti-takeover practices as ''poison pills,'' ''greenmail'' and ''golden parachutes.'' But the proposed legislation was not taken up by the full House before the 98th Congress went out of session, and Mr. Wirth and others were criticized for attempting to treat the symptoms of the takeover rash and not the fundamental issues. **********''This time we are trying to focus on what the fundamental public policy goals should be, and we want to use the Phillips takeover as a case study,'' David Aylward, the subcommittee's chief counsel and staff director, said yesterday. ''Phillips touches a whole bunch of public policy points,'' he said, most focusing on whether takeover efforts disrupt the economy and discourage companies from making long-term investments. **********Those investments, while often putting a company on surer footing in the long term, can depress its stock price and thus make it more vulnerable to a takeover. As a result, several corporate executives have contended that the current wave of sudden takeover bids will stifle long-term investment. Some investors and economists, however, maintain that the battles simply assure a more efficient use of capital. **********$8.1 Billion Bid **********Phillips is currently battling an $8.1 billion takeover offer from Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier and takeover specialist. Late last week, Mr. Icahn seemed close to raising the $4 billion in cash needed to proceed with the takeover attempt. **********Mr. Icahn, whose name was not on the list of witnesses scheduled to testify next week, could not be located yesterday to comment on the hearings. Representative Wirth was traveling in California and unavailable. A secretary for Mr. Pickens, who made his own run on Phillips late last year, said he was in a meeting. **********Mr. Aylward said yesterday that he doubted the subcommittee would immediately renew its effort to ban particular takeover tactics. ''If you find a particular practice and forbid it,'' he said, ''the quality of minds in this field is such that they come up with another.'' **********Instead, he said, the hearings beginning next week will be the first in a series to determine the longer- term financial impact of takeover efforts. Among the first topics, he said, was the shift to short-term capital - of the kind that would allow Mr. Icahn to find $4 billion in cash so quickly. **********Role of 'Junk Bonds' **********''We really don't know where this money is coming from, and whether it could be better used for something else in the long term,'' Mr. Aylward said. It was for that reason, he said, that the subcommittee was calling Mr. Joseph of Drexel Burnham, the Wall Street firm that has specialized in issuing ''junk bonds'' that have increasingly been used to raise capital quickly for hostile takeovers. Drexel Burnham is serving as Mr. Icahn's investment banker in the fight for Phillips. **********Junk bonds is the term used to describe high-risk, low-rated bonds, usually secured by the assets of the targeted company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/chrysler-plants.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Plants", "print_headline": "Chrysler Plants", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said it would invest $120 million to automate and upgrade its stamping plants in Michigan and Ohio.

This is the first time the benchmark lending rate has been below 10 percent since 1978. **********The drop in the prime rate, to which many loans in the United States and abroad are tied, is expected to stimulate the nation's economy. Also businesses, individuals and debtor nations that are carrying an immense amount of floating-rate debt should find it easier to repay their loans. **********Lower interest rates in the United States could push down the value of the dollar in relation to other currencies, which would help many American businesses. After the prime was cut, the dollar fell sharply in foreign-exchange trading. [Page D17.]  Weakness of the Economy But the prime rate reduction also reflects the economy's current weakness, analysts say. Since last summer, economic activity has virtually stagnated, especially in traditional sectors such as farming and manufacturing. **********This weakness, combined with slowing inflation, has brought the prime rate back down to a single-digit level after seven years. The rate had climbed as high as 20 1/2 percent in 1980 and 1981. Many economists say the prime rate could drop still further in coming months. **********''I think there is an even chance of one more cut in the prime rate -from 9 1/2 percent to 9 percent,'' said Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the investment house. ''So for the next few months I expect we'll be in single-digit prime rate territory. Then it depends on the magnitude of the economic recovery.'' **********Morgan Bank First to Act **********The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company led yesterday's rate cut and was quickly followed by all the other big banks. **********The drop in the prime rate, the second in five weeks, leaves it well below its 12 1/2 percent level of one year ago. **********Economists and traders are now focusing their attention on the likelihood of a cut in the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges on its loans to banks. Most analysts appear to believe the Fed will cut the discount rate before the week is over, to about 7 percent, from its present level of 7 1/2 percent. **********''That's what the markets are vibrating about,'' said Peter Crawford, an economist with Citicorp Information Services in New York. **********He and other economists also noted that the markets are eagerly awaiting tomorrow's ''flash'' estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. If it is low - below an annual rate of about 2 percent - many expect interest rates to drop further. But if it is unexpectedly high, some say the Fed will probably hold off cutting the discount rate. **********Functions of Prime Rate **********Despite its name, the prime rate is no longer what banks charge their best corporate customers. Such companies can negotiate special lower rates or can issue bonds or commercial paper in the financial markets. But smaller businesses and big ones with weak credit ratings still often have to pay the prime rate. **********The prime rate is widely used as a benchmark. A business, for example, might agree to pay ''prime plus one'' - one percentage point above the prime rate, whatever it happens to be. Mortgage or consumer interest rates are sometimes linked to the prime rate, as are some international loans. Generally, however, the prime rate is considered a lagging indicator that follows the credit markets rather than setting the pace. **********David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, a money management firm in Chicago, said the prime rate assumes a broad role today because many businesses, consumers and nations are heavily in debt and frequently pay interest rates that fluctuate as market levels change. **********A 'Self-Correcting Action' **********''The question is, 'What does this do to the economy?' '' said Robert F. Wescott, director of domestic forecasting at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia. ''Is it a reflection of weakness, or does it signal that the economy will pick up? To some extent it is both. It is a self-correcting action.'' **********Bankers and economists noted that the lower prime rate reflects weaker demand for credit, particularly business loans, as well as the lower interest rates that banks themselves must pay. For example, banks typically now pay about 7 3/4 percent interest on six-month certificates of deposit, compared with about 8.9 percent on April 1. **********Lower interest rates could stimulate the American economy not only by encouraging more borrowing but also by lowering the dollar against other currencies. **********When interest rates paid on deposits in the United States decline, foreign investors tend to become less interested in changing their holdings into dollars. If this happens, the result could be weaker demand for dollars and a falling exchange rate. This would help American companies that export goods or compete at home against imports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/30/world/syria-says-israeli-raid-killed-mostly-civilians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Syria Says Israeli Raid Killed Mostly Civilians", "print_headline": "Syria Says Israeli Raid Killed Mostly Civilians", "body_text": " **********Syria said an Israeli air attack in Lebanon early today killed ''a number of inhabitants, mostly women, children and old men.'' **********Lebanese authorities said six Israeli Kfir jets carried out the raid on the Syrian-controlled Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley. **********Israel said its target was a Palestinian base at Bar Elias, 31 miles east of Beirut and 10 miles west of the Syrian border. **********It was Israel's eighth air strike on Lebanese targets this year. **********The police said all six planes dropped balloons to foil heat-seeking SAM-7 and SAM-9 antiaircraft missiles. **********Israel's military command said in Tel Aviv that the planes had hit their target and returned safely. **********The Syrian communique said the Israeli jets were driven off ''by antiaircraft fire when they tried to bomb targets in the Bar Elias area at 6:50 A.M. local time.'' **********Several Syrian-supported radical Palestinian factions have bases in the area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/20/business/about-real-estate-giants-of-the-toy-industry-relocating-in-manhattan.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1985-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 858, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  GIANTS OF THE TOY INDUSTRY RELOCATING IN MANHATTAN", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE;   GIANTS OF THE TOY INDUSTRY RELOCATING IN MANHATTAN", "body_text": " **********For decades two connecting structures at 200 Fifth Avenue and 1107 Broadway have been a mecca for the toy industry's manufacturers and buyers. The buildings, which together are known as the Toy Center, hold the showrooms of a vast majority of the country's toy manufacturers. **********But recently two of the largest toy makers, Hasbro Inc. and Coleco Industries, announced plans to relocate around the corner from the Toy Center in buildings on 23d Street near Fifth Avenue. In separate agreements, the companies signed long-term leases for a total of 112,000 square feet of space in the structures - two light-colored cast-iron buildings that have undergone extensive renovation. **********Coleco will be occupying 44,000 square feet on the top two floors of 28 West 23d Street, and Hasbro has taken 68,000 square feet in the building at 40 West 23d. **********The moves are examples of a further spread in the toy industry's showroom territory. In the early 1970's Mattel Toys moved to Two Penn Plaza, at Seventh Avenue and 33d Street. Since then a handful of other toy makers, among them Mego Toys and CBS Toy Group, have taken space at 41 Madison Avenue, a showroom and office building just across Madison Square Park from the Toy Center at 26th Street, where many gift, glassware and china companies also have showrooms. **********''It will be our new base in New York,'' said Morton Handel, executive vice president of Coleco, speaking from the company's executive offices in West Hartford, Conn. **********''We were very happy in 200 Fifth Avenue and will be sorry to leave,'' he said. ''But our decision was based on the need for more space and more on adjoining floors.'' **********Mr. Handel said the new lease, in addition to providing contiguous space, gives the company an opportunity to redesign its showrooms. **********''We believe we will be able to display our merchandise in a more dramatic way than we had been doing in the Fifth Avenue building,'' Mr. Handel said. The company expects to be in its new space in time for Toy Fair, the week each February when most of the toy buying is done. **********Hasbro's decision to move was also prompted by a space squeeze. After finding expansion within the Toy Center impossible, Hasbro also was forced to move part of its operation at 200 Fifth Avenue to the building at 41 Madison Avenue a few years ago. **********''Our move to 40 West 23d Street gives us the opportunity to combine all of our showrooms under one roof,'' said Stephen D. Hassenfeld, chairman of Hasbro, who said the company had just acquired part of the CBS Toy Group. ''Since we are the largest toy company now, we probably could have gotten away with going to some other part of town. But the space in the 23d Street building is great, and it will be very convenient for the people we do business with.'' **********Workers are now converting the 68,000 square feet on the ground floor and basement levels of 40 West 23d into Hasbro's new showroom and offices. A mezzanine, under construction, will run around the perimeter of the ground floor and add 13,000 square feet to the existing 35,000 square feet there. **********Although the opportunity to expand near the Toy Center was the main reason both manufacturers chose 23d Street, there were financial considerations as well. According to Michael Cohen, a vice president of Williams Real Estate, the brokerage firm that handled the deals, both Hasbro and Coleco will be paying an average of just under $20 a square foot. Renewal leases in the Toy Center, where there is a waiting list for space, are now around $25 a square foot. **********The work under way in both buildings as well as the type of companies that have taken space in them illustrate the changes rippling through that part of Manhattan. Buildings that a few years ago served as workrooms for the needle trades now provide upgraded office space for advertising agencies, architectural and design firms and publishers. **********Owned by a group of investors consisting primarily of employees and principals of Williams Real Estate, the buildings have been undergoing renovations since 1981. The work has included the upgrading of mechanical systems, facades and lobbies. At No. 40, which was built in 1878, an air shaft that extends from the basement through the roof has been turned into a glass-covered atrium featuring new windows with red awnings and black wrought-iron balustrades. **********The toy manufacturers will not be the first new tenants in the renovated space. Earlier this year Kenyon & Eckhardt, the advertising agency, moved into 140,000 square feet on three floors of 40 West 23d Street. The ad agency joined Viking-Penguin Books, which has 35,000 square feet on the fifth floor of the building. Mikasa, the china company, will be moving from 41 Madison into the ground floor and basement of 28 West 23d. Part of the ground floor space will be a retail shop selling the company's overstocked items."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/business/advertising-push-for-outdoor-revival.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising;   Push for Outdoor Revival", "print_headline": "Advertising;   Push for Outdoor Revival", "body_text": " **********AS far as out-of-home media go, here is the picture as seen by Martin J. Mullany, president of Out-of-Home Media Services: Cigarette advertising is stagnant, liquor advertising is slipping, food advertisers are beginning to show an interest and the use by certain Japanese auto makers might reawaken the TV-smitten Detroit crowd. **********But if anything positive is going to happen in the industry, Mr. Mullany said, it is going to be up to the people who run the billboard companies. They have to get their national advertising salespeople out into the marketplace and stimulate interest in the medium, which is something that stopped happening pretty much, he said, after cigarettes were forced out of broadcast advertising and inundated the outdoor industry. **********The 46-year-old executive knows about that. He was in the business at the time and said yesterday that many of the outdoor plant operators dropped their national advertising representives rather than share the easily obtained commissions from cigarette advertising with them. That was about 15 years ago, and now there are not enough salespeople around to keep up interest in outdoor. **********Outdoor is far and away the largest component in out-of-home media, which is made up of billboards, posters and transit advertising. Mr. Mullany has been involved in it as a rep or on the agency side at the William Esty Company and most recently at McCann-Erickson since he left his job as assistant ad manager of the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company, maker of Dixon Ticonderoga pencils. **********In March, Mr. Mullany left McCann for his present job as head of and investor in Out-of-Home Media, a company that he describes as an agency for agencies. **********Because of the large amount of work entailed for the small amount of billings in handling outdoor advertising, most agencies find it more economical to let an outsider place the advertising and verify its use. **********As a matter of fact, Mr. Mullany's company was started in 1960 as a joint venture by a number of ad agencies for just that reason. In 1978 it was purchased by some of its employees and earlier this year Mr. Mullany and George Newman, outdoor plant owner and real estate man, bought it. **********There are 22 employees and the place bills between $25 million and $30 million, with the president expecting to be on the low side this year because of what he sees as a recessionary media trend. **********That situation is not helped by a cutback from the segment of the liquor industry that markets the so-called brown goods - bourbon, rye, Canadian and Scotch. Those are not selling well and are therefore cutting back on their advertising. **********Cigarettes and spirits, which are limited as to what advertising media they can use, are the traditional big users of outdoor. Automotive in the past has also been strong, but the love affair with television by the American auto makers has been eroding outdoor budgets. However, the Japanese makers are not so TV-oriented and they do love outdoor, as a look around the Times Square displays will quickly show. **********Mr. Mullany thinks that successful use of the medium by the Japanese will get Detroit to renew its own use. **********The particularly bright spot in the outdoor sky is a blossoming interest by the food and household products companies, traditionally one of the country's major advertising categories. And while that interest has not been converted to contracts yet, Mr. Mullany thinks it will continue to grow as television audiences continue to erode. **********But such dissatisfied national advertisers will not automatically find their way to the doorsteps of outdoor plant operators. Missionary work from a sales force is needed, Mr. Mullany said. **********The trouble is, he noted, that in the media game the outdoor crowd ''went from operations to finance without ever landing on marketing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/business/economic-scene-signs-of-pickup-in-second-half.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1985-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 930, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene;   Signs of Pickup In Second Half", "print_headline": "Economic Scene;   Signs of Pickup In Second Half", "body_text": " **********DESPITE anxieties about the dollar, and both the budget and trade deficits, the American economy is showing signs of perking up. It now looks as though the second half of this year will be markedly better than the nearly stagnant first half. **********Real gross national product - total output of goods and services adjusted for inflation - rose at an annual rate of just 1 percent during the first half. As many economists see it, the American economy has been in a ''growth recession'' for the past four quarters, during which real G.N.P. has risen by less than 2 percent, well below the economy's potential. **********However, two key indicators have risen smartly, it was announced this week. The index of leading indicators climbed by 1 percent in June, the best gain in five months. And factory orders, buoyed by rising demand for military hardware, jumped 1.9 percent in June. **********At the same time, inflation and inflationary expectations, at least for the near term, are at a low ebb. The Consumer Price Index rose by only two-tenths of 1 percent in June. Collective bargaining contracts during the first half provided for an average increase of just 2.8 percent, and, with productivity growing, there should be little wage pressure on employers to raise prices. **********Belief in a second-half pickup rests on more than upticks in the leading indicators. Although real G.N.P. grew by only 1.9 percent during the past four quarters, final sales - a measure of the economy's output after deducting the change in business inventories - actually rose by 2.9 percent during that period. In the April-June quarter of 1985, final sales grew by an annual rate of 5.1 percent. **********The sluggishness of the economy in 1984 and the first half of 1985 has in large degree been due to a big reduction in the rate of inventory accumulation. In the first quarter of 1984, business was building stocks at an annual rate of $73.8 billion. By the second quarter of 1985, business had brought its rate of stock-building down to $12.6 billion. At a steady rate of inventory accumulation, G.N.P. would have been $60 billion higher in the second quarter of this year. **********That drag from slowing the rate of inventorying should now be about over. In the second half of this year, if the final demand for goods and services holds at the level of the past year, business is, in fact, likely to increase the rate of inventory accumulation to $25 billion or $30 billion in each quarter. Hence, instead of subtracting from gross national product, inventory building is likely to cause G.N.P. to increase faster than final sales in the second half of this year. **********The second major drag on United States economic growth in the past year and a half has been the worsening trade deficit. In the first quarter of 1984, net exports - exports minus imports - ran $51.5 billion in the red. In the second quarter of this year, the gap between exports and imports was $91.1 billion, as final demand held up but Americans bought more and more goods from abroad. **********With the decline of the dollar by 10 percent to 15 percent since early this year, making American goods more competitive, the drag on domestic output should lessen as the year wears on. **********The economy's performance during the past year looks even less sluggish if one breaks down final sales, as George R. Perry of the Brookings Institution has done, into domestic final sales - final sales to domestic users - and net sales to and from foreigners. Domestic final sales rose by 4.2 percent during the past four quarters, and by a robust 6.4 percent in the second quarter of 1985. If domestic final sales continue to rise at anywhere near their recent rate, the G.N.P. seems sure to rise faster in the second half of this year than in the first. **********To be sure, not all sectors of the American economy are yet out of the woods, or will be by the end of this year, as export- and import-competing industries continue to be plagued by the overstrong dollar, weak commodity prices and intense world competition. **********The Agriculture Department reported this week that some 214,000 American farms - 12 percent of the 1.7 million farms covered in the survey - are in danger of bankruptcy. The department also reported that among commercial-sized farms -those with sales of $40,000 or more a year - one out of three is in severe financial straits. Sixty percent of the financially ailing farms are in the Corn Belt, Great Lakes States and northern Plains. Pressure is building on Congress and the Administration to rescue the threatened farms. **********And there is strong pressure from other interest groups - and the Administration - on the Federal Reserve to keep the economy growing. During the past year, the Fed's willingness to let the money supply grow well above its targets did much to prevent the inventory adjustment and widening trade deficit from producing an all-out recession instead of just a growth recession. **********With G.N.P. likely to grow faster in the second half, the Fed appears to be trying to throttle back monetary growth and hold interest rates about where they are. Its slogan seems to be: ''Neither slump nor boom.'' For the near term, that is the most probable outcome. **********This looks like a good time to take a vacation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/05/business/finance-new-issues-merrill-lynch.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Merrill Lynch", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Merrill Lynch", "body_text": " **********Merrill Lynch & Company is offering $250 million of 9 3/4 percent, five-year notes at a price of par, to yield 9.75 percent, or 59-hundredths of a percentage point more than Treasury notes of similar maturity.

Some listened to the orations on the Tirana radio, which usually intersperses some sophisticated cultural programming with music, which has included a song called, ''Forty Years of Building Socialism in the Countryside.'' **********But despite assertions from emigre groups in the West, there were no student demonstrations in this fast-rising city, where bank buildings tower over old minarets and cast shadows over an Oriental market. No new graffiti appeared in this Kosovo province city, 150 miles south of Belgrade, to extol Mr. Hoxha, who was 76 years old. **********And there were no cries of ''Kosova Republic,'' cries that have sent several hundred young people to prison, creating legions of contemporary martyrs in this society of families linked in clans. **********Concern Beneath the Calm **********But beneath the appearance of calm, there was evidence of deep concern. No one in authority wanted to speak to a visitor about the situation, at least not without guarantees of anonymity. **********A Communist League meeting here on the day of the funeral took up the issue of Yugoslav territory that was once Albanian. And both here and in Belgrade there is little doubt that the Kosovo problem, as it is called, is second only to the sagging economy as a national concern. **********''To tell you the truth, I was surprised that things were so quiet,'' said Miso Kikovick, a reporter for a Belgrade paper who is based in Pristina. ''I worked until 1 in the morning, and there was absolutely nothing to report.'' **********He said his expectations of some protest, however mild, were heightened because the death of the Albanian leader a scant 100 miles away coincided roughly with the fourth anniversary of student riots, in which local Albanians say more than 200 people were shot to death by the police. The Government says only nine people were killed in the disorders, which began when university students protested over cafeteria food. **********Whatever the death toll, the disorders impressed on all Yugoslavia that the growing consciousness of the ethnic Albanians, coupled with often vague political stirrings, was posing severe problems for this federation of precariously balanced national groups. **********Reviving a Balkan Nightmare **********In all six republics, the largely inchoate yearnings for a new Albanian nation straddling an international border prompted revivals of the gravest Balkan nightmare, fragmentation. **********The echoes of that fear were evident in the party meeting here on the day of the funeral. As reported in the local press, speaker after speaker, Albanians and Serbs, discussed the problem of territory that was formerly Albanian. Some of the delegates to the meeting chastised local officials for failing to stem hay-burnings and gravestone topplings, which they said have accelerated the panicky flight of Serbs and Montenegrins from the region. **********Other speakers condemned these acts but said that they were really quite rare and that in fact the departure of the Serbs from the autonomous province of Kosovo was not the result of vandalism. Rather, they said that the Serbs' departure was a result of a perception of diminishing fortunes, and that one population was growing uneasy and leaving as another was growing assertive and more numerous. **********Though different views were expressed at the party meeting, the consensus endorsed the party line, which calls for a tough stance against expressions of nationalism. The party line also appeals for full republic status and generous spending in Kosovo in a revenue-sharing program under which the wealthier republics invest in the province, Yugoslavia's poorest region. **********The underlying assumption appears to be that money and new constructions will enhance economic integration with the rest of Yugoslavia, and that the nationalistm may then subside. **********From Village to Bustling City **********This city itself stands as testimony to these policies. A huge newspaper office, towering banks and a large hotel stand in what was essentially a village a decade ago. In the center is the university, which, with 26,000 students, is the third largest in Yugoslavia. **********One professor said most of the students were children of peasants, who were often illiterate. Most study Albanian literature, language and history. he said. The local economy cannot absorb them, he added, and the large numbers of educated, nationalistic and unemployed youth would be a combustible mixture even if there were no nation across the border that could play on these frustrations. **********None of the young people encountered in Pristina's coffee houses appeared to have any sympathy for the Government of Mr. Hoxha or for his successor, Ramiz Alia, who in his funeral oration pledged to continue the the isolation of Mr. Hoxha's rule and the policy of considering hopelessly revisionist Communism as it is practiced in the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia. **********''We know there is no freedom there,'' a young man said over a Turkish coffee, ''that the churches and mosques have been shut and that perhaps 60,000 people have been killed. But we also know that the people there are our brothers. Like us, they are Albanian.'' **********Cultural issues tend to dominate over economic expectations. ''You have to understand,'' said Idris Aieti, the director of Kosovo's Institute of Albanian Studies, ''the Albanians are a very old people with roots to the ancient Illyrians. But in modern terms, they are a very young nation. Only since the second world war are we experiencing the rebirth that other European nations went through in the 19th century.'' **********Stirred by Poetry **********Just before the Hoxha funeral, there was a poetry contest in which young Albanians recited their original sagas. Several used the partisan struggle in World War II as their theme. But according to one young man who was present, every time the word partisan - a hallowed Yugoslav term - was used, the audience understood it to refer to one of the men or women who are in prison for advocating the notion of greater self-government. **********A foreigner who has close ties to the young says he is convinced that the overwhelming number of the young still want that self-government to be within the framework of Yugoslavia. **********He noted that the authorities in Belgrade were lucky that the Tirana Government was rigid, because if it grew milder nationalist feelings of ethnic Albanians who live in Yugoslavia might well become stronger. **********That is not the way things are seen in Belgrade.

The 1,150 inmates included people regarded here as notorious terrorists. **********But Mr. Rabin asserted in an interview that Israel did not have a military option for rescuing the three captured soldiers because the men were being held just outside Damascus, the Syrian capital. **********To get them out would have involved an ''all-out military operation in Damascus, in a way war with Syria,'' the Defense Minister said. **********At the same time, Mr. Rabin said, there was no reason to believe that had Israel held out longer, it could have struck a better deal - in fact, he said, the price might have gone up. **********And to have simply left the men languishing in captivity, Mr. Rabin said, would have run contrary to all the traditions of the Israeli Army and the Government. **********In a one-hour interview at his Tel Aviv office, Mr. Rabin explained in detail the considerations behind the prisoner trade.

They are held by terrorists in a place where I can't release them by force,' and then I do nothing.'' **********But given the fact that they were being treated well, Mr. Rabin was asked, didn't the possibility of holding out for a better bargain outweigh the dangers of letting so many hardened killers free? **********''No one could know for sure that they would not be finished off,'' Mr. Rabin answered.

But their rapid growth and public acceptance in the Treasury, municipal and corporate bond fields have tended to overshadow some of the dangers involved in buying these securities. **********In contrast to conventional bonds that pay interest periodically during the year, a zero coupon bond pays no current interest, but instead is issued at a very large discount from face value. When redeemed at maturity, the zero coupon pays the accumulated compounded interest in a lump sum. The interest rate at the time of purchase is thereby locked in for the entire term of the security. **********However, there are a number of risks to weigh when considering a zero. Even many ardent proponents of this investment product acknowledge that it is not appropriate for all investors, particularly those who may have to, or want to, sell before the bond is due. One key reason: Such bonds are normally more volatile than comparable conventional bonds, because their prices are more affected by changes in interest rates. **********In addition, if you decide to dispose of a zero coupon bond before maturity, you might find that the secondary market is neither as active nor as deep as it is when trading conventional, or current coupon, securities. With fewer bidders in the marketplace, your bond is therefore less liquid, and the market price is likely to be lower. **********''You can't compare the markets,'' said Roy G. Beck, president of Ryan, Beck & Company, an investment banking firm based in West Orange, N.J. ''There is an opaque marketplace with zeros, and you cannot routinely check the value. And you can't follow a zero the same way you can follow a Treasury bond that is traded every minute of the day.'' **********Then, too, dealer markups on zeros sold to individuals are usually high. And since the bonds are marketed on a net basis after computing the markup, it is hard for investors to calculate this charge built into the purchase price. **********There is also the risk, posed by inflation, in holding a long-term issue with a fixed rate. Zero coupon bonds generally fit into that category. In contrast, short-term investors are much better able to guard against inflationary pressures that may arise. **********This means that the potential loss of purchasing power is much greater with zero coupon bonds than with conventional bonds. For when inflation rises, nominal interest rates usually rise as well. And future cash interest payments - available with conventional bonds, but not with zero coupon bonds -can then be reinvested at higher rates. **********''Zero coupon bonds are the ultimate discount bonds,'' noted Thomas J. Taylor, vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company. ''The more of a discount you get and the longer out you go, the more vulnerable you are to interest rate changes.'' **********Another factor to consider with Treasury and corporate zero coupon bonds is that holders must pay Federal income tax on the imputed interest every year, although they receive no cash payments. That is because the difference between the bond's issue price and maturity price is deemed to be interest by the Internal Revenue Service, even though actual cash does not change hands until maturity. And the tax burden grows annually, because this so-called phantom interest increases as compounding continues. **********Even holders of federally tax-exempt municipal zero coupon bonds could be faced with an annual liability for state income taxes, if the securities are issued in a state other than the one where they live. Of course, when the bonds are held in a tax-deferred account - like an individual retirement or Keogh account - there is no current taxation of the imputed interest. **********Moreover, most purchasers who acquire a zero coupon bond normally do so simply by getting in touch with one dealer and accepting whatever is in that firm's inventory. As a result, they may not necessarily obtain the same competitive market rate of interest that they would get by shopping around among three or four dealers for the best possible price. **********''It's the old story,'' Mr. Beck said. ''When you're paying 30 cents for something that is going to be worth $1, you assume it's a great fire sale. But it may not be, because the bond is offered at 20 cents by someone else.'' **********Awareness of the risks, though, should not preclude buying zero coupon bonds under certain circumstances. They are typically priced for the budgets of small investors, with many available in denominations of $2,000 or so. They require no reinvestment decisions or coupon-clipping during their term. And they can be ordered so that they will mature at a price and a time convenient to personal requirements. **********Thus those looking for a relatively passive investment might find a zero coupon bond an attractive alternative. Nevertheless, the potential dangers that a buyer may have to face should be understood before any such transaction is completed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/17/world/a-larger-force-of-latin-rebels-sought-by-us.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1985-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 864, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A LARGER FORCE OF LATIN REBELS SOUGHT BY U.S.", "print_headline": "A LARGER FORCE OF LATIN REBELS SOUGHT BY U.S.", "body_text": " **********The White House, pressing for $14 million in aid for Nicaraguan rebels, has told Congress that it wants to expand the insurgent forces to put more pressure on the Nicaraguan Government. **********A document sent to two Congressional committees said the Administration had for now ruled out ''direct application of U.S. military force,'' but warned that this course ''must realistically be recognized as an eventual option, given our stakes in the region, if other policy alternatives fail.'' **********Publicly, President Reagan has given no indication of any plan to expand guerrilla forces.

Publicly, negotiations are being cast as the first priority. But the document also contended that only the direct pressure brought by expanded rebel forces fighting on Nicaragua's northern and southern borders could force the Sandinistas to accept United States demands. **********''Assistance provided to the Nicaraguan democratic opposition will be structured so as to increase the size and effectiveness of its insurgent forces to a point where their pressure convinces the Sandinista leadership that it has no alternative but to pursue a course of moderation,'' including major political concessions, the White House report said. **********The President's ''determination,'' or official request and justification to Congress for funds, set out the objective of resuming aid ''at levels sufficient to create real pressure on the Government of Nicaragua (20,000- to 25,000-man insurgent force in the north and 5,000- to 10,000-man force in the south).'' **********Administration officials now estimate that the Nicaraguan Democratic Force has 15,000 guerrillas fighting from bases in Honduras on Nicaragua's northern border and that the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance has 5,000 guerrillas fighting along Nicaragua's southern border with Costa Rica. **********Presenting the rationale for the Administration strategy of aiding Nicaraguan rebels, the White House document contended that the alternative would be an expensive and doubtful strategy of ''containment'' against Nicaragua. The containment strategy, it asserted, could raise the cost of American economic and military aid programs in Central America from a current level of $1.2 billion a year to $4 billion to $5 billion a year ''for the immediate future.'' **********''The containment approach is obviously deficient in that it is passive and does not contemplate changes in Sandinista behavior,'' the White House said. ''Only major direct pressure can induce change.'' **********The report, titled ''U.S. Support for the Democratic Resistance Movement in Nicaragua,'' listed guidelines for the ''management of the program,'' including ''a small U.S. advisory team'' that would ''maintain direct contact'' with Nicaraguan rebel leaders. **********Although Congressional sources have said that in the past some American Central Intelligence Agency agents had entered Nicaragua with rebel groups, the latest White House document pledged that C.I.A. staff members and contract personnel would not enter Nicaragua or ''participate in military or paramilitary operations of any kind.'' **********''U.S. presence will be limited to a small group of C.I.A. advisers outside Nicaragua whose function will be to provide intelligence, limited tactical advice based on that intelligence and logistical guidance,'' the document said. **********It said the requirements for Congressional action had left the aid program ''hardly covert.'' But it added that in order to ''keep the U.S. profile as low as possible,'' the C.I.A. would make ''maximum'' use of ''cooperative arrangements with third countries,'' evidently meaning Honduras, Costa Rica and possibly El Salvador. **********The White House put out a 16-page declassified version of the document today. It contained some of the same general material but excised any references to expanding the guerrilla forces, the C.I.A. operations or the role of third countries. **********Roughly $80 million in formerly covert aid to the rebels, channeled through the C.I.A., was cut off by the House last May. A later effort to revive it was delayed by Congress last fall, setting up votes this spring. **********The first Congressional action will come Thursday at hearings of the defense appropriations subcommittees of both houses.

One, he said, was the continuing existence in the remote region where the borders of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay meet of a substantial colony of German settlers whose sympathy for Hitler's Germany endures. **********The other, according to Mr. Harel, is the desolate nature of the region and the innate suspicion even of the indigenous population toward outsiders not known to them. **********''By 1961 we had very sound information on Mengele,'' he recalled. ''We were after him twice in Paraguay in 1962, in Asuncion and Encarnacion, where the three countries meet. On another occasion we knew he was at a location in the jungle of Brazil, 25 miles from Sao Paulo. He moved from country to country and always vanished into strongholds in German-owned establishments, where he was protected.'' **********A Yiddish-language newspaper of March 1947, preserved in the library of Yad Vashem, the Jerusalem memorial institution for the Jewish victims of the Nazis, indicates that at that time Dr. Mengele was believed to be under arrest in Vienna. **********Arrest by U.S. Reported **********The newspaper, Unser Wort, published by and for survivors of the Nazi period then living as ''displaced persons'' in the Western-occupied zones of Germany, called on readers with knowledge of Dr. Mengele's crimes to offer their testimony. **********The West German magazine Der Spiegel reported last month, without citing its source, that the 1947 arrest had been made by the American Army Counterintelligence Corps.

Harry R. Hughes, invoking emergency powers, tonight ordered the 102 privately insured savings and loan institutions in Maryland to limit depositors' withdrawals to $1,000 a month. **********The Governor acted to stem a run on deposits started last week by allegations of fraud at Maryland's second-largest thrift institution. His action comes three months after a similar crisis temporarily shut down Ohio's privately insured thrift industry. **********The Governor also said he would convene an emergency session of the Maryland Legislature Friday at which he would seek sweeping powers, including the right to declare a full bank holiday, to preserve the state's financial system. **********New Insurance Proposed **********The Governor said the $1,000 limit would remain in force until all privately insured thrift institutions that were eligible had received Federal deposit insurance. To protect deposits at institutions too small to qualify for Federal deposit insurance, the Governor will propose a new state-backed insurance company, his aides said. **********These steps would effectively mark the end of the Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation, a private concern not backed by the state, that has until now insured $7.2 billion in deposits at the 102 state-chartered institutions. **********Other Institutions Unaffected **********Today's moves do not affect commercial banks or savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. **********In a packed anteroom outside his office here at the State House, Mr. Hughes said he ordered the $1,000 monthly limit because the run on deposits that began last week at the Old Court Savings and Loan Association of Baltimore had spread to other Maryland thrift units. **********Late yesterday, after Old Court and another Baltimore thrift institution, the Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan Association, were placed under the protection of conservators, Mr. Hughes urged depositors not to panic. Today, however, other Maryland thrift institutions also experienced runs on deposits. **********''It was a step I did not want to take,'' Mr. Hughes said of his decision to place Merritt into conservatorship Monday night. ''But with the continued erosion of the S.&L. industry, it has become necessary to do it.'' **********According to the Governor, the $1,000 limit would apply to all forms of withdrawals: at teller windows, electronically or by checks. **********Although the limit could significantly disrupt business in the state, Mr. Hughes, who has barely slept since the savings crisis began, said the limit was necessary to prevent ''the roof from falling in.'' **********To help institutions meet the capital requirements for Federal insurance, Maryland will lend them money. In return, the state will receive from the institutions ''convertible debentures'' -i.o.u.'s that can be exchanged for common stock. **********With this extra financing, the majority of to 102 privately insured units should be able to qualify for Federal coverage, and the Governor said he expected many would receive protection within days. **********At the State Office Building in Baltimore tonight, the Governor's chief of staff, the director of the Maryland saving and loan division and representatives of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board met with more than 100 executives of the privately insured institutions to instruct them on applying for Federal insurance. Two hundred Federal bank examiners arrived in Maryland today to facilitate this process, with 150 more expected. **********For institutions with assets of $25 million or less, the Governor will seek to create the new insurance company. Mr. Hughes said that, like Maryland's private insurer, the new company would protect deposits up to $100,000 per account. The Governor said he would ask the Legislature to finance the new venture by issuing general-obligation bonds. **********Earlier today, anxious depositors again lined up outside branches of Old Court, which itself has faced withdrawal limits since it was placed under conservatorship late Sunday. Private guards regulated customer traffic into the institution's downtown Baltimore office, and customers created their own number system to assure their places in line. **********But it was clear by this morning that the run on Old Court had spread. At a suburban Baltimore branch of the Custom Savings and Loan Association, more than 60 people lined up early to withdraw their funds. And at the downtown Baltimore branch of the Fairfax Savings and Loan Association, savers lined up 12 deep to close out their accounts. The police said lines had also formed at numerous thrift units in Towson, a bedroom community north of Baltimore. **********Governor Hughes said that, all told, Maryland thrift institutions had lost $630 million in deposits in the last two months, $116 million of which was lost yesterday. He also disclosed that four more privately insured thrift units had voluntarily sought the protection of a conservator today, although he did not name them. **********Sources close to the Governor said that the Sharon Savings and Loan Association and the John Hanson Saving Association Inc. inquired early today about the procedure for entering conservatorship. But late tonight, neither appeared to have filed. **********Depositors interviewed before the Governor acted today expressed differing amounts of concern about the savings crisis. Some, such as M. Pamela Callahan, who lives in Philadelphia but maintains an account at Fairfax Savings, actually made deposits today. **********''What these people are doing can only worsen the situation,'' Miss Callahan said, pointing to depositors waiting for a teller at Fairfax. ''It can only destroy a good institution.'' **********But others were worried. Bruce V. Dunlap of Cockeysville, Md., accompanied his daughter to the downtown Fairfax branch so she could close her account. ''She's afraid of losing it,'' Mr. Dunlap said. Others sensed, rightly, that Governor Hughes would restrict withdrawals from all privately insured thrift units. Benjamin Goodman of Baltimore, for instance, raced to Fairfax Savings today because he wanted to make sure that he would have money available for a down payment on a house. **********''When the Governor announced that Merritt Savings was taken over, I came here,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''If they do the same thing to this bank -the $1,000-a-month limit - I'm in a bind.'' **********But an aide to the Governor said tonight that exemptions to the withdrawal limit might be granted. **********Savers at Old Court may face even more problems. In his court papers requesting a conservator for Old Court, Maryland Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs accused the institution of numerous violations of the private insurance corporation's regulations. This raised the possibility of losses that might not be fully reimbursed. **********For example, under the regulations, a thrift may not put more than 40 percent of its deposits in commercial loans, construction loans or loans to develop raw land. Yet at March 31, Old Court's percentage was roughly 70 percent, according to the papers. **********Similarily, the regulations say a thrift must maintain net worth equal to at least 4.66 percent of its deposits as of Dec. 31 of the prior year. Yet at March 31, Old Court reported its percentage at 3.19 percent, the papers said. **********''Even the net worth as reported by Old Court to the Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation may be significantly overstated,'' Mr. Sachs charged. **********The Attorney General also accused Old Court of numerous violations of Maryland savings and loan law. He cited examinations of Old Court's books by the state Division of Savings and Loan Associations, by the thrift unit's auditors and by the insurance corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/03/business/technology-bugs-that-make-plastics.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1985-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology;   'Bugs' That Make Plastics", "print_headline": "Technology;   'Bugs' That Make Plastics", "body_text": " **********WHEN humans eat a lot of sugar, they put on fat. When Alcaligenes eutrophus and some other forms of bacteria indulge in sweets, they fill up with beads of polyester. **********This biological curiosity could lead to sweeping changes in how plastics and synthetic fibers that incorporate polyesters are produced and used. It is for this reason that Imperial Chemical Industries' agricultural division has spun off a ''plastics-from-bugs'' research and development program, which seemed too small to pursue internally and too promising to forget, into a venture named Marlborough Biopolymers Ltd. **********''There's no doubt that there will someday be a large commodity market for this,'' said John Adsetts, the 41-year-old ICI executive who became Marlborough's managing director when it was set up here in northeast England two years ago. ''We're here to keep the technology alive and growing.'' **********As a thermoplastic, the bacteria-produced material, called Biopal, can be processed into strips, filaments, chips, panels and powders. It can also be used as an intermediate stage in the formation of other useful chemical products and, because of its structure, blended with other plastics. **********Mr. Adsetts believes that the first Biopol products will reach the market within two years, if all goes smoothly. But he declines to speculate about what they will be. **********The plastic, which is biodegradable, has special allure for health care companies, which are investigating it as a substitute for sutures, as a temporary scaffolding for new tissue growth in wounds and as a replacement for cotton swabs (which have sometimes been left in patients during operations, with disastrous effects). It might also be used to make capsules that would slowly release anything from drugs in a human or farm animal, to insecticides in a field, thus saving application costs and allowing more moderate doses. **********Marlborough expects Biopol's first applications in industrialized countries to be in specialized markets that ICI would not have bothered to develop. **********The idea of producing plastic from bacteria feeding on renewable resources, such as sugar, first captured ICI's fancy during the 1970's, when rising oil prices and declining reserves had chemical executives worried about their dependence on oil and gas feedstocks. As the energy crises of the 1970's gave way to an oversupply of oil in the 1980's, the immediate appeal of a bacteria-based insurance policy waned. **********However, ICI was reluctant to let the project die, as New York-based W.R. Grace & Company had done with an earlier research program in the 1960's. The oversupply of oil could not last forever, ICI reasoned. With the world's most-advanced fermentation system for growing the bacteria, ICI expected breakthroughs if the project were pursued. Researchers had already advanced the science of recovering the plastic from the bacteria and had developed a way to make the bacteria produce a more desirable polyester chain than the one they normally made. Biopal, the new chain, was less stiff and much tougher. **********In 1983 a decision was made to spin off Biopol and related research into a separate entity - Marlborough Biopolymers - with ICI holding a 75.1 percent stake, and Marlborough Teeside Management, a local venture capital and management development concern, holding the rest. To reduce Marlborough's accounting and tax burdens, Mr. Adsetts and his 12-member staff remain on ICI's payroll and work for the technically employee-less Marlborough on contract. **********However peculiar its structure, Marlborough convinced chemical, pharmaceutical and health care companies in the United States, Japan and Europe to support the research and development of Biopol, a program that had been costing ICI about $1.2 million annually. There are now some 150 people around the world working on Biopol, and Marlborough expects research contracts and sales of samples to allow it to finish the year slightly in the black, on revenues of about $500,000. **********The attraction for Marlborough's research partners is the promise of exclusive rights to resulting products. Such contracts are usual for small companies, such as Marlborough, that are developing new technologies, but they are rare in direct dealings between large multinationals. In effect, the multinationals are getting the fruits of ICI technology along with a deal they could not expect from ICI itself. **********Marlborough and ICI executives decline to name any of the companies with which they have agreements, but Paul Holmes, the ICI technical officer who oversaw the Biopol program until a recent promotion, said: ''ICI's Tokyo office has been inundated with requests for the material.'' **********Recently, Marlborough has devoted increasing attention to making less pure forms of Biopol in developing countries, for products such as fertilizer bags. To do this, it would using cheap molasses as a feedstock and less sophisticated fermentation plants than ICI has built in nearby Billingham."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/business/busines-digest-friday-december-13-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINES DIGEST: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINES DIGEST: FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1985", "body_text": " **********Companies G.E. said it could take a year to complete its merger with RCA.

W. Botha. Like many other people, the banker had expected Mr. Botha to be conciliatory and indicate that his Government would change its racial policies. **********But the banker was stunned - more by what he saw as Mr. Botha's pugnacious tone than by the words themselves. The banker turned to his wife and said, ''There's financial trouble ahead.'' **********Indeed there was. As weeks went on, more and more banks, fearful that racial tension would undermine the South African economy, refused to lend new money or renew maturing loans to any South African borrower. It caused a plunge in the value of the rand, South Africa's currency, and eventually forced the Pretoria Government earlier this month to take the drastic step of forbidding South African companies to repay billions of dollars of principal on their foreign debt for the rest of the year. **********Bankers, still shaken by the experience, are asking how the South African situation could have deteriorated so quickly before they had a chance to get their money out. **********A picture of what went wrong has been coming into focus. Interviews with bankers around the world show that the problems had been developing for some time but that there were some critical turning points, including these: *********** A surge in borrowing from abroad by South Africa's private sector that began about three years ago. *********** Worldwide coverage of growing civil unrest over the country's racial policies. *********** A shifting by major international banks of their South African loans to smaller banks, beginning last fall. *********** The widely publicized decision by the Chase Manhattan Bank in late July to stop all lending to South Africa. *********** President Botha's speech, made in late August, which shattered hopes of a voluntary easing of the nation's racial policies. **********What makes the crisis so unusual is that South Africa's economy was robust, the Government's coffers were full and the country's trade position was strong. Never in recent history, in fact, has a country so economically sound defaulted and risked a cut-off of credit for years to come from the very banks that are its financial link to the rest of the world. **********Bankers say the story began about three years ago when a tight monetary policy at home encouraged South African companies to borrow overseas where interest rates were much lower. But it was only a year or so ago, as racial disturbances were increasing and coming to world attention, that most international banks began to realize just how great South Africa's debt burden had become. **********Last fall, for example, the executive in charge of a major New York bank's African business took one of the bank's top officers to meet clients in Johannesburg. **********The senior banker did not like what he saw. He found that over the previous three years South African commercial banks had borrowed heavily abroad. The borrowings consisted mainly of short-term loans that had to be repaid in a few months. But the banks used the proceeds for making longer-term loans to South African companies. In banking, such a practice is considered a classical error. **********Specter of Credit Squeeze **********If South Africa's creditors suddenly decided not to renew those short-term loans, the borrowing banks could not quickly get repayment from their customers, who had borrowed on a long-term basis. And with racial disturbances spreading, the New York banker realized that political problems could touch off a financial crisis. **********At a meeting with Finance Minister Barend du Plessis, the New York banker warned that South Africa had a ''tremendous vulnerability'' as a result of its debt situation. **********The New York bank began reducing its lending to South Africa. Caution also spread among other banks. Bernard Shuttleworth, chief financial economist for the Standard Bank in South Africa, said he believes that ''foreign banks had become increasingly nervous after September 1984.'' He said, ''It was then that they began looking at us far more carefully.'' **********Most of South Africa's traditional creditors, such as the North Carolina National Bank, began cutting back then on loans to South Africa. A spokesman for the North Carolina bank said it reduced its loans there from $217 million at the end of 1983 to $101 million this June. **********Loan Participations Sold **********Among banks in the United States, Citibank remains the one with more loans outstanding in South Africa than any other. **********Many banks began reducing their exposure on loans in South Africa by selling participations to other banks. This sharing of the loans was not always apparent to the borrowers. **********In some cases, instead of telling the South Africans of the credit cutbacks, large American banks began selling pieces of their South African loans to other, less informed banks around the world - especially in Japan. **********The big New York banks liked this procedure not only because it helped reduce their exposure to South African debt but also because they could make a profit on the transactions. If the bank were earning three-fourths of a percentage point over its own cost of funds, it would try to sell a participation in the loan at a yield of only one-half point above the cost of funds - keeping one-fourth percentage point for itself. **********''If you have four or six banks brokering South African loans, you might have as much as $1 billion in participations out there,'' said a New York banker. ''Those participations were held by banks with the weakest knees.'' He added that they were the first to ''cut and run'' last August after Chase's decision. **********Impact on Economy Feared **********In March the Bank of Boston, a large regional bank, announced that it would cease all lending to South Africa. Ira Stapanian, the bank's president, said last week that the bank feared it might lose business at home because of its dealings with South Africa but that the main reason for the cutback was fear that racial problems would destabilize its economy. **********The bankers had to deal with economic problems, which they believed could be managed. At the same time, however, they faced political problems that made it impossible to focus only on economic reality. **********While they worried that increasing violence in South Africa might destroy the country's economy, making repayment of the loans impossible, they also had to worry about the domestic repercussions of doing business with South Africa amid increasing public antagonism in the United States and Europe toward the Pretoria Government. Bankers said the news media, especially television with its almost daily vivid accounts of rioting, played a key role. **********A South African banker said, ''If there were no television, there would be no crisis.'' **********Chase's Decision to Stop **********As racial tension mounted, the Chase Manhattan Bank decided in late July to cease all lending to South Africa. Financial sources in Johannesburg say the decision was made by Willard C. Butcher, Chase's chairman. Chase refuses to comment on the issue or even to acknowledge that it changed its policy. **********Word of the decision spread in South Africa as Chase's officers told their clients of the new policy. South African companies began unloading the rand. One reason was that if foreign banks refused to renew maturing loans there would be a run on rands as borrowers converted them to repay in the original currency. **********To find out if the reports about Chase were true, Gerhard de Kock, head of South Africa's central bank, telephoned Mr. Butcher in New York, according to banking sources. Sitting in his 17th-floor office at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, Mr. Butcher confirmed Dr. de Kock's fears. **********Following Chase's precedent, the banks overseas and in the United States that had bought participations in South African loans began to refuse to renew the loans as they came due. **********Reluctance to Expand Debt **********These banks' refusal to re-lend had an important effect because every dollar not re-lent to South Africa by one bank had to be replaced by another. And no bank wanted to increase its debt exposure there. **********''Chase, being such a large bank, probably tipped the balance for a lot of other banks,'' said Mr. Shuttleworth of the Standard Bank. In late August, for example, the First Bank System of Minneapolis announced that it would no longer lend to South Africa. Although its exposure was relatively small - about $39 million - its action added momentum to the belief that all banks were refusing to lend to South Africa. **********It was the fear that such pullouts would drain South Africa of its foreign exchange that caused a panic among banks and others. While South African companies had about $10 billion of debt falling due over the next year, the country's readily available foreign-exchange reserves stood at about $2.5 billion, and South Africa expected to clear another $2.5 billion from its foreign trade surplus. So if no loans could be rolled over, the country would come up short. **********As a result, during August dozens of banks acted to protect their own positions by stopping all lending to South Africa. They were trying to heed an old banking adage: Don't panic - but if you do, be the first."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/17/business/british-wage-pattern.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Wage Pattern", "print_headline": "British Wage Pattern", "body_text": " **********Average earnings in Britain fell 1.4 percent in November from October but were up 7.3 percent from a year before, the Government reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/business/week-in-business-ual-adds-hertz-to-travel-business.html": {"writer_name": "Merrill Perlman", "pub_date": "1985-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  UAL ADDS HERTZ TO TRAVEL BUSINESS", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS;   UAL ADDS HERTZ TO TRAVEL BUSINESS", "body_text": " **********UAL's purchase of Hertz from RCA was considered a canny step by some analysts, but others were more cautious.

''We will pay,'' he said, ''and we will comply in an honorable fashion with our commitments.'' Much of the Brazilian debt is tied to interest rates abroad, such as those in the United States. So when those rates rise, Brazil must pay significantly more. **********Mr. Neves said he believes the International Monetary Fund's request that Brazil slow its inflation to 120 percent this year was ''unrealistic,'' although he promised to reduce the inflation rate as much as possible. **********''We are a perfectly viable nation, and our potential is inexhaustible,'' Mr. Neves said. **********Plans for Economic Growth **********He added that he would try to induce economic growth without additional foreign loans by stimulating employment in Brazil's steel and cement industries and in agriculture. **********During a breakfast at the Brazilian Embassy, Mr. Shultz explained to Mr. Neves the American position on conflicts in Central America but did not specifically request Brazilian support for American policies there, the Administration official said. **********Asked about Central America this afternoon, Mr. Neves said that ''we cannot forget the conflict in Central America'' but that ''it is far away from us geographically.''

Gorbachev. **********The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, agreed on the format and some agenda items during their talks in Helsinki, Finland, two weeks  ago, and reached an understanding on some issues. **********Mr. Reagan, who arrived here today to begin a 23-day vacation on his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, is expected to spend some of the time preparing for his first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, which will be in Geneva on Nov. 19 and 20. **********Recuperating From Surgery **********Mr. Reagan's stay here will be part of his recuperation from major abdominal  surgery in which a cancerous polyp was removed from his colon on July 13.

''We're there to discuss the issues and set an agenda for the future.'' **********Mr. Speakes confirmed an outline of the United States preparations for the meeting that was provided Saturday by a senior Administration official. The official, who did not want to be identified, said about half the meeting would be used to develop a ''foundation'' that could lead to problem solving between the two superpowers. He said the other half would cover four specific areas. Those areas, which the official called ''baskets,'' are arms control, human rights, bilateral issues and regional concerns. **********Rights Violations a Topic **********In what could be an area of disharmony between the two sides, the official said the United States planned to raise concerns about what Washington considered Soviet human rights violations. **********The two leaders are to meet for about nine hours over the two days and are to visit for another two to three hours in social settings. **********The official, who briefed a small group of reporters, cautioned against expecting the signing of significant agreements that might provide the appearance of major breakthroughs in the talks. He said that with a new generation of Soviet leaders in place, it was important that a proper stage be set to pace American-Soviet relations for years. **********''There is an impulse to sign something by most bureaucrats in the Government,'' he said, ''but that is not the real telling measure. It's got to be measured in the months after.'' **********The official said the developing strategy called for Mr. Reagan to spell out  that the United States had ''no hostile intentions'' toward the Soviet Union and to express ''misgivings'' about whether its leaders had the ''same benign intentions.'' **********Policy on South Africa **********Today, on another subject, Mr. Speakes restated that Mr. Reagan planned no changes in his policy toward South Africa even if Congress overrode a possible veto of sanctions. The Senate is to vote next month on imposing sanctions, already approved by the House, and Mr. Reagan has said that he has not decided whether he would sign the measure. **********The spokesman said Mr. Reagan's policy of relying on diplomatic pressure was  ''the only way we can have influence.'' **********Mr. Speakes asserted there was a ''lack of in-depth understanding in the United States of the complexities of the South African problem.'' The senior official who briefed reporters on the summit talks Saturday made the same contention. **********Changes Being Considered **********Mr. Speakes said changes being considered by the South African Government, which might be announced on Thursday when President P. W. Botha is scheduled to  make a speech, were not designed to make it easier for Mr. Reagan to veto a sanctions bill. **********''I think the South Africans are taking in all factors,'' Mr. Speakes said, ''ranging from their own internal situation to international opinion, not only in the United States but in a number of other countries.'' **********The Administration has been seeking an end to violence in South Africa and a  dialogue between the Pretoria Government and black leaders that could lead to the dismantling of apartheid. **********On domestic matters, Mr. Speakes said Mr. Reagan would announce some staff appointments Monday. Officials have said Donald T. Regan, the White House chief  of staff, had decided last week to recommend that Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. replace Edward J. Rollins as the White House's chief political operative. Mr. Rollins has served as the Presidential assistant for political and governmental  affairs, and is among the cluster of senior Presidential assistants under Mr. Regan. He is leaving to become a private political consultant. **********At the same time, officials said Mr. Regan had decided to give M. B. Oglesby, an assistant to the President for legislative affairs, expanded Congressional responsibilities. Mr. Reagan's top legislative strategist, Max L. Friedersdorf,  has said he intends to leave his position. **********Mr. Speakes said Mr. Reagan would make no announcement this week on import restrictions to help the American shoe industry.

The four-year, $685 billion accumulation of deficits now exceeds all previous deficits, less periodic surpluses, of the 20th century. **********Economists have bewailed such figures since 1981, when Congress and the Reagan Administration ordered income tax cuts without making corresponding cuts in spending. But, for polticians, the budget deficit has been one of those problems, like the condition of the nation's bridges or the proliferation of toxic wastes, that seem too big or too remote to deal with. **********Finally, however, the deficits are beginning to hurt in ways that distress politicians. In this year's slower economy, the nation has become vulnerable to such after-effects of the deficits as a high dollar and higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case. **********The damage the deficits have begun to inflict lies behind the night-to-day shift in the Reagan Administration's foreign economic policies. They also underlie the attempts of Congress to deal with them, first last summer, with the resolution putting the deficits on a declining course, and again this month, with the 65-to-24 vote in the Senate to mandate a balanced budget by 1991. **********''As the debate has gone forward on trade, you see that you cannot have a good trade policy unless you have a sound economic policy,'' said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana. ''So we are therefore shifting back to more emphasis on the deficits.'' **********The deficits now present the Government with hard political realities. One is the possibility that, as many economists expect, the country will tumble into another recession by late 1986 or in 1987. Then, because of higher Federal payments to the unemployed and reduced tax revenues from businesses and consumers, the deficit could leap to $300 billion or $400 billion. **********With deficits of that magnitude, the Government would be constrained in using deficit spending to help pull the economy out of the recession - the one occasion, other than wartime, when all economists consider deficit spending legitimate. **********The other issue is more immediate - the political difficulties that the deficits are causing the Administration in Congress. Among those issues, the Reagan Administration often cites the prospect of protectionist legislation. A more compelling example of the political issue at stake, however, may be the four-year recession in American agriculture, whose resolution may even worsen the deficit. **********At first the recession affected only a tiny constituency, the nation's 5.8 million farm residents, or about 2.5 percent of the total population. But as the recession has trickled beyond the farms themselves, the old farm bloc in Congress, once thought to have fragmented with the urbanization of some rural communities and the decline of the farm population from 25 percent of the total 50 years ago, has returned. Last month the House of Representatives approved a new four-year farm law, extending aid to farmers at current levels, by a vote of 282 to 141. Republican and Democratic Congressmen of 10 states voted as blocs in support of the bill. **********If also approved by the Senate, where sympathy for farmers may be even stronger than in the House, the farm bill could add $10 billion or more to spending for agriculture over the next three years, according to Administration estimates. That is a small amount in comparison with annual deficits of $200 billion, but it is an important, symbolic fissure in the dike that Congress and the Administration are trying to erect against the deficits. **********The Administration's only hope then is to ease the pressure for farm spending increases by asking other countries to aid it in relieving the symptoms of the deficit, especially the high dollar while, at the same time, it is keeping pressure on Congress to cut down the deficits. Still, in appealing to other countries for help, an Administration that long argued that the high dollar demonstrated the soundness of its economic policies has had to eat ideological crow. **********But it now finds crow more palatable than the prospect of widespread Republican losses in the farm states during next year's Congressional elections. ''The policy change is coming at a time when the United States economy is simply failing to perform according to the Reagan Administration's scenario,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, ''so the Administration has to do something,'' **********Another ideological dispute remains, however, that could frustrate the new political concern over the deficits. The President still wants a smaller Government, so he would cut spending, and many members of Congress want to maintain the Government at its current size, so they prefer to raise taxes. **********The problem of the softer economy remains, too. Last week, Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, said the best time to deal with the deficits was a year or 18 months ago, when the economy was booming. A slower economy normally means demand for more Government spending, not less. **********Solving the deficit problem therefore requires painful steps and prospects of an easy resolution soon are bleak."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/business/finance-new-issues-a-large-car-loan-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 291, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A LARGE CAR-LOAN ISSUE", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   A LARGE CAR-LOAN ISSUE", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Acceptance Corporation is offering the largest issue ever of securities backed by car loans, and is the first finance affiliate of a car manufacturer to enter the new market.

Travelers are periodically attacked and refugee settlements, including the camp of Khao I Dang north of Aranyaprathet, have been robbed in the past. **********But what concerns the refugees as well as Thai and international aid workers who administer Khao I Dang and its humanitarian services are the increasing frequency, size and violence of the attacks on the camp. **********5 Attacks in 2 Months **********On March 10, Khao I Dang, a thatch and bamboo settlement of more than 30,000 people, was attacked for the fifth time since mid-January. This time, residents said in interviews during a recent visit to the camp, they were the prey of a large Cambodian gang that entered the camp at about 7:30 P.M. and went on a rampage of robbery and terror lasting until about 1 A.M. **********And this time, for the first time, residents said, people who could not meet extortion demands were killed. Two women and two children, one 8 months old and the other 4 years old, were shot to death, relatives said, and then blown apart by what was believed to be a grenade.  ''Cambodians are again killing Cambodians,'' said Sou Gaing, the neighborhood section leader. **********International Donors Contacted **********Alarmed by the violence, refugee leaders and international aid workers have relayed their fears to foreign embassies that support relief work. They have also expressed concern to the Bangkok office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is responsible for running the camp, and to local officers of the Thai military-civilian border patrol that provides camp security. **********One French aid organization, the Doctors Without Borders, withdrew its night staff for a short period. **********Every evening frightened residents, particularly those with homes at the edge of the camp, come to the open area around the compound's offices, hospital and warehouse to sleep huddled together on the ground. **********'A Place of Terror' **********''This place of refuge has become a place of terror,'' a volunteer worker said, echoing comments heard in many parts of the sprawling camp. **********''They came down from the mountain, more than a hundred of them,'' said Nan Pich, describing the March 10 attack. ''First we heard the shooting; then they were here, everywhere in our houses.'' **********Mr. Nan Pich, 28, was squatting by a homemade foxhole as he told of the raid, in which his mother, Sok Hoeun, and his sister Pich Kola died. **********He said his mother and her neighbor, Sroy Chhorn, had run to hide in the foxhole and were shot ''because the women did not have 600 baht'' - about $21. Residents of the camp say the standard bandit ''fee'' per family is 300 baht. **********Sroy Khoeung, Mrs. Sroy Chhorn's husband, said the bandits had come to his home three times before killing his wife, who had nothing left to give them. Not having any money himself, Mr. Sroy Khoeug said, he had fled the area at the advice of neighbors who assumed the intruders would not hurt women. **********Little Shelter From Crossfire **********His head shaved in mourning, he sat on his bamboo bed over the foxhole where his wife had sought safety. He said the camp's security force had ordered him to dig the pit in February, when he moved from another part of the camp to the small thatch and bamboo hut. Khao I Dang's houses offer no protection from a crossfire between bandits and troops. **********The residents of the camp, some of whom have been here for four or five years and many of whom have repeatedly been rejected for resettlement by Western countries, are classified as political refugees who will not or cannot return to Cambodia. **********Their status differs from that of the quarter of a million Cambodians who were pushed into Thailand by recent Vietnamese attacks on rebel bases inside Cambodia. These people are expected to return to Cambodian territory sooner or later. **********In the last five years, the population of Khao I Dang has shrunk through emigration from more than 130,000 to just over 30,000, in addition to as many as 5,000 illegal residents - people who steal into the compound hoping to be declared refugees and thus to reach the West. **********Permanence Said to Lure Bandits **********Resettlement of Cambodians in the United States and other nations has slowed in the last year, however, and the camp's permanence and appearance of relative prosperity increase the temptation for thieves, the refugees and aid workers suggest. Thai officials say they would like to empty this holding center, and they have repeatedly asked Western nations to speed up immigration of the residents. **********The camp is not heavily fortified. The single, shoulder-high barbed-wire fence can be easily penetrated from outside, as it is regularly by smugglers who supply the camp's black market. **********Residents of the camp say that poorly paid Thai guards occasionally accept money to let the smugglers and would-be refugees enter. But residents interviewed about the growing bandit menace say they do not believe the thugs are gaining access the same way. **********Col. Pradab Sangkaew, the Thai camp commander, said in an interview that the bandits ''need only wire cutters to get in,'' and that the area needed stronger defenses against intruders. **********Pattern Seen in Raids **********The commander said the pattern of armed robberies indicated that the bandits know when a group of refugees is about to be moved to a resettlement processing center. The bandits strike then, apparently believing that the refugees may have some extra money on hand for the move. **********He said he thought some camp residents might have an idea who the bandits are, but were reluctant to identify them. Residents who had seen the intruders said only that they were Cambodian-speaking and appeared to be ethnic Cambodians. One bandit was killed on March 10, but he has not been identified. **********A spokesman for the Khmer People's National Liberation Front denied suggestions that the armed men could be irregular troops loosely attached to the front's army, the anti-Vietnamese, Cambodian guerrilla force that is predominant in the area. The spokesman added that the front's officers always investigated such charges. **********Thai officials say Khao I Dang has had a small security force because resources are limited at a time when the armed forces have been facing intrusions by Vietnamese troops along the border, and when they have also been called on to oversee more than half a dozen major Cambodian evacuation sites."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/26/business/board-closes-thrift-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Board Closes Thrift Unit", "print_headline": "Board Closes Thrift Unit", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday that it had closed the Alliance Savings and Loan Association of Kenner, La., and had ordered the transfer of its estimated $144 million in insured deposits to another bank. **********A bank board spokesman said the insolvent thrift unit's deposits would be transferred by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to the Bay Savings Bank of Newport News, Va. **********The thrift unit, described by the bank board as ''a victim of substandard loan underwriting,'' will reopen today as a branch of Bay Savings, which has 22 offices in Virginia and $502 million in assets.

Solomon and Kristine Hanson. Atheneum Publishers, N.Y. 282 pages, $17.95. IN a particularly memorable phrase, Peter Drucker described business ethics as ''being able to look at your face in the mirror in the morning.'' That may be an apt rule-of-thumb for the majority of business executives, but - as E. F. Hutton's recent guilty plea to 2,000 counts of fraud makes clear - some have a stronger stomach than others. Thus, there is a need for ethical guidelines that allow less leeway for personal choice. **********Business executives looking for such guidelines could well profit from this new book. It makes no mention of E. F. Hutton, and is annoyingly reticent about the documented ethical and legal lapses of several other major corporations in recent years. But it has the virtue of forcing the reader to think about business ethics from a number of perspectives. And its premise is that ''The search for excellence, whatever else it may be, begins with ethics.'' **********Mr. Solomon, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas, is the author of more than a dozen books, including ''Above the Bottom Line,'' a textbook on business ethics. The co-author of ''Above the Bottom Line'' is also the co-author of ''It's Good Business.'' She is Kristine Hanson, a Harvard M.B.A. who works with the Eaton Financial Management Corporation in New York. The two authors' diverse backgrounds are reflected throughout the book, which includes such chapters as ''Beyond the Profit Motive,'' ''Corporate Culture and Ethics Checklist,'' ''Spinoza's Worm'' and ''The Ethical Advocate.'' **********Public opinion is antagonistic to business, the authors say, pointing to the unflattering depiction of business executives in popular television programs. But they say that the executives must bear much of the blame themselves for the distorted portrait. Business schools and the language of business, they point out, contribute to the perception of the quest for profits as a vulgar, ''dog-eat-dog'' activity. **********Yet business executives are no more -or less - ethical than other segments of society, the authors say. They argue that the daily concern of business with efficiency, fair exchange and a fair wage are the heart of business ethics. **********''Business is not a scramble for profits and survival,'' they argue. ''It is a way of life, an established and proven practice whose prosperity and survival depends on the participation of its practictioners. Business ethics is not ethics applied to business. It is the foundation of business. Business life thrives on competition, but it survives on the basis of its ethics.'' **********''Ethics becomes a problem in most companies,'' they write, ''not because of ethical indifference or ignorance but rather because it is just not part of the conversation.'' Nonetheless, the authors say they have repeatedly found that the more successful people and companies are those that take ethics seriously. And they urge corporations to adopt formal codes of conduct in order to provide visible guidelines and a court of appeal. **********The authors pose a number of theoretical ethical dilemmas, and their chapter ''Is It Ever Right to Lie?'' - with its discussion of whole truths, partial truths and evasions - reads as if it had been written with flaps between the Washington press corps and the White House in mind. They also list eight rules of ethical conduct (for example, ''Obey, but do not depend solely on the law,'' ''Ask the question 'What sort of person would do such a thing?' '') and they set forth 11 steps to ethical problem solving. **********The book is not without limitations. Some of the authors' suggestions are obvious. Much of the book reads as if it were transcribed from the authors' seminars. The checklists, surveys, cartoons and quotations - set off as sidebars -suggest that the book is intended for television-age managers and executives who are uncomfortable with the unadorned written word. And there is an apparent attempt to appear ''with it,'' an attempt that leads them to describe Ned Ludd of Luddite fame as ''a legendary 18th-century anti-technology activist.'' **********The book deals with specific ethical or legal lapses on only a few occasions, the authors preferring to talk in hypothetical terms. But one such occasion involves a brief discussion of the bribery scandals in Japan involving Lockheed. **********The authors quote a Lockheed official as telling a Congressional panel, ''If in a situation where high government officials have influence on matters pertinent to a private company, and money is requested as payoffs for those officials, can that private foreign company, which wants its products to be bought at all costs, realistically decline the request on the grounds that it is not a good thing from the ethical point of view?'' **********That was ''a simple, inelegant, disastrous statement,'' the authors say, one that harmed Lockheed and will long serve as a glaring example of what is wrong with business. The proper response, they write, would have been to point out the ethical ambiguity - between our system and that of third world nations - of giving money to expedite a transaction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/26/business/stock-slip-again-as-volume-drops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCK SLIP AGAIN AS VOLUME DROPS", "print_headline": "STOCK SLIP AGAIN AS VOLUME DROPS", "body_text": " **********The stock market continued to retreat yesterday in a dull session where trading volume contracted and even takeover rumors were scarce. **********But the nearly weeklong blast of rumor activity appeared to have left the market exhausted.

The average share fell 16 cents as declining issues outpaced those that advanced by 915 to 558. Volume dropped sharply, to 101.8 million shares, from 123.1 million Thursday. **********G.M. Down Again **********Analysts said part of the market's problem might be technical. ''I think the market got a nosebleed when it was in new high ground and General Motors was at a new low,'' Mr. Groveman said. G.M. fell another point, to 64 5/8, reaching a new 52-week low for the second consecutive day. **********I.B.M., which grudgingly moved above the 130 resistance price earlier this week, fell 5/8, to 128, yesterday. **********Texas Oil and Gas fell 3/8, to 19. The stock headed the day's most-active list on consolidated volume of more than 4.7 million shares. U.S. Steel, meanwhile, was the third-busiest issue, off 1, to 28. The two companies confirmed that they were discussing a combination, which Wall Street believes would be accomplished through a stock swap. **********Public Service of New Mexico, the second-most-active stock, rose 3/8, to 28 3/8, on nearly 2.9 million shares. The stock will be ex dividend next week, and traders said that yesterday's volume might have resulted from buying by tax-exempt institutions for dividend purposes. **********Some stocks that rose on takeover rumors over the last few weeks gave up some of the gains. ITT, for example, fell 3/4, to 35 1/8. A spokesman for Jay Pritzker, the Chicago businessman, was quoted as saying that he planned no action against ITT at this time. The stock has been climbing on speculation that either Mr. Pritzker or Irwin L. Jacobs, the Minneapolis investor, would soon make a move against the company. **********And CBS, which has been the subject of on-and-off takeover rumors this year, fell 2 1/8, to 110 5/8. The broadcaster recently invited the Loews Corporation to raise its stake in CBS to 25 percent in what analysts view as a defensive move. **********The stock of major money center banks fell on news that Argentina had declared a state of siege to curb growing violence. Citicorp dropped 1 1/4, to 41 3/4; Chase 1 1/8, to 56 1/8, and J. P. Morgan 3/4, to 49 3/4. **********Traders said the stock market was also hurt yesterday by the poor performance of bonds, which struggled after interest rates rose in Japan. **********Despite the weeklong gloom on Wall Street, Samson Wang of the Bank of New York's Beacon Capital said he was optimistic about the prospects for equities. ''I'm still quite positive on the market, even though the consensus is still pessimistic,'' he said. Mr. Wang believes the market strength will come from stable interest rates and perhaps some movement on tax revision proposals. **********Colonial Penn was the day's best gainer, rising 3 1/8, to 33 1/8. The insurance concern agreed to be acquired by FPL, a utility holding company, for $35 a share. FPL fell 5/8, to 25 1/8. **********The American Stock Exchange's market-value index fell 1.09, to 226.77, while in over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq composite index declined 1.09, to 289.49."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/28/world/after-4000-civilized-years-china-starts-to-hurry.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1985-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1097, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AFTER 4,000 CIVILIZED YEARS, CHINA STARTS TO HURRY", "print_headline": "AFTER 4,000 CIVILIZED YEARS, CHINA STARTS TO HURRY", "body_text": " **********The dust that blows across Peking from the Gobi Desert had left the apartment windows opaque with grime, so the new tenant dialed the diplomatic housing service and asked for window-cleaners. Quickly two men bustled in, slung safety ropes around their waists and clambered onto the 11th-story ledges. **********It was a minor demonstration of the favorite slogan here these days: ''Time  is money - efficiency is life.'' From Deng Xiaoping's hosting of foreign investors at the Great Hall of the People to the new merchant class springing up in the street bazaars, the idea of time as precious is bandied about as though nobody ever thought of it before. **********In a sense, they hadn't. Fifteen years ago a Westerner arriving here had to quickly accept that few things were accomplished without endless delay. The common wisdom then was that China had an agenda of its own that was largely impervious to outsiders' demands. After 4,000 years, it seemed, the Chinese saw  no need to hurry. **********Promoting the Work Ethic **********No longer. Nowadays, the insistent stress is on getting the job done fast, making a profit and eliminating waste. Maoist demands for ideological purity and shunning bourgeois ways have given way to an idolization of foreign technology and official encouragement to take the United States, West Germany and Japan as  models of how the work ethic can be applied to everyone's gain. **********''Notions regarding time have undergone radical change,'' a Chinese writer, Tong Gang, said recently in the official English-language newspaper, China Daily. ''Time has never been looked at in financial terms and therefore has been ruthlessly wasted: prolonged construction periods, endless meetings and meaningless conversations.'' **********He concluded: ''All these show the little value we place on time. 'Take your  time,' has been an expression so often used as an excuse that it hardly offends  anybody.'' **********The new impatience bears the imprint of Mr. Deng, the twice-purged leader who now, at the age of 80, may be running out of time. Branded as a ''captialist roader'' by Mao during the Cultural Revolution, he seems determined to take China by the scruff of the neck and drag it into modernity. **********His methods have little to do with orthodox Marxism. Job security and wage uniformity are out. In their place is an insistence that old men make way for young, that seat-warmers be demoted or dismissed and that everybody's pay be a measure of effort. Income disparities are widening among city-dwellers and farmers alike. While some are multiplying their wages, others are sliding down the pole. No More Iron Rice Bowl **********Mr. Deng has made a public mockery of phrases like ''eating from the big pot'' and ''the iron rice bowl,'' used in the past to capture the security enjoyed by millions of time-serving bureaucrats, plant managers and others. Bosses are being chosen at all levels on the basis of effectiveness, often in disregard of Communist Party membership. There are daily press accounts of shirkers in high places, such as the one recently about the freight manager of the national airline, C.A.A.C., who allowed valuable imports to waste in the rain because he could not be bothered to build a proper freight hangar. **********So far, the results are mixed. Official figures here have long been regarded  as dubious, but an annual growth rate of 13 percent in real terms may not be far off. High-rise buildings in Peking financed with Western money are being completed ahead of schedule with the help of performance payments, and industries that once were sluggards are claiming completion of five-year production quotas more than a year ahead of the deadline of December 1985. **********But major problems remain. Watching the Chinese as they go about their daily  tasks, Westerners ponder whether Mr. Deng is flying in the face of centuries-old traditions that place a harmonious, unpressured life ahead of material considerations, or whether in the end China will find that efficiency and Communism do not fully mix. **********Even in places that are symbols of the new era, not every Chinese seems caught up in the new drive. At the Bank of China counter in the 22-story, 1000-  room Great Wall Hotel, financed and run by a Hong Kong-based group, five clerks  can still take 20 minutes to cash two checks. At a taxi stand not far away, four drivers can huddle in the warmth of the dispatcher's office and wave away requests for a ride. **********Late last year, the Government gave a shock to many urban workers by announcing that from Jan. 1 the daily lunchtime rest period was being halved, to one hour. Mr. Deng could hardly have attacked a more sacrosanct institution. For years the country has virtually halted at noon. In Peking people would simply wedge themselves into any available space and surface again sometime toward mid-afternoon. **********Some Call Break Essential **********In companies where Chinese work for foreigners, some Chinese insist that only Government workers are affected by the decreee. In any case, they say, a two-hour break is essential for people who have to rise at 5 A.M., line up to use communal washing facilities and bicycle miles to work. **********Mr. Deng, who has already attracted $8 billion in foreign investment and talks of raising that fivefold, needs the increased productivity to lure money that could go elsewhere. A major attraction is that Chinese wages are low, even  by Asian standards, so that an industrial worker who earns 100 yuan a month, or  $36, may do half the work of his counterpart in Singapore and still be a better  bet. **********The drive for efficiency has extended to official advocacy of new attitudes toward clothing, eating and consumerism. The Communist Party Chairman, Hu Yaobang, has urged officials to wear Western-style suits, considered more comfortable than the high-collared ''Mao tunics'' that once were de rigueur. The press is full of articles about the new ''fast-food'' restaurants springing up in Peking and other cities, said to be able to put food on the table in as little as 10 minutes. **********About 40 ''supermarkets'' have been opened in the capital, the first time Chinese shoppers have been able to choose goods from the shelves for themselves. But their prices are up to 30 percent higher than in other stores, and they are  rarely busy. More successful has been the campaign to have college students take part-time jobs, also in the name of efficiency. According to the official New China News Agency, the old intellectual distaste for manual work has given way to a new vogue in waiting on tables, helping out in factories and sweeping dormitory floors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/12/world/south-africa-accuses-kennedy-of-interfering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA ACCUSES KENNEDY OF INTERFERING", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA ACCUSES KENNEDY OF INTERFERING", "body_text": " **********South African Cabinet ministers accused Senator Edward M.

Some reports today suggested that the United Democratic Front was also divided over how to respond to the Kennedy visit. **********Senator Kennedy is in South Africa as a guest of Dr. Boesak and Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and head of the South African Council of Churches. **********The visit has elicited a generally hostile response among ordinary whites, who in private conversation accuse Mr. Kennedy of interfering and seeking to rob them of a privileged way of life. The Financial Mail, a weekly news magazine reflecting white business opinion, printed a cover Thursday showing a photograph of the Senator with the caption, ''He's teaching us morals?'' An editorial recalled the Chappaquiddick incident, in which a young woman died when a car Mr. Kennedy was driving went off a bridge, and other events in his career. **********Meets With 2 Cabinet Ministers **********The Senator met today with two South African Cabinet ministers, Gerrit Viljoen, who is in charge of many activities affecting blacks, and J. Chris Heunis, who designed the country's new Constitution, which offers a limited political voice to people of Indian and mixed racial descent but ignores the black majority. **********At separate news conferences later, both ministers accused the Senator of interfering in their nation's affairs.

But, they add, the Anschutz and Pritzker families are not likely to make a hostile move against ITT. One source said the families offered to ''enter into a dialogue'' about going private only if ITT was willing. **********Another source said ITT ''turned a deaf ear.'' He added that the proposal being made was ''definitely financeable, not a pie-in-the-sky thing.'' **********In fact, sources say ITT has on several occasions rejected entering into formal discussions with the Pritzker/Anschutz team or their representatives. **********The proposal was apparently broached for the first time in early 1984 when Jay Pritzker, who owns the Hyatt Hotel chain, wanted to know if ITT's Sheraton Hotels were for sale. But sources say the conversations ''evolved further'' and additional informal contacts were made through ITT's investment banker, Lazard Fr eres & Company. Neither Lazard nor ITT would comment on the matter. **********The sources said the suggestion about going private was brought directly and indirectly to the company's attention by Mr. Pritzker; Jerry Seslowe, head of Resources Holdings, and J. Ira Harris, an investment banker in Chicago with Salomon Brothers. **********Philip Anschutz and Mr. Pritzker, who both cherish their privacy and shun unfriendly takeovers, dropped the matter about three months ago, the sources said. But the door was left open in case ITT wants to revive the idea, the sources added. **********Mr. Seslowe, an adviser to the Anschutz and Pritzker families who is said to have made the first and last of about half a dozen contacts with ITT, confirmed that ''approaches have been made in the past that have been rebuffed.'' The two families, who consider themselves an investment group for Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes, are said to own slightly less than 5 percent of ITT's stock. **********That is about the same amount reportedly held by Irwin L.

That suggestion was rejected and ITT continued with its plan to slim down by selling operations. Earlier this week, ITT announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell 12 companies to Forstmann Little & Company for about $370 million. **********There have been rumors on Wall Street recently that Mr. Jacobs would soon go above the 5 percent level and make known his intentions with regard to the ITT investment, under S.E.C. regulations.

He says he has seen scant evidence that free trade could help Ontario, while he is sure it could hurt in many ways. **********The Ontario leader plans a trip to Washington in two weeks to discuss his reservations about free trade with Reagan Administration officials, Senators and Congressmen. Next month, he will press them in a meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and other province premiers. **********A Prominent Skeptic **********Mr. Peterson has emerged as the most prominent skeptic of the advantages to Canada of a trade deal. Without Ontario's support, political experts say, an agreement will be very difficult to achieve. **********Ontario's trade with the United States is greater than American bilateral trade with Japan. With a third of Canada's population, it produces more than half the country's manufactured goods. **********As a consequence, if 14 weeks of hearings now being held by the Ontario Government result in Mr. Peterson and his minority Government of the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party turning against free trade, the political consequences would likely be severe. **********A third of the members of the federal Parliament are from Ontario, and are influential in proportion to their numbers. Also, Mr. Peterson suggests the next federal election will likely turn on the free trade issue. **********''It is the single most important thing we've done economically in 100 years,'' the Ontario Premier warned. **********Mr. Peterson fears that trade talks with Washington will force the so-called auto pact - worth $26.7 billion (Canadian) in Ontario exports to the United States last year - on to the bargaining table. American officials have said that the auto pact must be included, while Canadian officials have insisted that it should not. **********He also worries that small industries, such as furniture and shoes, will not be able to adjust to life without tariffs, and that new high technology industries cannot develop without the government help a free trade agreement might outlaw. **********Countervailing Duties **********Perhaps most significantly, the Ontario leader points to an assertion last week by William Merkin, a top Reagan Administration trade official, that a trade deal could not exempt Canada from the sort of countervailing duties they most hope a pact would prevent. Israel failed to win such an exemption in its free trade agreement with the United States last year. **********Mr. Peterson denies press reports that he was the only premier with doubts about free trade at an August meeting of premiers in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He said British Columbia expressed worries about losing its right to attract industry by pricing electricity cheaply; that Newfoundland feared losing fishing benefits, and that other premiers worried that Ottawa's generous aid to depressed regions would go down the drain. **********Significantly, Robert Bourassa -leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec, the second-biggest province - recently expressed concern that a free trade deal could result in Canada being swallowed up politically by the United States. The Liberals lead the ruling Parti Quebecois, generally pro-free trade, in polls, and an election is expected before spring. **********Federal officials have proposed talks to greatly liberalize the $120 billion bilateral trade, by far the biggest between any two countries in the world. They contend that a trade agreement would guarantee access to the huge American market at a time that protectionist sentiment in Congress is running high. Ultimately, they suggest, it would benefit the Canadian economy by forcing industries to become more competitive. **********'Low-Bridging It' **********But so far, Prime Minister Mulroney and his top aides appear to be ''low-bridging it,'' Mr. Peterson said, using his term for an extremely soft sell. ''He hasn't really jumped four-square on the pony,'' Mr. Peterson said of the Prime Minister. **********Indeed, in public statements, federal Government leaders have emphasized the numerous ways they would prefer to stop short of a full free trade deal in order to protect Canadian economic, political and cultural interests. **********''There may be no negotiations with the United States at all,'' Joe Clark, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, said in a speech here Friday evening. ''Their Congress may refuse even to consider arrangements which would limit their power to threaten Canada by protectionist bills.'' **********A document prepared by the Prime Minister's office and obtained by the press suggested that any sustained opposition from the Ontario Government could scuttle the negotiations. The document, which Mr. Mulroney's aides characterize as a draft paper, advocated underplaying the liberalized trade initiative. **********''It is likely that the higher the profile the issue attains, the lower the degree of public approval will be,'' the document said. **********'Some Intellectualization' **********Ontario, by contrast, is trying to provide ''some intellectualization of the subject,'' Mr. Peterson said. Studies are being conducted by a number of ministries to determine specific economic effects. **********A top economic official said that a chief area of concern is whether greater access to the market will mean more secure access, particularly if the American opposition to doing away with countervailing duties holds. The worry is that Canada could simply be increasing its vulnerability to the protectionism it wants to avoid. **********The official, who asked not to be named, also suggested that the tariff reductions coming out of the current round of cuts are being misunderstood. By 1987, some 80 percent of Ontario's exports to the United States will enter tariff-free, as will 70 percent of American shipments north. **********He pointed out that the statistics are averages, and that some weak industries will still have very high tariffs, while others have none. This means that the dislocations caused by the cutting of protection on struggling industries through a free trade deal will be much harsher than commonly believed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/10/business/a-banner-year-for-auto-sales.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1985-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A BANNER YEAR FOR AUTO SALES", "print_headline": "A BANNER YEAR FOR AUTO SALES", "body_text": " **********Even though car and truck sales will hit record levels for the 1985 model year, the chairman of General Motors Corporation warned today that the American auto industry, and others as well, would have to move swiftly to computerize their operations to meet threats from abroad. **********Roger B. Smith predicted that total American sales of cars and trucks -domestically made or imported -would reach 15.4 million by the end of the month, which is the end of the 1985 model year. The previous record was 15.3 million in the boom year of 1978. **********And he said he expected 1986 to be strong as well, though perhaps not reaching a record. ''We have a real shot at surpassing 15 million units again,'' he said at a news conference. **********He said cars would account for 10.4 to 10.6 million of those vehicles, with trucks, including the popular minivans, making up the rest. But imports are taking 25 percent of the car market and 16 percent of the trucks, and their share has been growing rapidly with the lifting of restrictions on Japan. **********'Global Standards' **********Mr. Smith acknowledged the threat from overseas in a later speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. ''Wherever American business competes -at home or abroad - it must meet global standards,'' he said. ''And unless we want to play a perpetual game of catch up, we have to do much more than just meet our competition on a day-to-day basis.'' **********Computers can give American companies an advantage over countries with less-advanced computer technology, he said, by speeding up design and engineering and drastically reducing overhead. But to fully utilize the power of computers, he added, the way American companies operate will have to change. **********Mr. Smith said the current torrid sales place was largely due to price cuts in the form of below-market financing plans offered by all the domestic manufacturers, but largely unmatched by imported brands. **********'A Big Boost' **********''We knew it would be a big boost, but it far exceeded our expectations,'' he said. G.M. is offering 7.7 percent financing on most of its remaining 1985 models, which is well below the 12 to 13 percent charged by most banks on auto loans. **********From Oct. 1, 1984, which was the beginning of the 1985 model year, 14.2 million cars and trucks were sold in this country, and Mr. Smith is evidently counting on the incentives to keep sales brisk for the rest of this month. In August, with incentives in effect largely in the final 10 selling days, the industry sold 1.3 million vehicles. In the 1984 model years, sales totaled 14.2 million cars and trucks. **********Mr. Smith said most large companies today were being managed with systems developed in their infancy. ''The result often was companies with uncoordinated systems, resembling little more than a collection of empires built by department heads who were fiercly loyal to their own particular functions,'' he said. **********Industry analysts say this would not have been a bad description of G.M. itself, before the reorganization and reforms directed by Mr. Smith in his nearly five years as chairman. **********A Paperless Company **********Mr. Smith said G.M. was beginning to move toward its goal of becoming a paperless company that conducts all its business over computer networks in its Saturn Corporation subsidiary and other advanced operations. Saturn now has a paperless expense account reporting system. ''Imagine, an expense report with no signatures required,'' he said. **********Saturn employees, most of whom are management or engineering professionals at this point, enter their expense reports into a computer terminal and payments are credited electronically to their bank accounts. **********''By eliminating paper, this system will generate savings for greater than the investment required or the chance of expense account abuse,'' Mr. Smith said. The system will be subject to electronic audits. **********Some suppliers of parts, Mr. Smith added, are now being paid automatically as cars are produced, rather than in response to billings. He said the ultimate goal was to eliminate purchase orders, shipping documents, receiving slips and invoices, and, presumably, the clerical staff needed to process them. **********No Plans to Cut Workers **********However, he said G.M. had no overall plan to cut its work force, a step that the Ford Motor Company recently announced. Ford said it plans to reduce its white-collar staff by 20 percent over the next five years. **********''Our big, across-the-board cuts are behind us,'' Mr. Smith said. Future reductions, he said, will be ''gradual and mostly through attrition.'' **********Mr. Smith said G.M.'s acquisition of Electronic Data Systems last year and Hughes Aircraft this summer were part of his plan to turn G.M. into a paperless, integrated company. He said such a change could trim as much as two years off the five it now takes to design, engineer and produce a new model of automobile. **********And, he added, the addition of artificial intelligence systems and engineering computers would greatly reduce the chance for human error."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/business/market-place-high-returns-on-drug-issues.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1985-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;   High Returns On Drug Issues", "print_headline": "Market Place;   High Returns On Drug Issues", "body_text": " **********WHAT William J.

''Last fall, Congress passed a law that speeded up the approval time for drugs going off patent and this provided opportunities in the smaller companies that produce generic drugs. **********''Close to 70 percent of our assets now are in-vested in big-capitalization drug stocks and in generic drug issues. Our largest single holding is Pfizer, which accounts for more than 5 percent of the portfolio.'' Pfizer already markets Feldene, the world's most widely prescribed anti-arthritis drug. One of its prospective new drugs, Sorbinil, is being tested for complications arising from diabetes. **********Other large positions include Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Syntex, Warner-Lambert and SmithKline Beckman. Minoxidil, an Upjohn drug, is already used in pill form for treatment of high blood pressure. The company is now conducting clinical studies for the drug to be used in topical form for treating male baldness. Syntex is working on a group of drugs called prostaglandins, the first of which, Enprostil, for treating ulcers, is expected to be submitted soon for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. **********Zenith Labs is the largest holding among generic drug issues. Other generic drug stocks held by the fund include Bolar Pharmaceutical, Lyphomed Inc. and Mylan Labs. **********Mr. Hayes was a drug analyst at Fidelity before becoming manager of the health care sector fund at its inception in July 1981. The fund now manages $255 million in assets. His investment style, Mr. Hayes said, ''is to move in and out of both groups and individual stocks aggressively, in order to take advantage of opportunities in the market.'' He still regards large-capitalization drug stocks and generic drug issues as ''attractive.'' **********But Mr. Hayes does not consider most hospital management companies - including the Hospital Corporation of America, the largest company in this group - attractive investments at the present time. ''In my view, these companies lack appeal because of cost containment measures instituted by the Government in the autumn of 1983 and also because of competitive pressures from health maintenance organizations.'' **********Known as H.M.O.'s, these companies charge patients a prepaid, fixed fee as a provider of health care. ''They are causing a revolution in the industry and have reduced the amount of days patients spend in hospitals by roughly one-half,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''Although we have owned Hospital Corporation in the past, Humana is the only big stock in this group we now hold - and that's because Humana is aggressively getting into H.M.O.'s. One thing that makes the group still attractive is that some companies are potential acquisition candidates.'' Here, the fund's holdings include Maxicare Health Plans and U.S. Health Care Systems, among others. **********Elsewhere, nursing home issues favored by Mr. Hayes are Manor Care, Beverly Enterprises and Mediplex Group. ''Demographics look super for these stocks,'' he said, ''because of the aging population.'' **********The No. 2 performer among all 818 funds is Fidelity OTC Portfolio, created early in January by Fidelity Investments as its 31st fund. This fund, which seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in over-the-counter stocks, showed a total return of 43.3 percent so far in 1985."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/world/philippine-communist-insurgents-are-gaining-us-officials-warn.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1985-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1446, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHILIPPINE COMMUNIST INSURGENTS ARE GAINING, U.S. OFFICIALS WARN", "print_headline": "PHILIPPINE COMMUNIST INSURGENTS ARE GAINING, U.S. OFFICIALS WARN", "body_text": " **********The Communist insurgency in the Philippines has grown steadily larger and more violent, despite assertions by the Government of President Ferdinand E. Marcos that the situation is being contained, according to officials familiar with the most recent reports of American intelligence agencies. **********The officials said that although President Marcos had taken some small steps toward introducing changes into the armed forces, the Philippine military remained severely hampered in its anti-insurgent efforts by hidebound leadership, cronyism and resentment among the populace of past brutality. **********Administration officials said the worsening military balance was the main reason that senior officials decided to get President Reagan more involved in the long-running crisis. **********A Message for Marcos **********Last week, Mr. Reagan sent a close friend, Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, to Manila to impress upon Mr. Marcos that worry about the Philippine situation had moved from the ranks of diplomats and intelligence officers into the Oval Office. **********Officials said the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey, and the White House national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, had advocated the Laxalt mission after Mr. Marcos, his wife, Imelda, and other Philippine officials had repeatedly spurned warnings from American diplomats about the growing violence and entreaties for military, political and economic changes. **********Until the Laxalt trip, the officials said, Mr. Marcos appeared to believe that these warnings did not reflect Mr. Reagan's own feelings. **********'The President Himself' **********''What bubbled it up was the continued negative trends - the number of people under arms, the number of violent incidents,'' a senior Administration official said in an interview. ''The President decided it was time to make sure President Marcos knew it was not just a few guys in Washington who had a problem with the Philippines, but the President himself.'' **********An American official who has recently met with Mr. Marcos and his wife said, ''There's a strong sense that they are somewhat divorced from reality.'' **********Administration officials and members of Congress generally applauded the President's effort to deliver a firm message to Mr. Marcos, but they expressed little hope that the mission would change Mr. Marcos's behavior. **********'This Hasn't Worked Either' **********''Fundamentally, they did it because previous steps hadn't worked,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. Mr. Solarz, who has pressed the Administration to distance itself from Mr. Marcos, added, ''I think it will soon become apparent that this hasn't worked either.'' **********Administration officials familiar with Mr. Laxalt's meetings said the Philippine President had minimized the dangers of the insurgency and in general had dismissed the criticisms delivered by Mr. Laxalt as overstated and unfounded. The officials said Mr. Marcos insisted that although he had ''a credibility problem'' in the United States, his popular support at home was firm. **********Administration officials said a 200-page report that Mr. Marcos gave Mr. Laxalt last week, reciting changes under way in the Philippine military and describing the status of the battle against the insurgent New People's Army, was merely a repackaging of an earlier Philippine Government white paper and was far more sanguine than American intelligence assessments. **********For example, although President Marcos has estimated the number of armed insurgents at about 9,000, and Lieut. Gen. Fidel C. Ramos, the top military officer in the Philippines, said Friday that total had grown to 12,500, the Pentagon puts the number at 16,500. **********Congressional sources familiar with intelligence reports estimated that as many as a million Filipinos are considered active supporters of the guerrillas, providing food, housing or other aid. **********''It's fair to say that President Marcos views the situation more optimistically than we do,'' said Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, in an interview. He added that the number of guerrillas was less important than the fact that ''the trend has continued bad.'' **********Official is Slain **********The increasing violence was highlighted Wednesday by the assassination of the provincial governor of Mindanao, the highest ranking official to die in the Philippines violence in many years. The New People's Army said it was responsible for the slaying. **********Mr. Armitage said he had not changed his own assessment that if present military trends continue, the rebels will achieve a ''strategic stalemate'' in three to five years, meaning neither side would have enough advantage to win a decisive victory. **********One official who has been briefed on the most recent intelligence information said that even that forecast is ''optimistic, by a substantial amount'' when the economic decline in the Philippines and public sentiment opposed to Mr. Marcos are considered. **********Despite the ominous intelligence reports, Pentagon officials said this week that they envisioned no change in the Administration's strategy of coupling military aid to the Marcos Government with exhortations for open elections, sharing of military power and a breakup of the business monopolies that are blamed for the islands' economic trouble. **********More U.S. Training Teams **********In a sign of the continued commitment, according to officials, American military officers in Manila had scheduled a sharp increase this year in the military training teams that rotate in and out of the Philippines to train Filipino soldiers in equipment maintenance, logistics and administration. **********A Pentagon official noted that members of Congress have been wary of closer involvement with Mr. Marcos's Government, and he said the trainers would be closely confined to technical advice on American-supplied hardware. **********''We are not looking for advisers in the field,'' the official said. ''There is no contemplation of advisers in the Vietnam sense.'' **********The United States is committed by treaty to protect the Philippines from external attack, but is not obliged to help it cope with insurgency. **********The Pentagon has already come under criticism from some members of Congress for planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several years to upgrade aging installations and housing at the two American military bases on the Philippines. Navy and Air Force officials in the Philippines have requested $1.3 billion in construction money over the next seven years, although Pentagon officials said only a fraction is likely to be approved. **********Some Signs of Change **********Pentagon officials who deal with the Philippine military said they were somewhat encouraged by recent signs of change, including an increase in authority for anti-insurgency field commanders, more disciplining of soldiers who abuse civilians and small raises for the underpaid troops. **********They said American aid, which until a few years ago concentrated on equipment for combating foreign invaders, had been refocused to alleviate shortages of trucks, helicopters and radios that would be useful against guerrillas, and such essentials as uniforms and boots. **********But the officials said about 35 of the 100 generals in the Philippine military were cronies of Mr. Marcos who had been kept on out of personal loyalty, preventing the promotion of younger officers and damaging morale. This, the officials said, is a major barrier to improving the military. **********Vital Outpost **********The Philippines is considered a vital strategic outpost for supplying American military forces in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, guarding oil routes from the Persian Gulf and monitoring the growing Soviet military forces in the Pacific. **********Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base are the largest American military centers of their kind outside United States territory, and the most important Western outposts between Hawaii and Japan. **********According to Pentagon reports, these installations have taken on added importance in the last two years as a supply point for increased Navy patrols in the Indian Ocean, and because of an expansion of the Soviet Pacific Fleet based in Vladivostok and a major buildup of the Soviet port and airfield at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. **********The United States Pacific Command, based in Hawaii, has begun exploring the possibility of alternative sites 1,500 miles to the east on the islands of Guam and Tinian, in case the Philippine bases are cut off. Pentagon officials say such a move would mean a major setback for the United States military, and would cost from $2 billion to $8 billion. **********'The Wrong Direction' **********United States officials said the expansion of the New People's Army had taken place without any evidence of support from the Soviet Union or other foreign powers. Officials say that so far, the intensely nationalistic group has been determined to rely on arms captured from Philippine soldiers or bought on the black market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/business/earnings-boeing-up-53.5-ual-falls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 678, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Boeing Up 53.5%; UAL Falls", "print_headline": "EARNINGS;   Boeing Up 53.5%; UAL Falls", "body_text": " **********The Boeing Company reported yesterday that net income in the third quarter of 1985 rose 53.5 percent on a 40.5 percent rise in sales. **********The country's leading manufacturer of commercial jets attributed the improved results primarily to increased commercial jet transport business, higher interest income and reduced interest expense. **********Boeing, which is based in Seattle, said that net income in the latest three months advanced to $132 million, or 85 cents a share, from $86 million, or 59 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales climbed to $3.09 billion, from $2.20 billion. **********''Boeing's earnings were pretty much on target,'' said Jon D. Gruber, aerospace analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''The company is benefiting from a sharp increase in airline deliveries after demand being in the doldrums. I look for a strong fourth quarter with per-share results above $1.20 a share for quarter about $3.75 a share for the year.'' **********On the negative side, Boeing said, were lower earnings from United States Government contracts. It also increased spending for research, development and engineering. **********The company said that during the third quarter it took orders for 104 jet transports valued at about $3 billion, up from 55 planes valued at about $2.4 billion in the year-earlier period. Most of the orders in the latest quarter were for less expensive aircraft. **********Boeing said that its firm backlog of unfilled orders on Sept. 30 amounted to $22.6 billion, from $21.5 billion at the end of 1984. The current backlog is made up of $16.6 billion for commercial customers and $6 billion for the United States Government. UAL Inc.  UAL Inc., the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday reported a sharp drop in third-quarter net income, citing the after-effects of a pilots' strike. **********Earnings fell 66.7 percent, to $22.2 million, or 46 cents a share, from $66.7 million, or $1.75 a share, in the 1984 quarter. **********Revenues decreased 5.6 percent, to $1.7 billion, from $1.8 billion. The airline said that comparison was distorted by the 29-day strike the airline underwent in the second quarter by its pilots union. Richard J. Ferris, chairman, president and chief executive of UAL, said in a statement that considering the after-effects of the strike ''the modest consolidated third-quarter results were to be expected.'' **********Earnings at the airline subsidiary totaled $811,000 in the third quarter, compared with earnings of $62 million in the third quarter of 1984. Mr. Ferris said airline earnings suffered from a reduction in capacity because of flight crew training requirements and a program to restore flights that would ensure on-time operations. **********The Westin hotel subsidiary had earnings of $3.9 million, up 7 percent, compared to earnings of $3.7 million in 1984. **********The pretax earnings of UAL reflect a $27.3 million gain from the sale of GAB Business Services in July and gains of $23 million on the sales of certain leasehold interests. **********The results in the third quarter also include one month of operations of the Hertz Corporation, which was acquired in late August. T.W.A.  Trans World Airlines yesterday reported a loss of $13.5 million in the third quarter compared with a profit of $91.2 million, or $2.61 a share, in the third quarter last year. **********The airline said that results were hurt by a charge of $42.9 million for the termination of its merger agreement with the Texas Air Corporation before entering its merger agreement with Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor. **********Revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.08 billion, down 1.9 percent, from $1.06 billion in the third quarter last year. **********Richard D. Pearson, the president and chief operating officer of the carrier, said that in addition to the penalty payments for ending the merger agreement the third quarter was adversely affected by terrorist activities overseas. **********He added that domestic revenues were diluted by discounts and a softening of traffic. ----Earnings tables, D10."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/business/self-control-direct-investing.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1985-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1476, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SELF-CONTROL: DIRECT INVESTING", "print_headline": "SELF-CONTROL: DIRECT INVESTING", "body_text": " **********SEVENTEEN months ago Carmine Arena, a concert pianist and teacher, made his first real-estate investment, a five-story apartment building in the West 100's in Manhattan for under $125,000. Since then, he said, he has been ''overwhelmed'' with offers of up to 10 times that for the property. **********''I realize now there is no real mystery to real estate,'' Mr. Arena said of what he has learned about property investment and management. ''There's a certain amount of knowledge you need, and a certain amount of courage - and then you take the leap. I'm a neophyte at this, and I know I'm being carried along on a marvelous tide, but I feel great about it.'' **********A substantial appreciation of one's property while sheltering income from taxes is the beacon that has lured many people to real-estate investment. And many individuals have been foregoing partnerships and syndications in favor of direct investments, according to real-estate professionals and experts. The trend seems to reflect a growing sophistication about realty investments and a more variegated real-estate market. **********But perhaps the major attraction of direct investment, according to Hap Shashy, a tax partner with the Dallas office of the law firm of Jones, Day Reavis & Pogue, is exercising ''direct control over your investment, unlike what happens in a syndication arrangement, and also probably getting more for your money, because none of it is being diluted by syndication costs and other costs that essentially come off the top.'' **********An additional factor, said Austin K. Haldenstein, the president of a Manhattan real-estate concern bearing his name, is that many investors consider direct investing ''a way to get their feet wet in real estate.'' **********''They take on a small property, within the scope of their financial and managerial ability, and they use it to learn how to be a real-estate entrepreneur,'' he said. **********There is no accurate way to measure how many people invest directly in real estate or how much they invest, since it is an individual activity that only sometimes involves real-estate professionals. But the experts say a great many people invest a great amount - at least several trillion dollars - and that the figures are growing. **********One area of intense activity is the lively and growing market in the investment-ownership of condominium and cooperative apartments in New York City. Another active area is the increasingly sophisticated marketing of single-family homes for investment purposes. **********''More and more direct investors are treating real estate as a growth stock,'' said Lewis B. Kaye, president of L.B. Kaye Associates, a real-estate firm in Manhattan. ''Properties are being bought not for their return to the bottom line, but for their appreciation, and that's really pushing the market. People have seen that real-estate values rise sharply and are confident that will continue.'' Many investors also buy real estate as a tax shelter. **********At the same time, real-estate investing can provide a secure financial foundation independent of one's salary. That's why Sidney Bernstein, a sales representative for a children's apparel firm, and his wife Adele bought four cooperative apartments in the Glen Oaks Village development in Queens, alongside the one in which they live. **********The Bernsteins paid $18,000 in 1981 for their own two-bedroom apartment, and bought the other four over the next two years for a total of $93,000. They made a total down payment of about $9,500 for the one- and two-bedroom apartments, and rent them for $550 to $650 a month. **********Indeed, except for the very wealthy, direct investors in real estate are usually confined to lesser-priced single-family homes and small apartment and commercial buildings. **********''The direct investor usually is closed off from larger and more lucrative properties, such as downtown office buildings or good-sized shopping centers,'' said Richard Kateley, senior vice president of the Real Estate Research Corporation, a consulting company based in Chicago, ''because those properties entail really significant dollar investments.'' **********To underscore the point, Mr. Kateley posed the hypothetical example of a building worth $1 million, a price very much toward the bottom of the real-estate ladder. If the investor were to get, say, an 80-percent mortgage, that would require a down payment of $200,000. This would cover only the equity, and the investor would need additional money to cover maintenance, repair and other incidental costs. **********''Even with five people involved,'' Mr. Kateley said, ''I'm still talking about people who have significant amounts of cash to sink into something. For real-estate investments of any noticeable dollar size, an investor needs a strong income.'' **********However, as the situation of Mr. Arena, the musician and newcomer to the realty market, indicates, the returns or potential returns to an investor with even a single, well-chosen property can be substantial. **********Mr. Arena bought his apartment building, in the West Side neighborhood of Manhattan Valley, less than 10 blocks from Columbia University, Central Park and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, with a down payment of half the purchase price. He took a five-year balloon mortgage for the balance. **********The building's 15 apartments are regulated under New York City's rent-stabilization system, with monthly rents ranging from $150 to $475. With maintenance and labor costs included, Mr. Arena said, he is breaking even on the building. But, as Mr. Arena and others said, the immediate bottom-line result for direct investors has become less important than the property's potential future value, its appreciation. **********Mr. Arena said that when he was considering the property, ''I wanted to know all about the rent roll and other things to get some clue as to how much I should offer and what I should expect from it in the future. But I've learned that the old formulas don't apply now, not when in just two years the same building draws offers of 10 times what I paid for it.'' **********The same reasoning applies to single-family homes, according to Joel Bernstein, president of the Epic Residential Network Inc., a 15-month-old national real-estate company that sells single-family homes to investors. ''There are huge numbers of people with $15,000 to $25,000 to invest, and they are looking for some way to get into the real-estate game,'' said Mr. Bernstein from Epic's headquarters in Fairfax, Va. Mr. Bernstein said that Epic usually has 500 to 600 homes in its inventory and has been selling about 200 a month, with an average price of between $70,000 and $80,000. **********Vacation-home investments have always been one of the most active areas of direct investing in real estate, Dennis Hess, the president of Merrill Lynch Realty, noted. Such homes ''are really a special kind of investment, where other, noneconomic factors come into play,'' he said. ''They're not for those people strictly looking for the biggest bang for their investment dollar.'' **********People most often invest in vacation homes in areas where they themselves vacation, Mr. Hess said, and do so out of an emotional attachment to the area, as well as a desire for economic gain. In fact, he said, most vacation-home investors can expect only to break even when their debt service and management fees are compared with their interest and mortgage payments and depreciation. **********The Treasury Department proposals now before Congress have had a somewhat chilling effect on investments in vacation homes, real-estate experts agree. For example, the Treasury has proposed capping the deductibility of interest, other than that for a primary residence, at $5,000 a year above investment income. Approval of this proposal would be a sharp blow to the market in vacation homes, Mr. Hess said. **********In addition, Mr. Shashy, the Dallas lawyer, said, several other proposed revisions would ''have the affect of detracting from the overall investment appeal of real estate, including direct investing.'' He cited the proposal to eliminate preferential treatment of capital gains and replace it with an index keyed to inflation. ''A lot of people make a lot of money by investing in real estate where the appreciation outpaces inflation,'' Mr. Shashy said, ''so such a change would negatively impact on real estate's investment appeal to them.'' **********The Treasury has also asked Congress to end Federal deductions for state and local taxes, including property taxes, a move that could have a negative effect on the real-estate investing market. The fate of all the Treasury proposals in Congress is uncertain, analysts say, but investors had best pay attention to the news from Washington. **********''Direct investing is exciting, and it can be good to you, but you're going to be in trouble if you don't know what you're doing,'' said Stanley Thea, a Manhattan-based realtor. ''It's not something to do without a great deal of thought.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/business/l-shrinking-oil-165645.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shrinking Oil", "print_headline": "Shrinking Oil", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Your excellent review of the ongoing shakeout in the nation's oil industry (''Big Oil Starts Thinking Smaller,'' March 17) raises some serious questions about the companies' top- level management. **********With the exception of Shell Oil (owned completely by Royal Dutch/ Shell and which, contrary to the article, acquired the Belridge Oil Company in 1979 for $3.6 billion), nearly all major American oil companies have made gross miscalculations about their businesses, wasted billions of dollars in disastrous diversification, and stamped their ineptness on many areas of government policy. **********Oil company executives assumed as late as 1981 that crude oil prices would rise as high as $60 a barrel in 1985.

Volcker, Fed chairman, and Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. According to a Congressional source at the meeting, the Fed's staff found that a majority of the closed thrift units probably had net worth below 5.5 percent, which is the minimum level to qualify for deposit insurance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The corporation is managed by the three-member bank board. **********In an effort to contain the Ohio banking crisis while not jeopardizing its own strained insurance fund, the bank board conditionally approved the deposit insurance application of one of the Ohio thrift units, the Columbia Savings and Loan Company of Cincinnati. **********The bank board said Columbia's application had been filed almost a year ago but that it had expedited its approval in the wake of the banking crisis centered in Cincinnati. **********The implication of the Federal Reserve analysis, according to banking sources, is that most of the 71 state- chartered thrift units that experienced a swift erosion of public confidence in the wake of the collapse of the Home State Savings Bank would have to look to the Federal Reserve, rather than the bank board, for assistance. **********Such assistance could come in two ways. The Federal Reserve System can lend money to financial institutions to help them weather a run by depositors. It also has the power to approve the purchase of Ohio thrift institutions by stronger Ohio banks or out-of-state banks. **********''Since the collapse of Home State, we've received 28 inquiries and three formal applications for membership in the F.S.L.I.C.,'' said Robert Moore, a spokesman for the bank board. He added that five other thrift units, including Columbia, had applied for membership before the banking crisis. He said approval of the applications was being expedited by the bank board, but that at best the process would not be quick. **********As the problems with the Ohio thrift units grew during the week, with huge lines of depositors seeking to withdraw their money, the reserves of the private deposit insurance company - the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund - were depleted. In an emergency measure, a second fund was set up with a $40 million injection of funds from the State of Ohio and a $50 million injection by member thrift units. But that was not enough to buttress the public's confidence. **********In Washington, pressure mounted on the bank board to provide swift, blanket deposit insurance to restore the public's confidence. But meetings between four Ohio Representatives and Mr. Gray on Thursday produced little. ''The bank board just did not have the statutory authority to provide such blanket insurance,'' said Representative Willis D. Gradison Jr., an Ohio Republican who attended the meeting. **********Consequently, the bankers and legislators turned to the Federal Reserve, which had provided loans to the banks through its discount window during most of the week at an 8 percent interest rate. Yesterday, the Fed said it would continue to make the funds available on Monday. **********''At this moment, the Fed seems best able to work with the state,'' Mr. Gradison said.

It is a subsidiary of Honeywell Inc., a leading United States military contractor with headquarters in Minneapolis. **********Tetra Tech International helps manage several key Omani Government agencies in addition to Masandam Province, and the company and its parent work for both commercial and government customers in several other Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, as well as in the United States. **********The president of Tetra Tech International and the man who helped to get its contract in Oman is James H. Critchfield, who, before joining the company in 1975, had an interest in Oman, working for the C.I.A. both as head of the Middle East desk and later as the chief intelligence official for energy, according to former intelligence officials and public documents. **********Mr. Critchfield is among about 20 American, British and Arab advisers to the country's ruler, Sultan Qabus bin Said, who have helped shape the country's foreign and domestic policies. Like Mr. Critchfield, many of the advisers have intelligence backgrounds. **********In an interview late last year, Mr. Critchfield acknowledged that he is one of the closest American advisers to Oman's ruler, and he said he no longer had anything to do with the C.I.A. **********Yet there is a widespread perception in Oman that Mr. Critchfield and others with intelligence backgrounds retain ties to their former employers. As a result, Western and Omani officials said, the role of Westerners in Oman has become a subject of dispute. **********An Active Area For Spy Agencies **********The Middle East has long been a caldron of intrigue and foreign intelligence activities by both Western and Communist countries; the Russians, the officials noted, are known to be active throughout much of the region, primarily in Syria, Libya and Southern Yemen. **********In addition, Western and Arab officials said, for many in the Middle East, truth and rumor are often blurred, and perceptions tend to be as politically important as fact. One of the legacies, they said, is that Omanis tend to believe that former associations with intelligence agencies continue. **********The perceptions are often enhanced by the nature of the C.I.A. itself, the officials said, in part because the agency has a variety of relationships with outsiders ranging from contract employees to part-time informants to contacts like businessmen and journalists who debrief the agency on various matters. **********The issue of advisers in Oman figures in an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into millions of dollars in payments made by Ashland Oil to secure business in Oman. **********The investigation is into possible violations by Ashland of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids payments by American companies to foreign officials. The recipients of some of the payments, Timothy Landon, a British military official, and Yehia Omar, a Libyan exile, have both been Omani advisers, according to official diplomatic registers. **********Mr. Landon and Mr. Omar have had past dealings with the C.I.A., according to several Omani officials, former American intelligence officials and the Ashland public documents, which were submitted to a Congressional committee and filed with the S.E.C. **********Mr. Landon, who lives in England and no longer has an official role in Oman, declined a request to be interviewed. A spokesman for Mr. Omar, who also no longer has an official role in Oman, said Mr. Omar would not talk with the press. **********Roles for Foreigners After 1970 Coup **********The relationships between foreign advisers and Oman blossomed soon after the coup in 1970 that brought Sultan Qabus to power, according to Omani and Western officials, some of the advisers and public documents. **********Since then, the advisers have been involved in writing Omani laws, establishing diplomatic relationships between Oman and its neighbors, providing security for the nation's ruler and lobbying for Oman in the United States. **********In 1971, Robert B. Anderson, a former Secretary of the Treasury in the Eisenhower Administration, became an unpaid ecomomic adviser to the Sultan. His job, he said in an interview late last year, was ''to consult on ways to improve their economy'' and get Oman ''out from under the dominance of the British,'' who arrived in the country before the American advisers. **********Mr. Anderson said his Omani role was arranged in part by Ghassan Shakir, a Saudi with close ties to the United States and Mr. Anderson. Mr. Shakir also became an adviser to the Sultan, as did Mr. Omar, the Libyan exile, according to American intelligence officials and a 1981 report prepared by Ashland Oil lawyers for the company's board of directors. The report investigated allegations by Ashland officials involved in Omani business ventures that payments to Mr. Omar and Mr. Landon had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; it concluded that the payments did not violate the law. **********Mr. Omar and Mr. Shakir later came under criticism from British bankers and Omani officials for millions of dollars in commissions they made during Oman's development in the 1970's, according to Omani officials and the 1981 Ashland report filed with the S.E.C. No formal charges were ever brought against the two men. **********Mr. Shakir, who lives in Saudi Arabia, could not be reached for comment through his business associates, who declined to discuss his work in Oman. **********The Sultan's new, outside economic advisers also became involved in foreign affairs. Mr. Anderson said he was personally responsible for Oman's re- establishing long dormant diplomatic relations with key neighbors like Saudi Arabia. **********In 1971, as a result of Mr. Anderson's close ties with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Sultan Qabus made a state visit to Saudi Arabia, leading to the eventual establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, according to Mr. Anderson and American and Omani officials. **********In another diplomatic venture, Mr. Omar helped smooth Oman's relations with other Arab countries and played a key role in getting the Sultan to refrain from denouncing Egypt for signing the 1978 Camp David accords, according to several Omani officials and Ashland oil documents that have been made public. **********Omanis Turned To Other Americans **********The Omanis turned to other Americans to assist in economic development. In 1972, an American energy consultant, C. Stirling Snodgrass, was brought in by the Omanis to organize that country's petroleum ministry, according to Omani officials and other sources. **********According to two former United States intelligence officials, while working for Oman, Mr. Snodgrass also had a secret relationship with the C.I.A. and headed two C.I.A.-owned energy consulting companies in Washington until he died in 1974. **********Thomas W. Hill Jr., an American attorney, became legal adviser to the Sultan in 1972 as a result of introductions to Omani officials by Mr. Anderson, according to a former American adviser to the Omani Government. Over the next several years Mr. Hill was said to have written several Omani laws in the areas of commerce, banking and ethics. **********In addition, Mr. Hill was said to have provided a legal opinion that enabled Oman to void an earlier petroleum concession and award it, with the help of Mr. Anderson, to another venture. **********Mr. Hill no longer works for the Omani Government, but still does business in the country representing foreign businessmen. Mr. Hill was asked to be interviewed on his involvement in Oman and declined to comment, but he did say that he had not ever worked for the C.I.A. **********On another matter, Mr. Anderson said that he had arranged a marine survey contract in the early 1970's for an American company. **********The Sultan's uncle, Tariq bin-Taimur, who was Prime Minister at the time, voiced concern about the marine contract and asserted that it was a cover for C.I.A. operations in the Indian Ocean, according to Omani and British officials. The assertion was subsequently denied by Americans working on the project. **********U.S. Embassy Aide Asked About C.I.A. **********C. Patrick Quinlan, who was charge d'affaires and the highest-ranking State Department official in the country in the early 1970's, said in an interview in 1983 that he had raised questions about C.I.A. connections to Omani advisers. Mr. Quinlan said his protests were based on his concern that foreign policy was being undermined by back-channel discussions. **********''I discovered that the C.I.A. had connections with Robert Anderson and Omar,'' he said. **********Referring to perceptions by many Omanis, he added: ''It was widely believed they were associated with the C.I.A., and I didn't know what representations they were making to his majesty in the name of the United States. They were unofficial representatives of the U.S. Government.'' **********Mr. Quinlan said he was also concerned about ''the large commissions'' being paid to Mr. Omar. In addition, he said, he recommended that ties between the C.I.A. and the Omani advisers be dropped. **********But, he said, he soon changed jobs and never heard back from the State Department. State Department officials said they were unable to find the relevant documents in response to a two-year effort to obtain them under the Freedom of Information Act. **********Mr. Anderson said in an interview that he was unaware of Mr. Quinlan's protests. He said he had voluntarily reported information to the C.I.A., ''if I learned something of advantage to the Administration,'' but said he had not had any ''official responsibilities'' on behalf of the agency. **********A Washington attorney who has represented Mr. Omar, Myles Ambrose, said Mr. Omar did not talk to the press. **********Sultan Visited U.S., And Relations Improved **********In 1975, with the help of Mr. Omar, Sultan Qabus made his first official visit to the United States, meeting with President Ford and other top officials, according to Omani officials. One former Omani official said that at the meeting, the United States agreed to the sale of TOW antitank missiles to Oman and that Mr. Omar received a commission on the sale. **********Relations between the United States and Oman improved after the 1975 meetings. In the next few years, wealthy advisers to the Omanis like Mr. Omar and Dr. Omar Zawawi, an Omani businessman and adviser to the Sultan, began making investments in the United States and elsewhere with the help of Mr. Hill, Mr. Critchfield and several former officials who had left the Ford and Nixon Administrations. according to public records. Dr. Zawawi, many advisers say, has come to symbolize American interests in Oman because he represents so many American and British companies doing business there. **********Others who became involved in Oman, according to the Western and Omani officials, included a former C.I.A. employee who installed security devices and electronic gear in the palace. He was still an adviser in charge of communications for the palace as of December 1984, the officials said. **********Chester A. Nagle, whom Omani and Western officials and public Ashland documents identified as another former Central Intelligence Agency employee, was involved in the sale of security equipment to Oman, according to an Omani official. **********Mr. Nagle now edits a military and diplomacy magazine in Virginia. After repeated requests for an interview, Mr. Nagle's administrative assistant, Leslie Roper, said, ''I don't think he has anything he wants to talk to you about.'' **********In 1979, Mr. Nagle registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent of Oman, working for the palace office until 1982, according to public records. State Department documents show that in 1983, Mr. Nagle was listed as a special assistant to the palace office. **********According to Omani and American officials and foreign agent registration records at the Justice Department that were filed by Mr. Nagle, Mr. Nagle was hired by Mr. Landon, the British military officer. **********Mr. Landon has held various official positions within Oman. Though he is now based in England and most of his Omani dealings are in the commercial area, he is still considered to have the best access to the Sultan among non- Omanis, Omani and Western officials said. **********According to an Omani adviser, Mr. Landon is also the main connection in Oman for Mr. Critchfield, the president of Tetra Tech. **********Some See Company As Political Liability **********A few Omani officials said that the activities of Mr. Critchfield and his company could become a political liability for the Omani Government should more Omanis learn about the company's role in the country. **********They said that some Omanis objected to the Sultan's having turned over as much civil authority to a private company, especially because of the widespread perception that Mr. Critchfield retained ties to the C.I.A. despite Mr. Critchfield's denial of any present links to the agency. **********But other Omani officials praised Tetra Tech's work and said Mr. Critchfield had been a positive influence in trying to curb corruption within Oman and expand the country's educational and public services. **********In the Masandam province, Tetra Tech is in charge of speeding the development of the sparsely populated but strategic area and overseeing the development of communications, construction, transportation, public health, water, electricity, roads and ports and harbors, according to a Tetra Tech official. The American company has the same arrangement in another strategic province, Dhahira. **********Some Omani and American officials have criticized the company's arrangements with the Omani Government in Masandam, in part, they said, because of the large payments the company receives from the Omani Government to develop the area. A Tetra Tech spokesman defended the size of the contract on the grounds of the region's strategic importance and the difficulty and expense of development in the harsh mountainous terrain. **********Tetra Tech also advises the petroleum ministry on hydrocarbons, oil and gas as well as providing technical staff to the Omani Public Authority for Water Resources."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/business/navy-says-it-knew-of-lewis-s-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Wayne Biddle", "pub_date": "1985-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 652, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NAVY SAYS IT KNEW OF LEWIS'S PLANS", "print_headline": "NAVY SAYS IT KNEW OF LEWIS'S PLANS", "body_text": " **********Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. said today that the retirement of the chairman of the General Dynamics Corporation did not affect his decision on how to discipline the company over its dealings with the Navy. **********Speaking for Mr. Lehman, who spent most of the day at Naval Academy commencement exercises in Annapolis, Md., Navy Capt. Brent Baker said at the Pentagon that General Dynamics lawyers had informed the Navy's chief counsel last Friday that David S. Lewis, chairman of the company, would leave by the end of this year. General Dynamics announced the retirement today. **********But Captain Baker said the decision to penalize General Dynamics for what the Navy regards as ''pervasive'' business misconduct had already been made and was not changed because of the knowledge of Mr. Lewis's retirement. **********Details of Navy's Actions **********In announcing the decision Tuesday, Secretary Lehman disclosed the cancellation of two Navy contracts and the suspension for the time being of new contract awards at two of the company's divisions. He also said the company was being fined $676,283 for having given gratuities to Adm. Hyman Rickover. Mr. Lehman, however, rejected a recommendation by the Defense Department's Inspector General that Mr. Lewis and two other General Dynamics executives be barred from Defense Department procurement. **********Admiral Rickover, who is retired, released a statement today through his lawyers saying that his ''conscience is clear'' regarding the gifts received from General Dynamics. **********''I have always acted in the best interest of the Navy and my country during my 64 years of military service,'' Admiral Rickover said. ''No gratuity or favor ever affected any decision I made.'' **********Censure for the Admiral **********Mr. Lehman said Tuesday that the 85-year-old admiral, who founded the Navy's nuclear-powered submarine program, had been officially censured by the Navy for taking $67,628.30 in gratuities from General Dynamics between 1961 and 1977. The company's Electric Boat division at Groton, Conn., has been a major supplier of such vessels for many years. **********Mr. Lehman added that the admiral's acceptance of the gifts was ''unethical, if not illegal.'' Many of the gifts, which he said included ''trinkets'' such as teak trays, were ''suggested, encouraged and even demanded'' by Admiral Rickover during his tenure as head of the Navy's submarine program. **********Censure was the strongest administrative punishment of Admiral Rickover that was available, a Navy spokesman explained today. The statute of limitations for any criminal charges concerning the gifts has expired, the spokesman said. **********Comment From Proxmire **********In a speech on the Senate floor, which is debating the 1986 military authorization this week, William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat who has led investigations of General Dynamics' business conduct, criticized Secretary Lehman for having ''tapped the company on the wrist'' while ''Admiral Rickover has been hit with a baseball bat.'' **********Senator Proxmire added, ''If Lewis stepping down was part of a deal between General Dynamics and the Navy to get anyone off the hook of ultimate responsibility, it won't work.'' **********Representative Bill Nichols, the Alabama Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee, called Mr. Lehman's actions ''a pretty strong dose of medicine,'' given General Dynamics' weapons-building role. **********Legislation on Expenses **********In a matter that grew out of Congressional investigations into improper billings submitted to the Government by General Dynamics, the House Armed Services Committee today approved legislation that would tighten up on contractors' overhead charges. The bill, known as the Allowable Cost Reform Act, now goes to the House floor. Passage is expected. **********In another case involving misconduct by a major military contractor, spokesmen for the Justice Department and the General Electric Company declined to comment on reports that that company had agreed to pay $2 million in civil penalties after pleading guilty to defrauding the Pentagon of $800,000 on military contracts.

Government Securities Inc. and the subsequent banking panic in Ohio, many have called for stringent new regulation of the government securities market. While the public needs greater protection against abuses - especially from unscrupulous dealers - Congress should avoid heavy-handed intervention, which could easily do more harm than good. **********Government securities, alone among the major financial markets, have been largely unregulated. The notes were free of any threat of default and the major players were securities dealers, commercial banks, corporations and pension funds, all sophisticated investors capable of guarding their own interests. **********Rising and more volatile interest rates and growing Federal debt changed the market in the late 1970's. One change was the growing use of ''repurchase agreements,'' or repos, in which investors purchase securities from a dealer who agrees to buy them back at a future date for a higher price that reflects the interest earned. Repos greatly increased both the market's liquidity and its ability to absorb the growing Federal debt. **********However, they also introduced hazards, as dealers developed reverse repos (like repos, except securities are bought from customers, with an agreement to sell them back at a set, higher price), futures contracts and other variations. The proliferation of techniques increased interdependence, making participants vulnerable to a collapse in any one area. **********A second change was the entry into the market of cautious but less sophisticated investors, such as school districts, municipalities and small financial institutions. Repos offered them seemingly safe and convenient cash-management investments. **********However, a number of unscrupulous dealers realized they could take advantage of the growing presence of unsophisticated investors, many of whom were unaware that they even could - let alone should - protect themselves from losses by taking possession of the government security involved in a repo. Dealers used securities that they should have turned over to buyers as collateral for perhaps two or three other investments. **********The result has been a string of failures in the last three years, starting with Drysdale Government Securities in 1982. These defaults have prompted reforms in repurchase agreements, increased monitoring of major dealers by the Federal Reserve and efforts by the Fed to improve self-regulation. Yet, it was evident in the E.S.M. collapse that many investors still failed to take basic precautions. **********Given the experience of recent years, it may no longer be realistic to rely on buyers' sophistication to prevent abuses. Instead, it may be simpler for the Government itself to police the few hundred dealers. **********But regulation could raise the dealers' cost of doing business, in turn raising the cost of financing the national debt. If regulation were to increase interest rates on Treasury securities by as little as one-tenth of a percentage point, Federal net interest expenditures would rise by $2 billion a year. We must carefully weigh those costs against the benefits that might accrue from regulation. **********Such policing need not be as involved as that which the Securities and Exchange Commission requires of public companies and corporate securities dealers - periodic financial statements, full examination of financial operations and disclosure to investors. This would be costly and time-consuming. Rather, Congress should consider four approaches. **********One option is the capital-adequacy guidelines recently proposed by the Fed. To give teeth to the guidelines, banks that clear transactions for government securities dealers could be required to assure that the dealers have enough capital to survive an adverse interest rate move. Bank regulators would help maintain compliance, although opportunities for mistakes and deception would still exist. **********Asecond option would be to create **********a self-regulatory organization **********for government-security dealers under the aegis of the Fed. The organization would set standards and keep a list of reputable dealers, but it couldn't protect the public from renegade dealers or from frauds. **********Third, the Federal Reserve could be given authority to create a registry of approved government securities dealers. Membership would be voluntary, and the Fed would have the power to investigate the financial conditions of registered dealers. **********Fourth, mandatory delivery of securities pledged in repos should be required, with appropriate notation in the Fed's book-entry system to identify the beneficial owner of the securities. Here again, the clearing banks might be the best monitors. **********These options would enhance the self-policing tendencies of the market without the cost of full regulation. While they might not eliminate failures among government securities dealers, they would reduce the number and severity of incidents. Even these measures may be insufficient. But before we move to full-scale regulation, with all its costs and burdens, we should try these options."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/world/for-tunisians-in-libya-an-abrupt-homecoming.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1985-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1066, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR TUNISIANS IN LIBYA, AN ABRUPT HOMECOMING", "print_headline": "FOR TUNISIANS IN LIBYA, AN ABRUPT HOMECOMING", "body_text": " **********The billboard on the far side of the Tunisian-Libyan border here said ''Welcome to You'' in Arabic and showed Col.

Though few Tunisians are now being taken to the border forcibly by the Libyans, most have been dismissed from their jobs and are living in seclusion to avoid taunts from neighborhood ''revolutionary committees,'' according to Tunisians who left Libya recently. **********Attempts by Morocco and Kuwait to mediate are stalled, as Tunisia has refused to enter into talks with Libya until the expulsions stop. Tunisian officials said they hoped to put pressure on Libya, which is said to be suffering from shortages of bakers, weavers and other skilled workers. Tunisians filled many of those jobs. **********Tunisia's toughness is an about-face for a nation that until now has sought to accommodate Colonel Qaddafi. **********''For us, this represents a complete change of perception about Libya,'' Mahmoud Mestiri, Secretary of State to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview. He said the tension would continue as long as Colonel Qaddafi remained in power. **********A reduction in Tunisian, Egyptian and other foreign workers had been planned for months by Libya because the country, oil-rich but underpopulated, had been hurt by the decline in world oil prices. But the ferocity of the Tunisian evictions made them a special case. **********In the regional capital of Medenine, Abdel Majid Ben Mohammed, 22, who said he had worked as a tractor driver in the town of Sebha, said the Libyan police had tortured him with electric prods. He said that he was hospitalized for three days, and that after he sought to have pictures taken of the scars on his back, he was jailed and then taken to the border. **********Habib Mohammed, who said he worked for 10 years in Tripoli as a cook, said he had been picked up by the police, interrogated and taken straight to the border with his wife and two children. He said he had no idea what had become of his house and belongings. **********Osine Ali, 26, said he had lost a year's savings. ''They told me if I want my money to go ask Reagan,'' he said. **********'Arabian' Citizenship Offered **********Almost all the evicted said they had first been offered ''Arabian'' citizenship in the united Arab nation envisioned by Colonel Qaddafi. All said they had refused. **********As he crossed the border here with two friends, Ridha Mohammed, a lanky 21-year-old, explained, ''I'm Tunisian, not Arabian.'' **********There was no way here to confirm the stories, but many similar ones have been reported. **********The return presents new hardships. Few of those returning have found jobs. Tunisia, though economically pressed, is starting emergency job programs. **********''It will take time, but we will integrate them into the economy,'' Planning Minister Ismail Khelil said in an interview. **********Most of the returning Tunisians said they agreed with Mohammed Ben Mohammed, a 54-year-old kitchen worker who had lived in Libya for 17 years. He said he would not go back even if tensions ended.

Many officials had expected the Russians to follow past practice and expel only a token contingent of Britons from Moscow. **********There was no immediate response from Moscow to the announcement today. **********The six Russians in today's order were given until Oct. 7 to leave the country. Britain said each had been declared persona non grata as a result of participation in ''the unacceptable activities of the Soviet intelligence services'' in Britain. **********Military Aides to Be Ousted **********The six Russians named today were Yevgeny I. Safronov, first secretary of the Soviet Embassy; Col. Viktor A. Mishin, assistant air attache; Viktor V. Daranov, an embassy clerk; Aleksander I. Yerokhin, a clerk in the military attache's office; Ivan I. Vikulov, director of Anglo-Soviet shipping activities, and Sergei A. Volovets, correspondent for the Soviet press feature syndicate Novosti. **********NATO intelligence sources singled out the expulsion orders for Colonel Mishin and Mr. Yerokhin as evidence that the British had moved beyond the K.G.B. to oust Russians connected with the G.R.U., the Soviet military intelligence agency. **********In doing so, one source said, the British were inviting the wholesale expulsion of their own army, air and naval attaches in Moscow. The entire process, he added, leaves the British with very few known spies to watch. **********''It will be interesting to see how the Russians fill this gap,'' he said. ''My guess is that they will depend in the immediate future on illegals.'' That term is used for spies who have established false identities in civilian life. **********An experienced Foreign Office official said the decision to expel the six Russians had been taken after ''deep and anxious'' discussion. The Government, he said, still hopes for an improvement in relations with the Soviet Union. **********But at the same time, a senior British official said the Soviet move against the 25 Britons had convinced the Government that it should move against other purported Russian agents in Britain. **********The information implicating the six in spying was said to have come from the Russian K.G.B. agent Oleg A. Gordiyevsky, whose defection was announced last Thursday, the day the British announced their first expulsion of Soviet citizens. Western intelligence officials said last week that Mr. Gordiyevsky, identified as the London chief of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, had been working for Britain as a double agent for nearly 20 years. He is said to have defected in late July or August because he feared that his activities had been discovered by Moscow. **********The latest British move followed a series of consultations Sunday night in which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met with her Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and her Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd. As Home Secretary, Mr. Hurd oversees the work of counterintelligence services. **********Lev A. Parshin, the acting charge d'affaires in the Soviet Embassy, was summoned to the Foreign Office late this afternoon and told of the new expulsion order. By that time Mrs. Thatcher had left on a visit to Egypt and Jordan. **********The expulsions will reduce the number of Soviet diplomats and other officials in Britain from 211 to 205. **********'Incontrovertible Evidence' **********Derek Thomas, political director at the Foreign Office, cited ''incontroverible evidence'' that the six were engaged in spying. The evidence was supplied by Mr. Gordiyevsky, British officials said. **********The unanswered question, according to allied intelligence sources, is the number of other spies who have been identified by the Russian defector. A second question, these sources said, is how many of them are under British surveillance. **********Mr. Thomas told Mr. Parshin that ''the British Government has worked hard to improve Anglo-Soviet political and commercial relations'' but that ouster of the 25 Britons from Moscow ''could not but set back that process.'' **********The Government, according to an industrialist involved in arms production, is concerned with the attention Soviet spies have concentrated on some of Britain's advanced military technology, including the Ptarmigan command and control system and antisubmarine warfare detection systems. **********Political commentators called the Government action ''natural under the circumstances.'' **********''If the Prime Minister wants to live up to her billing as the 'Iron Lady,' '' one said, ''then she must be as tough with the Russians as she was three years ago with the Argentines.'' **********A statement issued by the Soviet Embassy tonight indicated that Moscow might reply to the British action with further expulsions of British personnel. The statement called the British action ''provocative and vindictive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/business/inland-steel-sees-deficit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inland Steel Sees Deficit", "print_headline": "Inland Steel Sees Deficit", "body_text": " **********The Inland Steel Company said today that it expects to report a net loss of about $50 million, or $2 a share, in the third quarter and that the company will eliminate its 12.5-cents-a-share quarterly common stock dividend that would have been paid on Dec. 1. **********Inland attributed the impending loss to ''weak market conditions, reflecting continued high levels of imports and lower price realizations.'' **********It said that omitting the dividend would ''preserve liquidity at a time when modernization and new facility investments'' were being made in its integrated steelmaking and steel service center divisions. **********The company said that quarterly dividend payments would continue on two series of convertible preferred stock. **********Inland, the nation's fourth-largest steel producer, reported a net loss of $29.6 million in the second quarter.

That first St. Nick is said to have gained his reputation for generosity by saving three innocent men condemned to death, rescuing three girls from prostitution by throwing a sack of gold through their parents' window, and bringing back to life three boys who had been pickled by an innkeeper to feed his guests. **********Today's Ded Moroz contents himself with appearing at public New Year's tree celebrations, where he leads children in songs and dances, poses riddles and hands out gifts. **********Another ritual is being played out, with increasing weariness, in the Hall of Columns, an ornate room in the House of Unions. Once a noblemen's club and later the setting for Stalin's show trials of the 1930's, the House of Unions was draped in black a week ago for the lying-in-state of Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov. **********Today Anatoly Karpov and his challenger, Gary Kasparov, had been scheduled to sit down to their 37th game in a world chess championship match that has dragged on longer than any in history.

But the two men have been locked for more than 100 days in a grueling duel of draws that has begun to seem as if it will go on forever. **********In their search for omens about the coming year, some Russians are turning east, where the Oriental calendar has long held a fascination for them. The trade union newspaper Trud reported that 1985 is the year of the water buffalo. It quoted an ethnologist from the University of Hanoi as predicting a quiet year with success at the workplace and without serious problems in family life. **********Since the water buffalo is a quiet creature, the Vietnamese professor, Vu Minh Trang, counseled calm behavior on New Year's Eve, ''avoiding excesses.'' **********A Moscow-based Vietnamese journalist, when questioned by telephone, dismissed such predictions as old- fashioned. He said he preferred to read Pravda to learn about the world. **********Russians have their own superstitions about the holiday, and some traditionalists say it is vital that each household carry out 25 tasks on New Year's Eve. Others believe that no work at all should be done. **********In the restored Znamensky Church, which is now a concert hall, Dmitri Pokrovsky's Ensemble of traditional singers staged a New Year's Eve presentation of Christmas dances and games of Old Russia. **********One dance, with hooded men and the clashing of tambourines and saw blades, harked back to pre-Christian times. Another, involving puppets, told the story of the birth of Jesus, highlighting Herod's slaughter of the Holy Innocents. In the light of small candles, the audience in the former church watched these semi- pagan, semi-Christian rituals of the past, on the eve of Russia's atheist New Year. **********As the Russian proverb has it, ''On New Year's Eve, even the birds have beer.'' Russia's only truly secular holiday generates an excitement that is not found on national celebrations as May Day or the Nov. 7 anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. **********Streets are strung with lights. Shops, specially stocked for the occasion, are emptied of their wine, cakes, fruits and sausages. In parks around town, children gathered around New Year's trees and joined Ded Moroz for troika rides. Gorky Park, its winding paths iced over for skaters, lighted up its Ferris wheel and put on a fireworks display. **********Stoleshnikov Pereulok, a small shopping street in the heart of Moscow, has been turned into a pedestrian mall for New Year's. In this city of shortages, only a few stands sell prepackaged New Year's treats of candies, biscuits and tangerines. **********But a holiday spirit could be felt at sidewalk stands where heavily bundled saleswomen hand out sweet rolls and three-kopeck paper cups of tea from giant samovars.

Since the Treasury made its modified flat tax proposals in November, tax-oriented real estate investments have fallen from favor, as investors became concerned that tax changes would reduce the future value of interest and depreciation deductions. **********Many investors now equate economic real estate investments with unleveraged programs, partnerships in which properties are purchased for large amounts of cash and little or no debt. Highly leveraged programs have become synonymous with ''tax deals.'' **********Statistics illustrate the trend. In the first half of 1985, sales of leveraged real estate limited partnerships to the public were down 4.8 percent from the first half of 1984, to $1.095 billion. Sales of unleveraged partnerships surged 48.5 percent, to $1.157 billion, according to Robert A. Stanger & Company, a Shrewsbury, N.J., concern that tracks real estate investments. **********Most real estate professionals, though, look down on unleveraged programs. The best that can be said for unleveraged partnerships, the professionals say, is that they are low-risk deals. If you buy a property for all cash, there is virtually no chance that you will lose it through foreclosure. Because these partnerships do not generate tax losses to offset other income, risk of an Internal Revenue Service audit is scant. **********But low risk usually means low reward. If you invest in an unleveraged program, you are reducing your potential for gain. ''Real estate investors have made more money from appreciation than from tax savings or cash distributions,'' said Paul Dunn, president of McNeil Securities, the marketing arm of the Robert A. McNeil Corporation, a syndicator in San Mateo, Calif. ''With leverage, you can increase your returns from property appreciation.'' **********The idea is easy to grasp for anyone who has ever sold a house. Suppose you bought that house for $50,000 and sold it for $100,000. If you paid all cash, you have a 100 percent profit on your investment. But if you bought the house with a 20 percent down payment ($10,000) and leveraged the balance by taking out a mortgage, you would have a 500 percent return on your invested capital. **********The same concept holds if you are investing in a real estate limited partnership. Both types of programs may provide depreciation deductions as well as income but, other factors being equal, your return is likely to be higher from a leveraged program. According to the Stanger organization, investors in the 50 percent tax bracket can expect 9 percent or 10 percent annual returns, compounded, after-tax, if the properties appreciate 4 percent a year in an unleveraged partnership. In a leveraged deal that is otherwise similar, that return would be about 15 percent. ''It's difficult to imagine an economic climate in which an unleveraged partnership would outperform a leveraged partnership,'' said John Blake, an analyst in Stanger's research department. **********So leverage can be a powerful tool, if used carefully. However, investors need to feel comfortable that rental income from a property will be sufficient to recover the debt service. If not, the property may be lost through foreclosure. Today, with interest rates lower than they were a few years ago, more leverage may be practical. ''Each transaction should be examined closely, but the ideal amount of leverage is probably in the 60 percent to 80 percent range,'' said Martin Helpern, a partner in the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath. **********The amount of leverage in a real estate limited partnership is shown in the prospectus of a public program, or the offering memorandum of a private placement. Most public programs require a minimum investment of $5,000; the funds usually go into ''blind pools'' - that is, properties are selected after the money is raised, so investors do not know the exact purchase terms before they put in their money. However, the offering summary at the beginning of a prospectus will generally state how much leverage the partnership intends to use. **********In a private placement, the minimums are higher, often $50,000 or so. Properties are usually specified, so investors know what they are buying. They are able to see the purchase price, the amount of borrowing involved and the mortgage terms. **********Of course, there is more to a good real estate investment than simply checking the amount of leverage. You should be confident that the sponsor has made money for past investors. Check the ''prior performance tables'' in the prospectus for evidence that properties bought for earlier partnerships have been sold at a profit. **********Where properties are specified, you or an adviser can do a more thorough analysis of the project's finances. ''What I consider a true economic deal,'' said Mr. Helpern, ''is a property that will generate positive cash flow, perhaps 6 percent to 8 percent, fully sheltered. If there's some excess tax loss, so much the better. Most important, the property should have genuine potential for appreciation.'' SUPPOSE, for example, you invest $25,000 in a limited partnership, acquiring a 10 percent interest. The partnership buys a $1 million building for $250,000 in cash, borrowing the other $750,000. In the first year, the property's net income, after operating expenses and debt service, is $20,000. Your share - $2,000 - would be passed through as a cash distribution.

Your share would be $3,000. **********Thus, you would have no tax liability from the partnership. Your $2,000 distribution (8 percent of your $25,000 investment) would be tax-free, because the I.R.S. considers it a return of capital; in addition, you will have a $3,000 tax loss (12 percent) to offset other income. **********Before you invest in any offering, insist on seeing an appraisal that justifies the building's purchase price. The appraisal should be thorough, relating the price to recent sales of similar properties. In today's market, you generally should be wary of deals in which the purchase price is more than 12.5 times the building's annual net operating income. **********If you buy at a fair price, and the property's operating income will comfortably cover debt service, leveraged real estate can pay off. Unleveraged partnerships may be appropriate for risk-averse investors, but they are sacrificing the chance to make the most of real estate appreciation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/06/world/defunct-satellite-is-identified-as-target-for-weapon-test.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1985-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFUNCT SATELLITE IS IDENTIFIED AS TARGET FOR WEAPON TEST", "print_headline": "DEFUNCT SATELLITE IS IDENTIFIED AS TARGET FOR WEAPON TEST", "body_text": " **********The Air Force has apparently settled on a six-year-old military research satellite called Solwind as the first target for a new American anti-satellite weapon, according to a private analyst. **********The analyst, John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, said today that Solwind will be in the right spot for the test on the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 13. **********A Congressional source who was briefed on details of the test confirmed the test date and said Mr. Pike's identification of the target ''rings a bell.'' **********Private analysts said that if Solwind is the target, the Air Force has set itself a difficult task.

Then he applied bits of information from the Air Force that have become public, such as the fact that the target would be a military satellite rather than a National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite, and that it had been on a scientific mission.

I think not. While there is no disputing that America's international investment position has fallen dramatically, the official figures give a highly misleading impression. The reason lies in a failure to properly allow for inflation. **********The total of international assets is a hodgepodge of shares, government bonds, bank deposits and overseas assets. Shares, bonds and bank deposits have a market value that is readily determined. The stock of direct investment, however, is the cumulative book value of investments. As any book-value calculation, it understates the replacement value of the assets. The older the investment, the greater the understatement, especially in an inflationary time. **********United States direct investment abroad is greater in book value terms (around $226 billion in October 1984) than direct investment in America (about $149 billion). It is also older; about one-half of direct investment in the United States took place over the last five years, while only one-fifth of American direct investment abroad was added in those years. **********What is the true replacement value of American direct investment overseas? Data that would allow a direct calculation are not available. But the earnings from direct investment can be capitalized to give a rough market evaluation, on a par with that of shares and bonds. **********The results are rather dramatic. In the first three quarters of 1984, United States earnings on direct investment abroad were about $28 billion. In contrast, the profits on overseas investments in the United States were only about $7.5 billion. Thus, while the book value of American direct investment abroad was only half again as much as direct investment in the United States, its earnings were four times as much. From this figure, we can establish a net capital value for American overseas investment of about $350 billion (against a net book value of $77 billion). **********Thus, the United States is not a net international debtor, and will not be for another couple of years, even if trade deficits turn out as high as forecast. However, this should not disguise or minimize the fact that the pattern of international direct investment has drastically changed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/17/world/aleksei-yepishev-ex-commissar-of-soviet-military-s-political-arm.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1985-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALEKSEI YEPISHEV, EX-COMMISSAR OF SOVIET MILITARY'S POLITICAL ARM", "print_headline": "ALEKSEI YEPISHEV, EX-COMMISSAR OF SOVIET MILITARY'S POLITICAL ARM", "body_text": " **********Gen. Aleksei A. Yepishev, for 23 years the chief political commissar of the Soviet armed forces, died Sunday after a long illness, the Soviet press agency Tass announced. He was 77 years old. **********General Yepishev retired last July to the largely honorary post of military inspector. From 1962 until his retirement, he was political commissar of the Soviet armed forces, with responsibility for the political loyalty and moral discipline of the Soviet military. **********An obituary signed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and other senior Soviet political and military leaders praised General Yepishev for giving ''all his abilities and knowledge and vast experience of party and state work to the strengthening of the country's defenses and its protection.'' **********The armed forces political directorate, of which General Yepishev was head, also has the status of a department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. General Yepishev became a full member of the Central Committee in 1964 and was an influential voice in the Kremlin, especially under Nikita S. Khrushchev and Leonid I. Brezhnev. **********Under Khrushchev in Ukraine **********He served on the Stalingrad military council during the war and under Mr. Khrushchev in the Ukraine during the postwar purges. It was under Mr. Khrushchev that he was appointed chief of the main political directorate.

After the city was evacuated, he sat on the military councils of various fronts, at Stalingrad and in the Ukraine, Poland and Czechoslovakia. **********In 1943, he was named Deputy People's Commissar of Medium Machine Building and a major general. After the war, General Yepishev worked in the Ukrainian party organization until 1951, when he became a Deputy Minister of State Security. In 1953 he went back to party work in the Ukraine, then in 1955 he was named Ambassador to Rumania. In 1960 he was appointed Ambassador to Yugoslavia, and served there until he was named the chief political commissar of the armed forces in May 1962. **********He held the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and was awarded three Orders of Lenin and many other awards. **********Last July, already ailing, General Yepishev was replaced as chief of the main political directorate by Gen.

The debt ceiling legislation has been delayed because it was tied to proposals to reduce Federal budget deficits. However, Congressional leaders said late Friday they had agreed on a plan to balance the Federal budget by 1991 and impose automatic spending cuts if the deficit does not decline according to schedule. **********News of the agreement helped reduce rates on outstanding bills slightly, so that the three-month issue was bid late Friday at 7.20 percent while the six-month bill was bid at 7.28 percent. No auctions of Treasury notes or bonds are expected until the last half of this month. **********The supply of new tax-exempt securities remains heavy, as issuers try to complete financings before the end of the year, when proposed changes in Federal tax laws are expected to sharply reduce the amount and kind of bonds that may be issued. **********Many analysts expect that the sharp drop in the supply of new tax-exempt issues will cause prices of outstanding tax-exempt bonds to outperform prices of Treasury and corporate issues. Aaron Gurwitz, an economist at Salomon Brothers, estimated that the decline in the supply of new bonds would more than compensate for the decline in demand from commercial banks. Their purchases are expected to drop sharply because proposed tax legislation would not allow them to deduct interest paid on money used to buy tax-exempt issues. Because of the expected tax law change, he said banks are not likely to be major sellers of bonds, unlike the first quarter of the past three years when large banks across the country reduced their holdings of tax-exempts by an average of about $2 billion. **********The following new fixed-income issues are scheduled this week: **********TAXABLE MONDAY International Paper Co., 750 shares ($100,000 per share) of money market preferred stock, BBB+/Aa-1/A.

He was 65 years old. **********Mr. Riboud, an articulate, elegant Frenchman and a Socialist whose closest friends included artists, writers and President Francois Mitterrand, headed Schlumberger for 20 years until his illness forced him to step down last month. **********Over those years, he expanded the company from its base as the world leader in testing oil wells into a diversified enterprise with a focus on technology, including electronic instruments, semiconductors and computer-aided design systems. The company had revenues of $6.4 billion last year. **********Mr. Riboud's emphasis on long-term planning and heavy spending for research,  combined with a decentralized management approach that relied on an independent, highly trained corps of field engineers, kept the company consistently ahead of  its competitors. Schlumberger thrived during oil boom years, and as the oil market softened it fared better than most oil-related companies. #30 Percent Earnings Growth In many of the Riboud years, Schlumberger had annual earnings growth of more than 30 percent, and Wall Street regarded the company and its chief executive with a degree of awe. **********''Jean is a unique person, a true Renaissance man,'' Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and a Schlumberger board member and longtime friend of Mr. Riboud, said last month. ''He drove that company to always be the best.'' **********Mr. Riboud himself often said, ''It's easy to be the best.'' But he added: ''That's not enough. The goal is to strive for perfection.'' **********Jean Riboud was born Nov. 15, 1919, in Lyons, where his father was a prosperous banker. As a teen-ager, he took a passionate interest in politics and ardently supported Leon Blum's Popular Front Government of 1936. **********Confined at Buchenwald **********After his graduation from the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris in 1939, he joined the French Army and served as a lieutenant in the early days of World  War II. He later joined the Resistance, was captured by the Germans and spent two years in the Buchenwald concentration camp until its liberation in May 1945. **********After the war, Mr. Riboud took a job with a French investment bank, Andre Istel & Company, that was owned by a friend of his father. In 1946 he came to New York to open an American office for the bank, which had Schlumberger as one  of its clients. Gradually, he impressed members of the Schlumberger family, and  in 1951 the company's co-founder, Marcel Schlumberger, persuaded him to join the company as his assistant. **********Working in Paris, Mr. Riboud helped to merge Schlumberger, which had operated as a loose confederation of four family-owned companies, into a single entity. In 1957 he was put in charge of all the company's operations outside North America, and in 1965 he was elected president and chief executive officer. **********Although he headed one of the world's largest capitalist enterprises, Mr. Riboud remained committed to the leftist ideals of his youth. He was one of Mr.  Mitterrand's closest confidants, and in the early 1980's was repeatedly mentioned for a possible post in the Mitterrand Government. **********Most Friends Were Artists **********Outside work, Mr. Riboud remained aloof from other business executives, and most of his friends were artists and writers, many of whom he first met in his early days in New York. They included Lillian Hellman, the playwright, Saul Steinberg, the artist, and Robert Capa, the photographer, and many of them were  somewhat puzzled by Mr. Riboud's success as a businessman, partly because he seldom talked of it. **********''He was a man of great intelligence, great warmth and great friendship, and  he liked my wife's cooking,'' Cornell Capa, the director of the International Center of Photography and Robert Capa's brother, said yesterday. ''He was a wonderful copain, the French word for good friend.'' **********But Mr. Riboud was also a forceful and sometimes autocratic chief executive,  who moved subordinates from job to job like pieces on a chess board -all, he maintained, to ''shake the tree'' and keep Schlumberger from becoming complacent. **********In a two-part profile in The New Yorker in 1983 that was later expanded into  a book, ''The Art of Corporate Success,'' the writer Ken Auletta noted that over the years Mr. Riboud had had a hand in forcing four members of the Schlumberger  family - which still controls about a quarter of the stock -out of the company.  He also forced others off the board when he deemed it necessary. **********Survived by Wife and Son **********But he believed he was simply doing his duty to the company, and said, ''If you want to be St. Francis of Assisi, you should not head a public company.'' **********Mr. Riboud is survived by his wife, Krishna, whom he married in 1949; their son, Christophe, of Paris, and three grandchildren. He is also survived by two brothers, Marc, an internationally known photographer, and Antoine, chairman of  Groupe BSN, a French food company; and three sisters, Francoise Riboud, who lives at La Carelle, the family's estate near Lyons, Sylvie Jullien, of Aix-en-Provence, and Michele Lacoin, of Lyons. **********Funeral services are to be held today at La Carelle, and a memorial service in New York is scheduled for 11 A.M.

As for the effects on the peace efforts, the official continued: ''I can't say it's going to destroy the process. I think it's going to slow it down and put it at risk. It has affectred his confidence in us.'' **********The Jordanian ruler's comments were interpreted by some Middle East experts as the latest round in a long series of maneuvers in a peace effort that has shown only incremental progress over the last year. **********Skepticism on Negotiations **********Some experts outside the Government have been consistently more skeptical than American diplomats about the ability of Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians to find a formula for negotiations. **********''The material isn't there for a so-called peace process,'' said Fouad Ajami, director of Middle East Studies at The Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. ''King Hussein's historical pessimism about that conflict has not been tempered and has not been improved. I believe he hasn't really changed his mind. I believe he views the peace process with a sense of doom.'' **********In the King's calculations, Professor Ajami explained, the Arab world looms as more crucial than United States. ''He has a reading of the Arab world,'' he said. ''He knows it very well. He realizes the Arab world will be merciless to those who engage in a peace settlement and don't get anything in return. So he is not going to step forward. He makes these good sounds, which please the Americans, don't threaten the Palestinians and don't worry the Syrians.'' **********Relations With Syria Warmer **********In recent months, Jordan and Syria have moved toward something of a reconciliation after years of tension. King Hussein has pledged to deny Moslem fundamentalists the use of Jordanian territory for forays against the Syrian regime, and last week he announced his intention to accept an invitation to visit Damascus. **********Although the State Department official said that this move did not constitute a Jordanian withdrawal from interest in negotiating with Israel, Mr. Ajami saw it as an effort by King Hussein to balance his relationship with the United States. **********According to the State Department official, the last year of diplomacy has seen a narrowing of the gaps and a focusing of the issues on two major procedural questions. On one issue, both Jordan and Israel now agree that an international conference may be convened, provided that it leads quickly to direct negotiations. The question now is what form such a conference would take. **********On the other issue, it is now agreed that the Palestinians must play a role in every step of the process.

Angered by a 23 percent wage cut, local members of the United Food and Commercial Workers believed they might strike George A. Hormel & Company in August, when their contract would expire. They called the 41-year-old Mr. Rogers to organize the battle. **********The move was unlikely to please Hormel - or Big Labor. In the late l970's and early 1980's Mr. Rogers became a hero of near mythic proportions with the union rank and file by helping score an organizing victory over J. P. Stevens & Company, settling a tug-of-war that had dragged on for 17 years. But then and later, his aggressive confrontations have dismayed some union presidents. **********Mr. Rogers calls his approach - in which unions attack not only the company they are seeking to bargain with or organize but also banks and other corporations that do business with the principal target - ''corporate campaigns.'' Others use the terms ''coordinated campaigns'' or ''comprehensive campaigns.'' By whatever name, such projects are this year's rage in the labor movement. With membership falling, organizing difficult, union image poor, and increasing numbers of companies willing to do battle with them, unions are groping for ways to reinvigorate themselves. **********A new A.F.L.-C.I.O. report endorses coordinated campaigns as ''an effective means'' to neutralize employer opposition, and the federation gives unions broad assistance in conducting them. **********But labor officials are less enthusiastic when Mr. Rogers personally leads the battles. Jay Foreman, an executive vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers, said, ''Ray acts as if he is a Messiah, and that worries me.'' **********''I think some of his ideas are exciting,'' said Robert F. Harbrant, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Food and Allied Service Trades Department. ''Some of the ideas, on the other hand, are suicidal.'' **********Mr. Rogers' own view is that both labor and management fear his power to win workers' loyalty. ''I have started a movement,'' he said. ''The corporate financial structure is scared to death of it. Most of the union leaders refuse to understand it. They are not ready to make the organizational commitment to carry it off.'' THE confrontation in Austin is a typical example of the Rogers approach. Starting in January, the labor organizer devoted himself virtually full time to devising strategy and marshaling support for the local union. With the temperature at 20 degrees below zero, he sent several dozen workers to distribute leaflets at 12,000 homes in Austin and the rest of Mower County. Mailings went out to every national union in the country, as well as 50,000 local unions. Members constructed storage and distribution facilities in the basement of the Austin Labor Temple, where three local unions have offices. When the strike finally began in August, the union was ready to distribute food and clothing to its 1,500 members. **********With the strike under way, 350 workers and supporters set out on a five-day caravan, camping in vans and tents, to show their friendship with non-striking Hormel workers in Iowa and Nebraska. **********Last month, when the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board decided there was reason to believe that the Hormel strikers were picketing illegally at First Bank System, Inc., a bank holding company Mr. Rogers contends plays a major role in Hormel's affairs, the burly organizer dispatched hundreds more pickets to the First Bank building in St. Paul and the N.L.R.B. headquarters in Minneapolis. **********''I'd like to see anybody in the country do the things we do,'' said Mr. Rogers, who with a partner, Ed Allen, is running the Hormel effort through his firm, Corporate Campaign Inc. **********Mr. Rogers believes the Austin campaign is more than just a test of his strategy. He wants to demonstrate that concessions will be stopped. ''This campaign can be a real example of how to turn back the onslaught against the American worker,'' he said. **********The strike has split Austin. Many of the 23,000 townspeople support the action. But Local P-9's parent union does not approve of Mr. Rogers's tactics, and other national unions and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are instructing their locals not to support the strikers. **********Yet when James Guyette, president of the striking local, walked into the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention, he received a tumultuous standing ovation - from unionists not supposed to be supporting him. **********The parent union wants to raise the lowest wages in the fractured meatpacking industry and reestablish a national wage rate in meatpacking, rather than place its efforts on maintaining relatively high wages at companies like Hormel. Lewie G. Anderson, director of the union's packing division, said in a recent position paper that ''Mr. Rogers has led the members of Local P-9 down a dead- end street.'' **********The Hormel company portrays Mr. Rogers as a malevolent Music Man, come to town to twist the minds of the citizens, take their money and blacken the name of the company and the community. Charles Nyberg, Hormel's general counsel, says that the union leader's combative tactics prevent a settlement. And, he says, Mr. Rogers always ''leaves town with his pot of gold.'' **********Mr. Rogers replies that his salary is smaller than that of many union executives, and says the union is getting ''a multimillion-dollar campaign that doesn't cost a million dollars.'' **********In fact, Mr. Rogers's company, Corporate Campaign, is due to receive $160,000 in fees from the striking local, although Mr. Rogers says he is taking no money until there is a settlement with Hormel. Another $180,000 is allotted for expenses. The firm also is to receive a $200,000 bonus if the strikers win their demand of a return to the $10.69 hourly wage workers received before the company imposed the 23 percent cut a year ago, get a contract that gives the local union strong powers, and have other benefits returned to them. IT is an unwritten labor rule that union presidents receive credit for successes, while consultants remain invisible. Mr. Rogers violates this rule constantly. **********Moreover, union presidents tend to be wary of departing from traditional methods, say some of their subordinates. They are apprehensive about stirring up the rank-and-file members, fearful of losing power and perquisites. In a sense, this argument holds, some union leaders become businessmen, unwilling to destroy amicable relationships built up over the years with their companies - and uncomfortable with the aggressive stance espoused by Mr. Rogers. **********Some in the labor movement, including some old friends, say the organizer's extreme self-confidence, public criticisms of union leaders, and what they see as his practice of splitting local and national unions will destroy him. **********Both friends and foes agree that he is an imaginative and uncompromising fighter. ''His approach is to win 100 percent or lose 100 percent,'' said a top labor consultant. **********Another consultant says that Mr. Rogers, a thick-chested man with a big mustache, makes enemies because he ''doesn't play the Fancy Dan game.'' ''Ray is a true-blue redneck,'' the consultant said, with minimal interest in life's luxuries. **********Mr. Guyette agrees: ''The guy is disliked because he doesn't go around Washington D.C. wearing expensive clothes and expensive jewelry and rubbing elbows with the so-called social elite. Ray's commitment is to the working person and the poor, and he believes the best way he can help is by being out where they are instead of miles away in fancy hotels.'' **********To all appearances, Mr. Rogers leads a monkish existence that some associates say is reminiscent of that other crusader against corporations, Ralph Nader. Mr. Rogers wears inexpensive clothes, stays in inexpensive hotels and his only apparent vice is an extreme fondness for ice cream. His friends worry that he takes so little time off. Mr. Rogers's inexpensive bachelor apartment is on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His hobbies are running and lifting weights - a sport he took up as a boy to defeat bullies who were beating him up. **********Mr. Rogers and Mr. Allen, who met in the Stevens drive, founded Corporate Campaign in 1981, establishing its headquarters on West 14th Street, only a few minutes' walk from Union Square, the site of numerous labor rallies in decades past. **********The firm is run on strict egalitarian principles: The 10 full-time employees each receive a weekly salary of $425. At times the firm has had to fight for clients, but Mr. Rogers says business is brisk just now. Besides the Hormel effort, it is conducting smaller campaigns for three unions against the Transamerica Corporation, and for migrant farm workers against the Campbell Soup Company. **********Mr. Rogers needs a victory at Austin, however, for his record has been spotty since the coup at Stevens. Three years ago Mr. Rogers was fired by the International Association of Machinists in a campaign against Brown & Sharpe, a Rhode Island-based machine tool maker. **********However, his friends point out that other activists have had their difficulties, too, in running corporate campaigns. Unions often turn to them only as a last resort, and sometimes such campaigns have little effect. **********One fact emerges, however. Corporations do not like the Rogers approach. The Stevens settlement contained what became known as ''the Ray Rogers clause,'' prohibiting the union from conducting ''corporate campaign-style activities'' against the company, and Hormel is demanding a similar clause. A native of Beverly, Mass., Raymond Franklin Rogers Jr. was born into a labor family. His mother was an assembler in an electronics plant. His late father was a lathe operator who endured a bitter strike at an electronics plant in Lynn. **********In 1967 the young man graduated from the University of Massachusetts with a degree in sociology. As a Vista volunteer in Tennessee, he organized poor people and college students into ''destruction'' teams, to knock down dilapidated houses, and ''construction'' teams, to build new ones. **********He next moved to the Appalachian Regional Commission in Washington D.C., and produced a 15-page paper that graphically described malnutrition and hunger in the region. His superiors said they would fire him if he distributed the paper; when he pressed on, they made good on the threat. **********Ultimately he became convinced that ''the only vehicle to create social, political and economic change is the labor movement,'' Mr. Rogers recalled recently. **********In 1973, Mr. Rogers was hired by the clothing workers union, then conducting an organizing campaign against the Texas-based Farah Company. In a preview of confrontations to come, Mr. Rogers enlisted the support of unions that agreed to picket stores carrying Farah slacks. Stores canceled orders, and Farah settled. **********Mr. Rogers then went to work for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in its monumental battle with J. P. Stevens, and began to formulate his ''corporate campaign'' tactics. For six weeks, he recalls, he studied his target, drawing a circle to represent Stevens and arrows pointing toward the center to represent every conceivable way to apply pressure. He wanted to make his attacks personal; that is, to single out Stevens's executives and supporters in the financial community, and embarrass them with the association. **********Mr. Rogers dragged numerous companies into the dispute, including the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Goldman, Sachs & Company. In 1980, bowing to pressure, Stevens settled. **********Similarly, in fighting Hormel, Mr. Rogers has also taken on the First Bank System Inc. In particular, he has targeted individuals who are active in both companies, including Richard L. Knowlton, Hormel chairman and a board member of two First Bank companies, and two outside directors who serve on the boards of both Hormel and various First Bank companies. **********Whether the union's activities against the First Bank System constitute an illegal secondary boycott remains unresolved. The N.L.R.B. and the union reached an agreement in which the union said it would refrain from illegal secondary boycott activities, with the company retaining the right to go to Federal court to prohibit picketing it regards as illegal. The company has filed an objection to the agreement, asking that the N.L.R.B. make a finding whether the picketing is illegal. **********Mr. Rogers remains undaunted. ''We have a terrific following,'' he said in the local union headquarters in Austin the other day. ''It's only a few people in a few high places whooppose us.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/18/world/reagan-s-german-trip-furor-over-remembrance.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1985-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN'S GERMAN TRIP: FUROR OVER REMEMBRANCE", "print_headline": "REAGAN'S GERMAN TRIP: FUROR OVER REMEMBRANCE", "body_text": " **********An apparently impulsive decision by President Reagan to grant a favor to a fellow head of government has drawn him into one of the most embarrassing and politically damaging episodes of his Administration. **********The episode, which threatens both Mr. Reagan's carefully nurtured relations with American Jews and his reputation as a master of public relations, began five months ago when he received Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany for a meeting that included a discussion of Mr. Reagan's planned trip to West Germany this May. **********Kohl Stresses Anniversary **********At the session, Mr. Kohl stressed the importance West Germans attached to the 40th anniversary on May 8 of the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II, and he urged Mr. Reagan to visit a military cemetery for American and German war dead as a symbol of reconciliation. Mr. Reagan agreed. **********Within 24 hours, everyone realized that there were no American graves in German military cemeteries.  But by all accounts, the momentum for Mr. Reagan's visit to the military cemetery in Bitburg began at the meeting with Mr. Kohl. **********As it turned out, the cemetery contains the graves of SS soldiers, and the planned visit has been transformed into a politically damaging episode that has enraged Jewish organizations and veterans' groups and has left White House officials blaming one another as well as Mr. Kohl. **********A review of what happened since the Kohl-Reagan meeting on Nov. 30, based on interviews with American and West German officials, reveals that the State Department and the West German Embassy had almost no involvement in the arrangements. **********Although relations between the United States and West Germany are strong, the planning for the trip produced a tide of emotion left over from World War II that stunned officials. **********According to one American, Mr. Reagan and the West Germans were ambivalent about a second possible commemorative appearance by the President, at a concentration camp, a visit that became embroiled in West German domestic politics. Franz Josef Strauss, the Bavarian leader, was reluctant to have Nazi crimes commemorated at the site of the Dachau camp, near Munich in Bavaria. **********But on Tuesday, the Bonn Government made public excerpts from a letter from Mr. Kohl to Mr. Reagan recalling that the West German had originally recommended that the President visit a camp or some other monument to victims of the Nazis. The White House said the letter also urged Mr. Reagan to stick to his plan to visit the Bitburg cemetery. **********Nonetheless, American officials said, during late December and early January, the West Germans offered no encouragement for Mr. Reagan to visit a concentration camp. At one point, according to one Administration official, American diplomats told the West Germans that Mr. Reagan would be prepared to go to a concentration camp if the Germans wanted him to do so. **********''So that there was no appearance of U.S. pressure, we wanted them to make a public statement that the President was going to a concentration camp at the invitation of Chancellor Kohl,'' said one official. ''But the Germans dropped the issue at that point.'' **********The planning for the trip was handled by Michael K. Deaver, who, as the departing deputy chief of staff, paid a cursory visit to the Bitburg cemetery with about 50 American and German officials in late February. Either the presence of the SS graves was not noted at the time or their significance was not understood. **********A West German official said the cemetery was selected because it was near a United States air base and ''the President could stay within the compound for security and telecommunications reasons.'' **********Regan Backed Cemetery Idea **********Once the decision was made to visit the cemetery, White House officials said, Donald T. Regan, the chief of staff, endorsed it. Aides said Mr. Regan, who took over as chief of staff on Feb. 4, had entrusted planning to Mr. Deaver and was himself immersed in the budget for the fiscal year 1986. **********Mr. Regan has come under criticism within the Government for his handling of the dispute, particularly on the ground that he did not anticipate the political fallout. **********Although the President has now reversed himself and plans to visit a concentration camp, Jewish spokesmen, veterans' groups and legislators said the visit to the cemetery with the graves of SS soldiers was unacceptable even if a concentration camp site was added. **********Concern Over Jewish Vote **********White House officials fear that in laying a wreath at Bitburg, Mr. Reagan will damage Republican prospects among Jewish voters. **********''There seems to have been absolutely no political input in these decisions,'' said a Republican strategist close to the White House. ''There is long-term damage here for us among Jewish voters.'' **********In the meeting between Chancellor Kohl and President Reagan in November, Mr. Kohl said he felt ''particularly strongly'' that World War II was the ''absolute low point in German history'' and that he would mark the end of the war by speaking April 21 at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. **********He also made it clear that the West Germans had been piqued at not being invited to take part in the Western Allies' celebrations in June 1984 of the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, an exclusion that Mr. Reagan regretted. **********Mr. Kohl then urged Mr. Reagan to visit a German military cemetery during his trip as a symbol of reconciliation. **********Choice of Bitburg Explained **********After Mr. Reagan agreed to visit a cemetery, Bitburg emerged as a favorite because it was close to a United States base and situated in Mr. Kohl's home state, the Rhineland-Palatinate. **********Mr. Deaver, the deputy chief of staff, was heavily involved in December in planning for Mr. Reagan's second inaugural, and then informed the President and his wife, Nancy, that he planned to leave the White House after his trip to Western Europe in preparation for the President's May visit there. **********''The trip was going to be Mike's last hurrah, but he was distracted,'' a White House official recalled. He noted that in early January, Mr. Deaver also helped shape the switch of jobs between Mr. Regan and James A. Baker 3d, the chief of staff, who took over the Treasury Department. **********Later that month, planning for Mr. Deaver's trip was further delayed when he entered Georgetown Hospital for 10 days for treatment of a kidney ailment. He was released on Jan. 30. **********A Camp Too Grisly for Reagan **********In the meantime, Mr. Reagan apparently told Mr. Deaver - and began telling aides - that he was reluctant to visit a concentration camp. **********''The President was not hot to go to a camp,'' an American official said. ''You know, he is a cheerful politician. He does not like to grovel in a grisly scene like Dachau. He was reluctant to go. I am not saying opposed, but there was a coolness. And nobody pushed him on it.'' **********A White House official recalled sitting in on a meeting where the subject of a visit to concentration camp came up. The official recalled Mr. Reagan's saying, ''You know, I don't think we ought to focus on the past, I want to focus on the future, I want to put that history behind me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/27/world/ethiopian-rebels-win-clash.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ethiopian Rebels Win Clash", "print_headline": "Ethiopian Rebels Win Clash", "body_text": " **********Eritrean rebels said today that they had killed or wounded more than 1,500 Ethiopian Government soldiers and shot down a MIG fighter plane in heavy fighting last week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/18/business/business-people-high-tech-squadron-delivers-for-pacific-bell.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  High-Tech Squadron Delivers for Pacific Bell", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   High-Tech Squadron Delivers for Pacific Bell", "body_text": " **********It was a ''cadre of very high-tech people'' who were responsible for the news last week that Pacific Bell had filed for a patent on a technology that would allow a single telephone line to carry two voice conversations and five streams of data at the same time. **********Users of home information services cannot now speak on the telephone line while their home computer or terminal is using the line. **********The Pacific Bell product alleviates that problem and is expected to be popular with residential and small-business computer users. **********According to Michael Bandler, vice president of network engineering and planning at Pacific Bell, the technology is the handiwork of fewer than 10 people with a bevy of advanced degrees - ''the most high-tech people we have in the company.'' **********The two men who oversaw the technology are Mr. Bandler, 47, and Thomas C.

They added that they expected an army officer to be indicted in the case. **********Such claims of coming investigations have been made by the Salvadoran Government in the past, only to be unfulfilled. President Jose Napoleon Duarte, when he took office, pledged repeatedly to investigate the killing of the agrarian advisers and at least five other notorious human rights cases here, including the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. **********No Salvadoran Army officer has ever been convicted of murder in a human rights case despite the known involvement of the military in a series of killings in past years. **********But American and Salvadoran officials contend that this time an investigation will definitely go ahead as part of a package of long-delayed changes in the legal system by the Government of President Duarte. **********Carefully Selected Unit **********As evidence of the Government's determination, the officials said that a special investigations unit of at least 20 carefully selected Salvadoran policemen has been trained by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations to pursue those responsible for killing the advisers at the Sheraton Hotel four years ago, as well as to investigate other notorious human rights cases here, the officials said in interviews. **********Those killed at the hotel included Jose Rodolfo Viera, the head of the Salvadoran land redistribution agency, and two advisers for the American Institute for Free Labor Development, Mark D. Pearlman and Michael P. Hammer. **********Mr. Viera, as head of the Agrarian Reform Institute, was a Government official, the sources said. As a result, his slaying was legally an act of terrorism. Terrorist offenses in El Salvador are prosecuted by military rather than civil courts. The officials said that if necessary all past proceedings in civil courts could be declared null, and the case retried in the military tribunal. **********New Evidence Reported **********The new investigative unit, which has not been publicized before, has been quietly working on the case of the slain agrarian experts for several months and has developed ''substantial new evidence'' that will result in the indictment of Capt. Eduardo Alfonso Avila, an army officer who has been suspected in the killings in the past but has never been charged, an official familiar with the case said. **********Movement on investigating past killings and on changing the judicial system has become possible since Mr. Duarte's Christian Democratic Party won control of the National Assembly. On Tuesday the Christian Democratic majority ousted the rightist Attorney General, who had obstructed the legislation to change the legal system. The former right-wing majority in the Assembly had also held up changes in the legal system and in giving legal status to the special investigative unit. **********The unit is expected to be granted legal standing within the next week by the National Assembly, which is also expected to authorize a judicial reform commission and forensic laboratory, funded by $11 million in American aid, according to Salvadoran officials. **********Confessions by Enlisted Men **********The machine-gun assassination of the three agrarian experts in January 1981 took place as they sat sipping coffee in the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel here, and it is one of the best-documented cases of a rightist death squad killing. Two enlisted men from the National Guard have confessed to carrying out the shootings on the orders of two army officers attached to the intelligence division of the National Guard, a unit that was feared as having a license to kill in the early 1980's. **********The two suspected officers are Lieut. Rodolfo Isidro Lopez Sibrian and Captain Avila. Neither has been convicted of the killings, in part because under Salvadoran law those accused of a crime cannot give testimony against others implicated in the same case. Therefore the testimony of the soldiers ordered to carry out the shootings cannot be used to convict the officers. **********Lieutenant Lopez Sibrian was charged with the killings but was released by the Salvadoran courts. After strong pressure from the United States Embassy, he was forced to resign from the army last November. Captain Avila has not been previously charged in the case because investigators hoped he would give evidence against Mr. Sibrian. But Captain Avila has denied he had evidence to give. **********Two officials involved in the case say Captain Avila will now be charged with complicity in the killings on the basis of new evidence. The two officials said it might also be possible to re-charge other suspects in the case, including Lieut. Lopez Sibrian and two rightist businessmen. **********Captain Avila is no longer on active duty with the army. But an army officer said that Mr. Avila had been kept on a special reserve status that compels him to remain in the country or risk being charged with desertion. **********Lieutenant Lopez Sibrian was allowed to dye his bright red hair and shave off his moustache before entering a police lineup. He was cleared by the Supreme Court, on which Captain Avila's uncle was and still is a justice. Roberto D'Aubuissson, the right-wing leader and a former intelligence officer, went on television at the time and proclaimed the two officers innocent. **********Extensive Testing Reported **********The special investigative unit, officials said, had been chosen from the ranks of the National Guard, National Police and Treasury Police. They said the men had been selected on the basis of physical, psychological and mental aptitude tests. The men's political backgrounds and personal histories were also studied, one official said.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on Nov. 19 and 20. **********In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, he is expected to announce proposals to reduce Soviet-American tension.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in Geneva on Nov. 19-20. **********Aside from the need for arms control, officials said, Mr. Reagan considers Soviet actions in Latin America, Africa and Asia significant in the effort to reduce East-West tensions. In the Indian interview, which involved answers to written questions, he said: **********''To establish the foundation for a truly more constructive relationship, I want to talk with General Secretary Gorbachev not only about arms control but also about regional tensions, about our bilateral relationship and about the obligation of both our nations to respect human rights.'' **********In an allusion to Nicaragua and other nations, he added: **********''Over the past 10 years, a growing source of instability and war in the developing world has been the imposition of new regimes - Marxist-Leninist ones - that are, almost from the day they take over, at war with their own people, and then, before very long, at war with their neighbors. **********''This is a problem that simply has to be addressed, a pattern that has to be broken if we are to avoid the further spread of conflict. **********''The Soviet Union, as we see it, is too often supporting, and sometimes directing, these wars. In such cases, the flow of arms from outside is a major concern, and we want to do something about it.'' **********Mr. Reagan said he would raise the issue of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan with Mr. Gorbachev. **********''It is clear that the Afghan spirit of independence cannot be crushed, that continued war will only mean more bloodshed and that only a political solution is possible,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********''The Soviets claim that they, too, believe in a negotiated settlement. I will be asking General Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva whether, if that is so, he is willing to address the crucial issue: withdrawal of the more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan and the restoration of that country's independence and nonalignment. **********''The way to solve regional problems is through dialogue and negotiations, not invasion and occupation.'' **********Mr. Reagan was caustic about Soviet opposition to the American research effort on the space-based antimissile program, officially known as the strategic defense initiative and commonly called ''Star Wars.'' **********Reagan Lists Soviet Defense Work **********Mr. Reagan said that over the last 20 years, the Soviet Union had developed a strategic defense program on its own. **********''It has been the Soviets who have built the world's most extensive network of civil defenses and the most widespread air defense system, who have deployed the world's only operational ABM and antisatellite systems, and who have devoted extensive resources to investigating many of the very same technologies we are now examining in our S.D.I. research,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********He added that some Soviet efforts, such as the construction of a large radar station in central Siberia, at Abalokovo, north of Krasnoyarsk, ''are in clear violation'' of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. That accord was intended to limit the size and quality of antimissile defenses. **********The Soviet Union has said that the American program violates the treaty and will lead to an arms buildup in space. **********''Soviet criticism of S.D.I. is more than a little hypocritical,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''It is quite clear that the Soviets are intent on undermining the U.S. S.D.I. program, while minimizing any constraints on their own ongoing strategic defense activities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/16/world/israelis-illegally-got-us-devices-used-in-making-nuclear-weapons.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1985-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELIS ILLEGALLY GOT U.S. DEVICES USED IN MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS", "print_headline": "ISRAELIS ILLEGALLY GOT U.S. DEVICES USED IN MAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS", "body_text": " **********The State Department has known since early this year that Israel had illegally acquired electronic devices that would be critical in making nuclear weapons but avoided making that an issue with the Israeli Government, Administration and Congressional officials said today. **********The officials said the State Department had asked Israel to explain the uses to which the devices, known as krytrons, had been put. But the officials said the Department had not, as has been reported, asked to inspect sites where those devices might be used. **********The officials said the State Department wanted to keep the illegal shipment out of the public eye until after it had become the target of a grand jury investigation in Los Angeles. Once the case was in court, they said, the Department could then avoid answering questions by saying that it never commented on pending investigations. **********At the State Department news briefing this morning, a spokesman, Edward Djerejian, told reporters that ''the Government of Israel has been cooperative in our investigation.'' **********'Vigorous Enforcement' **********Beyond that, he said, ''it's inappropriate for me to comment on any matter that is under investigation by the U.S. law-enforcement authorities. But let me state that we have consistently stressed to law-enforcement authorities the importance we attach to the vigorous enforcement of U.S. export-control laws.'' **********Krytrons, technical experts said, are extremely high-speed electronic switches that could be used to control the timing of nuclear detonations. The more precise the timing, they said, the more destructive the weapon would be. **********Israel has long been suspected of having the capacity to build nuclear weapons and possibly of having assembled them. Technical experts said Israel had the nuclear material and the explosive devices necessary but lacked devices to make advanced triggers. **********On Sunday Newsweek reported that the Federal grand jury was investigating the possibility that krytrons were smuggled from the United States to Israel. Information Given to U.S.  A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry, Nachman Shai, confirmed on Sunday that Israel had acquired the krytrons but said they were being used for the development of conventional weapons. He also said that Israel had complied with an American request for information on their uses. **********The krytrons were developed and manufactured by the E.G.G. company in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and are used commercially, among other purposes, as timers in strobe lights at airports, in high speed copying machines, and in explosive geological tests for oil. **********A version of higher quality and precision has been developed for military use, technical experts said. Government officials said all krytrons are subject to strict export control laws and exporters must have a Government license, issued by the Commerce Department, for sales abroad. **********In this case, officials and business executives said, the manufacturer sold the krytrons to a distributor in Los Angeles called Milco in what was described as a legitimate deal. In that sale, E.G.G. included the ususal notices that the krytrons could not be exported without a Government license. **********Grand Jury Investigation **********The officials said, however, that the devices evidently were sold to Israel without a license. That has become the subject of the grand jury investigation, with some reports holding that an announcement was expected from the court soon. **********Administration officials said that when the State Department became aware of krytron shipments that took place between 1979 and 1980, American diplomats in Tel Aviv asked the Israeli Government for an explanation. The Israeli Government, they said, insisted that the devices were being used for non-nuclear purposes. **********After the grand jury began its investigation, the officials said, the State Department told the Israeli Government that it was not satisfied with the previous explanations and insisted on more details. **********Whether Israel was able to satisfy the American Government could not be determined, although the State Department spokesman today said that Israel had been cooperative. **********The officials said the United States had not asked to inspect the sites where krytrons were in use, suggesting that such a request could be construed by the Israelis as an affront to their national sovereignty or a cause for embarrasment if Israel refused. **********Earlier this year Federal officials said Pakistan had illegally tried to obtain the same devices and that a Pakistani agent had been arrested by Federal agents while trying to smuggle 50 krytrons out of the country. Pakistani officials have denied that he had any connection to the Pakistani Government. **********Representative Stephen J.

After its problems touched off a run on other privately insured Maryland thrift units, Maryland authorities were forced to temporarily limit withdrawals at all of the state's 102 privately insured thrift units, and to take other steps to calm the volatile situation. **********Old Court had grown at a fast pace in recent years by gathering deposits from across the United States with interest rates of as much as two percentage points above national averages. At the end of April, for example, Old Court was offering an 11.5 percent rate on a six-month certificate of deposit with a minimum investment of $2,500. The same week, the average yield on six-month certificates of deposit at New York banks was only 8.79 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor. Among New York thrift units, Dime Savings was offering a yield of 8.79 percent, and Goldome 8.87 percent, on six-month certificates of deposit. **********Old Court invested its funds in such projects as office buildings and big residential developments. Such investments are considered by some as much riskier than residential mortgage loans secured by real estate. Those loans still make up the major portion of the portfolios of most of the nation's thrift institutions, but some, such as Old Court, have been moving increasingly to other kinds of investments. **********High Rates **********The critical question to many financial experts is whether an institution that pays extra high rates is necessarily riskier. Many of the institutions carry Federal deposit insurance, so the added risk may not be important to depositors, although many regulators are becoming concerned. **********Higher rates on deposits, however, do not always indicate riskier investment strategies. Many newer thrift institutions, for example, are able to pay more interest simply because they are not saddled with old, low-paying mortgages. **********''The bottom line is that they can afford to do it,'' said Charles H. Kresslein Jr., president of the Maryland League of Financial Institutions, a trade association. **********But with the growing profusion of investment practices, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, believes depositors should at minimum get more information about thrift institutions so they can avoid those that may have particularly risky portfolios. **********''The average consumer should have available to him the ratings system used by the regulators to rate banks,'' Mr. Schumer said. **********Opening 'Money Desks' **********Signs of change in the industry are many. Financial analysts say that thrift institutions that for years accepted deposits solely from local sources are increasingly opening sophisticated ''money desks'' and gathering their funds nationally at generally higher cost. To stay profitable, the institutions are investing the funds in even higher paying assets, such as office parks, malls and real estate joint ventures. **********''Gathering funds nationally has become an important marketing tool for many banks and thrifts,'' said Hugo H. Ottolenghi, the managing editor of 100 Highest Yields, a newsletter that tracks savings rates. ''At the same time, consumers are showing a greater willingness to send their money out of state. More and more people are seeing banks as part of a national market.'' **********According to Mr. Ottolenghi, at least 25 thrift institutions gather deposits from outside their home states for a variety of reasons. In the case of Texas, he said, some institutions have found that local capital simply is not sufficient to meet the state's huge demand for financing. In the case of Virginia, the savings industry is so competitive that institutions can often attract funds cheaper elsewhere. **********Funding Needs **********Some industry executives, however, maintain that even if a thrift institution does invest in big construction loans, it does not follow that the institution is prone to problems. **********''To me, it would depend on the institution's leadership,'' said George M. Pattison, a vice president at the Vernon Savings and Loan Association in Vernon, Tex., which gathers nearly half its deposits from outside Texas. ''I don't feel we're putting our customers out on a limb. And they don't either or else they wouldn't send their money here.'' **********Other banking experts, however, say high-paying thrift institutions are almost always riskier. **********''In order to pay the rates they pay, they have to be purchasing more speculative assets,'' said Stuart I. Greenbaum, the Norman Strunk Distinguished Professor of Financial Institutions at Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management. **********Ian Giddy, a professor of finance at New York University's Graduate School of Business, said: ''Usually, in this business, there is no such thing as a free lunch. A high rate implies one of two things: either the rate is really not high, or there is something not as favorable about the institution compared with what the depositor could get elsewhere.'' **********Risky Deals **********But many banking experts say they see nothing wrong with paying high rates so the thrift institutions can plow money into risky deals. They say the practice is an important part of a deregulated financial world in which institutions should be free to pay what they wish and individuals free to choose their depository institution. That freedom, they say, should extend to advertising high rates - provided, of course, the promotions are not deceptive. **********For now at least, no one seems to be suggesting that savers are getting anything but the rates promised in ads. Ad content is governed by truth-in-lending and truth-in-advertising statutes. But that does little, critics of the system say, to help far-flung depositors know when their money may be bankrolling some dicey ventures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/16/business/in-the-trenches-at-people-air.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN THE TRENCHES AT PEOPLE AIR", "print_headline": "IN THE TRENCHES AT PEOPLE AIR", "body_text": " **********On Friday night of the recent Labor Day weekend, Laurie Gillespie and Rick Avjean, customer service managers for People Express Airlines, faced three planeloads of irate passengers who had been waiting in the North Terminal of Newark International Airport for hours. **********Five deep, the customers surrounded the counter. Several demanded to know if their flights to Portland, Me., delayed by a storm, would ever take off. Two were crying. One woman had lost two children.  Only the customer service managers behind the counters kept the disorder from disintegrating into chaos. For them, crowd control has become an art form. And that is crucial for the low-fare airline whose profit margin relies on full planes and tight schedules that have led to flight delays and crowds, even when the weather is good. **********In addition, the unusual mixture of students, families, business travelers and others attracted by the low fares make no-show statistics more difficult to calculate for People than for other airlines, an industry analyst said. Because of this, there are often empty seats, which over the years has encouraged a steady standby clientele, adding to the airport crowds. On the other hand, this sometimes leads to overbooking, where there are more passengers with reservations than seats available. **********When any situation becomes difficult, the customer-service managers keep the discomfort down to a level where most People Express passengers, when asked, said they considered it a fair trade for the savings. **********''They handle the crowd well,'' said the airline-industry analyst. ''It has gotten ingrained in those people that it's necessary if the company is going to be successful.'' **********To be sure, some passengers were disgruntled that night, and others were reduced to shouting and tears. Occasionally, a customer manager would pause to take a deep breath. And at least one sounded slightly frantic as he announced over the loudspeaker: ''We're sorry, folks, but we're trying desperately to get a system going here.'' **********Nonetheless, at that gate and others nearby, the customer service managers never shouted back to a hostile passenger. **********The situation could have become much worse. ''It was a rolling nightmare,'' said Donald C. Burr, president and founder of People Express, who helped at the customer check-in desk. ''I've seen a terminal explode at another airline, and it can happen fast, almost in a split second.'' **********Those working the front lines have actually chosen to be there. Each customer manager alternates between serving as a flight attendant and member of the ground crew, and can request a specific schedule. Each also has a personal stake in making passengers want to come back: Every customer service manager becomes a stockholder in the company within the first few months of employment. **********The service managers make $17,000 their first year and about $26,000 after five years of service. There is profit sharing, but not until the second year of employment. **********The managers are trained to handle crisis situations in three days of role playing. But they mostly credit their front-line prowess to their unusual degree of autonomy: They can request larger planes to accommodate a bigger passenger turnout - although such crafts are not always available - or hold a plane for a late connecting flight. Such authority, they said, gives them credibility with the passengers. **********''You learn most of it on the job,'' said Miss Gillespie, who has a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from the University of Maine at Orano. **********'People Distress' **********It was impossible to walk through the airport that holiday Friday without stepping around bags and people - and almost as impossible to get through the crowd to the counters. **********''I just have to get to Portland,'' one woman behind Mr. Avjean said, beginning to cry. Another followed suit. Next to her, a man started to curse. Someone else muttered something about ''people distress,'' a frequently heard play on the airline's name. Mr. Avjean's voice was controlled as he dealt with each. **********Next to him, Miss Gillespie telephoned other gates to help Melody Holmquist find her niece and nephew, 11-year-old LeAnn Henry and her 12-year-old brother, Richard, who were supposed to meet her at the airport. **********The children were located in a matter of minutes. Another flight to Portland was not - the woman did not get to Portland that night. All through the exercise, Mr. Avjean and Miss Gillespie took standby names of customers bumped from a canceled flight and tried to answer the eternal question, ''Will I get out tonight?'' **********''Part of the reason they got hired must have been their good interpersonal skills,'' said Heidi Kreuter, a customer seated on the floor. Her flight had just been canceled. But, as a regular People Express customer, she had made an extra reservation, weeks earlier, for the next morning -''just in case.'' She said she would fly with the airline again, but her fiance, Stephen Brown, said he would not. Another man was overheard saying, ''The only thing I will do with this airline in the future is invest.'' **********''In a real crunch, it can be difficult to please everybody,'' said Christa McGlynn, a customer service manager who had worked a 12-hour shift at the Buffalo/Niagara Falls gate. ''There are times when all we can do is ask passengers to be patient.'' **********The system is constantly being reworked to help both crew and passengers. One change involves anticipating overbookings, a common problem at many airlines. As it becomes apparent a problem might develop, customers checking in are asked if they would be willing to trade their seats for a round-trip ticket anywhere in the domestic People Express system. Thus, the staff knows beforehand just whom to approach if necessary. **********A Losing Quarter **********Mr. Burr said that of 4,000 employees hired in the past four years, 200 customer service managers have left. Some left, Mr. Burr said, when the company ''hit a trough'' last quarter, ending April. Because of its expansion into 10 new cities, the company lost $8 million and there was no profit sharing, a loss of up to $700 for some customer service managers. **********To encourage a feeling of camaraderie - a feeling People Express was based on when it began in 1981 with 400 employees - the airline has divided its crew into 11 operational groups of about 300 employees each. Those groups are divided into teams, which work on specific routes. In preparation for the Labor Day rush, the group handling the Portland, Me., and Syracuse flights turned a before-shift briefing into a party, complete with paper hats, quiche and pastry. **********In some cases, their camaraderie was even transferred to the passengers, many of whom began to pull together. As Miss McGlynn called out standby names, two college students in front of the crowd repeated them in harmony for the people in back. ''We were all in it together,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/09/business/finance-new-issues-zero-coupon-securities-introduced-in-london.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Zero-Coupon Securities Introduced in London", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Zero-Coupon Securities Introduced in London", "body_text": " **********Quadrex Securities Ltd. yesterday introduced zero-coupon securities to the British Government bond market, with an offering of $:309.3 million face amount of zero-coupon issues, known informally as ''stags.'' **********The new securities, which had the approval of the Bank of England, were created by separating interest payments from the principal on $:100 million of 15 1/2 percent Treasury bonds, or gilts, due in 1998 Together with Charterhouse Japhet P.L.C., Quadrex is offering zero-coupon bonds due between 1985 and 1998 at prices ranging from 98.90, to yield 10.55 percent, and 26.875, to yield 11.11 percent. **********The name ''stags'' is an acronym for the special purpose company which issued the bonds - Sterling Transferable Accruing Government Securities. **********Like zero-coupon securities backed by United States Treasury securities, the bonds do not pay interest, but are sold at a discount from their face value.

Mariano Santini, described as Mr. Cutolo's confessor and accused of carrying messages for the crime leader, whose  followers sometimes call him ''Jesus'' and whose view of the world is sometimes  referred to as ''the Gospel.'' **********Mr. Cutolo's sobriquet reflects in part the mystical trappings he has given his New Camorra group, complete with ancient initiation rites and pledges of loyalty. ''It becomes almost sacramental,'' said Judge Lucio Di Pietro, one of the magistrates investigating the Camorra. **********Feigned Madness for Escape **********Mr. Cutolo's charisma comes from a series of unusual feats: he has spent about half his life in prison and has built his movement there. He once successfully feigned madness to escape a prison cell. **********Judge Di Pietro dismisses the sacramental rituals as a clever way of building loyalty, but he does not dismiss Mr. Cutolo's accomplishments. **********The judge said Mr. Cutolo did most of his recruiting from prison, especially  among the poorest of the poor. An almost revivalist message promised mutual aid  among those who joined his organization, in return for absolute loyalty to him.  ''The whole organization was built in jail,'' said Amato Lamberti, a sociologist who runs an institute that studies the Camorra. **********Until Mr. Cutolo entered the scene, the ''old'' Camorra was a far more traditional organization. In its past, it emphasized mutual aid, albeit often for people involved in criminal activities. **********It also built black markets, which were welcomed by many of the poor in Naples, since the black market competition held prices down and created jobs for the many unemployed. **********Threatened Old Structure **********Over the years, different leaders of the Camorra held sway in different economic domains. Mr. Cutolo's challenge was to propose reorganizing the Camorra along geographic lines, with each local leader answering to him. This threatened the entire traditional structure, and the gang fighting began. **********In the meantime, Mr. Cutolo pulled off some significant coups. From prison, he organized a major drug connection with Peru, and he managed a spectacular prison escape. **********And he usually has the run of the prison. Former prisoners report that his men are in nearly complete control. Besides being able to communicate with the outside, Mr. Lamberti noted, Mr. Cutolo ''usually enjoys the best food from the  best of Naples restaurants; he refuses the prison food.'' **********Over 700 Dead in Gang War **********Three key events led to the transformation of organized crime in Naples and to the outbreak of gang warfare, which has claimed well over 700 lives since 1979. **********According to Judge Di Pietro, one crucial event was the earthquake that hit Naples on Nov. 23, 1980. ''After the earthquake, the enterpreneurial phase began,'' the judge said. ''They started recycling money into the rebuilding.' **********In addition, the narcotics business and the millions of new dollars gave the  gangs in Naples, as in Sicily, much more to fight over. Out of this grew Mr. Cutolo's plan to take a major stake in the international cocaine traffic. **********The third key event, according to Mr. Lamberti, took place in 1979 and 1980,  when Mr. Cutolo sought to move into areas controlled by the traditional Camorra  families, notably the cigarette smuggling business. **********Mr. Lamberti said investigators had not chosen to look deeply into the Camorra's business operations. **********But Judge Di Pietro, who works out of a cramped, guarded office in the crumbling main courthouse, proffers a thick report to show how deeply investigators have gone. He says a large-scale trial was the most efficient approach to such large-scale criminality. **********''We've been very quick,'' he said, sighing, ''in spite of what they say.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/15/business/stocks-up-modestly-trading-slow.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1985-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 515, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRADING SLOW", "print_headline": "STOCKS UP MODESTLY; TRADING SLOW", "body_text": " **********Stock prices managed a small gain yesterday in continued light trading. **********The Dow Jones industrial average finished 1.68 points ahead, at 1,316.98. **********Advances on the New York Stock Exchange led declines by 883 to 616 as most other closely monitored indexes also gained ground.

General Foods is discovering that a similar ploy works pretty well with TV commercials. **********In order to combat the ''zapping'' craze and get consumers to watch General Foods video ads without jumping to another channel, the White Plains package goods giant has been wrapping its 30-second commercial messages in a bit of meatier programming, something informative and noncommercial that makes the pill easier to swallow. **********It doesn't require much - about 60 or 90 seconds - making a total package of two minutes or less. **********They are now being used effectively on five cable TV networks, but nowhere on broadcast. The reason is simple enough. The broadcasters want to charge for the time used by programming material, which is supplied free by General Foods, according to David Braun, the director of media services. If not for that snag, General Foods would already be using a little commercial coating selectively where the problem of zapping and clutter are at their worst. **********One of the cable networks that is using what the company calls its ''Short Cuts'' is Lifetime, the result of the merger about a year ago of the foundering Cable Health Network with the Daytime network. According to Thomas F. Burchill, the former broadcaster who is its president and chief executive, Lifetime gives advertisers the 30-second advertising plus the 60-second addition for the price of a 60-second slot. **********He and his associate, Andrew H. Feinstein, vice president-sales, call the programming informercials, or Lifetime Tips, or just Tips for short. Mr. Braun prefers the designation ''wraparound miniprogram'' because by his definition informercials contain advertiser-related plugs and his programming does not. **********Mr. Burchill also calls them Lifetime Minutes, which sounds a bit more proprietary, and he and Mr. Feinstein are doing what they can to promote more of the same. **********Lifetime, a property of Hearst/ ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services, has been running such Minutes for Procter & Gamble, Lever Brothers, A.H.

Its prime-time personalities include Richard Simmons, Regis Philbin, Stanley Siegel and Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex adviser. **********The man responsible for all that, Mr. Burchill, who is 43 years old, has been in the broadcast business since Holy Cross and the Navy, starting out with advertising rep firms, the Edward Petry Company and John Blair & Company, and then doing his own thing at Bolton/Burchill Ltd. Then he heard a call from RKO and got the top job of the sales division for the owned stations.

Hutton had said at the time it pleaded guilty that it would be conducting its own internal investigation. **********Hutton has already agreed to pay a total of more than $10 million in penalties to the Federal Government and restitution to the banks whose money it used without their consent. The Justice Department had charged that from July 1980 through February 1982 Hutton schemed to systematically withdraw billions of dollars from the bank accounts of its branch offices before checks to cover those withdrawals had been collected by the banks. **********Mr. Bell, who was Attorney General from January 1977 to August 1979 under President Jimmy Carter, is a senior partner in the law firm of King & Spalding in Atlanta and served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1961 to 1976. He is expected to meet next week with Hutton's officials and attorneys to begin his inquiry.

But despite the attention it has generated, none of the shareholders asked about it. **********In addition to retaining Mr. Bell, Mr. Fomon announced ''further steps to eliminate the risk of future abuse.'' One of these, he said, was to have the firm's money mobilization department report directly to the company's control and planning division, rather than to the operations division. Mr. Fomon said that would provide ''centralized management of all those activities relating to the management, mobilization and control of the company's financial resources.'' **********Another corrective step, he said, would be to dock the pay of the managers of branches where excessive drawdowns of bank acccounts occurred. The managers will be assessed the cost of the firm's restitution from their future compensation, he said, because part of their past compensation came from the interest profits of their branches. **********Terming the checking scheme ''a sorry affair,'' Mr. Fomon said that ''much has been debated about individual punishment - I have wrestled with the personnel problem for two weeks now.'' He said that if any clients had been injured, ''the decision would be easy; the people involved would be gone.''

By Mr. Rhoades's count, 55 such publications were created in 1983. A like number went down the drain the following year, while 35 more were being started. **********Many, like the two magazines that he publishes, are ''maker specific,'' that is, aimed at owners of specific makes of computer. So along with all of the other needed ingredients, the success of the machines is basic to the success of the publication. **********Many of the magazines that failed, Mr. Rhoades said, were those whose machines failed. Others were undercapitalized or undermanaged. **********Wall Street analysts believe that much of the high death rate is because not enough advertising is available to support the crush. But Mr. Rhoades reported that a sister company, the International Data Corporation, estimates that annual ad spending for computers now stands at $1 billion and will go to $6.8 billion by 1989. **********And who will probably be around to enjoy that windfall? The McGraw- Hills, the Ziff-Davises and the ABC's of this world. Deep pockets one and all. **********Mr. Rhoades is pretty confident that he and his company, PC World Communications in San Francisco, will be with them.

Hutton, declined comment except to say: ''Mr.  Turner is a client of ours. He is known to us and we have been working with him  on a number of matters.'' **********According to investment banking sources familiar with last week's negotiations, Shearson Lehman withdrew from pursuing a hostile takeover of CBS after Mr. Turner decided not to take on a corporate partner. At the same time, two sources familiar with the negotiations said, William E. Simon, former Secretary of the Treasury, also pulled back from working with Mr. Turner, and he may be preparing a bid of his own. **********One reason Mr. Turner and Mr. Simon parted company, one of these sources said, was that the two men disagreed over the roles and authority each would have were they to gain control of CBS. Mr. Simon declined to comment yesterday on reports about his dealings with Mr. Turner. **********Bankers at Shearson Lehman, according to an investment banking source, agreed initially to work with Mr. Turner because they admired his business acumen and were convinced that he genuinely wanted to run CBS. However, the Wall Street source said, Shearson Lehman believed a corporate partner was necessary to increase Mr. Turner's chance for success. **********By choosing to try taking over CBS without a partner, several investment banking sources said Mr. Turner could follow a more personally risky approach. One Wall Street source said that such a course could mean Mr. Turner would sell  his company, of which he owns 80 percent, and use the proceeds - estimated at more than $500 million if he were to sell at $40 a share - as a down payment to  buy at least 51 percent of CBS, a percentage that could cost $2.5 billion, according to Wall Street estimates. **********The remainder of the financing, Wall Street sources said, could be financed by ''junk bonds,'' which yield higher interest rates and dividends to investors  than most other securities.

The company has 12 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. **********SCM officials could not be reached for comment.

In that framework, I view the stock as undervalued and the offer as on the low side.'' **********SCM's sales totaled $2.2 billion in the year ended June 30, up from $1.9 billion in the year earlier.

Last April, the company announced a major write-off primarily associated with a restructuring of its typewriter operations. **********No Stranger to Suitors **********SCM, moreover, is no stranger to uninvited suitors. In 1979, N. Norman Muller, head of a private company that owned Petrocelli clothing, sought to liquidate the company, but lost the battle.

Other American operations include the Endicott Johnson Corporation, the shoe manufacturer and retailer, the Hygrade Food Products Corporation, which makes Ball Park frankfurters and the Ames Company, a producer of hand tools. **********In June, Hanson announced plans to raise $630 million through a stock offering to be used for paying off debt and financing possible acquisitions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 17, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   People", "body_text": " **********Russell J.

Weill had resigned as president and that it had named Louis V. Gerstner Jr., head of travel services, to succeed him. **********Mr. Weill's resignation came after months of rumors that the strong-willed Wall Street executive was restless in the huge company and after he made at least two unreported attempts to buy the troubled Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which he headed, from American Express. **********Mr. Gerstner, 43 years old, will assume the No. 2 post Aug. 1, when Mr. Weill's resignation becomes effective. Mr. Weill will continue as a consultant to American Express until his employment contract expires in June of 1986. **********The new president, described by associates as a consummate operations man, is credited with revitalizing the company's travel division, now American Express's biggest profit center. [Page D5.]  The company also announced that it planned a partial divestiture of Fireman's Fund. [Page D5.]  Mr. Weill, who is 52, made his mark by forging a string of brokerage houses into what today is the giant Shearson Lehman Brothers investment banking arm of American Express. **********Asked why he had stepped down, Mr. Weill said yesterday, ''I want to do my own thing, to run and build something again.'' **********James D. Robinson 3d, the 49-year-old chairman and chief executive of American Express, accepted Mr. Weill's long-expected resignation ''with disappointment.'' Mr. Robinson categorically rejected Wall Street speculation that he and Mr. Weill were unable to get along and remarked, ''We get along very well, we're friends, and are rather amused by all the talk.'' **********In a long interview yesterday in which Mr. Robinson and Mr. Weill seemed exceptionally comfortable with each other, Mr. Weill tended to agree with Wall Street's assessment that he had become frustrated and restless with the loss of his command as head of a major brokerage house and his assumption of a management role in the big American Express bureaucracy. **********He noted that he had been building Shearson for 25 years and now expected to help Mr. Robinson ''and then decompress and think about what I'm going to do.'' **********Asked how long he might decompress, he said with a smile, ''Anywhere from a day to a week.'' **********The firm that Mr. Weill built originated in 1960 as Carter, Berlind & Weill. When Arthur Levitt, now the American Stock Exchange chief, joined it, it become known as ''corn beef with lettuce.'' By mid-1981, when American Express bought it for $915 million, it had become Shearson Loeb Rhoades and Mr. Weill was its board chairman, a post he retained after the acquisition. By 1983, he had been named president of American Express and Peter A. Cohen, his close associate, now 38, was named to succeed him as head of Shearson. **********Rumors of Departure **********Rumors of Mr. Weill's impending departure began earlier this year, touched off by reports that he had begun selling his American Express stock. But Mr. Weill maintained yesterday that the sale had ''nothing to do with my leaving'' and was his way of diversifying his investments. He noted that he had received some $30 million worth of American Express stock in the Shearson sale and had been selling off a part each year. **********He declined to discuss his net worth - thought to approach $50 million -but said with a suggestion of his easy dealings with the American Express chief, ''I'm nearly as rich as Jim Robinson.'' **********Both executives confirmed widespread Wall Street reports that Mr. Weill had tried at least twice to buy Fireman's Fund but was rebuffed by company directors. **********Mr. Weill said that he had put together a leveraged buyout group, had arranged the financing and planned to be head of it. Mr. Robinson said, however, that the company decided that the ''best route'' for Fireman's Fund would be to sell stock in the company to the public in an initial public offering. **********'The Present Is Still Bad' **********Mr. Weill had come to know the insurer extremely well when asked to help rebuild the company a year and a half ago. His assessment of Fireman's Fund yesterday: ''The future looks bright, but the present is still bad.'' To help put it back on the track, he had cut employment by 2,000, to 12,000; dismissed unproductive agents; cut costs heavily; raised rates by an average of 40 percent, and canceled several kinds of unprofitable coverage. **********Asked what made him think he could turn the big insurer around, he said, talking as if he were still part of a deal: ''I'm an alchemist. It's gone through a down cycle and now the cycle appears to be changing. We think that over five years we can make Fireman's Fund into an outstanding company.'' **********With the departure of Mr. Weill, some on Wall Street suggested that his protege, Mr. Cohen, seemed vulnerable. But Mr. Robinson, when asked whether the Shearson chief's future at the company was shaky, replied, ''Nope.'' **********''Peter Cohen is doing a terrific job running Shearson Lehman Brothers,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''Sandy passed on an orderly baton to Peter and Peter has run the firm, expanded its size and things are going very well. Clearly, Peter Cohen is a key member of the senior management team, as are the heads of all our other subsidiaries.'' **********One of American Express's major unresolved problems at the moment centers on Warner Amex Cable Communications, a cable company owned jointly with Warner Communications. American Express is willing to sell its half to Time Inc. and Tele-Communications under an $850 million offer, but Warner, which must also agree, has so far not done so. The impasse is expected to be resolved by one of the partners buying out the other. **********Its American Express Bank is, according to Mr. Robinson, ''doing very well,'' although Edmond J. Safra, the Lebanese-born Swiss banker, resigned last year as board chairman after the company refused to sell him back part of the operations he had sold to the company. Mr. Safra, however, is still an American Express director. **********Investors Diversified Services, the big mutual fund company that American Express bought in late 1983, is, Mr. Robinson said, ''doing very very well.'' **********Using Mr. Weill's nickname, Mr. Robinson noted that IDS was ''Sandy's brainchild, and it's worked out very well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/business/credit-markets-bond-prices-swing-upward.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 728, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ;   Bond Prices Swing Upward", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS ;   Bond Prices Swing Upward", "body_text": " **********Bond prices firmed in the credit markets yesterday, ending for the moment what had been a period of weakness during the holiday season.

And when retail activity builds up, the market tends to feel better.'' **********Aside from a pickup in volume, market participants were encouraged by a lower Federal funds rate, the overnight rate for bank loans; results of the latest purchasing managers survey - which showed a reduction in the pace of economic activity in December from November levels - and forecasts that this week's report from the Federal Reserve on the nation's basic money supply will show a large decline. **********''The economy seems to have regained some of its momentum,'' said William N. Griggs, managing director of Griggs & Santow Inc., financial consultants, ''but the market does not think it is looking at an economy that is in danger of overheating. That perception helped to give the market a pretty good tone.'' **********After fluctuating wildly last week, the closely watched Federal funds rate traded in a narrow range of between 8 percent and 8 1/4 percent yesterday. Due in part to thin holiday trading, it traded last week as low as 7 percent and as high as almost 14 percent. **********Yesterday's improved conditions served the Treasury well, as it sold $14 billion of three-month and six- month bills at its regular weekly auction. **********At the auction, the Treasury said that the average discount yield on its three-month bills fell to 7.78 percent, down from the 7.86 percent average yield at last week's auction.

Prices in those markets rose by three-eighths of a point to three-quarters of a point in moderate trading, traders said. **********While some analysts continue to forecast that another cut in the discount rate, currently at 8 percent, could be forthcoming, Mr. Griggs of Griggs & Santow said such a move wasunlikely. At the same time, however, he sees little evidence suggesting that the Fed is likely to tighten its grip on monetary policy, even if signs of a resurgence in economic activity become stronger. **********''The market seems to be sensing a change in attitude at the Fed, where the arguments of Preston Martin and Martha Seger to look at the inflation performance seem to be gaining more weight,'' he said. **********''That is not a political argument,'' he added. ''There is a legitimate point to be made that in setting policy one doesn't want to focus entirely on the economy and its real growth pace, but also on what sort of inflation performance we are getting. The Fed seems to see that we are not getting the same pickup in inflation that we would normally expect at this point in the business cycle.'' **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six- month Treasury bills: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) **********3-Mo.

That does not include an additional 700,000 tons required, but not pledged, for the 21 African countries affected, it said. **********According to the report, the amount of food aid required by Africa this marketing year climbed by 100,000 tons in the last month, to seven million tons. But as of late April, only 6.3 million tons had been pledged, and of this 2.7 million tons had been delivered. **********Some Seed Has Been Eaten **********In southern Africa, the report said, all grain that has been promised needs to be delivered immediately, and supplies for sub-Saharan countries must be received before June rains make remote districts inaccessible. **********Seed has been eaten in many areas to stave off starvation, and the United Nations organization predicted that even if weather was favorable, food deficits would continue into 1986 unless the seed was replaced. **********''Urgent action is therefore needed not only to save human lives,'' the report said, ''but also to insure the normal planting of crops.'' **********To speed delivery of food aid, special steps are needed to remove bottlenecks at African ports, the report said. **********The flow of supplies into Ethiopia is limited by problems at its Red Sea port of Assab, and congestion at several West African ports has increased the suffering for famine victims in Chad, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. **********The Countries Hardest Hit **********In the United Nations organization's assessment, these are the six hardest-hit countries: *********** Chad. Its food supply remains critical, the report says, mainly because of a shortage of trucks, limited capacity at the port of Douala and transit problems at the Nigerian port of Apapa. Less than a third of the 1.5 million Chadians who require food aid are receiving it. *********** Ethiopia. Food supplies remain serious in northern areas, where the report said five million people were ''at risk.'' Logistical problems remain acute at ports while domestic distribution is restricted by security problems because of fighting between rebels and the army. Ethiopia has received less than half of the 961,000 tons of aid requirements pledged by donors for 1985. A lack of long-haul trucks threatens the scheduled delivery of the remainder, and a shortage of seeds will hurt the main growing season this year. *********** Mali. The food situation is still critical, the report said, primarily a result of insufficient transportation to carry food from the Ivory Coast port of Abidjan. It has received less than a third of the 283,000 tons in aid the organization estimates are needed in 1985. *********** Niger. The situation is worsening for some 400,000 nomad herdsmen affected by the famine. The report said the closure of the Nigerian port of Apapa for Niger-destined goods had disrupted an otherwise carefully planned program. *********** Mozambique. The country is facing a critical food supply situation, the report said, especially in the southern and central provinces that were subjected to heavy rains and flooding in February. Some 2.5 million people are experiencing food shortages. *********** The Sudan.

He was 66 years old. **********Lord Harlech was returning last night to his family estate at Talsarnau, in north Wales, 60 miles west of Shrewsbury, when his car collided with another vehicle, the police said. **********His ties with the Kennedys dated from the 1930's, when Joseph P. Kennedy was the American Ambassador to Britain. He became friends with John F. Kennedy, the Ambassador's son, when the 21-year-old American was a student at the London School of Economics. The ties became closer when John Kennedy's sister Kathleen married the Marquess of Hartington, Lord Harlech's cousin, in 1944. **********Lord Harlech, then William David Ormsby Gore, entered Parliament in 1950 and held several Foreign Office posts before Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, mindful of his friendship with the Kennedys, sent him to Washington in 1961. Once described by President Kennedy as ''the brightest man I know'' and regarded by many as the President's closest non-American friend, he became closely identified in Britain with the Kennedy Administration and family. **********Like the Kennedys, Lord Harlech was touched by glamour and dogged by tragedy. He was born on May 20, 1918, the second son of the Fourth Baron of Harlech and Lady Beatrice Cecil, and grew up in a family noted for its political and social connections. **********His father was a Member of Parliament for 28 years and held several ministerial posts. His mother was the granddaughter of Lord Salisbury, a former Prime Minister and a powerful figure in the Conservative Party. **********His elder brother, Gerard, died in a car accident before World War II. His childhood sweetheart, Sylvia Lloyd Thomas, whom he married in 1940, also died in an automobile accident, in 1967. **********Educated at Oxford **********Lord Harlech graduated from Eton and New College, Oxford. He served in the Berkshire Yeomanry in World War II, attaining the rank of major. Elected to Parliament as a Conservative representing the English-Welsh border constituency of Oswestry, he was soon appointed as Secretary to the Minister of State in the Foreign Office. **********In 1956 he became Parliamentary Under Secretary to the Minister of State, and from 1957 to 1961 he was Minister of State, the position immediately under that of Foreign Secretary. **********As Minister of State, he worked on disarmament issues and represented Britain in United Nations debates. He was knighted in 1961 shortly after being named Ambassador to Washington. **********In 1964, after the death of his father, he hesitantly accepted the family title and became the fifth Baron Harlech. After leaving his post as Ambassador in 1965, he returned to London and became deputy leader of the Conservatives in the House of Lords in 1966. **********From 1965 until his death, Lord Harlech was president of the British Board of Film Censors. **********He is survived by his second wife, the former Pamela Colin, a New Yorker who was London editor of Vogue magazine when they married in 1969. Also surviving is their daughter, Pandora, and four children by his first marriage: a son, Francis, and three daughters, Jane, Victoria and Alice.

In July the front seized the town of Barentu in the southwestern part of Eritrea. Spokesmen for the front at that time declared the victory their most significant in more than a year, consolidating rebel control over a large portion of the region. **********A telling blow to the rebel effort to grow food for the people in their areas was the taking by Ethiopian forces of a 5,000-hectare mechanized and irrigated farm at Ali Ghidir, about 50 miles west of Barentu. **********A debate is now going on over whether the front, well equipped with arms seized during the July capture of Barentu, will regroup for a counteroffensive and on how much of the Eritrean countryside Ethiopian forces will try to continue to hold. **********The Eritrean conflict is one of the longest running wars of modern times. The former Italian colony of Eritrea was loosely federated with Ethiopia after World War II.

It ''has been used to attack those very values which it was designed to uphold, '' he said. **********Gave Notice a Year Ago **********Last December, the British served notice, as required by law, of their intention to withdraw from Unesco, complaining about what they viewed as an anti-Western stance. They also complained that Unesco spends 70 percent of its budget at its Paris headquarters, rather than in the field. But until today, the British had left open the possibility they would change their minds if Unesco made major changes. **********In Paris, Unesco's Director General, Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, said he ''deeply regrets'' the decision, which he said ''must also come as a surprise'' to those who sought agreement over the last two years on the agency's programs, budget and structure. **********In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said West Germany had been encouraged to remain a member by decisions at a Unesco conference last month that the spokesman said showed a willingness to achieve reform. **********''Those decisions can only be put into practice from within,'' he said.

In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency Tass condemned the British move and said it proved London had joined a United States-led propaganda campaign against the organization. **********U.S. Action **********The United States withdrew from Unesco at the end of last year, after charging that the agency had become politicized and anti-Western. Washington has maintained contact with the organization in the status of observer. **********Mr. Raison said today that Britain also intended to maintain observer status at Unesco because it supports the agency's underlying principles. **********The decision to withdraw from the organization brought loud protests from Tory and opposition Members of Parliament and charges, denied by Mr. Raison, that the Government was responding to pressure from the United States and from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative American research group. **********'A Kick in the Teeth' **********George Foulkes, the Member of Parliament who led the Labor Party's attack in a session that was sparsely attended, called the decision ''shabby and disgraceful,'' as well as ''a kick in the teeth for the third world and another step in Britain's isolation.'' **********He pointed out that all members of the Commonwealth and the European Common Market, as well as all but one speaker in the recent House of Commons debate, had urged the Government to stay in Unesco. **********At its conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, this fall, Unesco said it was making changes and had adopted a budget of $307 million for 1986 and 1987 that had been cut by 25 percent to reflect the withdrawal of the United States, which had contributed one-quarter of past budgets. **********The organization also did not seem to be pressing as hard as in the past in its campaign for what has been termed a new world information order, a program that Western countries fear would restrict freedom of the press. **********''There has been some reform,'' Mr. Raison said today, ''but the degree of reform is not sufficient. **********''It is sad that an organization which began with such high hopes and to which this country has contributed so much in the past should have gone so wrong. But we have to deal with what the organization has become.'' **********Founded in London in 1945 **********Unesco's constitution was drafted at an international conference in London in November 1945. **********The decision to leave, Mr. Raison said, ''is in no way aimed at the United Nations system as a whole.

Unfortunately, Unesco is not such a body.'' **********The $9 million budgeted for next year's British contribution to Unesco will go instead to other educational and scientific activities, particularly in the Commonwealth, he said. **********Mr. Foulkes contended that these programs would be no substitute for effective aid through Unesco. **********He also said the State Department had been informed of the decision before Parliament. **********''We have never been subjected to U.S. pressure,'' Mr. Raison replied, denying that Washington had heard the news first. **********Move is Criticized **********Edward Heath, the Conservative former Prime Minister, told the House of Commons on Nov. 22 that withdrawal from Unesco would be typical of ''the growth of a nasty, narrow-minded nationalism which believes that we can survive without the rest of the world.'' **********David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, echoed these sentiments today, saying the decision made Britain ''an international Philistine.'' **********Some Conservatives said they were delighted with the decision. Others, who agreed with the decision, were more somber. ''This is a very sad occasion for me,'' said Robert Rhodes James, a Conservative Member of Parliament for Cambridge, ''not because the Government decision is wrong, but because it is right. Unesco has become a disgrace.'' **********When Unesco was founded after the war, its first Director General was the British scientist Julian Huxley.

Today, though, a more complex technology is on the horizon and it centers on an automobile that listens as well as talks. **********Like Michael Knight on the television show ''Knight Rider,'' drivers of the late 1980's and early 1990's will converse with what now would be considered super vehicles, according to experts in the fledgling field. And the idea is not as silly as it might seem, they say, because voice command will promote safety by allowing a driver to keep eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. **********Current prototypes perform only simple functions, such as starting the engine and turning on the lights and windshield wipers. But the end product is expected to be a car that can be told to tune its radio, alter its interior climate and dial its cellular telephone, as well as respond to questions about engine condition, fuel economy and the driver's trip in general. **********Renault is one of the manufacturers that is heavily involved in research on what has come to be called automotive dialogue. Daniel Dubus, chief engineer in the company's Scientific and Technical Affairs division, said studies over the next year will provide management with sufficient information so that a firm decision can be made on marketing cars that hear and interpret human speech. **********Thus far, he said, the research has proved the feasibility of the concept - and turned up some problems as well. The difficulties are the same as those that have plagued other electronic engineers, including those at the Ford Motor Company, which also is investigating the idea's possibilities. **********Initially, Renault's work centered on voice control of secondary functions, such as wipers, turn signals and power windows. Part of the research also centered on the sort of information that drivers would want from the car and on how much they would be willing to pay for it, Mr. Dubus said. **********At its heart, the system has a central computer and voice-recognition components, and its very basic version works well in most sorts of traffic and noise situations. For Renault, word recognition was 95 percent, according to Mr. Dubus, with the car failing to comprehend about 4 percent of what was said to it, and misinterpreting 1 percent. **********A computer interprets speech by converting the sound waves to electrical impulses, then translating them into digital form and comparing the combination of digits with a ''template'' that tells the computer what is meant. The chief difficulty is the wide variation in the way words are said - the inflection, the speed, the accent - and in separating one word from another. **********Two forms of the system exist, the speaker-dependent version, in which the computer is trained to recognize a specific person's voice, and the speaker-independent system, which responds to words spoken by any voice at all. The latter is much more complex and less successful, requiring far more computer memory to sort out even a small vocabulary. **********The strides in compressing the size of computers while increasing their power are what have made speech recognition in automobiles possible, but the state of the art still is such that speaker-dependent systems are more practical at present. As a specific voice is programmed, the computer learns the frequency patterns of that person's speech, and recognition accuracy can be almost perfect. **********However, noise, or even a cold that alters the speaker's tones, can cause a misunderstanding or total lack of comprehension. The further difficulty is in separating phrases. One way to do that is for the speaker to inject pauses between each word, although even then - and particularly in a car - background noise can seem to string the words together and be read by the computer as a phrase. **********Filters are used to solve that problem to some extent, but the slow enunciation of words is artificial, and the engineers are at work on another way of doing things, in which the computer is trained to pick command words out of a phrase that it otherwise does not recognize. The system, called continuous-word recognition, also eliminates the problem of extraneous noise, since the computer simply rejects it as another word for which it cannot find a match in its memory. **********Some road noise is automatically excluded, the engineers say, since the actual bandwidth that a computer requires is fairly narrow, with all the information needed to understand human speech contained in the 300 to 3,000 Hz range. The vocal range is greater than that, of course, but high-fidelity is not a factor for the computer. **********According to Jerry Rivard, Ford's chief electronic engineer, a key word or key switch also is required to allow the system to ignore the vehicle's radio and normal conversation. **********In addition, there has to be some way to lock out the car's special rapport with its owner. Otherwise, you would never be able to leave it with a parking attendant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/05/world/us-legislators-appear-stunned.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. LEGISLATORS APPEAR STUNNED", "print_headline": "U.S. LEGISLATORS APPEAR STUNNED", "body_text": " **********A Soviet defector's announcement today that he would return home stunned leading members of Congress.

Detroit has used the period of restraints to undergo the most thorough rebuilding in its history and has positioned itself to concentrate on the intermediate price range, where Japan's cost advantages will not be so punishing. **********Indeed, the cornerstone of Detroit's plan for coping with the easing of the export restraints following four years of quotas is to buy large numbers of small cars in Japan to sell here under American labels. And while these so- called captive imports fill out its model lines, Detroit's true test will come in the compact and small-specialty segments of the auto market. **********''At the low end, Detroit will become more a distributor than a manufacturer,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''The next battleground is in small luxury and sporty cars.'' **********The marketing struggle is pitting cars like the Mazda RX-7 against such Detroit offerings as the Chrysler LeBaron GTS, the Dodge Lancer, the Pontiac Grand Am and the Oldsmobile Calais. **********Principal Market Arena **********The key customers are the comfortably off young people, the generation that bought droves of Toyotas, Nissans and Hondas as basic transportation and now, grown older, has its eye on something nicer. The key products are the better-equipped small cars: four-door sedans with more creature comforts or the sporty models that signify youth and energy. **********Auto industry people expect the Japanese to cut into Detroit's share of those markets - though not as quickly as they came to dominate in small cars - and to start challenging European makes such as the lower end of the Audi, BMW and Volvo lines. Japanese cars like the Nissan 300 ZX and the Toyota Cambry are considered strong entries in the $12,000-to-$18,000 price range. **********The encouraging news is that in today's market the small-car category is much less important than it once was. Three years ago, the low-priced subcompacts - which now sell for $7,500 or less, offering basic transportation and not much more - made up 30 percent of the market. Last year their share dropped to 15 percent. **********Tokyo's New Export Plan **********Beginning Monday, Japanese imports to the United States will jump to 2.3 million cars a year from the previous ceiling of 1.85 million. The 24.3 percent rise follows President Reagan's recent decision not to press Japan to continue ''voluntary restraints'' on car shipments. The Japanese Government imposed the ceiling to assure ''orderly markets'' at a time when industry sources said exports might soar as high as 2.8 million units without any restraint. **********Much of the increase will likely go to the captive imports sold by American companies, so the financial impact on the Big Three auto companies is expected to be minimal. **********''The impact will not be felt strongly at all because car sales are good now,'' said Jean-Claude Gruet, an auto industry analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. ''But it will be felt very sharply when the next sales downturn hits.'' **********The General Motors Corporation already sells cars made by the Isuzu Motor Company and the Suzuki Motor Company as the Chevrolet Spectrum and Chevrolet Sprint. The Chevrolet Nova, which is to be introduced in June, is a thinly disguised Toyota Corolla made by G.M.'s joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation in Fremont, Calif. **********Further Links With Japan **********The Chrysler Corporation, despite the attacks on Japanese tactics by its chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, has been selling cars made by the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation as Dodges and Colts and is seeking to increase its imports from that company. **********The Ford Motor Company has no captive imports at the moment but is building a factory in Mexico to make cars with the assistance of its Japanese affiliate, the Mazda Motor Company. Ford is also expected to buy half the output of an assembly plant Mazda plans in the Detroit area. **********All three companies have advanced projects, such as G.M.'s Saturn Corporation, to build competitive small cars in this country, but all are three or four years from production. **********When the restraints began in 1981, the tacit understanding was that Detroit was being given breathing room to rebuild financially and become competitive with the Japanese. By all accounts, Detroit has tried to do so. **********Some Imaginative Offerings **********New models have poured from its factories, including Chrysler's mini- van and Pontiac's two-seat Fiero, imaginative offerings that created new classes of vehicles. **********Detroit's model lineup is almost completely changed from four years ago - a transformation that consumed a staggering $50 billion in capital investment. And though the achievement has gone largely unnoticed because of the decline in the price of gasoline, the fact is that American-made cars now equal or exceed comparable Japanese models in fuel economy, according to Government mileage ratings. **********''This industry's operations have undergone a major transformation, at enormous cost, to meet the new realities of the business environment and the demands of the marketplace,'' said Philip Caldwell, who recently retired as Ford's chairman. **********By almost any measure, the American industry is more advanced and more productive than it was four years ago. Yet its most critical handicap, its cost disadvantage, persists. **********''The Japanese have a $2,300 to $2,600 cost advantage in small cars,'' said James Harbour, the consulting engineer who first documented Japan's manufacturing superiority. ''They are making huge profits in this country and are using them to develop superb new products.'' **********Lower Wage Rates Cited **********According to Mr. Harbour, the Japanese advantage is rooted in lower wage rates, more efficient use of labor, lower warranty costs and leaner white-collar staffs. He says the strong dollar penalizes Detroit by about $500 a car. **********The Japanese have never fully exploited their cost advantage to cut prices and maximize their share of the American market. Instead, they have invested profits in advertising, more features and new models. **********In today's strong market, the Japanese are not expected to cut prices. **********Four years ago the American automobile industry was in dire trouble. The economy was in a recession, more than 300,000 auto workers were in unemployment lines and the Big Three had lost $4 billion in the previous year. Chrysler was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. **********At the same time auto imports, mostly from Japan, were capturing an ever larger share of a shrinking market. At one point every fourth car being sold in this country came from Japan. The domestic industry asked Washington for help. **********The assistance came in the form of the supposedly voluntary restraints under which the Japanese limited themselves to 1.68 million cars a year for three years. The agreement was later extended for a fourth year but at a level of 1.85 million units. **********The American industry's financial recovery has been spectacular. The combination of reduced costs because of more efficient operations, modest contracts accepted by the auto union and a shift by car buyers back to big, option-laden cars produced profits totaling almost $10 billion in 1984 for the Big Three. The recovery has been less robust for labor, with more than 100,000 former auto workers still off. **********A Change in Operations **********In addition to spending money on capital investments, the automobile companies have changed the way they operate. G.M. has reorganized its five semi-autonomous automobile divisions into two supergroups to eliminate duplication of effort. It purchased the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to develop paperless communications systems. **********Chrysler halved the size of its white-collar staff during its crisis. **********At Ford, the approach now is ''simultaneous engineering'' of new products rather than the sequential systems of the past that forced factory engineers to try to correct the mistakes made by designers. **********Nevertheless, the public remains skeptical about the quality of Detroit's cars. In a recent survey by J.D. Power & Associates, an automotive-oriented market research firm, American auto companies scored 2.76 on a zero-to-five scale on overall quality of workmanship, compared with 3.39 for the Japanese. **********The industry has also made progress on productivity. Reduced staffs, leaner inventories, union concessions and more sophisticated operating procedures have cut the industry's break-even point from 11.2 million cars and trucks in 1980 to about 8 million now, the Government says. **********But small cars remain a problem. According to G.M. officials, the giant auto maker was planning to build a code-named ''S'' car about the size of a Honda Civic in this country until one of G.M.'s Japanese affiliates, Isuzu, demonstrated in late 1981 that it could produce similar models for almost $2,000 a car less. **********So General Motors adopted what the United Automobile Workers terms its ''Japanese strategy.'' The company agreed to buy as many as 300,000 small cars a year from Isuzu and Suzuki. It also arranged its joint venture with Toyota to build a slightly larger model in Fremont, and now it plans to import cars from Daewoo, the South Korean company, for sale as Pontiacs by the 1987 model year. **********In addition, General Motors began its now highly publicized Saturn program. It is to produce an American- built small car that matches the Japanese in both quality and cost. **********Direct Competition Planned **********Roger B. Smith, chairman of G.M., said the Saturn cars will compete directly with the company's Isuzu and Suzuki models. If successful, he said, G.M. may stop importing small Japanese models. ''The market will tell you when to stop importing,'' he said in a recent interview. ''The Saturn people are trying to build a car that is so competitive it will push other people out of the market.'' **********Some analysts doubt that General Motors will ever be able to match the Japanese in the lower price range as long as it has to pay workers represented by the U.A.W. But the analysts say the techniques pioneered at Saturn may be a big help in controlling the cost of larger cars. ''It is good that G.M. is making the effort,'' Mr. Gruet of Dean Witter said. ''They will apply Saturn companywide.'' **********Chrysler has said it will simply abandon the low end of the car market to the Japanese, at least for now. **********''We're the last patriots around here,'' a Ford executive grumbled recently. The company is the only member of the Big Three that has not announced plans for large-scale imports from Japan, and its subcompact, the front-wheel-drive Escort, made in the United States, has been a top seller, though barely profitable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/22/world/summit-finale-western-allies-seen-encouraged-geneva-ceremony-live-on-soviet-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1985-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  GENEVA CEREMONY LIVE ON SOVIET TV", "print_headline": "SUMMIT FINALE: WESTERN ALLIES SEEN ENCOURAGED;   GENEVA CEREMONY LIVE ON SOVIET TV", "body_text": " **********Soviet television broke into normal programming at noon today for a live broadcast from Geneva of the joint appearance of President Reagan and Mikhail S.

Politicians, intellectuals and newspaper editorials have called for decentralizing the Government and for greater dedication to the welfare of the community over that of the individual. They have also demanded stricter building codes and a crackdown on corruption in public housing construction that may have allowed building regulations to be ignored. **********In the damaged areas of the capital rescue crews are beginning to be replaced by demolition crews, angering some families still seeking the bodies of relatives trapped in the rubble of fallen buildings. **********Hope for survivors has virtually ended, but near miraculous instances of survival continue to occur. Early this morning rescue workers found two newly born babies still alive almost five days after their maternity ward collapsed at Juarez Hospital. **********Death Toll at 4,200 **********There is little question that Mexico has suffered terrible physical and human destruction. The death toll is more than 4,200 and continues to rise daily as digging reaches the lower levels of crushed buildings. The center of the city will probably offer a vista of torn skyscrapers and splitting walls for months to come. **********But in a capital of more than 18 million people and one million buildings, the destruction and loss of human life could have been far worse. One of the few fortunate aspects of the disaster was that the first and most devastating earthquake struck at a little after 7 in the morning, when most office towers and public buildings were virtually empty. Had the shock waves hit during rush hour, the death toll would have been far higher. **********According to Ricardo Ampudia, a spokesman for the President's office, fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of the buildings in the capital were destroyed by the earthquakes. **********''It is important that the extent of the damage not be exaggerated,'' he said. **********Heavy Equipment Needed **********What the country needs most, Mr. Ampudia added, is heavy construction and demolition equipment and medical teams, since at least six hospitals were damaged by the quakes. There are ample supplies of food, clothing and medicine, he said. More than 100 plane flights from around the world have brought more than 1,800 tons of relief supplies, airport officials said. **********Besides the known dead, the Government lists 2,000 other city residents as missing and buried in fallen buildings. Some Western diplomats estimated that as many as 4,000 bodies may actually be found in the more than 400 fallen buildings. These include two large apartment complexes, three hospitals, a Government technical school and dozens of smaller apartment buildings and work places. At least 700 other buildings suffered serious damage, according to the Government. **********A major Mexico City newspaper, El Universal, estimated today that one million city workers have been left at least temporarily unemployed by the earthquakes that destroyed their shops and businesses. Although official figures list 30,000 homeless, Western diplomats and international relief officials give far higher numbers. El Universal used a figure of 350,000 homeless today. **********Still, Mexico City continued to recover today. Virtually all services are working again, there have been no epidemics caused by polluted water or decomposing bodies and the work of recovery and rebuilding is under way on nearly every downtown block that was torn and broken last week. The airports and the capital's subway are open. **********Although 152 schools were damaged, classes are expected to begin again next week.

Suburban stores, while performing slightly better than those in the city, generally have also shown an erratic, mostly downward sales pattern. **********Some Rays of Hope **********July results, however, reflected some rays of hope in the long, dull period. Four of the seven reporting retailers had sales gains of between 3 percent and 10 percent over 1984. At one of the companies, an executive reported, ''There were a number of high spots during July, such as strong dress business and good activity in women's sportswear, as well as in jewelry, designer clothing and furniture.'' **********But the overall results were severely dampened by sales declines reported by two of the largest-volume retailers, which dragged down the averages for the city and area. **********As in earlier months, July's retail environment was dominated by heavy price cutting at stores. One-day sales and extra price reductions at the cash register were added to ticketed price reductions. ''Consumers seem to have difficulty making a purchase unless it has a quickly perceived value,'' one retail executive observed. ''Whether it's price or newness or both, the value is what attracts today's customers.'' **********Competitive Marketplace **********Retailers continued to bemoan the pervasive price-cutting, acknowledging that it was difficult to arrest in an intensely competitive marketplace. The activity not only hampers profits because it involves reduced profit margins and higher promotion costs but also appears to be self-perpetuating, retailers said. Asked when price slashing might ease off, one executive replied: ''When customers show that they are willing to buy at full prices. But the problem is that they've gotten so used to price reductions, that they may not come about for some time.'' **********Retailers participating in the spot-check are Abraham & Straus, B.

The tentative Treasury plan represents a view within the Administration that the thrift industry should gradually be merged into the much stronger commercial banking industry. **********Such conversions could significantly shrink the size of the nation's thrift industry. While well over a thousand healthy institutions earned record profits this year, another 300 to 400 thrift units were essentially insolvent, according to industry estimates. The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, estimated a few weeks ago that another 1,300 thrift institutions were approaching insolvency as of the end of October. **********Highest Priority **********The Treasury's draft plan, which the Treasury believes would not require legislation, would represent a major entrance of non-banking organizations into the banking industry in circumvention of Federal laws that prohibit such consolidation. **********The Treasury official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said that finding a solution to the thrift unit problem was one of the department's highest priorities. In any solution, substantial sources of new capital would have to come from the private sector, he said. **********''When you look at the available sources of funds, the Government is not about to come up with any money at this time of deficit,'' he said. ''And there is just so much you can get from the thrift industry itself, so that leaves the private sector. When you get a realistic proposal from someone like a Sears, you should listen to it very carefully.'' **********The Treasury could encounter some opposition from the new Comptroller of the Currency, Robert L. Clarke. He told reporters today that he would oppose non-banking concerns entering the banking industry through purchase of insolvent thrift institutions, unless they came under the same regulatory restrictions as bank holding companies. But he did say he would favor commercial banks buying ailing thrift units and converting them to commercial bank charters as a means to infuse capital. **********Board Opposition **********The Treasury plan also faces opposition from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board - the regulatory agency for the multibillion-dollar thrift industry. In Sears's case, the bank board has already indicated that it was not welcome as a bidder for troubled thrift units because of its Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. brokerage subsidiary. **********But faced with a potential need for some $16 billion in new capital over the next three or four years, industry sources said the bank board might come under pressure by the Treasury to change its position. **********''My guess is that the bank board might be tempted by that kind of offer, but I think the industry would oppose it,'' said William O'Connell, president of the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********Doug Fairweather, a spokesman for Sears in Chicago, would not say whether Sears has made a specific proposal to the Treasury, but added: ''Until the early 1980's, it was known that we saw the acquisiton of troubled thrifts as a way to expand our presence in the deposit-taking and lending activity. But then that was cut off by the present bank board.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/15/business/winans-defense-challenges-legal-basis-for-case.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1985-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WINANS DEFENSE CHALLENGES LEGAL BASIS FOR CASE", "print_headline": "WINANS DEFENSE CHALLENGES LEGAL BASIS FOR CASE", "body_text": " **********The Federal Government yesterday rested its case against R. Foster Winans, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and the spotlight turned to a challenge by defense lawyers to the legal foundations for the criminal charges. **********The conclusion of the Government's case came exactly one year after the Securities and Exchange Commission began its formal investigation into the providing of advance information by Mr. Winans on articles he was writing for the ''Heard on the Street'' stock market column in The Journal. **********In the trial, being heard in the Federal District Court in Manhattan without a jury, the Government has charged Mr. Winans and two others with conspiracy, securities fraud and mail and wire fraud. **********There was no testimony yesterday. Before the prosecution rested its case, it dropped two of the 61 counts of its indictment and narrowed four others to include Mr. Winans and not his co-defendants. The basis for the criminal charges remain intact against Mr. Winans; David J. Carpenter, his roommate and a former news clerk at The Journal, and Kenneth P. Felis, a former broker at Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Mr. Winans's lawyer, Don Buchwald, then systematically began challenging the indictment. He asserted, for instance, that the defendants had no intention of defrauding Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Journal, as the Government has charged. **********In his rebuttal, Peter Romatowski, the Assistant United States Attorney handling the case, said that Mr. Winans had told one of the alleged co- conspirators that the disclosure of coming articles ''could get him into trouble at work.'' If there was not an intention on Mr. Winans's part to defraud, Mr. Romatowski asked, ''why sneak off to the A.T.&T. building next door to make phone calls, why use phony invoices'' to hide the payments to him? **********Mr. Buchwald also asked Judge Charles E. Stewart Jr. to drop most elements of the conspiracy charge because ''it lumps together different agreements and arrangements.'' In addition to the arrangement between Mr. Winans and two former Kidder, Peabody brokers, the Government also charged that previous trading of securities in the account of Mr. Carpenter was part of a conspiracy. Judge Stewart denied the motion, saying that ''the conspiracy started in January 1983 and other people joined in; basically it involves the same procedures.'' **********Mr. Buchwald also tried to show that the Government's case was without merit because it relied on the fact that Mr. Winans had violated The Journal's policy of not divulging information about coming articles. ''If the company did not have such a policy even the Government concedes there would have been no crime,'' he said. Judge Stewart conceded that the Government's case relied on that premise but added that ''there may be liability under some other theory that they reserve'' the right to call upon. **********'Journalistically Pure' **********In trying to counter the prosecution's charges that Mr. Winans's actions were conspiratorial and harmed the reputation of his employer, Mr. Buchwald said that the former reporter was never given a written statement of The Journal's policy and that the articles he wrote were accurate and based on their merit as being newsworthy. ''They were journalistically pure,'' Mr. Buchwald added. **********Jed Rakoff, the lawyer for Mr. Carpenter, argued that the charges against his client should be dismissed because no evidence had been presented to show that he was part of a conspiracy or knew of The Journal's policy. He said that Mr. Carpenter originally resisted making out the false invoices to cover up payments to Mr. Winans but then agreed to do so because he ''was in an hysterical state and felt physically threatened'' by Peter N. Brant, a former Kidder, Peabody broker who is the Government's chief witness. Mr. Brant has pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and fraud charges. **********Mr. Rakoff said that, when Mr. Carpenter signed the checks that his invoices for decorating services were meant to explain, he was merely serving a ''spousal role'' for Mr. Winans, with whom he shared a joint checking account. **********Judge Stewart is expected to decide on the motions for dismissal after he hears today from E.

But the stock rallied in the afternoon, closing less than a point below its opening level. Apparently investors overcame their initial apprehension. **********''Today's activity reflected all the attention the bankruptcy prospect got yesterday, last night and this morning from the financial community and the news media,'' said Rosario Ilacqua, an analyst at L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. He follows Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, after the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation. **********''It bottomed out today, then rose as the full brunt of the bankruptcy issue wore off,'' Mr. Ilacqua said. He expects the stock to ''continue to churn'' until Judge Solomon Casseb, the Texas judge in the Pennzoil case, reviews the jury's verdict and decides whether Texaco will have to post a bond to appeal the verdict. **********The Volume Leader Again **********Texaco stock closed at $31.50 yesterday, down 62.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, as 11.3 million shares changed hands. It had fallen as low as $30.375. Texaco was the Big Board's volume leader for the second consecutive day. **********The stock had slumped since Nov. 19, the day the Houston jury awarded the Pennzoil Company $10.53 billion in damages in its suit against Texaco over Texaco's acquisition of the Getty Oil Company last year. **********But the stock decline intensified after Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., Texaco's president, said in published remarks that the company could be forced into bankruptcy if it had to post a $12 billion bond to appeal the verdict. **********The purpose of the bond, which is not automatically required under Texas law, would be to let Texaco delay paying damages to Pennzoil until its appeals are exhausted, according to J. Patrick Hazel, a University of Texas law professor. **********Psychological Impact Noted **********Mr. Ilacqua, the analyst, said: ''There's no doubt that a judgment of this magnitude is having an unbelievable effect on the corporation. It's all psychological now because, other than legal costs, there's been no physical impact on operations. But for Texaco it's like sleeping with the sword of Damocles over you.'' **********Several analysts said institutional investors, worried by Texaco's raising the prospect of bankruptcy, were behind the heavy selling of Texaco shares. **********''The falloff is continuing because Texaco is faced with such tremendous risk in this case,'' said Philip L. Dodge, oil analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********''I don't think bankruptcy is a strong possibility,'' Mr. Dodge continued, ''but given the possibility of a dire outcome in the courts for Texaco, a fiduciary wouldn't want to put himself at risk. So they're getting out.'' **********Some Institutions Hang On **********However, officials of some large institutions with sizable blocks of Texaco stock said they were not selling. **********Alan J. Strassman, executive vice president of Battery March Financial Management Inc. in Boston, said his organization had not sold any of its 3.4 million Texaco shares since the jury's verdict was announced and did not intend to. **********''We don't like to sell stocks on bad news,'' Mr. Strassman said. ''That's not good policy generally because, typically, by the time the bad news becomes public, it's well reflected in the price of the stock.'' **********James S. Martin, executive vice president of the College Retirement Equities Fund, the nation's largest portfolio of equities, said it had not sold any of its 2.6 million Texaco shares since the verdict. **********Awaiting Outcome of Case **********''We're not sure that would be justified,'' he said. ''This case has a long way to go. At this point the investment is still justified. There's plenty of upside left in the stock if the case is resolved in a reasonable fashion.'' **********A spokesman for one major institution, who asked that it not be identified, said it was now buying Texaco stock because ''we think the market has overreacted and in fact created an opportunity for us to take a better position.'' **********The prospect of severe financial damage to Texaco prompted Moody's Investors Service to announce yesterday that it was reviewing about $3 billion of Texaco's commercial paper and $8.8 billion of its long-term debt. **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation also said yesterday that it was reviewing Texaco's senior and subordinated debt and commercial paper. **********Texaco officials declined to comment beyond their statements made earlier this week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/07/business/washington-watch-banking-bills-wilt-again.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1985-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 467, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch;   BANKING BILLS WILT AGAIN", "print_headline": "Washington Watch;   BANKING BILLS WILT AGAIN", "body_text": " **********BANKING legislation, the perennial hopeful that everyone agrees is needed, has, for all practical purposes, died for this session of Congress. **********The responsibility for its demise can be spread around, according to Congressional aides. **********Some, they say, belongs at the feet of the House Banking Committee's chairman, Fernand J.

On Tuesday, the State Department, caught by surprise by what appeared to be Mr. Weinberger's conditions for the meeting, said through Bernard Kalb, the department spokesman, that ''we think it is appropriate for the Soviet Union to apologize, but it is not a precondition for the talks already agreed to.'' **********Weinberger Wants Compensation **********Today, appearing on a television interview program, Mr. Weinberger said it was ''absolutely required'' that the Soviet Union compensate the family of Major Nicholson. **********''We think it's vital there be some form of compensation for Mrs. Nicholson,'' Mr. Weinberger said on the ABC program ''Good Morning America.'' **********''There's no way you can compensate a family like that in any material way,'' he said. ''But on the other hand, they have been deprived of parental and other support, and some kind of compensation for such a brutal act seems to me to be absolutely required.'' **********Mr. Weinberger has also contended that the killing was an act of Soviet policy and not an unplanned move by a ''trigger-happy guard,'' as suggested by Jeane K. Kirkpatrick, the former chief delegate to the United Nations. **********U.S. to Seek an Apology **********State Department officials said today that the purpose of the meeting of the two generals was to discuss ways of avoiding such incidents. The United States will seek an apology and compensation, one official said, but he complained that the Defense Secretary was not acting in coordination with the rest of the Administration. **********President Reagan, who has condemned the killing, has nevertheless said that it made it more necessary than ever for him to have a meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. **********State Department officials have sought to separate the killing from other aspects of relations with the Soviet Union. They said this policy had been followed so far, with none of the continuing negotiations having been affected. **********Soviet Paper Criticizes Army **********MOSCOW, April 3 (UPI) - The Soviet military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda sharply rebuked the leaders of a Soviet regiment in East Germany today for failure to properly train infantry units. It was the second such criticism in two days. **********There was no mention of the shooting of Major Nicholson, however, and no indication that the article represented anything more than a routine criticism after military maneuvers. **********The newspaper, commenting on the winter training exercises by Soviet troops in East Germany that just ended, said the regimental commander and his staff tolerated canceled actions, sloppy discipline and absenteeism. **********In one infantry company, the newspaper said, ''None of the servicemen showed industry. None of the trainees knew what the tactical situation was. It turned out that no specific tasks were set by the commanders of the company or by the commanders of the units who acted as platoon leaders.'' **********Editorial Finds 'Lack of Order' **********The article came after an editorial Tuesday that accused the troops based in East Germany of showing ''lack of order and no proper concern for the preparation of the training leaders.'' **********But the editorial praised Soviet fighting forces over all. **********Lieut. Col. S. Paksin, battalion commander of the companies that were criticized, reacted to the shortcomings in the training of the motorized infantry in a strange manner, the newspaper said. **********''Well, the training has still done some good,'' the newspaper said. ''It seems that the commander, and some of those who are under his command, accept the shortcomings in the training process.'' **********Ultimately, the newspaper said, blame falls on the regimental comander and his staff, whose tolerance ''unfortunately contributes to a great extent to all this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/world/bonner-addresses-synagogue-crowd.html": {"writer_name": "Fox Butterfield", "pub_date": "1985-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 635, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONNER ADDRESSES SYNAGOGUE CROWD", "print_headline": "BONNER ADDRESSES SYNAGOGUE CROWD", "body_text": " **********Yelena G. Bonner, the Soviet human rights activist, went to a synagogue here today and expressed her hope that Jews in the Soviet Union will be allowed to join their families abroad. **********Miss Bonner, whose mother is Jewish, said it was the first time that she had been to a synagogue. **********It was also the first time Miss Bonner, wife of the dissident and physicist Andrei D. Sakharov, had spokenly publicly since she arrived in the United States on Dec. 7. She has said through her son and daughter, Alexei Semyonov and Tatiana Yankelevich, who live in Newton, that she pledged to the Soviet authorities that she would not talk with reporters while she is in the West for medical treatment. **********It was not clear whether her remarks today violated that promise, which she has said is a condition of her being able to return to the Soviet Union and join her husband at his place of banishment in Gorky. **********Rabbi's Invitation **********Miss Bonner, 62 years old, came to the synagogue, Congregation Mishkan Tefila, this morning at the invitation of the rabbi, Richard Yellin. Rabbi Yellin said that the congregation, which he called the largest Conservative synagogue in New England, includes nearly two dozen families that have relatives who have not been allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union. **********Standing at the pulpit, Miss Bonner said in Russian, ''Even though I am not a believer, I think I have become a part of something very close to me.'' **********Her husband, she said, is considered by many Israelis to be a ''prisoner of Zion'' because of the help he has given Jews who are unable to leave the Soviet Union, though he himself was born into a family of Russian Orthodox Church members. **********''Today I hope all the prisoners of Zion will be free, as well as all my friends of different nations and different religions,'' Miss Bonner said. **********''My many personal friends, like Anatoly Shcharansky, I hope will be reunited with their relatives,'' she added. Mr. Semyonov translated her remarks. **********Miss Bonner, who repeatedly stressed that she does not consider herself a Jew, appeared to be moved when the cantor, Gregor Shelkan, recited a prayer in Russian. Mr. Shelkan was born in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which is now part of the Soviet Union, and survived a German concentration camp, Rabbi Yellin said. **********'Respect Toward All Beliefs' **********Miss Bonner, wearing a rose-colored wool knit dress and a white woolen shawl, spoke briefly with journalists outside the synagogue after the service. To explain why she had come, Miss Bonner said, ''My birth, I am half-Jewish and half-Armenian.'' **********''My upbringing gives me deep respect toward all beliefs, all religions,'' she said. ''The most deplorable teaching is the superiority of any nation over another.'' **********''Especially because there is anti-Semitism in the world, I find it impossible not to come to a synagogue,'' she said. **********Rabbi Yellin said after the service that ''Judaism is a nonproselytizing religion'' and that he had not intended to try to persuade Miss Bonner to be a more active Jew. ''But she wanted to be here, and to me, that is an affirmation of her Jewishness,'' Rabbi Yellin said. **********Rabbi Yellin gave Miss Bonner several gifts, including a Bible in Russian and Hebrew, a beginning grammar of Hebrew that is often used by Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union to Israel, and a set of small folding candlesticks. **********In an unusual move, Rabbi Yellin invited journalists to attend the service today, but said no Jewish reporters would be allowed because they would break the sabbath if they worked.

Gorbachev, a 54-year-old party official with a reputation for interest in modest internal economic changes. **********The Soviet decision to pursue arms talks in Geneva, with only a token ceremonial interruption, is seen by Government specialists as a deliberate Kremlin move to project both strength of leadership and continuity of policy despite the death of the third Soviet leader in 28 months. **********'The Image of Continuity' **********''Preserving the image of continuity at this point is at least as important as the fact of continuity,'' a State Department official said. ''They are embarrassed at the succession of infirm leaders they've had,'' another Government specialist said, ''and they don't want Chernenko's death to look as though it's hampering them.'' **********The speed with which Mr. Gorbachev was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party was taken as evidence by officials here that the ruling Politburo made the key decision to select him as the new leader in late February, if not before. **********Moreover, they see evidence that Mr. Gorbachev had been performing as the effective leader of both the party and the Soviet Defense Council in the final months of Konstantin U. Chernenko's life. Each of these developments adds to skepticism that policy changes of substance are in the wind. **********President Reagan decided not to attend Mr. Chernenko's funeral in Moscow on Wednesday because he felt a ceremonial meeting with Mr. Gorbachev would bring no productive results. But his assertion that he would ''very much'' like to meet Mr. Gorbachev sometime later was intended, an aide said, to signal that ''we'd like to get off on the right foot'' with the new leadership. **********The White House is encouraged that after several years of drift and transition, the Kremlin did not turn to yet another of the aging members in the Politburo as a transitional leader or select Grigory V. Romanov, the former Leningrad party chief, who is regarded as more of a hard-liner than Mr. Gorbachev. **********''Gorbachev is from the younger generation, maybe more interested in technological improvements in the Soviet economy,'' a White House official said. ''There's some underlying feeling here that he is more likely than Romanov would have been to put together over time a regime inclined to constructive relations with the U.S. And there's some hope he'll be more decisive. If they'd have picked another of the old guard leaders, that would have been a sign that they were still indecisive about moving ahead.'' **********Critical of U.S. Policies **********Nonetheless, White House officials cautioned that Mr. Gorbachev, in public statements at home and on trips to Britain and Canada, had been just as critical of the Administration's policies, most notably the research program on a space-based defense, and just as quick to bristle at Western criticism of Moscow's human rights record as his immediate predecessors. **********Some experts on the Soviet Union point out that it would be quite consistent with Soviet history for him to take a fairly hard line on foreign policy in the period he is consolidating his own power internally to reassure other Politburo and party leaders that he will effectively protect Soviet interests. **********Some academic specialists, such as Thane Gustafson of the Georgetown Center for Strategic and International Studies, say they regard Mr. Gorbachev as an advocate of more investment in the civilian sector of the Soviet economy and slowing the growth of military spending. **********But Government specialists dispute any implication that he would be less demanding or more flexible than other Soviet leaders in arms negotiations with the United States. ''I don't see any clue to his being softer,'' one Government official said. **********Change in Style Expected **********Nonetheless, given Mr. Gorbachev's reputation for modern-minded pragmatism on economic policy, his education in law at Moscow State University and the favorable publicity he got in Britain and Canada for civility, fashionable dress and a sense of humor on diplomatic missions, many American officials expect a change in style from the stodginess of Mr. Chernenko and the hard edge of Yuri V. Andropov. **********''This guy is skillful,'' an Administration official said. ''He is going to try to win the hearts and minds of Western public opinion. He's a terrific P.R. guy and certainly able to sell soft soap to the West. I think we're in for kind of a dangerous time with Gorbachev.'' **********After meeting with Mr. Gorbachev last year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said she felt the West could ''do business'' with him. On a recent visit to Washington, she shared her view of Mr. Gorbachev privately with President Reagan. **********Now, some Government specialists suggest that Mr. Gorbachev could be more flexible than his predecessors because so few of the established policies are identified with him by name. ''He doesn't have the same vested interest in policies that Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko did,'' one official said. A widespread expectation is that he will attempt some modest economic revisions fairly soon. **********Consolidation of Power **********But specialists caution that before he can put his own imprint on on policy, he must consolidate his personal power. For unlike an American President, he does not have the automatic power to replace the top echelons of the Government and party apparatus. He must share power with those who elected him, including the old-guard leaders in their 70's and rivals like Mr. Romanov. **********In the final three months of the life of his former mentor, Mr. Andropov, Mr. Gorbachev was the point man in ousting as many as 50 senior Communist Party and Government officials and replacing them with younger men. Some specialists suggest he may move soon to expand the membership of the Politburo from 10 to its normal size of 15 by promoting some of his allies and making other changes. **********But he faces a delicate task in making important personnel changes without alarming the four old-guard leaders in the Politburo and their allies elsewhere. Only a minority of specialists believe he can afford to seize the reins of authority fairly quickly. The prevailing view is that the older generation will keep some checks on him and that will slow policy shifts. **********''The most likely thing is change at a controlled pace,'' a Government specialist said. ''It's unlikely we'll see radical changes of policy in the short run. As for later on, we'll just have to wait and see.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/business/people-express-adding-5-cities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People Express Adding 5 Cities", "print_headline": "People Express Adding 5 Cities", "body_text": " **********People Express Airlines Inc., the discount-fare carrier, said that it would begin service from its Newark base to Albany, Atlanta, Dallas, Montreal and Providence, R.I., marking the airline's largest expansion in three years. **********A spokesman said the airline would offer three round-trip flights daily to each city. **********Service from Newark to Montreal, at a $29 one-way fare, will begin Saturday.

But we're going to have to highlight that rates will be reduced and corporate America will start paying their fair share of taxes.'' **********President Reagan proposed ending the investment credit, but he offered depreciation schedules that would be somewhat more favorable to business than those approved by the committee. This is one of the few instances when the legislators have taken steps to make the tax law less generous to taxpayers than the President's plan. **********The committee, however, rejected Mr. Reagan's proposal to require taxpayers who took advantage of the rapid depreciation rules of the 1981 law to repay part of their benefits over the next three years. **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and other Administration officials who attended the committee's meeting, which lasted late into the night, were not available to comment on the panel's actions. But Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who led a small working group that wrote the investment credit and depreciation provisions, said the Administration had approved them. **********The committee approved a proposal to reduce to 20 percent, from 25 percent, the tax credit that businesses can claim for research and development expenses. The President proposed extending the full 25 percent credit. **********The committee also voted to continue to allow taxpayers to deduct all their interest payments on mortgages on second homes and to maintain many other tax advantages enjoyed by real estate investors. Those proposals and others recommended Monday by the six-member bipartisan working group were approved without change. **********Expansion of the investment tax credit and accelerated write-offs of investment expenses were cornerstones of the Reagan Administration economic policy enacted in 1981. But most economists, including those in the Administration, agree that the incentives proved to be too favorable in some areas and led to a bias in favor of certain kinds of investments over others. **********A Difficult Issue **********The economists differ significantly on how much those incentives should be curtailed, and the issue has proved to be one of the most difficult for the committee to resolve. **********Scores of lobbyists hovered in the House corridors today, buttonholing lawmakers and staff members to argue that without generous incentives American industry would suffer and the nation's trade deficit would worsen. **********Real estate investments would be hardest hit by the lengthened depreciation schedules. Buildings that can now be written off over 19 years would have to be depreciated over 30 years. In some instances, that would offset steps taken by the panel to continue to allow many elements of real estate tax shelters. **********Automobiles and Computers **********Automobiles used in business, which can now be depreciated over three years, would have to be written off in five years under the proposals. Five-year write-offs of computer equipment would be continued. **********According to a calculation by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the panel's decisions would raise the ultimate cost of equipment by 3 to 20 percent. For instance, the cost of oil-pumping equipment would increase 18 percent. **********Figured another way, the National Machine Tool Builders' Association said the write-off of a $100,000 machine tool would be about $17,000 less than under current law in the first five years after it is purchased. **********Depreciation deductions are intended to account for the fact that businesses purchase in one year machinery and other equipment that they use for many years. Eventually, however, the equipment wears out and must be replaced. Rather than allow the entire deduction to be taken in the year when the money is spent, on the one hand, or to leave businesses without resources to replace equipment, on the other, the deductions must be spread over a period of time, depending on the expected life of the equipment. **********Businesses want to take the write-offs as quickly as possible. If, for example, they can deduct the cost of a piece of machinery over five years and it is used for eight years, they have extra money to spend for three years while the machine is still in use. **********One reason depreciation rules are so difficult for legislators to deal with is that schedules must be set for hundreds of different items. The panel decided, for instance, to allow shops that rent tuxedos to write them off in three years (now it is seven years) and to let race horses be depreciated over five years. **********The investment tax credit was first enacted as an incentive for capital expenditures in the Kennedy Administration, was disallowed and then reinstated twice, and finally expanded in 1981 so that companies could reduce their taxes each year by 10 percent of the amount they spent on equipment. **********The Reagan Administration argued, and the legislators apparently agreed, that the write-off had been too generous and formed the basis of many tax shelters of questionable economic value. Repeal of the credit would raise nearly $50 billion a year by 1990. **********Two elements of the panel's decisions would soften the blow to business somewhat. **********First, in many instances companies could take larger write-offs in the earlier years an investment was being depreciated than in the later years. **********Second, the panel agreed that the depreciation allowances on items placed in service in 1987 and afterward would be partly adjusted for inflation if the annual inflation rate exceeded 5 percent. **********The President proposed full indexation to inflation, which was one reason his proposal was considered by business to be more favorable than the committee's. **********The decision to reject the President's proposal to recapture past savings by companies that took advantage of the 1981 rapid depreciation rules was expected. The Administration added this provision at the very end of its drafting process last spring as a means of raising additional revenue, but even Administration officials acknowledged privately that the idea was not likely to be enacted. **********The proposal would have raised more than $50 billion over the next three years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/28/business/at-t-seeks-rate-changes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

The success of their recommendations depends, to a critical degree, upon a prolonged economic recovery and a favorable cycle for producers of capital goods. Lower interest rates and a weaker dollar would also help. **********Inco Ltd., the Canadian company that ranks as the largest factor in the nickel industry, is one example of a metals issue attracting some favorable attention after a long period in the doldrums.

''The supply-demand picture for nickel has improved substantially and Inco has made dramatic strides in reducing its costs. **********''After reporting a loss for 13 consecutive quarters, the company should show just about break- even results for the final three months of 1984, to be followed by a profit in the first quarter of 1985.'' **********Mr. Morrison estimates that earnings for all of 1985 could reach $2 a share. **********Although he is somewhat less optimistic on the profit outlook for this year, William G.

Looking ahead, however, he is optimistic on developments on both fronts. **********Finally, it is Mr. Morrison's view that ''the dumping of metals'' by lesser-developed countries - a key factor in causing a weakened price structure during 1984 - should be alleviated within the first half of this year. Among the copper stocks, he rates Asarco Inc. and the Phelps Dodge Corporation as ''weak holds.'' But the Newmont Mining Corporation is accorded a ''buy/hold'' opinion. **********Mr. Anker of First Boston said that he saw Asarco and Phelps Dodge as attractive speculations, while Newmont, which has the best record in the industry, ''merits attention.'' In yesterday's trading, Newmont rose 1/2, to 36 3/8. Asarco ended at 17 7/8, down 3/4, while Phelps Dodge eased 1/4, to 13 5/8. **********Amax Inc., the world's leading producer of molybdenum, is considered by Mr. Anker to be ''the least attractive of the major mining companies.'' **********In a detailed study of Amax, Daniel A. Roling, a metals analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that some improvement in the company's operating earnings this year ''would only return Amax to a marginal level of profitability.'' Accordingly, he places an ''O.K. to sell'' opinion on the stock for both the intermediate and long term. **********Mr. Morrison of Dean Witter has a ''hold/sell'' rating on Amax, a stock that traded as high as 69 in 1981. But Wall Street analysts expect the company to show a loss in 1984 for the third consecutive year.

Security analysts have steadily been cutting their estimates of corporate earnings for 1985. **********''All year long, in the entire universe of publicly held companies, there has averaged close to three reduced estimates for every increase,'' Stanley Levine said. At the firm of Lynch, Jones & Ryan, he heads the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which monitors earnings forecasts from 115 brokerage houses on 3,300 stocks. **********''From mid-April through mid-May, the rate was 2.4 cuts for each raised estimate,'' Mr. Levine said. ''Since then, the rate has been running three cuts to every increase - a pace similar to that which we saw at the start of 1985.'' **********Actually, reduced estimates have outpaced increased estimates since the start of 1980. This trend would seem to indicate that analysts on Wall Street and across the country had been consistently too optimistic over profit prospects. **********However, Howard J. Abner, chairman of the brokerage firm of Abner Herrman & Brock Inc., said the chief problem lies elsewhere. ''The great majority of security analysts now derive the basis for their earnings estimates from company managements,'' he said. ''But managements, in turn, have had difficulty in accurately projecting the earnings progress of their own companies. This is because the domestic economy has become more volatile in nature and business on a worldwide scope has become increasingly complex.'' **********What companies have to say about their own profit prospects often comes as a surprise to analysts. It happened this week when the BankAmerica Corporation disclosed that its operating results for the quarter ending June 30 would be ''near the break-even point.'' Security analysts had been forecasting a quarterly profit of $100 million or more, and some said that until recently the giant West Coast bank had encouraged such projections. **********In response to BankAmerica's disclosure, its stock fell 1 7/8 points Tuesday, to 19 7/8, as the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. **********A milder surprise confronted followers of Wang Laboratories Wednesday when the company said it would report a loss -the first in its 34-year history - for the current quarter. On the American Stock Exchange, the stock fell 1 1/8, to 15 1/2, after trading at a new low since 1982. Analysts began chopping earnings estimates for various technology companies. **********If security analysts continue to trim many of their earnings estimates - a factor that conceivably would hurt investor psychology - why is the stock market over all at record highs? **********The recent drop in interest rates, currently at their lowest levels in about five years, is apparently the exogenous factor operating here, according to Mr. Levine of Lynch, Jones & Ryan. ''At the bottom of the bear market for stocks in August 1982, we were seeing four cuts in earnings estimates for every increase,'' he said. ''But the sharp drop in interest rates at that time provided the impetus for the ensuing bull market. People seem to remember that episode.'' **********At the present time, his work shows that the market's worst sector in terms of downward revisions in earnings estimates is the broad group of basic industries. From mid-April to mid-May, for example, the average estimate for aluminum company profits was cut by a whopping 39 percent. Price weakness and the strong dollar were factors. **********During this same period, estimates were also cut in the technology sector. Earnings projections for semiconductor companies, which have been hit hard by the recent economic slowdown, were pared by 16 percent on average. ''One stock, Texas Instruments, sustained a 60 percent decline in earnings estimates for 1985,'' Mr. Levine said. This followed a surprisingly poor earnings report by Texas Instruments for the first quarter. **********On the brighter side, earnings estimates were raised recently by analysts for several companies in the health care and financial services industries. The latest tally, for example, showed estimates for Johnson & Johnson up 3.3 percent. Its stock, incidentally, has performed well this year. Estimates for insurance companies and money-center banks in New York City were also raised. **********Sometimes managements try to soften the blow of forthcoming earnings reports deemed to be disappointing by providing an advance warning. But this technique, especially in a stock with a big institutional ownership, does not always work. On Feb. 12, when the Data General Corporation forecast earnings substantially below Wall Street's expectations, the stock tumbled 14 1/8 points, to 58 3/4, on a volume of nearly 3.8 million shares. **********At Merrill Lynch, which employs the largest analyst force in the brokerage industry, earnings estimates were recently raised for companies ranging from Federated Department Stores, The Limited Inc. and Precision Castparts to Southwest Forest Industries and U.S. Shoe, among others. **********Estimates were lowered for a much longer list, including such companies as Apple Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, R.H.

Smith of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. **********Purchased Dr Pepper **********Forstmann is a private New York investment firm whose last deal was the purchase a year ago of the Dr Pepper Company for about half the price for McGraw-Edison. In a leveraged buyout, most of the money is borrowed and the lenders are paid back from future earnings of the company. Theodore J. Forstmann, a partner in Forstmann Little, said yesterday that the firm would invest about $300 million of its capital in the transaction and the rest would be borrowed from banks. **********Some leveraged buyout plans have fallen through recently because bank money could not be obtained, among them a $1.1 billion plan to take Northwest Industries private. **********Mr. Forstmann said he was confident of obtaining financing. ''You need capital to do these things,'' he said. ''It's pretty hard to start off with basically nothing. We start off with over $500 million in capital.'' **********Participation by Executives **********McGraw-Edison, which employs some 20,000 people in the United States, would continue to be managed by its current senior executives, who would have an equity participation. Edward J. Williams is McGraw-Edison's chairman and chief executive. **********The company, based in Rolling Meadows, Ill., has an illustrious history in the Chicago area. It was formed in 1957 through a merger of companies founded by Thomas Edison and Max McGraw. **********Mr. McGraw was an entrepreneur ''who brought the toaster to the American table,'' a company spokesman said. The company for many years made toasters and other electrical appliances under several brand names. At the end of the 1970's it got out of the consumer business and bought Studebaker-Worthington Inc. to obtain a stronger industrial base. Now the company owns more than 100 plants and makes such diverse products as electical motors, brake systems, automobile lights and lighting fixtures. **********Last year, McGraw-Edison reported sales of $1.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion the year before. **********In a restructuring to slim down the company and generate cash to invest in its more profitable areas, much of the old Studebaker-Worthington was sold last year to Dresser Industries. **********Included in the sale were Turbodyne, of Wellsville, N.Y., a maker of steam turbines; Worthington, of Basking Ridge, N.J., a maker of compressors and pumps, and Masoneilan, of Houston, a producer of valves for the petroleum industry. **********Fourth-Quarter Charge **********The sale of these units - what the company calls its process equipment segment - forced it to take a fourth- quarter charge against earnings of $57.5 million for a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. **********This caused a loss for the final quarter of $31.8 million, compared with earnings of $10.6 million in the 1983 quarter. Earnings for 1984 fell to $10.8 million, or 65 cents a share, versus $33 million, or $2.02 a share, in 1983. That year's earnings included a loss of $9.8 million from discontinued operations. **********McGraw-Edison's management has come under criticism by some analysts. The fourth-quarter charge, for example, was attributed by them to a long learning curve in the overseas businesses that proved expensive for shareholders. Others said management had been slow to shed marginal areas and redeploy the assets into stronger parts of the company. ''The weakest part has been the process equipment sector,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''Power systems, which includes the transformer business, may be one of the other areas not performing up to snuff, but it is not as hard-pressed.'' **********'A Kind of Game Plan' **********Mr. Forstmann said current management would stay in place. ''We don't manage businesses,'' he added, ''but we have a kind of game plan and we talk the whole thing through with management.'' McGraw-Edison, he said, has a core group ''of very stable businesses with very strong market positions.'' **********Leveraged buyout candidates, he said, have good operating management, predictability of earnings and cash flow in order to service debt and a stock selling at a reasonable price. **********Solid industrial businesses such as McGraw-Edison are thus attractive to Forstmann Little. ''Stability is not glamorous - but it is to us,'' Mr. Forstmann said. **********The transaction is subject to a definitive merger accord and completion of the bank financing arrangements. The $1.3 billion value is based on McGraw-Edison's shares and debt to be assumed or refinanced. As of March 15, about 16.5 million shares of McGraw-Edison common were outstanding and 411,000 were issuable on the exercise of employee stock options. **********If all goes well, Forstmann Little will now have seven or eight companies in its stable. ''I can't remember them all,'' Mr. Forstmann said. But he added that all the companies, including Dr Pepper, were ''exceeding expectations - we don't do these things just to fiddle about.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/business/honduras-debt-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Honduras Debt Talks", "print_headline": "Honduras Debt Talks", "body_text": " **********The Government has decided, it said today, to suspend talks with 40 private American banks until a new administration takes office next year.

Offshore production is costly and complicated, and critics of the Government have questioned Petroperu's offshore ability. **********Mr. Garcia, who took office July 28 proclaiming a nationalistic, anti-imperialist foreign policy, said he saw no reason for reprisals by the United States over his decision to nationalize the operations of Belco, which has been in the country since 1959. **********''This is not a measure against foreign capital. Neither is it an anti-American position,'' he said. **********Retaliation Feared **********But a high Government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Garcia was concerned that the Hickenlooper Amendment might be invoked against Peru. That American law requires retaliation against any nation that seizes United States property and does not make ''prompt and adequate compensation.'' **********The official said that was why Mr. Garcia had gone to great lengths to explain in his news conference on Friday that independent evaluators would set a price on Belco's assets and the Government would make any payments necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/11/business/ticor-replaces-most-of-its-board.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ticor Replaces Most of Its Board", "print_headline": "Ticor Replaces Most of Its Board", "body_text": " **********Ticor, the nation's third-largest home loan insurer, which stands to lose as much as $166 million on delinquent home loans underwritten for the Equity Programs Investment Corporation, said it has replaced most of the 15-member board for the Ticor Mortgage Insurance Company, a subsidiary. **********Winston V.

It was jointly developed in-house and by Campbell- Mithune Inc. of Chicago. **********Over all, Schwinn, which is privately held, is increasing its advertising budget for this year by about 70 percent. Company officials declined to provide specific figures. **********Mr. Schwinn said that the company's brand-name recognition was still high; he mentioned a company survey of several years ago that found an identification rate of more than 80 percent. So, he said, one purpose of the campaign is merely to ''maintain our exposure.'' He added, ''We've got a fine product line and we want to let people know that.'' **********The new product line - the bikes will sell for about $145 to $300 - also marks the company's new aggressiveness in seeking to raise its 10 to 15 percent share of the market by boasting that its products can compete for technology-conscious as well as price-conscious customers. **********Industry observers said Schwinn had suffered from a perception that its bicycles were technically inferior to other American-produced bicycles and, even more, to imported bicycles. **********Mr. Schwinn said that some consumers were attracted by the lure of foreign-sounding brand names but added: ''That works two ways. People buy Schwinn because it's a recognizable name that represents high quality.'' **********Mr. Schwinn said that besides the company-sponsored advertisements, independent dealers who stock Schwinn products would be setting up coordinate campaigns. The advertisements will begin in late April. **********Industry figures said that bicycle industry as a whole had begun to recover from its prolonged slump of the early 1980's, a slump largely resulting from the public's fascination with video games. Bicycle sales plummeted from the nine-million levels of the late 1970's. **********Last year, however, about 10.2 million bicycles were sold, according to the Bicycle Manufacturers Association of America. **********For Schwinn and other companies, the worrisome part of that good news is that competition is sharper. The number of bicycle companies in the American market has increased tremendously since 1980, although exact figures are not available, **********Further, the share of the market gained by imports has risen substantially. In 1983 imported bicycles accounted for 2.6 million, or 29 percent, of the 8.9 million bicycles sold. Last year they were 4.3 million, or 42 percent, of the bicycles sold. **********However, Mr. Schwinn, who said that Schwinn itself both manufactures and imports bicycles, did not distinguish between domestic or foreign manufacturers. ''Our competition,'' he remarked, ''is anybody who sells a bicycle.'' **********And he said the company was in a good position for the challenge.

One of them goes like this: In the early 1960's the man was on the run from the police, and Mr. Qoboza, a young black reporter, was following the story. **********''He would disappear and then turn up, somewhere, at a public telephone, and call in with a statement. Of course the police would trace the call, but by that time, he was long gone. We had our own pimpernel.'' **********Mr. Qoboza is now a prominent newspaper editor. The man he was talking about is Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, whose days as the pimpernel ran out in August 1962, when he was arrested for sabotage because of his role in the militant wing of the congress. He has been in prison ever since and has become, through incarceration and steadfast defiance from within the prison walls, South Africa's leading black hero, the man, according to a recent newspaper survey, whom 90 percent of the nation's black people want unconditionally freed. **********'Symbolizes Black Determination' **********''I think,'' Mr. Qoboza said in an interview today, ''that he symbolizes black determination to be free.'' **********The symbolism, from a black nationalist point of view, is evident. Pollsmoor prison, outside Cape Town, where Mr. Mandela is held, represents the system against which he rebels. His rebellion, from within, is the ambiguous emblem of defiance in a society where the rulers seem to call the shots. **********The enigma, however, seems to be that, invisible and unheard, removed by white authority from black political activism, Mr. Mandela has captured the spirit and devotion not only of those who knew him at the time of his incarceration, but also of those who have, in the last year of upheaval, assumed the custodianship of black resistance - the teen-agers who were not yet born when he was jailed. **********If Mr. Mandela, 67 years old, was released tomorrow, said Michael Morake, 18, in an interview in Soweto, Johannesburg's sprawling black satellite, ''I will probably pass him by because I would not recognize him.'' **********''But it is his ideas and commitment to the struggle that make even us youths regard him as our leader,'' he said. **********'Revolution Will Set Him Free' **********''Anyhow,'' he added, ''I do not worry about not knowing what Mandela looks like right now, because the day has come closer where I will see him with my own eyes.'' **********''If the system does not free him,'' he said, ''the people's revolution will set him free. And that day is not far away.'' **********Mr. Mandela is seen as an inspiration whose physical presence means less than his message and example. **********''He is the symbol of our struggle,'' said Mzwakhe Kubheka, 19, a high school student. ''To me he is like Jesus Christ.'' **********''How many people would rather stay in jail than be free at the cost of their integrity,'' he said. **********''For the struggle to go on,'' he said, ''we do not need Mandela to be around. We, the youths, will do the job the way our leader would have wanted. And he knows that we are carrying on from where he left off 23 years ago.'' **********Mr. Mandela was jailed and was supposed to become, thus, a nonperson, banished, initially to the harshness of Robben Island, off Cape Town. But the myth was stronger than the prison walls and it grew across the generations. **********Son of Tembu Chief **********There were other heroes, but many have been detained or otherwise neutralized. Mr. Mandela filled the emptiness at the heart of black yearning for leadership. Who, then, is he?  Mr. Mandela was born in 1918, the eldest son of a chief of the Tembu people, inheriting a mantle of royal self-confidence that defied white relegation of blacks to second-class status. He studied law at South Africa's Fort Hare University, an academy whose alumni include Robert Mugabe, now Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. **********As in Mr. Mugabe's case, the university seems to have honed political views. Mr. Mandela is said to have been expelled from it for organizing a student strike. **********In Johannesburg, he and Oliver Tambo, now the exiled leader of the African National Congress, formed a law practice. In 1944 Mr. Mandela joined the congress, then far less demanding of white concessions than it is today, and played a leading role in its nonviolent campaigns against apartheid in the 1950's. **********Those actions caused him to be detained, along with 155 others, in 1957, in a four-year treason trial that ended, in 1961, with all the defendants being acquitted. That was the start of the pimpernel whose credentials were strengthened, Mr. Qoboza said, by the fact that Mr. Mandela never chose self-exile to secure comfortable dissent. **********Killings at Sharpeville **********It was at this time, too, that a great change came over black resistance in South Africa. On March 21, 1960, the police shot dead 69 black protesters in Sharpeville, a black township south of Johannesburg, and, in the wake of the massacre, leaders such as Mr. Mandela decided to turn to violence. **********Mr. Mandela was a central figure in the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe -the Spear of the Nation - the military wing of the African National Congress, and he became its first commander. On one of his trips outside South Africa, he was said to have visited Algeria, to organize training bases, and to have undergone training. The name of Umkhonto we Sizwe is feted, still, in the songs that young blacks sing at the gravesides of slain township activists. **********In August 1962 the authorities caught up with Mr. Mandela and, after the leadership of Umkhonto we Sizwe was rounded up, put him on trial for sabotage. His final address to the court that jailed him for life is burned into the soul of black resistance. **********''There comes a time, as it came in my life,'' he said, ''when a man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life of an outlaw because the Government has so decreed to use the law to impose a state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret having taken the decisions that I did take.'' **********'The Choice Is Not Ours' **********Earlier, when Mr. Mandela launched violent resistance to white rule, a pamphlet was circulated by his organization saying: ''The choice is not ours. It has been made by the nationalist Government which has rejected every peacable demand by the people for rights and freedom.'' **********At his trial, Mr. Mandela talked of ''the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.'' **********''It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve,'' he said. ''But if need be, an ideal for which I am prepared to die.'' **********Mr. Mandela is visited regularly only by his immediate family. This year, however, the authorities have permitted some outsiders to see him. **********He is, said Lord Bethell, a British peer and member of the European Parliament, who saw Mr. Mandela in January, ''a six-foot-tall, lean figure with silvering hair, an impeccable olive-green shirt and well-creased navy blue trousers.'' **********''I am in good health,'' Mr. Mandela said at the time. ''It is not true that I have cancer. It is not true that I have had a toe amputated. I get up at 3:30 A.M. every morning, do two hours of physical exercise, work up a good sweat. Then I read and study during the day.'' **********A Mean Left Hook **********The reference to exercise does not surprise Mr. Qoboza. If Mr. Mandela had not become a politician, he said, he would have become a great athlete. ''When the world had not discovered jogging, he had,'' Mr. Qoboza said. ''As an amatuer boxer, he packed one of the meanest left hooks in the business.'' **********Samuel Dash, chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee and now a professor of law at Georgetown University, saw Mr. Mandela earlier this year and wrote, in The New York Times Magazine, that ''he is a tall, slim, handsome man'' who appears ''vigorous and healthy, with a calm, confident manner and dignified bearing that seemed incongruous in our prison surroundings.'' **********''Indeed, throughout our meeting, I felt that I was in the presence not of a guerrilla fighter or racial ideologue, but of a head of state,'' Mr. Dash wrote. **********Mr. Mandela, he said, lived in a cell measuring 25 by 40 feet, with access to the roof the building. **********President P. W. Botha has sought to depict the African National Congress, and Mr. Mandela, as Communists. The Congress has long entertained an alliance with the South African Communist Party, but Mr. Tambo, its exiled leader, has denied that it is steered by Moscow. **********'I Am a Socialist' **********In his interview with Lord Bethell, Mr. Mandela was quoted as saying: ''Personally, I am a Socialist and I believe in a classless society. But I see no reason to belong to any political party at the moment.'' **********Mr. Mandela confronts the authorities with a dilemma, one they have sought to resolve for almost a year in a kind of negotiation conducted through newspapers and public statements. **********If he were to accept the authorities' terms for his release - that he renounce violence - then he would be discredited and thus neutralized. But, if he stays in prison, the authorities seem to acknowledge, his aura will grow, as will his stature as a rallying point for black resistance. **********Last December, he was offered freedom if he went to live in the so-called homeland called the Transkei. He rejected the offer. **********The offer was not publicized, but, in January, after Lord Bethell saw Mr. Mandela, the authorities publicly offered to release him if he gave them an undertaking that he would renounce violence as a means of achieving political goals. That offer, too, was spurned. **********His reply, in the strange dialogue between captor and captive, was transmitted by his daughter at a rally in Soweto. ''My father says I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I, and you the people, are not free,'' she said. ''Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.'' **********Wife Is Under Restrictions **********Mr. Mandela's messages are often transmitted by family members who see him in prison. His wife, Winnie, is a ''banned'' person in South Africa, banished to a remote corner of the Orange Free State, forbidden from being quoted in the South African press. **********Their relationship is seen by many blacks as a symbol of resistance since both, in their different ways, are damaged by white authority, but both refuse to be cowed. **********From the authorities' viewpoint, Mr. Mandela's incarceration presents special problems. While visitors say he is in vigorous health, his death in prison would cause a massive black outcry. To release him might, officials said, strip him of some glamour. But to release him without conditions might be seen by whites as a sign of weakness, and, moreover, might result in the unleashing of unpredictable forces. **********In the latest statement that he has transmitted through Mrs. Mandela, Mr. Mandela has said the only thing left to the Afrikaner white elite is to discuss a handing over of power to the black majority. But he seems to have left open the door to negotiation. **********''If the Government abandons apartheid,'' Mrs. Mandela said after visiting her husband, ''lifts the ban on the A.N.C., releases all political prisoners, and allows the exiles to return, then Nelson and other A.N.C. leaders would be prepared to sit down and talk.'' **********What inspires the myth of Mr. Mandela seems to be his refusal to compromise. **********''All his life has been dedicated to the struggle,'' Mr. Qoboza said, ''and I bet that the first thing he would do if he was released would be to organize a rally in Soweto and re-dedicate himself to the struggle.'' **********In his interview with Lord Bethell, Mr. Mandela said much the same thing: ''If I was released, I would never obey any restriction. If they confined me, for instance, to the Cape area, I would break the order and walk to my home in Soweto to be with my wife and daughter.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/23/world/laos-remains-of-gi-s-called-hard-to-identify.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1985-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAOS REMAINS OF G.I.'S CALLED HARD TO IDENTIFY", "print_headline": "LAOS REMAINS OF G.I.'S CALLED HARD TO IDENTIFY", "body_text": " **********American military officers indicated today that it would take at least a month to begin identifying remains found at a site in Laos where an American gunship crashed during the Vietnam War. **********At the same time, they praised Laos for its ''extreme cooperation'' in assisting in the search. **********The Laotian-American excavation took place last week at a site near Pakse, in eastern Laos, where an American C-130 went down in December 1972 with 16 servicemen aboard.

Now they have convened here again, sobered by last year's largely disappointing sales and profits, and searching for ways to solve the problems that complicated 1984. **********These problems, retailers said at the National Retail Merchants Association convention, include what now appears to be a permanent demand for discounted merchandise, ever-growing competition from the big chains, inventories that appear difficult to keep in line with sales trends, too much of the same merchandise in everyone's stores and ever-increasing expenses. **********In interviews this week at the convention at the New York Hilton Hotel, merchants reported a variety of approaches aimed at combating these and other problems. Such strategies include a shift to more exclusive goods or items not generally available; purchase of more off-price merchandise; use of outside services to help control inventories and expenses; efforts to improve sales force performance, and ways to stimulate motivation among younger employees. **********''The difference between this year and last year is that we can only gain market share by adhering as closely as possible to our strategy rather than wavering over short-term developments,'' said Herbert Glaser, president of the stores division of Elder-Beerman Stores of Dayton, Ohio. **********''In our 22 stores, we will find more business by investing more in men's furnishings and women's accessories, which aren't big ticket but should be impervious to any economic ebbs and flows,'' he said. **********Budget Basements Stressed **********Also, in contrast to other department stores that have given up their low-priced budget basements, Mr. Glaser said, ''We feel we've got to hold on to our basement budget stores, hold that base and also pick the spots where we can gain business.'' **********Stephen A. Blake, vice president of Webster Clothes, a Baltimore men's clothing chain, said, ''We see a fairly good year, a slower spring but a strong fall, which will make it all up.'' Webster operates 70 regular-price and six off-price stores. Off-price retailing concentrates in lower-priced national-brand apparel. **********''Three years ago, we would have put our money 50-50 into our regular- price and our off-price stores,'' Mr. Blake said. ''But the specialty stores are strengthening themselves, although off-price had a good ride the last two to three years. Now we are putting more dollars into our regular- price stores.'' **********Others at the convention expressed concern about the increasing use of off-price merchandising. **********Joseph Glik, chief executive officer of Glik's, a 15-store apparel chain based in Granite City, Ill., said: ''The Wal-Marts and the K Marts of the world are coming to our area and we cannot compete with them on the items they promote. So we are dropping those goods and substituting more fashionable items.'' **********For example, Mr. Glik said he would drop a national-brand lingerie product and similar goods on which the discounters were slashing prices. **********Effort to Control Costs **********He added that Glik's was trying to ''keep the lid on our costs, and we've hired a computer time-sharing company to help us. It's expensive but the value is there if you can afford it.'' **********Some merchants did not find much encouragement from a research study discussed at the convention. The Management Sciences Institute, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, said Monday that a study it will soon publish found that retail sales will have ''unexciting growth'' in the rest of the 1980's, with apparel in particular showing virtually little rise. Demographic changes, population shifts and fewer teen-agers were cited as reasons. **********But a session yesterday presented another study, by the Associated Merchandising Corporation, a leading merchandising and research organization. It reported that ''major opportunities exist in private labels.'' These are brands that stores adopt rather than national brands. **********Isaac Lagnado, research director of Associated Merchandising, said, ''Of upscale career women, 56 percent believe store labels are as good as national brands while only 28 percent say they are concerned about country of origin.'' **********The implication, some merchants said, was that store profits could benefit from a high demand for private brands, which typically carry higher markups than national brands. **********But Mr. Lagnado added that recognition by consumers of national labels ''is also very high,'' ranging from 41 percent to 71 percent, depending upon the merchandise category. **********'Only a Modest Gain' **********Aaron Selber, president of the seven-store Selber Brothers' department stores in Shreveport, La., called the new year ''a tough one for retailing, with prospects of only a modest gain.'' **********He said that the oil and gas drilling industry in Shreveport was operating with shorter contracts now ''due to the expected volatility of oil prices.'' In addition, the competition from new shopping centers and possible rising interest rates caused him to be concerned about 1985. **********''But we are controlling our expenses so that they should grow at a lower rate than sales,'' Mr. Selber said. He added that Selber's recently changed its retirement plan to an employees' stock purchase plan. ''Our staff is getting much younger,'' he said, ''and we can reward them with something that they can touch and feel.'' **********Charles Chappell 2d, store manager of Chappell's, with seven stores in Syracuse, said: ''January started off a little flatly. But we will go about it as we did in 1984. We will find the items to exploit, such as men's and women's clothing lines not available so far in Syracuse.'' **********Foreseeing a ''slightly better year than 1984,'' David Castleton, head of Castleton's seven apparel stores in Salt Lake City, said: ''We plan to be more conservative on our inventories this year, adopting a rifle rather than a shotgun approach to what we buy.

Each year, wealthy and middle-class Cairenes flock to escape Cairo's burning desert heat for the cooler, humid breezes of the Mediterranean. **********Alexandria's population ordinarily grows in the summer to about five million people from three million, especially on Fridays and Saturdays -Egypt's weekend. **********By midday, it seems that every speck of sand is shielded by contiguous beach umbrellas stretching across the horizon. The 45-mile-long Corniche, the broad boulevard that traces the sea coast, is jammed with cars, motorcycles, donkey-drawn carts, and beach-bound pedestrians. Hundreds of thousands of children frolic in the surf. **********''It's so crowded out there you need reservations to go into the ocean,'' said Akram, a young Alexandrian beachcomber. **********Crowds Are Sparse **********But not so this year. The Corniche is navigable even during the 2 P.M. rush hour, when Alexandrians leave their offices for lunch and nap. Hotels are offering weekend packages to lure customers away from Cyprus, the favorite summer haunt this year. Reservations are no longer required even at the most popular restaurants. The beaches, by Alexandria standards, are deserted. **********While reliable figures are hard to come by, travel agents here estimate that the summer tourist influx has plunged from a usual peak of two million to about 500,000. **********The main culprit in the decline is sewage. Alexandria is one of the few Mediterranean cities that still pumps raw sewage into the sea close to its shores. The effects of this practice have been painfully evident this year, even to the most devoted fans of the city sometimes called Alex. Indeed, Alexandrians have talked of little else this summer. **********''All of a sudden, Alexandria's sewage problem has become a national problem,'' said Ahmed Baha el-Din, a columnist for the semiofficial daily Al-Ahram. ''The sewage that now covers Montazah, Aida and the other aristocratic beaches has been there for months,'' he said. ''So why all this sudden fuss?'' **********''Because Cairenes, the first-class Egyptians, traveled to Alex for their summer vacations!'' he went on. ''That's why.'' ''More to the point,'' he continued, ''Government officials with Big Mouths and Loud Voices traveled to Alex and 'discovered' the problem.'' **********Role in Cabinet Shake-Up **********In fact, the sewage scandal was widely cited as a major cause of the recent Cabinet shuffle. Commentators here said the problem had highlighted the Government's indecisiveness and inability to solve urgent problems. **********The protests by the rich were particularly vocal this summer. In late August, prominent members of the Alexandria Yacht Club complained to the local officials of ''the presence of sewage on their private beach,'' reported Al Shaab, an opposition newspaper, several of whose editors and senior reporters also own or rent apartments here, as does Mr. Baha el-Din. **********''If this situation continues,'' a prominent physician complained, ''Alexandria could experience not only serious economic problems, but health hazards as well.'' **********Al-Shaab reported, and several doctors confirmed, that many children who have swam in the ocean this summer have contracted unusual skin rashes and intestinal ailments. **********''We're seeing disorders that we haven't ever seen before here,'' said a doctor who teaches at Alexandria University's medical college. Blame Placed on U.S.  The local government of Alexandria, whose economy is heavily dependent on the annual summer invasion, has been eager to escape blame. A convenient scapegoat has been found: the United States. **********In late August, Al-Ahaly, another Cairo-based opposition newspaper, asserted that the local Council of Alexandria had formally protested to Washington the delay in completing a long-planned, desperately needed ''waste water'' project, at a cost of nearly $1.5 billion. American officials in Cairo said they did not know of any such protest. **********But they did acknowledge the project has been delayed for at least four years, partly by a dispute between Egypt and the United States over several issues. At the moment, work has been stopped by a disagreement over where the partly treated sewage should be dumped. The Americans support what they call an ''ocean outflow'' solution, which they estimate is almost $500 million cheaper than and environmentally superior to the ''desert outflow'' that Egypt wants. **********As a temporary solution, city officials approved a 1,000-foot extension of the pipeline that carries raw sewage into the Mediterranean. The extension, completed in May, was disastrous. Not only did currents carry the sewage back to shore, but this summer, to what one official called ''highly visible'' spots, meaning beaches of the wealthy and powerful. **********Local Governor Feels Heat **********Alexandrians blame Washington less than their government for the city's plight. **********Specifically, many blame Alexandria's Governor General Fawzi Maaz, a former intelligence chief who was in deep political trouble even before the sewage crisis became a national scandal. Several Alexandrians predicted that not only would Governor Maaz lose his post, national politicians who defended him might also fall. **********Earlier this summer, Egypt's Parliament, the People's Assembly, set up a special committee to investigate allegations of land profiteering and fraud against Governor Maaz. He has denied the allegations. **********On the Parliament's last day in session in July, legislators approved or debated in less than three hours more than 60 laws, agreements and reports, including the secret report on Governor Maaz. **********Moustafa Sherdy, a Member of Parliament and editor of The Wafd, the newspaper of Egypt's major opposition political party, accused the Speaker of the Parliament, Rifaat al Mahgoub, of trying to protect General Maaz, Mr. Sherdy's arch political foe. **********Challenge to the Government **********Mr. Sherdy challenged Mr. Mahgoub and the national Government to show that the Maaz report, which is still secret, had been duly considered by Parliament. Corruption, Mr. Sherdy asserted, is not confined to Alexandria, and he said the resolution of the inquiry would have lessons for Egypt's other districts, which are called governorates. **********Demanding that Governor Maaz be punished, Mr. Sherdy called Mr. Maghoub in an editorial ''the dog at the center of power.'' **********General Maaz and several others who were attacked in the editorial sued Mr. Sherdy and the paper's cartoonist for libel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/business/briefs-063235.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Kraft Inc., Glenview, Ill., a Dart & Kraft unit, said it had completed its acquisition of Westman Commission Co., a Denver-based food service distributor.

That brought the Big Three's combined profits for the year to $9.81 billion, easily eclipsing the old record of $6.15 billion set in 1983. **********The General Motors Corporation earlier reported record earnings of $4.52 billion last year and the Ford Motor Company posted record net of $2.91 billion. **********In the fourth quarter, Chrysler's earnings soared fivefold, to $609.7 million, or $4.91 a share - its best quarterly performance - from $118.3 million, or 91 cents a share, in the 1983 period. Sales for the quarter rose 39.5 percent, to $5.3 billion, from $3.8 billion. **********Chrysler's sales for the year climbed 47.8 percent, to 19.6 billion, from $13.26 billion, as unit sales rose 36 percent, to 2,034,348, from 1,493,961. **********Factors Aiding Recovery **********Analysts said the industry had benefited from a recovery in the sales of cars and trucks, restraints on Japanese imports, buyer preference for larger, more expensive cars, restrained labor agreements and improvements in operating efficiency. And, they said, 1985 may be equally rewarding for the companies, particularly if the national economy remains healthy. **********''I think they can do it again,'' said Ann C. Knight, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''The critical variable is continued economic recovery.'' **********Others were not as optimistic. ''Without any strikes this year, General Motors will do better, but Chrysler's tax holiday is over, so it will be down,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''Over all, the industry will probably end up with earnings slightly worse than 1984.'' **********Mr. Healy was referring to the fact that Chrysler's 1984 earnings were increased by $883.9 million in tax-loss carry-forward credits. The company said all such credits were used up during the year, and that it had a Federal tax liability for the year of about $50 million. The last time the company paid Federal income taxes was in 1977. **********Chrysler also announced a new incentive program today to stimulate sales and said it would take the unusual step of paying a $500 bonus to each of its 100,000 employees as a sort of deferred payment for the anxieties many endured when the company was close to bankruptcy. **********Threat on Imports **********And Lee A. Iacocca, the company's chairman, made his bluntest threat yet to shift small car production to overseas locations if the Reagan Administration declines to seek an extension of the voluntary restraint agreement that limits imports of cars from Japan. **********The agreement, which began in 1981, limits Japanese shipments to 1.85 million cars a year. It was intended to help the United States auto industry climb out of a slump that began in 1979 caused by the rapidly rising price of gasoline. **********Mr. Iacocca, somber despite the company's record earnings, said he expected the restraints to be ended when the agreement expires in March and predicted the Japanese auto companies would rapidly seek to improve their market share, from the current level of about 18 percent. **********He said he plans to visit Korea in April to discuss producing cars in association with the Samsung Group, a large Korean manufacturer. He said it was likely that production of subcompact cars the size of Chrysler's Omni and Horizon models would be quickly transferred overseas if there was a surge of imports from Japan. **********Chrysler said it would notify people who bought the company's cars from 1979 through 1984 that they can get a $500 discount if they buy any 1985 model before June 6. Analysts said the move appeared to be intended to acquaint owners of the company's earlier front-wheel-drive cars with its more advanced current products. **********The company also extended its 8.8 percent financing program on its smallest American-made cars and the offer of a free automatic transmission on its larger K-body models until April 30. **********The $500 payments to employees, Mr. Iacocca said, are ''voluntary, 'thank you' payments'' to workers who stayed while the company was undergoing substantial layoffs and was being supported by $1.2 billion in Government- guaranteed loans. **********''Our people and their families have earned this payment,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''They earned it in work, in worry, in sacrifice. They were part of the action, so now they're getting a little piece of the action.'' **********The company said $135 million had been set aside for executive bonuses, an amount it said was one-third less than called for by the bonus formula. After last year's bonuses at the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company prompted protests by Federal officials, Chrysler said it would keep the bonuses for its top executives below the levels at the other companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/29/world/malta-now-wary-on-disaster-cause.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 925, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MALTA NOW WARY ON DISASTER CAUSE", "print_headline": "MALTA NOW WARY ON DISASTER CAUSE", "body_text": " **********The Maltese Government backed away today from its official explanations of the storming of an Egyptian airliner amid growing indications that a large number of passengers died as a result of Egyptian bombs used in the assault. **********Paul Mifsud, the Government spokesman, also said that the magistrate investigating the case was looking into the conduct of the Egyptian commandos in the operation. **********Meanwhile, the co-pilot of the plane, Emad Bahey Monib, confirmed that the hijackers had asked that the plane go to Libya. But he said that they mentioned Libya along with Malta as possible destinations, and he did not know where they would ultimately have taken the plane. **********Pathologists virtually completed the autopsies on the 59 bodies recovered from the plane. Fifty-seven people died in the assault on the airliner on Sunday night and two were killed earlier. **********Most Said to Die From Smoke **********The Government's chief coroner, Dr. Abela Medici, said he expected the autopsies to be finished by late today and indicated smoke inhalation had been the main cause of death. **********The new emphasis by the Maltese Government on the causes of the disaster came from Mr. Mifsud in a briefing to a small group of reporters. **********In the past, Mr. Mifsud had said that the fire aboard the airliner had been caused by three hand grenades thrown by the hijackers as 25 Egyptian commandos stormed the Boeing 747. **********Today Mr. Mifsud pointed to a series of past statements he had made emphasizing that he had received all his information on the storming of the airliner from its captain, Hani Galal. **********''I don't know anything myself,'' he said.

The bomb, the official said, appeared to have been too powerful and was the likely cause of the fire that produced thick smoke and possibly poisonous gases from the burning of material used to insulate the airliner. **********New questions about the Egyptian conduct of the assault came from another official close to the investigation. **********The official, who insisted on anonymity, said that ''many of the injuries came from the Egyptian smoke bomb'' tossed by the commandos inside the aircraft. **********Fumes Said to Fell Woman **********An injured Frenchwoman, Gilda Blanc, is reported by doctors to have suffered not from the smoke produced by the fire, but from the fumes of the smoke bomb. **********''This kind of thing is used outside, where it disperses,'' the official said. ''But in an inside space, it is deadly.'' A fireman who was called to the scene 10 to 15 minutes after the assault also lent support to the theory that the Egyptian bomb blasts were a major cause of the fire. **********He said that the fire on the plane was ''mainly in the back,'' over the cargo hold. ''Baggage and bodies were all mixed,'' he said. But he added that he did not know himself the cause of the smoky inferno. **********The fireman gave his name, but asked that it not be used. **********Shooting Called Indiscriminate **********Dr. Medici, the coroner, said today that while some of the bodies contained bullets, the main cause of death was smoke inhalation. **********''Let's just say there was a lot of smoke,'' he said, explaining his caution by the fact that he was not authorized to discuss the case. **********Despite Egyptian denials, witnesses to the assault have said that the Egyptians fired what one witness called an ''uncountable'' number of shots during the attack. A passenger, Tony Lyons, has called the Egyptian shooting indiscriminate. **********Dr. Medici also said that the nature of the explosion was under investigation, but he did not elaborate. He said in response to a question that he could neither confirm nor deny reports that many were killed by the blast. **********The doctor, in a white coat and rubber gloves, spoke outside his laboratory at the University of Malta's medical school, where the autopsies are being carried out. He spoke in a hallway where 12 coffins were stacked along the wall. **********Destination Discussed **********The co-pilot of the plane, Mr. Bahey Monib, said he had suggested to the hijackers a variety of possible destinations, including Athens, where the flight originated, Cairo, where the plane was scheduled to go, or Sicily. **********''He refused everything except to go to Malta,'' Mr. Bahey Monib said. ''And there was the possibility to land in Libya.'' **********Mr. Bahey Monib said he tried to dissuade the hijackers from forcing the plane to go to Libya. ''I said Libya was too far. I said we would crash into the sea before reaching there. If you want to kill us, kill us.'' **********Mr. Bahey Monib said that during the gunfight on the airliner between one of the hijackers and an Egyptian security guard, a bullet flew through the cockpit.

The Prime Minister went on to criticize Mr. Sharon harshly at a Labor Party rally, while Labor supporters shouted: ''Fire him! Fire Sharon!'' **********Mr. Peres said of Mr. Sharon: ''I read in the papers that the Likud ministers met and that one minister, who is usually outstanding in his generosity and accuracy, offered a plan, and, out of a sense of collegiality, gave full credit for this plan to the Prime Minister - although I never saw it. Then he comes to me and says, 'Give me clarifications on this plan.' What am I supposed to clarify? His own fabrications?'' **********Mr. Peres then added of Mr. Sharon: ''I hear that one of the ministers said Hussein was not reliable. I recall that the same minister said that Bashir Gemayel was very reliable.'' **********Mr. Sharon once predicted that Mr. Gemayel, the late leader of the rightist Phalangist militia in Lebanon, would sign a peace treaty with Israel. Mr. Gemayel was elected President of Lebanon after Israeli troops invaded in 1982, but was assassinated before he could take office. **********The exchange of allegations and rebuttals between Mr. Peres and Mr. Sharon ilustrated the increasingly nasty state of relations between Labor and Likud as some kind of Jordanian-Israeli negotiations over the future of the West Bank appear to be becoming a serious possibility. **********Mr. Neeman ignited today's outburst by declaring on the Israeli radio that he had seen written Government proposals for joint Jordanian-Israeli rule of the West Bank. **********''I saw a document,'' he said. ''It gives the details of Israeli proposals with comments of the Jordanian reactions. I can't say who signed it.'' **********Mr. Neeman said he copied the document by hand, but did not have it in his possession. He indicated it was a plan purportedly forwarded by the Prime Minister to King Hussein suggesting that Israel and Jordan set up a joint ''condominium'' over the West Bank. **********Mr. Sharon, for his part, said on the Israeli radio that ''there are contacts'' taking place secretly between Mr. Peres and King Hussein. **********''The contacts were never discussed in the Cabinet,'' said Mr. Sharon, ''and according to what is being published there are very serious dangers in them. For example, the subject of the joint government in the West Bank is not acceptable to us. **********''The most dangerous thing that was heard,'' he continued, ''was the idea of sharing in the area of security'' with Jordan. **********Officials here agree that some kind of paper on the subject of possible Jordanian-Israeli cooperation over autonomy on the West Bank has been circulating in the Prime Minister's office. In the past two weeks the Israeli newspapers Hadashot and Haaretz have both published reports about such a proposal. The plan itself was reportedly a working paper drawn up several months ago by the director general of the Prime Minister's office, Avraham Tamir, as a possible scenario for advancing the peace process with Jordan. **********However, the general impression among officials in the Prime Minister's office and among political commentators is that any autonomy proposal that may exist is simply one working paper among many, although some ideas in the plan may have been informally mentioned to King Hussein by Israeli officials, either through the United States or in their own secret contacts. In this view, such a paper would have been drawn up on an informal basis and would not in any way constitute a formal negotiating position, let alone the basis for a secret agreement between Mr. Peres and King Hussein. **********According to Haaretz, the purported plan calls for autonomy for the West Bank as an interim solution, with an autonomy council elected by the residents and subordinate to a joint Jordanian-Israeli administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/08/business/satellite-orbit-rules-irk-3d-world.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Stuart", "pub_date": "1985-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SATELLITE ORBIT RULES IRK 3D WORLD", "print_headline": "SATELLITE ORBIT RULES IRK 3D WORLD", "body_text": " **********A conflict between industrial and developing countries over the use of space is shaping up as the dominant issue at a conference of 150 countries that opens Thursday in Geneva. **********The meeting is being convened to negotiate a plan to avert traffic jams in the space used by orbiting communications satellites. **********Although the five-week World Administrative Radio Conference is nominally technical, there is a political undercurrent of North-South conflict - the desire of industrial countries to gain an advantage from their technical lead with a flexible approach to assigning orbital slots and the desire of some developing countries to reserve orbital slots years before they are to be used. **********Congestion Above Equator **********Communications experts around the world say the increased use of low-cost satellites to expedite domestic, regional and world communications is leading to a virtual traffic jam in the satellite belt, 22,300 miles above the Equator. Similarly the radio frequencies that give the clearest signals are being rapidly filled. Most of the orbit space and radio spectrum is used by the United States and Intelsat, the multinational cooperative that runs a nonprofit satellite communications system. **********At Geneva the United States and other industrial nations will try to protect their satellite orbit slots. So far, they have been taken on a first-come, first-served basis. **********Nations that are newer to satellite communications will seek to earmark orbital positions they can use in the future when they are ready to put up their own (or shared) satellites. The advocates of rigid assigments include India, Colombia and Cameroon. **********A U.S. Counter Suggestion **********The United States delegation of 57 representatives from the governmental and private sectors is led by Dean Burch, a Washington lawyer and former Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. **********Reagan Administration officials said the United States would seek to counter the proposal for a rigid slot assignment system by offering to refrain for 10 years from using parts of the radio spectrum opened to satellite use by a 1979 conference. **********By staying out of the expanded spectrum, American officials said, the United States would reassure less-developed nations that there will be radio room for them when their satellite-launching plans mature. The American proposal would let a country ask for radio frequencies 15 years in advance, against five now. **********Compensatory Sums Urged **********Washington's plan would also establish a requirement that countries with a satellite in operation make compensatory payments to countries forced to put satellites in less desirable orbits or forced to use less desirable radio frequencies. **********Noting that at least seven major proposals for allocating space and spectrum are expected at Geneva, American officials said support for its plan is still unclear. **********Perhaps the most persuasive aspect of the American proposal is the knowledge that between 50 and 100 American satellites are at some stage of planning, development or scheduled launch in the next three years, according to the F.C.C. Without some kind of regulatory plan, therefore, less-developed nations might have even more to fear operating under the present first-come, first-served system. **********Problems of Tropical Zone **********There are shortcomings to the American plan, however, officials acknowledged. **********Less-developed nations, particularly those in the tropical zone, want rigid assigments of radio bands, including the lower frequencies now dominated by the developed nations. These frequencies are less disturbed by the bad weather that is commonplace in the tropics. **********In general, the less-developed nations argue that a flexible assignment plan would result in industrial nations' taking all the best orbit slots and spectrum assignments. **********American officials counter that improved technology makes it possible for seemingly less attractive allocations to be used efficiently."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/19/business/patents-power-system-for-satellite.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-01-19", "snippet": "WASHINGTON \n\nTHE RCA Corporation, which\n\nbuilds and operates communications satellites, received a patent this week for a dual power system for a direct broadcast satellite that would permit a home television viewer to pick up many channels with a...", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\n\nPOWER SYSTEM FOR SATELLITE", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\n\nPOWER SYSTEM FOR SATELLITE", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON **********THE RCA Corporation, which **********builds and operates communications satellites, received a patent this week for a dual power system for a direct broadcast satellite that would permit a home television viewer to pick up many channels with a 2-foot antenna dish on a rooftop. **********Patent 4,494,063 was granted Patrick J.

Justice Sartzetakis, a 56-year-old Supreme Court member with an apolitical background, established a reputation for courage as a young prosecutor by cutting through an official coverup to prove that the killing of a leftist legislator at a disarmament rally in 1963 had been deliberate. Costa-Gavras's award-winning 1970 film was closely based on the episode. **********Movie houses began showing the film again after Justice Sartzetakis was nominated for President three weeks ago by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. As the voting in Parliament proceeded through three rounds, the posters outside the theaters showing ''Z'' proclaimed, ''This is your President.'' **********Justice Sartzetakis, who has shunned all publicity since his nomination, was described by a source close to him as ''an outstanding legal expert with a great deal of moral courage.'' **********Mr. Papandreou hailed him as the embodiment of the ''symbols of democracy, justice and freedom.'' **********Father Dismissed From Police **********The President-elect, who has been reluctant to release detailed current biographical information, was born in Salonika in northern Greece in 1929. His family is said to have lived in difficult economic and political circumstances after the elder Mr. Sartzetakis was dismissed from his job as a police officer in 1935 for supporting an antimonarchist rebellion. **********The future President studied law at Salonika University and did advanced study in Paris. He joined the Greek judiciary in 1955 and was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1982. He is married to Efie Argyriou, an archeologist and historian, and they have one daughter. **********He first attracted public attention when he headed a team investigating the death of Grigorios Lambrakis, a popular legislator from a Communist-front party, who was fatally injured when hit by a van carrying right-wing thugs at a rally in Salonika on May 22, 1963. **********Senior police officials were found to be implicated. Justice Sartzetakis's brother Yannis, a mathematics professor, said recently that the two of them received many death threats during the Lambrakis investigation. ''Many times he would hide vital documents of the case under his bed,'' he said. **********The Lambrakis case occurred while Constantine Caramanlis, whom Justice Sartzetakis replaces as President, was Prime Minister. There were some allegations of ''moral responsibility'' by the Prime Minister in the Lambrakis killing, but he was not implicated. Nevertheless, the case was considered to be one of the factors in the Prime Minister's resignation the same year. **********Called Home by Colonels **********Mr. Sartzetakis was pursuing postgraduate studies in Paris in 1967 when a group of colonels staged a coup to take over the Greek government. Less than a month later, he was called home by the new rulers to resume his duties as an assistant judge. **********But the next year, he was dismissed from the bench for purported partiality. He refused to accept his dismissal quietly, contesting it with public statements and petitions. **********On Dec. 24, 1970, while he was still contesting his dismissal from the judiciary, policemen burst into his house in Salonika and arrested him, and he was soon placed in solitary confinement, without charges being filed. **********Six months later, he was among a score of prominent Greeks accused of conspiring against the military regime. Another was Lady Fleming, the Greek-born wife of Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. In November 1971, however, Mr. Sartzetakis and Lady Fleming were freed. **********It was not until 1973 that Justice Sartzetakis saw the film inspired by his skills as a prosecutor. He expressed this reaction to an interviewer: **********''I can only tell you that the film covers only a small part of reality. It barely touches the surface. The real case was a thousand times worse.'' **********A Severe Demeanor **********A bespectacled man with a receding hairline, Justice Sartzetakis has a severe demeanor, broken only by his colorful ties and an occasional smile.

Thursday it closed at $40.25. **********Part of Texas Commerce's previous popularity among investors came from the fact that for 16 years its earnings consistently showed year-to- year increases every quarter. That string will be broken this quarter, the bank said, mainly because of an increase in problem loans to the energy industry. **********The banking company said net income would decline 35 percent, to about $30 million, from $46 million in the first quarter of 1984. On a per- share basis, net income is expected to drop to 92 cents this quarter, from $1.41 in comparable period of 1984. **********The news stunned the financial markets and caused not only Texas Commerce's stock to fall, but also the stocks of the other banking companies that are heavy lenders to the energy industry. **********Texas Commerce and J. P. Morgan & Company in New York, the parent company of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, are the only two bank holding companies in the United States with the highest, triple-A bond rating from Standard & Poor's. **********In contrast to Texas Commerce's longtime performance, most other major Texas banks have been hard hit by losses from energy-related loans. Most have had sharp declines in earnings, and some, like Interfirst in Dallas, have reported large losses. **********''The big question is whether we're seeing a hangover from old energy problems or whether this is the emergence of a second round of big losses,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, first vice president and bank stock analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. **********''Texas Commerce is, has been and will continue to be a real quality bank,'' said James F. Carter, vice president and bank stock analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''What happens is simply the Texas banks as a group are muddling through, and finally Texas Commerce got to a point where it, too, had to report down earnings.'' **********James L. Cochrane, Texas Commerce vice president and chief economist, said earnings were hurt by larger loan losses than had been expected. He said the bank had budgeted $25 million for loan losses, but the actual figure would be $48 million. He added that actual charge-offs would be about $28 million, also higher than had been expected. The provision to the loan loss reserves is a direct charge against earnings, while actual charge-offs are charged against the loan loss reserve and do not directly affect earnings. **********Among the problem loans are some to bank directors. The bank's proxy statement disclosed that the Comptroller of the Currency, the chief Federal regulator of federally chartered banks, was investigating some of those loans to see whether the bank had violated any regulations on lending money to its own executives and board members. Federal rules permit banks to lend to insiders as long as the terms are similar to those for any unrelated borrower. **********Loss Involving Director **********Of the $48 million provision for loan losses, about $12.3 million will be attributed to a complicated loan to the Intrepid Drilling Company, which is controlled by Pat R. Rutherford Jr., a Texas Commerce director. Mr. Cochrane said the credit to Intrepid, which was once two loans totaling $32 million, was originally made at market rates. **********But Intrepid ran into financial trouble and last month the loans were made into one credit, giving the borrowers more time to pay and reducing the interest rate. After Intrepid's stockholders put up $10 million more in capital - $1 million to pay down the loans and $9 million as added collateral - the two loans were combined into one for $19 million, and the bank took the $12.3 million charge-off. **********Among the questions believed to have been raised by the Comptroller's investigation was whether the new, lower rate - 4 5/8 percent for the first five years and 6 percent for the next five years - was appropriate. **********Loan to Drilling Rig Operator **********Another question may concern the fact that Texas Commerce made the loan to a drilling rig operator when such loans were against the bank's policy. Mr. Cochrane said the bank occasionally made exceptions to this rule, especially for strong, well-capitalized companies. He also said the interest rates were appropriate as part of the restructuring of the loans. **********A second director who received a low-rate loan from Texas Commerce was Richard Moncrief, a member of a wealthy Texas family with long ties to the bank. That loan, too, according to Mr. Cochrane, was restructured last January because Mr. Moncrief could not meet the payments under the original terms. The new rate was set at 8.84 percent, below the prime rate of 10.5 percent. As part of the restructuring, Mr. Moncrief's family guaranteed repayment. **********Still another problem loan, for $25 million, was to finance a limited partnership in a Houston condominium. John Duncan, a member of Texas Commerce's board, and his family owned 49.8 percent of that partnership. That loan was restructured last year at an interest rate of 9.5 percent. Only 3 percent interest would be paid during the first five years, with the balance payable after that period. **********Share prices of two other Texas banking companies dropped yesterday.

Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, has catapulted this country of nearly 100 million people into an enormous town meeting. **********Day after day, on dusty street corners, in tiny shops and air-conditioned offices, people are arguing, waving fists and shouting about the International Monetary Fund. The debate is particularly acute in the pages of the country's newspapers, The ''debate,'' as everyone here calls it, turns on whether Nigeria should accept a $2.4 billion loan - and the rigorous economic austerity measures that would accompany it - from the monetary fund to help alleviate the country's acute financial problems. **********''I.M.F. Loan: A Tentacle of Capitalism,'' said The Daily Star. ''I.M.F.: What For?'' asked The Sunday Herald. **********'We Already Have Debt Burdens' **********And last Sunday, in an emotional sermon at the First Baptist Church of Lagos, Bishop Festus Segun looked out at General Babangida, who was in the congregation, and said, ''Those in a position to take the decision on the loan should note that we already have debt burdens.'' **********The Bishop's view is widely held. Business executives and bankers, labor leaders and university professors support it. Nigeria has never borrowed from the I.M.F. Many Nigerians say that taking a loan now and accepting the stringent economic changes required by the monetary fund would be unacceptable because Nigeria's sovereignty would erode. **********''I'm against it,'' said J. N. C. Obi, an insurance executive from Enugu who was passing through Lagos, as he jabbed his finger angrily at a newspaper headline. ''This will tie our hands.'' **********''The I.M.F. loan,'' according to a newspaper column by two leaders of a civil service union in Ilorin, a town 150 miles from here, would create ''more idle hands which are responsible for armed robberies, bank breakings and many more types of crime waves, coupled with misery and underdevelopment.'' **********Public Comment Requested **********The swirl of public discussion over the International Monetary Fund, the likes of which has not been seen since the military overthrew a civilian Government in December 1983, was touched off by General Babangida's announcment that he was ''inviting'' Nigerians to comment on their country's economic future. Part of that future, the general said, could entail imposing painful economic policies, including the drastic devaluation of the naira, Nigeria's unit of currency, as well as the ending of subsidies on petroleum and agricultural products and sweeping cuts in the Government's work force. **********To many economists here who have access to the economic data that measures this country's state of health, Nigeria is at a precipice. ''They're looking down a dark well,'' a Western diplomat said. ''The country is flat broke. Its income is declining. It has overborrowed and can't borrow any more. Its population is rising rapidly.'' **********This year, the Government of Nigeria is expected to spend 43 percent of its $11 billion national budget - a budget one-third the size of New York State's - for paying the interest on its foreign debt. Already, according to Western bankers, the country is 120 days behind in repaying certain short-term debts, a lag that has prompted Western banks to continue issuing letters of credit to pay for imports into Nigeria. **********According to some economists, Nigeria's ability to earn the foreign exchange it desperately needs to pay for Western machinery, spare parts, medical supplies and food is threatened by predictions of sharply lower oil prices. Indeed, Daniel Yergin, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass., has argued that oil prices could drop to $18 a barrel from its current level of $28.50. For Nigeria, which earned $10.5 billion from oil sales last year, the drop could be devastating, according to these economists. **********To Borrow or Not to Borrow **********Against this backdrop, General Babangida has said Nigeria must address the issue of whether to borrow from the International Monetary Fund or not. Some journalists here say they believe he has already decided to accept the loan. But, nonetheless, it is the fun of the debate itself more than the issues that seem to have riveted people's attention. **********''Nobody could debate at all until four weeks ago,'' said Arthur Ezenekwe, the Lagos bureau chief of The Daily Star. **********''Under Buhari, nobody could talk or write about anything,'' he said, referring to the jailing of journalists by the previous Government of Maj. Gen. Mohammed Buhari, which quickly chilled any criticism of its performance. **********In one of his first acts after taking power, General Babangida ordered all journalists released from prison. ''Now the ordinary man in the street is talking about the loan,'' Mr. Ezenekwe said. ''The general impression is that taking the loan is bad.'' **********For Alaba Ogunsanwo, a professor of politics at the University of Lagos, the debate has allowed him to express a view that many Nigerians accept -that the country's tradition of widespread corruption in government provides bleak hope that an I.M.F. loan would not be squandered. **********''We will never make progress,'' Professor Ogunsanwo told an interviewer from The Sunday Times of Lagos, ''as long as we refuse to distinguish between coming into governmental positions to make money and actually remaining in the private sector.'' **********Government officials, he said ''must be going in there to serve and not to make money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/24/business/ashland-net-up-in-period.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ashland Net Up in Period", "print_headline": "Ashland Net Up in Period", "body_text": " **********Ashland Oil Inc. reported yesterday that its quarterly income rose to $14.1 million, or 22 cents a share, from $5 million a year ago.

The dollar is at its lowest level in about 10 months. **********Economists and currency traders say the dollar's drop is the result of an erosion of a principal factor behind its rise to record highs earlier this year: confidence in the Reagan Administration and its handling of the American economy. **********Undercutting the dollar are the increasing number of signs showing economic weakness and concern that the Government may not have ready solutions for the economy's problems, the analysts said. They added that these factors could provide the combination needed to sustain a decline in the dollar, finally breaking a five-year run. **********Sometimes Hard to Predict **********Few are willing to make heavy bets that the dollar will stay down, since it has defied so many predictions in the last several years. But more traders than ever seem to regard this as a likely scenario. **********Another factor emerged late Friday that will probably add to the market's volatility, at least temporarily. That was the announcement that President Reagan would undergo major surgery to remove an intestinal growth. The news came after most currency trading had ended Friday, but it is expected to be a market factor today and perhaps later in the week, depending on developments. **********Late yesterday the President's doctors were describing the three hours of surgery on Saturday as successful and expressed confidence that his recovery would be swift. But traders predicted a nervous market. Any reversal in the President's condition, they said, could cause a dollar slump. **********Close Attention Expected **********''Obviously, this is something that the market will be watching closely,'' said Giuseppe Dose, manager of foreign-exchange trading for the Bank of America, expressing a widely held view. **********Overall, though, the dominant factor affecting the dollar remains the state of the economy. **********''The single key word for the dollar now is the economy,'' said Rimmer De Vries, senior vice president and chief international economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. ''The strong dollar was always based on confidence in the economy. What we are seeing now is that that confidence can be eroded very quickly when the market perceives that the Government is drifting on key issues, such as the deficit.'' **********Mr. Dose also said the currency market is shifting its focus. ''Before, the market was looking at interest rates and other technical factors, with that confidence in the economy there,'' he commented. ''Definitely now it is worried about the state of the economy. Finally, people are starting to realize that it is time to look at other currencies - sterling or the Swiss franc. There isn't just one currency any more.'' Many maintain that the dollar is anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent overvalued. **********Pattern of Dollar's Value **********The dollar began to fall slowly in early July, and the pace quickened at the end of last week. By late Friday the dollar was at its lowest level in about 10 months - 2.87 West German marks and 240 Japanese yen - down some 17 percent from the record highs it reached in late February. Once again, the market was witnessing the kind of sharp swings that had become standard in the past year. **********Such a drop in the dollar would have a mix of economic repercussions that go well beyond the frenetic world of currency trading. In fact, some dollar weakening would be regarded as a dose of very positive medicine for the eocnomy. The Federal Reserve has been saying since late last year that it felt the dollar ought to decline, in the hope that this would rejuvenate the hard-hit manufacturing sector. **********Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, summed up the paradox: ''Even though it is the weak economy that is driving the dollar - and I do believe that it has a long way downward to go - the fall is part of the appropriate remedy for the economy's problems.'' **********Effects of Lower Dollar **********Mr. Lawrence said a falling dollar would, over time, make American companies more competitive internationally by lowering the cost of American goods to foreigners, give a lift to commodity producers and increase domestic employment and demand. These effects could take time, from 18 to 30 months, and inflation would rise slowly. Also the trade deficit, which has ballooned to record levels because of the dollar's strength, would widen at first before starting to shrink. **********But ''most American companies would benefit,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''It would be good for the U.S. economy.'' He added that it would also allow European countries to lower their interest rates - as Britain began to do on Thursday - and thus bolster their economies. **********One fear, though, is that the dollar's decline could become too steep. A crash would bring many problems, not the least of which would be a destructive uncertainty and loss of confidence in the monetary authorities. **********Uncertainty About Market **********''So far, we have had just what everybody wants - the soft landing,'' said Scott E. Pardee, executive vice president of the Discount Corporation. ''But it's a skittish market, and there's no bottom to it. You don't know what the next stop-off point is. It could be smooth water ahead, or we could be about to go over Niagara Falls.'' **********Mr. De Vries said lack of agreement over how to narrow the Federal budget deficit adds to the possibility of the dollar's decline becoming uncontrollable. **********''I feel, and I think the market might perceive, that our policy-making is adrift,'' he said. ''The whole debacle on the deficit just removes confidence that the problems won't get worse. If you want a soft landing for the dollar, you have to have some feeling that the Government is working in the right direction.'' **********For many corporations that regularly deal in the foreign-exchange market, the dollar's decline has already been a blessing. ''We're having a ball with this,'' said Jeffrey C. Donahue, director of international money management at the Union Carbide Corporation. **********Several Market Techniques **********He explained that the number of sophisticated financial products available today, such as currency options and currency swaps, provide an array of means to take advantage of the dollar's decline without having to take the risk of actually selling dollars in the open market. **********''Call it the zen of foreign exchange if you want, but the vibrations have seemed much easier to read this time that the dollar is coming down,'' Mr. Donahue said. ''That makes it easier. And with all the products we have to use, companies always do better in a declining market than a rising dollar market.'' **********''Now companies can hedge without selling their dollars or dollar-denominated securities,'' Mr. Pardee said. ''That does lend some stability to the market that you didn't have before.'' **********However, some traders insisted that the easiest days may be past. ''We do expect the dollar to generally move downward for some time,'' Mr. Dose of the Bank of America said. ''But it is going to be a bumpy ride.'' Mr. Donahue added, ''There will still be plenty of chances to get your fingers singed.'' ---- Currency Outlook in Europe PARIS, July 14 - Any uncertainty about President Reagan's health, bankers here said this weekend, is likely to add to the downward pressure on the dollar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/world/airline-was-penalized-in-84-inspection.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Witkin", "pub_date": "1985-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIRLINE WAS PENALIZED IN '84 INSPECTION", "print_headline": "AIRLINE WAS PENALIZED IN '84 INSPECTION", "body_text": " **********Arrow Air, whose plane crashed in Newfoundland yesterday, was one of 16 airlines receiving significant penalties after a Government inspection of 327 American carriers in early 1984. **********The Miami-based company was barred by the Federal Aviation Administration from carrying out expansion plans pending the correction of shortcomings found by the inspectors. The problems were cleared up later in the year and the restrictions lifted. **********The deficiency found most worrisome by the aviation agency was in procedures that allowed for overly long deferral of maintenance. Other problems included inadequacies of training and operations manuals, and failure to keep proper training records. **********The airline, which still has 11 planes after the Gander crash. operates 150 to 160 scheduled flights a week, mostly between the Northeast and Puerto Rico. But 75 percent of its business is in charter operations. **********In Military Airlift Since '81 **********The 258 fatalities in the Gander disaster were the first for Arrow except for the death of a flight engineer aboard a Boeing 707. **********Since 1981, when the company was restarted after a hiatus of 27 years, it has had a contract with the Military Airlift Command to fly service personnel around the globe. In the fiscal year 1985, according to the Defense Department, the airline did $33.6 million worth of military airlift business. **********Robin Matell, an Arrow spokesman, said the airline flew a million passengers to 245 places in 72 countries over the past year. He said the airline had been losing money since it was restarted four years ago, but was turning a profit in 1985. The carrier, started by a former World War II pilot named George Batchelor, is privately owned. Two other operations of Mr. Batchelor - International Aero Leasing, which leases planes, and Batch Air, a maintenance company - have been money-makers for many years, Mr. Matell said. **********Ex-F.A.A. Official on Staff **********Mr. Batchelor, who will be 64 next week, serves as chairman and his 32-year-old son Jon is president. Richard Skully, a former high official of the F.A.A. who came to Arrow Air from Air Florida, is the head of operations and maintenance. The airline was originally founded after World War II, but tightening Government rules forced it and several other carriers to stop flying in 1954. **********The general inspection of air carriers that led to the temporary restrictions against Arrow Air was ordered in early 1984 by Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Secretary of Transportation. It came on the heels of a disturbing run of accidents and incidents, largely involving commuter carriers and other airlines that had sprung up after the industry was deregulated in 1978. **********Arrow was one of about 40 airlines that inspectors decided needed a second round of more thorough inspections. And 16 of those were eventually penalized, with operations suspended or curtailed, or crew members withdrawn from service. Compliance Is Called Good Anthony Broderick, the F.A.A.'s associate administrator for aviation standards, said the problems found at Arrow were by no means the worst among the 16 carriers. **********''Their compliance disposition was quite good,'' Mr. Broderick said.''They hired new people and redid their operatisons. And we continued a significant amount of inspection attention.'' **********There were no immediate indications what had caused the DC-8 at Gander to falter just after takeoff and crash in flames a short distance from the end of the runway. Crashes on takeoff and landing, close to the ground, make up the overwhelming majority of airline accidents. **********''There is so little time to correct a mistake or solve a problem,'' Mr. Broderick said. ''If you lose 1,000 feet at 39,000 feet, what's the difference?'' **********In the decade or so before 1985, airlines like Arrow that concentrate on charters rather than scheduled operations achieved an impressive safety record. Only two crashes occurred from 1976 through 1984 and the total death toll was 10. **********But 1985 has been a severe setback. In addition to the Gander disaster, the year has been marked by one other major charter crash.

Today, the United States Embassy spokesman, Donald Hamilton, said the second plane was fully equipped to serve as a gunship, but under an agreement with Congress was not yet mounted with machine guns. **********Second Plane Believed Used **********The agreement between the Administration and Congress stipulated that the second aircraft could be used in combat only after American officials had evaluated the performance and use of the first gunship, according to an aide of Representative Michael D. Barnes, head of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. **********But apparently in violation of that understanding the Salvadoran Air Force is believed to have equipped the second aircraft with a rapid-fire gun of unknown specification and used it as a gunship alongside the first aircraft in a battle earlier this week, according to the source with knowledge of the plane's use. **********It is not known if American officials were aware that the Salvadorans intended to use the plane in combat, but it appears there was little supervision over how it would be employed. **********The United States Ambassador to El Salvador, Thomas R. Pickering, refused to comment on the matter today. Other American officials also refused to comment on whether the two American-provided planes had been involved in combat. **********''The embassy is aware of reports that more than one plane may have been used and is looking into the matter,'' Mr. Hamilton said. **********'Cause for Serious Concern' **********Representative Barnes said unauthorized use of the second plane in combat would be cause for serious concern. **********''In November I was given personal assurances by the Department of State that this would not occur,'' Mr. Barnes said in a statement released by an aide in a telephone interview. ''If the situation is as it appears, it is a direct violation of the personal assurances I was given two months ago.'' **********An aide to Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, echoed the criticism. ''It would appear to be a serious violation of the understanding between the Administration and members of Congress,'' the aide said. **********The terms under which the planes were to be used were set out in a letter from senior members of Congress to Ambassador Pickering on Sept. 20. The letter was signed by Edward Boland, then head of the House Intelligence Committee, Dante B. Fascell, head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mr. Barnes, according to an aide to Mr. Barnes. **********92 Members Sign Letter **********According to two Congressional sources, the letter to the Ambassador said, ''We understand you will not authorize release of the second rebuilt C-47 to El Salvador unless you are satisfied that the system is working well, with due attention to human rights concerns.'' **********The aide to Representative Miller said 92 members of Congress had signed a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger in September expressing concern over the deployment of gunships to El Salvador. **********The aide said Defense Department and State Department officials had given assurances that the second gunship would be sent into combat only after American officials had studied how the first gunship had performed. **********The American-provided planes were used to attack leftist guerrillas for the first time, apparently with some success, in a heavy 18-hour battle in San Vicente Province two days ago, according to several reporters who watched the fighting. Having been told by American officials that only one gunship was in the country, the reporters were surprised to see two gunships spraying the guerrillas with long burps of unbroken machine-gun fire. **********15 Rebels Found Dead **********Army spokesmen say the bodies of 15 rebels were found when the battle ended, an unusually high number in a war in which the rebels almost always carry away all of their dead. The army reportedly lost at least 15 dead and over 40 wounded and there are indications that the figures could go higher. **********The Salvadoran Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Adolfo Blandon, said in an interview today that he personally directed the battle from a specially equipped American-provided communication helicopter that hovered above the battle. **********''It's a good plane,'' General Blandon said of the C-47 gunship. ''But we need more and better ones.'' **********The Salvadoran commander said he would ask the United States this year to provide a total of six gunships and 10 Hughes 500 helicopters equipped with rapid-fire ''miniguns'' of a type used in Vietnam. If delivered, such weapons would radically increase the fire-power available to the Salvadoran military. **********Warning by Rights Groups **********General Blandon said the helicopters and gunships would be used in tandem to clear guerrilla forces from landing zones and repel large rebel attacks. **********Human rights organizations have frequently warned, however, that such high-powered weaponry could cause heavy civilian casualties in the populated areas where many battles are fought in El Salvador. The aide to Representative Miller said the Administration had promised that gunships would not be used near villages. **********The Salvadoran Air Force has bombed towns and killed civilians on at least three occasions, moving President Jose Napoleon Duarte to issue new rules last year limiting aerial bombardment and strafing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/17/world/soviet-said-to-have-allowed-29-jews-to-leave-in-august.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Said to Have Allowed 29 Jews to Leave in August", "print_headline": "Soviet Said to Have Allowed 29 Jews to Leave in August", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union allowed 29 Jews to leave for the West in August, equal to the record low of last October, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said today in its monthly statement on refugees processed worldwide. **********Last July the committee registered 174 Jewish emigres, the highest figure since December 1982.

''But I believe these issues can be resolved.'' **********American and Jordanian officials said there had been some movement toward direct talks in the discussion today , but no one said there had been a breakthrough. It was unclear, given the refusal of officials to provide details, if in fact it will be possible to meet the target of starting negotiations by the end of the year. **********Issue of 'Proper Auspices' **********The principal issue discussed today, State Department officials said, was King Hussein's insistence that the proper ''auspices'' for the direct talks should be an international conference to which the Soviet Union, the United States and other permanent members of the Security Council would be invited. Israel has opposed such a meeting, and the United States has been unenthusiastic because of doubts that Moscow would play a constructive role. **********A State Department official who participated in the hourlong session this morning said later that ''headway'' was made on resolving that problem, but he declined to be more specific. **********'Focused Our Discussions' **********''I think we have narrowed, focused our discussions very intensively on the questions associated with an international context - in the King's term, an international conference,'' the official said. ''As I said, I think headway has been made. This is not the moment, this is not the place to get into the details of that headway.'' **********But other officials said certain approaches had been discussed. One approach was that the Security Council endorse negotiations without a conference necessarily being held. **********Another approach was agreeing that participation of non-Middle East nations should be limited to those with relations with the Middle East countries at the conference. Of the Security Council's five permanent members, the Soviet Union and China have no diplomatic ties with Israel. **********The meeting at the White House today took place against the background of active behind-the-scenes diplomatic moves involving the United States, Jordan and Israel, as well as a brewing confrontation between the Administration and Congress over a pending arms sale to Jordan. Pro-Israeli members of Congress have promised a floor fight against the sale. **********King Ready for Talks **********After an unpublicized meeting last week in New York between King Hussein and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the Jordanian leader made a statement at the United Nations General Assembly last Friday in which, for the first time, he declared his readiness for ''direct negotiations'' for peace with Israel, albeit under the ''cover'' of the international conference. **********On the same day, Mr. Reagan announced plans to sell Jordan an arms package valued at from $1.55 billion to $1.9 billion. The package includes 40 advanced fighter planes. There seemed to be a clear connection between the statement by King Hussein and the arms sale. **********The King said, ''We are prepared to negotiate under appropriate auspices with the Government of Israel, promptly and directly under the basic tenets of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.'' **********Resolution 242 of 1967 sets forth the idea that Israel would return lands seized in 1967 from Arab nations, including Jordan, in return for peace. Acceptance of 242 has been deemed as tantamount to recognition of Israel's status as a nation. Resolution 338 of 1973 calls for negotiations. **********King Hussein said to reporters at the White House that in his meeting with Mr. Reagan, ''I have reiterated to him Jordan's commitment to a negotiated settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, within the context of an international conference to implement Security Council Resolution 242.'' **********'An Unswerving Position' **********He added that Jordan had ''an unswerving position in condemnation of terrorism, irrespective of its nature and source.'' **********''Jordan condemns violence and is committed to a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' King Hussein said. ''We are prepared to join all parties in pursuing a negotiated settlement, in an environment free of belligerent and hostile acts.'' **********Israel has been seeking a commitment from Jordan of ''non-belligerency'' as a precursor to peace talks. State Department officials said the King's statement today went far toward meeting that request. **********Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader, who heads Israel's national unity government, underscored the differences in Israel by responding in a conciliatory way to King Hussein. Mr. Peres, at a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, was reported to have welcomed King Hussein's comments even though repeating Israel's opposition to an international conference. **********But Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is the leader of the Likud bloc in the divided government, has responded negatively to King Hussein's comments. Because of the split in Israel over the way to approach negotiations, with Labor more forthcoming, the United States is seeking to insure that before it agrees to a formula for peace talks, there be no question but that Israel can accept, or that Mr. Peres would win a test of wills with Mr. Shamir, Administration officials said. **********'Under Appropriate Auspices' **********Middle East diplomacy is noted for its jargon, in which certain expressions take on special meaning. State Department officials noted, for instance, that Mr. Reagan, in his statement, used the term ''under appropriate auspices'' in discussing the timing for direct negotiations. That is the same wording used by King Hussein at the United Nations and was supposed to show a narrowing of the gap between them. **********King Hussein's opposition to terrorism was supposed to ease the concern of Israelis about the Jordanian leader's agreement with Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, on the approach to peace talks. Some Israelis have been accusing Jordan of allowing Palestinian terrorists to operate from its territory, something denied by Jordan. **********Pro-Israeli members of Congress, in advance of the arms sale announcement to Jordan, passed language requiring Mr. Reagan, before making such a sale, to certify that Jordan was publicly committed ''to the recognition of Israel and to negotiate promptly and directly with Israel under the basic tenets of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.'' **********King Hussein's comments on Friday and today were meant to give the President the kind of public commitment he needs to certify that the arms sale can go ahead, State Department officials said. **********But several key members of Congress expressed concern about the pending sale and promised to seek to block it by floor action. This led to an unusual call by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, for other senators ''to reserve judgment'' on the arms sales ''until we have a clearer picture of the true prospects for direct Jordanian negotiations.'' **********Mr. Reagan said today that those arms ''are important in meeting Jordan's proven defense needs and as evidence that those who seek peace will not be left at the mercy of those who oppose it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/07/business/at-t-disputes-atari-tie-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

Others have gone in search of land to farm. Most have rediscovered poverty. **********''We were given no preparation to deal with the crisis,'' said a Paraguayan in his 50's who now works occasionally as a gardener. ''We were given a dream that was then snatched away.'' **********As Itaipu begins to feed its energy into the industrial and urban heartlands of neighboring Brazil, the problems bequeathed to Paraguay by the joint project spanning the border at the River Parana are just beginning to become apparent. **********Population Drops Sharply **********Over the last two years, the population of this riverside town has fallen from 80,000 to 50,000, while its income now comes largely from the sale of duty-free and contraband goods to busloads of Brazilians who cross the Friendship Bridge from Foz do Iguacu each afternoon. **********In the fertile farming regions around Puerto Stroessner, violent clashes have already erupted between the police and former Itaipu workers who, first lured away from the land by well-paid jobs and then forced back by unemployment, have occupied some private estates. **********In Paraguay as a whole, the eight-year economic boom that accompanied construction of the $16 billion giant is also over, leaving little new industry or social welfare structure to testify to the spending spree. **********Suddenly, voices are being heard questioning whether in the long run Itaipu will benefit Paraguay. ''The only thing that is clear is that Itaipu permanently ties Paraguay to Brazil,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, publisher of ABC Color, an independent newspaper that was closed by the country's rightist Government last year. **********Some Unexpected Repercussions **********In many ways, Itaipu is the result rather than the cause of the expanding influence that Brazil, with a population of 130 million, has over Paraguay, with just 3.5 million inhabitants. But planners who saw the economic and political logic of consolidating Paraguay's links to Brazil through Itaipu failed to anticipate the social repercussions. **********Soon after seizing power in 1954, Paraguay's President, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, announced what he called ''the march to the east'' from Asuncion, the capital, toward the Brazilian border. By 1960, a highway to this town and the bridge over the River Parana freed landlocked Paraguay from its dependence on Argentina as its only trading avenue to the world. **********Political factors also played a role. Although Buenos Aires had traditionally dominated Paraguayan politics, General Stroessner not only distrusted the Argentine governments that followed the ouster of President Juan Domingo Peron in 1955, but he also felt greater personal sympathy for Brazil, where he had undergone some military training. **********After the armed forces seized power in Brazil in 1964, they too began to view their tiny neighbor in geopolitical terms, financing construction of new highways linking remote eastern areas bordering on Brazil to the more populated central regions of Paraguay. **********An Equal Share of the Work **********When Brazil decided its future energy needs required construction of a huge hydroelectric complex across the River Parana, the approval of Paraguay, as the owner of half the river and water, was required. Brazil assumed all financial responsibility for Itaipu and agreed to buy Paraguay's unused electricity, but Paraguayan companies and workers were given an equal share of the construction opportunities. **********Between 1974 and 1981, with the Itaipu Binational Company also building roads, houses and schools in Puerto Stroessner, some $2 billion entered the Paraguayan economy, bringing double-digit growth rates in the late 1970's and stimulating the ''march to the east.'' **********''Until the 1970's, the land in the east had little commercial value,'' said a Roman Catholic priest with experience in the area. ''Peasants could occupy private land without problem. But after money from Itaipu began reaching officials and professionals, they began buying land for speculative reasons and the price began to rise.'' **********Many peasants, their eyes on Itaipu, were happy to sell their plots. ''They thought there would be jobs and money and everything would be O.K.,'' an unemployed worker in Puerto Stroessner said, recalling his own reactions. ''Here they had running water and a nice house. They never thought they would have to return to the land.'' **********Private Estates Occupied **********Coincidentally, many of the 300,000 or so Brazilians who had settled in border areas between here and Pedro Juan Caballero, 240 miles to the north, began introducing mechanized farming of soybeans and timber, in both cases eliminating the need for cheap farm labor. A number of large foreign export-oriented companies formed estates of up to 100,000 acres. **********As a result, when Itaipu and its contractors began laying off workers in 1982, the former peasants often had nowhere to go. Pointing out that the Constitution gave them a right to land, they began ''invading'' uncultivated private estates. And when repression followed, they turned to the church for help. **********''We saw the problem coming and tried to create awareness among the authorities before it was too late,'' said Heriberto Alegre, a lawyer for the ecumenical Committee of Churches, which is now representing peasants involved in 66 land disputes. ''But the Institute of Rural Welfare paid no attention.'' **********Last September, Mr. Alegre was himself jailed and charged with encouraging illegal land occupations. ''They think that my arrest is the solution to the land problem,'' he said in an interview at Tacumbu Prison in Asuncion. ''The solution is a land reform and not repression of a lawyer.'' **********Wary About Argentina **********The farming model imported from Brazil, however, is now also being applied to the previously inaccessible Chaco region of northern Paraguay, where huge cattle ranches are appearing. And in the more populated region between here and Asuncion, no land redistribution seems likely. **********At an official level, relations between Paraguay and Brazil remain good. With a democratic administration installed in Buenos Aires, the Stroessner regime suspects Argentina of supporting its political enemies, but it sees no such threat coming from Brazil's new civilian Government. ''Any criticism of Itaipu is stimulated by Argentina,'' an official said. ''Brazil is helping our development. Thanks to Itaipu, we are permanent allies.'' **********Mr. Zuccolillo, the newspaper publisher, added, ''For that very reason, Brazil will never permit a pro-Argentine government in Paraguay.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/24/business/rates-rise-sharply-as-worries-persist.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1985-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RATES RISE SHARPLY AS WORRIES PERSIST", "print_headline": "RATES RISE SHARPLY AS WORRIES PERSIST", "body_text": " **********Interest rates rose sharply yesterday, reversing a portion of the large declines that occurred earlier this month. **********There was no surprising economic news to account for the turnaround in trading, but by late in the day the three-month Treasury bill was bid at 7.80 percent, up from 7.62 at Monday's auction, while the six-month issue was at 8.01 percent, up from 7.87 percent. **********Treasury bond prices fell about 3/4 point but are still more than 3 points, or $30 per $1,000 bond, higher than they were April 4. The 11 1/4 percent issue due in 2015 was offered late yesterday at 99 1/2, down 3/4 point, to yield 11.31 percent, compared with about 96 2/32 to yield 11.75 percent on April 4.

Huge Federal budget deficits, the need to attract foreign money to finance the trade deficit, worries about inflation and the upward pressure on interest rates that comes from an expanding economy have all been cited as reasons for high rates, and all remain of serious concern to investors and speculators. **********One early disappointment to people expecting continued declines in interest was the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, which opened at 8 1/8 percent and averaged about 8 percent for the day, up from 7.52 percent Monday and 7.60 percent last Friday. **********Remarks by Fed Officials **********Speaking in various forums across the country, Federal Reserve officials did not provide any fresh insight into monetary policy that would point to higher or lower interest rates. **********Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, was quoted by Market News Service as telling the Georgia Bankers Association that the dependence of American capital markets and the economy on inflows of foreign capital mean ''it would be difficult to get declines in interest rates.'' Mr. Volcker also noted that low inflation is a key to attracting foreign capital. **********The importance of maintaining an anti-inflationary monetary policy was also mentioned by Preston Martin, vice chairman of the Fed, in a speech to the National Foreign Policy Conference. But Mr. Martin, who has occasionally advocated a monetary policy with lower rates, also warned that the American economy is in danger of slipping into a ''growth recession'' where the economy would not expand enough to create new jobs for a growing work force. **********Private economists expect that such a slowdown in economic activity would cause the Fed to encourage faster growth of the money supply. Faster money supply growth might also be justified, Mr. Martin said, by a slowdown in the rate at which money changes hands, or velocity. **********Announcement of Deficit **********Another reminder of the potential for higher interest rates was the Treasury's announcement of a $28.46 billion deficit for March, a performance that analysts said was consistent with forecasts of a budget deficit of about $200 billion for the present fiscal year, ending Sept. 30. Although the supply of Treasury notes and bonds has been light the past few weeks, securities dealers expect the Government to announce on April 30 plans to sell $19 billion of notes and bonds in the week of May 6. **********Yesterday's announcement of a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index for March was also cited as a reason for yesterday's higher interest rates. Analysts at Money Market Services noted that the monthly increase ''has produced some concern among debt market particpatns that inflation pressures are on the rise.'' But they concluded that by the second half of this year inflation will be rising at a rate of only 2 percent to 4 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/23/business/national-intergroup-reports-a-profit.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1985-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATIONAL INTERGROUP REPORTS A PROFIT", "print_headline": "NATIONAL INTERGROUP REPORTS A PROFIT", "body_text": " **********National Intergroup Inc. yesterday reported a third-quarter profit of $16.9 million, or 60 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $14 million in the period a year ago. **********The Pittsburgh company attributed the results to the Permian Corporation, an oil and gas gathering company that it acquired in August, and higher earnings by its financial services businesses. **********''While third-quarter earnings remain far below acceptable levels,'' Howard H.

Apart from speculative flurries in real or imagined takeover candidates, the focus generally has been on downbeat news - slowing growth in the hospital management sector, continuing disappointment with computer companies, product woes in the pharmaceutical industry. **********The reaction by institutional and public investors has been to dump the affected stocks without a backward glance. For example, last Monday the panic selling got around to the Warner-Lambert Company, as reports of limited problems with an anti-arthritic drug in France caused the stock to shed 10 percent of its value in a day. **********In the market's smaller issues - the so-called secondary stocks, in which individual investors account for more of the activity than they do in the institutionally dominated blue chips - the price erosion has been relentless, with many companies down 30 percent or more in the last 12 months. **********''There's instant emotionalism,'' said Robert J. Nurock, publisher of The Astute Investor in Paoli, Pa. ''With any bad news, investors now abandon ship right away because of fear that worse will come later.'' In polling his institutional clients, Mr. Nurock added, he found few who could cite reasons for the market to go up, a sign of their discouragement. Individual investors likewise seem to expect lower prices, according to several analysts. **********But some analysts say there is a silver lining to the clouds overhanging Wall Street. Such unrelenting gloom, they say, has in the past presaged market rallies. ''Sentiment, by many measures, is as pessimistic and dark as it was at the market bottom in 1982,'' observed Robert Prechter, publisher of the Elliott Wave Theorist, in Gainesville, Ga. **********The notion that such pessimism is encouraging -that investors' emotions often have them looking in the wrong direction at a market turning point - is amply buttressed by history. Bullishness among investors and their advisers has usually reached peaks around market tops, while extremely bearish sentiment tends to prevail near bottoms. In the latter case, bearish investors tend to step up their selling as their gloom deepens. When they have sold their stock, the influence of the buyers in the market takes over. **********Analysts who track market ''sentiment'' deal in such arcane technical indicators as short sales by small investors, trading in options and even the views of professional advisers. Even collectively, these indicators of investor moods are not perfect. No one can be sure just how much pessimism it takes to create a bottom. But when readings reach extreme levels that have marked turning points in the past, watchers of investor psychology take notice. And that, some of them say, has been happening recently. **********Of seven so-called sentiment indicators monitored by Value Line, a New York investment service, three have in recent weeks exceeded the bearish levels of August 1982, the eve of the bull market. **********Among those three indicators are sales of odd lots - less than 100 shares - which are assumed to be the province of unsophisticated small investors who cannot afford to trade in multiples of 100 shares. Odd-lot stock sales soared to 2.5 times the number of odd-lot purchases in early September, versus a 2.47 reading at the bottom in 1982. **********Meanwhile, purchases of put options - which give the holder the right to sell stock at a fixed price, and thus are a wager on lower quotes -reached a record level in relation to purchases of call options, which usually are bought by bulls and give the holder the right to buy stocks at fixed prices in the future. **********The third measure, the ''short interest'' - the total of New York Stock Exchange shares that have been sold short in anticipation of price declines -was well above its 1982 peak. Several other indicators were close to their August 1982 levels, including short selling by the public, Big Board specialists and other New York Stock Exchange member firms. **********''This is one of the blackest moods in modern times in the market,'' said John A. Mendelson, a senior vice president and director of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He pointed to the skimpy premiums on stock index futures, which is an indication that investors have little expectation the market will go up in the short term. **********Mr. Mendelson says that such pessimism has often been a reliable sign that the market may be approaching a turn. ''For every top and bottom we have numbers for, going back to the beginning of the century, each has been different in economic fundamentals, but the common denominator has been emotionalism,'' he said. **********But many experts are not convinced that sentiment indicators alone can call the market's tune. **********''You have to look at a broader range of indicators to get a projection of the market,'' said Richard Peterson, a Value Line editor. The outlook for the economy, the amount of mutual fund cash on hand, returns available from competing investments - all these factors could influence stock prices. But Mr. Peterson described investor psychology as ''obviously a factor to consider.'' At least in the short run, the market's course may depend as much on investors' perceptions - and on their hopes and fears - as on real developments in the economy and in companies' business prospects. **********Market Vane, an investor service based in Pasadena, Calif., measures one brand of sentiment by polling advisers in the futures market, then giving their answers a weighting depending on both the intensity of the adviser's opinion and the number of his clients. (And thus, presumably, the adviser's influence on market activity.) This produces a number that Market Vane calls the ''bullish consensus.'' THE lowest bullish consensus on record is 19 percent, set in August 1982, according to Market Vane's associate editor, Peter Hackstedde. On Sept. 17 of this year, that figure stood at 23 percent. ''So far, that's been the bottom of the market,'' Mr. Hackstedde observed. ''We've had 23 percent only four times, and each time we've had an outrageous rally off it. Usually, it's marked some kind of low.'' Conversely, the bullish consensus is often at about 80 percent at market tops, he said. **********Another service, Investors Intelligence, in Larchmont, N.Y., focuses on writers of stock market letters. A week ago, of the 135 letters that the firm follows, 34.8 percent were bullish, 38.1 percent were bearish, and 27.1 percent were looking for a market correction. ''That was the first time since August 1984 that we had more bears than bulls,'' said Michael Burke, editor of Investors Intelligence. By itself, however, that might not be a signal to run out and buy stocks. Mr. Burke noted that in 1984, bears held the edge for 19 weeks before an explosive rally occurred in August. **********But the Elliott Wave Theorist's Mr. Prechter, who sees the public buying a lot of puts and selling stocks short, has urged his clients for the first time in nine months to commit any fresh cash to stocks. Signs of ''tremendous pessimism'' about the market abound in his own business as an investment adviser. ''It's been close to a depression for market letter writers and for brokers as well,'' he said. **********Is he frightened about the market? ''Oh, absolutely,'' he said. ''The past couple of weeks I've had trouble sleeping. I've gotten tons of letters saying I'm all wrong, it's the start of a bear market, the crash of '29 all over again. You never get that at tops.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/14/business/business-people-an-andersen-partner-is-moving-to-beatrice.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  An Andersen Partner Is Moving to Beatrice", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   An Andersen Partner Is Moving to Beatrice", "body_text": " **********In the latest in a string of executive changes since its merger with Esmark Inc. last summer, the Beatrice Companies has named David E.

The new Midcon-United company - which, with 30,000 miles of pipelines, will form one of the nation's largest gas pipeline concerns - is expected to command greater power in negotiating both supply and sales contracts. **********This is crucial in the pipeline business, which is unique in the transportation industry, since gas pipeline companies not only move a commodity, but actually purchase it at one end, and sell it at the other. **********Gaggle of Lawsuits **********But if Midcon, with its $41-a-share bid for United, is betting on a trend that its competitors have also bet on, it also faces unusual risks in its bid, since United Energy is in the midst of a gaggle of lawsuits. **********The lawsuits stem from United Energy's cancellation of gas supply contracts dating from the early 1970's: The contracts required United to deliver gas to industrial and utility customers at prices substantially below cost. **********While some analysts have estimated that the suits could cost United up to $600 million in damages, others argue that the lawsuits - most of which are still pending - do not threaten the company's financial health. **********Don C. Bustos, a vice president at Duff & Phelps, a Chicago brokerage, said: ''Yes, the suits certainly affect the asking price. It would have been about $45 to $47 if they didn't exist. But the damage these suits can cause has been greatly exaggerated. United is very strong financially.'' **********And Patricia Wees, a Midcon spokesman, said the Lombard, Ill.-based company ''looked at the risks involved and we felt they were manageable.'' **********Market Expansion **********The proposed United acquisition would greatly expand both Midcon's gas supplies and its markets. Midcon now serves 12 states, mainly in the Great Plains and the Middle West. The Midcon-United combination, which both boards approved over the weekend, would create a network stretching over 14 states from the Great Plains to the Middle West, and from Texas to Florida. **********Analysts said that the new entity -with about $6 billion in assets and $7 billion in annual revenues - would be better able to withstand price squeezes from producers: it could risk bargaining harder against producers seeking higher prices for gas. **********Thus the new Midcon ''would be able to absorb more risk in one geographic area because of the diversity of their supply and customer base and geographic spread,'' said Mr. Bustos, who added: ''They'll be able to move gas anywhere and it'll always be through their system. So, they'll always be making a profit, not paying somebody else's profit margin.'' **********J. Hugh Roff, the 54-year-old chairman and chief executive of United Energy, said he and O. C. Davis, Midcon's 65-year-old chief executive and president, had discussed a merger ''in a very general, conceptual way'' months ago at a meeting of the American Gas Association. **********''We were really talking about the industry, and we agreed there were some interesting possibilities between our two outfits,'' Mr. Roff said, referring to the steady march of restructuring among pipeline companies in recent months. ''But it was no more than an agreement to keep in touch.'' **********Mr. Roff said the ''hard negotiating'' really only began last week and moved into high gear by week's end. **********'Good, Fair Price' **********''It is a good, fair price for our shareholders,'' he said, ''and we think it offers United the chance to participate in a large strong pipeline system with good marketing access.'' **********Under the agreement, Mr. Roff will continue to head United Energy and become vice chairman of Midcon. In addition, the merger also calls for United Energy's two vice chairmen, John S. Davis, and Stephen A. Wakefield, to become executive vice presidents of Midcon, and for the Midcon board to include three members chosen by United Energy and to expand from 12 to 17. **********United Energy issues closed at $39.75, up $3.75, on the the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Midcon shares closed at $43, down $1. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Bustos, the Duff & Phelps analyst, said that the United Energy acquisition ''would really increase Midcon's long-term earnings growth potential because this is a very good deal.'' **********He continued: ''There may be some additional weakness in the stock price, but that will disappear in several weeks.''

Geological studies of Mount St. Helens have shown that it experienced four large eruptions between 1480 and 1482. **********The specialists spoke before a possible new eruption in Colombia was reported yesterday. **********Part of the difficulty in diagnosing the situation at Nevado del Ruiz has been the damage its eruption did to the network of seismographs, or earthquake detectors, emplaced around the volcano in the weeks immediately before the eruption. Several of them have become silent either because they were destroyed or because their communication links were interrupted. **********Monitoring Warning Signs **********On Mount St. Helens, such devices have enabled geologists to monitor the ''harmonic tremor'' that indicates upward movement of molten rock or magma into the volcano as a prelude to further eruptions. **********The specialists there and at Kilauea, a volcano crater in Hawaii that is one of the world's most active, have been further aided by tilt meters on the volcanoes' flanks, as well as by laser-based measurers of distance that show when the volcanoes begin to swell. **********Dr. Richard P.

PLANS A 5.6% PRICE CUT FOR LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE JUNE 1", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said today that it planned to reduce the price of its long-distance telephone service by 5.6 percent on June 1. **********That is when residences will begin seeing a new special charge of $1 a month on bills from their local phone companies. **********The 5.6 percent price cut, if approved by the Federal Communications Commission as expected, would be for all calls in the United States and would be the second cut of similar size in a year. **********It would affect the price not only of A.T.&T.'s regular long-distance service but also of the WATS and 800-number services. WATS, or wide area telephone service, lets companies call distant numbers for a flat hourly fee, and the ''800'' lines are paid for by companies so people can dial them without paying long-distance fees. **********Customers will not share equally in the estimated saving of $1.1 billion a year, industry experts said. **********Companies Will Benefit Most **********The biggest benefit is likely to come at large corporations because they use long distance a lot. Some consumers could break even after paying the new $1-a-month charge, but those who make few long-distance calls may end up with higher monthly bills. **********''If the caller makes an average number of calls, it will be a wash,'' said Wendell E. Lind, a spokesman for A.T.&T. Communications, the company's long-distance division. ''But if a person makes no calls, he obviously would pay more.'' **********The cuts are expected to put further pressure on A.T.&T.'s competitors, which have encountered aggressive marketing by A.T.&T. **********The competitors have been reporting losses, laying off workers and clamping down on costs, but communications specialists say their outlook is dim. The competitors have about 15 percent of the long-distance market, against A.T.&T.'s 85 percent. **********The price cuts are the latest attempt in a concerted effort by A.T.&T. to maintain its dominance in long-distance service. **********Since last summer the company has reduced rates, has started product promotions for customers who choose it as their primary long-distance carrier and has run uncharacteristically hard-hitting advertisements. Today it reported a 55.9 percent jump in the latest quarter's earnings, to $354 million, or 31 cents a share. **********A separate set of price cuts of as much as 6.6 percent is being sought for international calls, A.T.&T. said. At a news conference here before the company's 100th annual meeting, Charles L. Brown, the chairman and chief executive officer, said the company was trying to lower its prices because A.T.&T. would soon be enjoying lower access charges from local telephone companies. They will be required to reduce these rates, which are what they charge long-distance companies for connecting them to the phones of local customers. **********Savings on Typical Calls **********''We will be passing along to our customers any savings we get from paying lower access charges,'' Mr. Brown said. **********A.T.&T. released a schedule showing how the price of typical calls would drop. A five-minute daytime New York-to-Chicago call, for instance, which currently costs $2.18, would be $2.07 under the proposal. A Chicago-to-Los Angeles call would drop to $2.12, from $2.24. **********Internationally, the price of a five- minute morning call from any point in the United States to London would fall to $6.45, from $6.67, while a call to Paris would drop to $7.05, from $7.23. **********A.T.&T. seems to have nothing to lose and everything to gain from its proposal, according to analysts. Its estimated $1.1 billion in price cuts should be offset by lower fees paid to the local telephone companies. At the same time, lower prices should increase demand for A.T.&T.'s service, with higher profits as a result. **********''I don't know what the final effect will be, but the key is how elastic that demand is,'' said Virginia A. Dwyer, A.T.&T.'s senior vice president for finance. **********Impact on Competitors **********For the competitors of A.T.&T., today's announcement was interpreted by analysts as bad news. **********To remain competitive with A.T.&T., analysts said, companies such as the MCI Communications Corporation, the GTE Corporation's Sprint unit and Allnet Communications Services Inc. might also have to cut rates to maintain their price advantage. They are already grappling with other price cuts by A.T.&T. Last June it reduced long-distance charges by 6 percent, and it has introduced promotions such as giveaways. **********Although the competitors' costs are also expected to fall June 1, the cost reductions will not be as big for them as they are for A.T.&T. The result could be a squeeze on the competitors' profits, which are already being crimped. **********''They are just not in a position to give up margin,'' said Robert Morris 3d, an analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc., a Wall Street brokerage house. ''It will make it very difficult for them to maintain the price differential they have had over A.T.&T.'' **********The competitors reacted to the news calmly. **********At MCI, Gary Towbin, a spokesman, said his company was still studying the A.T.&T. proposal. In any case, he added, MCI's customers benefit from discounts on heavy use that would lessen the impact of A.T.&T.'s price cut. **********At Sprint, a spokesman said he did not yet know how the company would respond. **********And at Allnet, Stephen J. Ingish, a spokesman, said, ''Our plans are to restructure our rates and remain competitive.'' **********At the annual meeting of A.T.&T. today, the company released its latest financial results. As Wall Street analysts had expected, A.T.&T earned $354 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, up 55.9 percent from $227 million, or 20 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1984. Revenues rose to $8.3 billion, from $8.1 billion. Last year's results were depressed because A.T.&T. had just divested itself of its 22 Bell operating companies. Most analysts, therefore, do not consider the huge percentage rise in earnings to be noteworthy. **********Nearly 2,000 shareholders attended today's annual meeting. **********The company's big call-switching computers, which had been set up at past annual meetings for shareholders to watch in action, were nowhere to be seen today.

The opposition has called the Chancellor's team ''amateurish'' and ''dilettantish.'' **********More Revelations Expected **********There continue to be reports about East German agents in West German Government agencies. Bild, a tabloid newspaper, today played up speculation about a spy in the Chancellor's office and it seems likely that more revelations will be trickling out. **********Moreover, the image of a Government buffeted by scandal will be driven home by the corruption trial of Otto Lambsdorff, the former Minister for Economics Affairs, which opens here on Thursday. A senior figure in the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in the governing coalition, Count Lambsdorff stands accused of accepting bribes from the Flick holding company, and the trial is likely to last for a year. **********The weekly Der Spiegel has lately added fuel to the fires crackling around the coalition with disclosures about political payoffs by the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. **********Less Trust in Institutions **********The scandals may have accentuated what Bodo Hombach, a Social Democratic strategist, believes is a new volatility in the West German electorate, which has traditionally been slow to change loyalties. **********''The belief in institutions has been shaken,'' said Mr. Hombach, who crafted his party's triumph last May in North Rhine-Westphalia. ''People are now asking which man will help, not which organization or institution should they elect.'' **********Johannes Rau, the Social Democrats' victor in North Rhine-Westphalia, seems likely to be designated his party's standard-bearer for 1987 and to apply some of Mr. Hombach's insights in running an American-style, personality-oriented campaign. While the Social Democrats apparently face an uphill fight, it is widely agreed that Mr. Kohl's weaknesses give them a long shot at victory that seemed unthinkable a year ago. **********Mr. Kohl has so far allowed his Interior Minister, Friedrich Zimmermann, who is responsible for the internal security agency, to carry the political weight of the scandal. A subtle internal party rivalry appears to be at work here, since Mr. Zimmermann, who in May made some scathing public remarks about the Chancellor's decision-making capacities, represents Franz Josef Strauss's Bavarian Christian Democrats. **********Mr. Strauss and Mr. Kohl are on-and-off foes, so the Chancellor may to a certain point savor the Interior Minister's discomfort. Yet, according to sources close to the Chancellor, he has no intention of sacrificing Mr. Zimmermann, a move that might oblige him to shuffle the Cabinet; by protecting the minister, Mr. Kohl will make him indebted to him. East German Ties Unaffected So far West and East Germany have shown signs of wanting to prevent the spy scandal from poisoning their relations. The East German press has avoided exulting over the defection of Hans Joachim Tiedge, the internal security officer. **********''The East Germans have no interest in playing this up,'' said Hartmut Zimmermann, a West Berlin academic authority on East Germany. ''There are still people over there who have an interest in a visit by Honecker to Bonn.'' **********Erich Honecker, the East German leader, is scheduled to open the Leipzig fair in a few days, and Mr. Strauss, who is the Premier of Bavaria, is slated to meet with him there. Friedhelm Ost, the West German Government spokesman, said today that Mr. Kohl had no objections to the meeting. **********Later next month Willy Brandt, the Social Democrats' chairman, is also expected to meet with Mr. Honecker. It will be Mr. Brandt's first visit to East Germany since 1974, when the discovery of an East German spy in his office forced him to resign as Chancellor. More Damage to Alliance Seen Western diplomats believe that the espionage scandal may cause more damage to West Germany's ties with its allies, particularly the United States, than with East Germany. **********The allies have always regarded West Germany as something of a security risk, a reputation confirmed in 1974. This image will now be reinforced at a moment when the United States' plans for a space-based defense system have raised the issue of the transfer of advanced American technology to West Germany and other allies. **********Next week, Horst Teltschik, the Chancellor's security adviser, will go to Washington to discuss space weapons.

It is an honor to be with you on this day. **********We mark today the anniversary of the liberation of Europe from tyrants who had seized this continent and plunged it into a terrible war. **********Forty years ago today the guns were stilled and peace began - a peace that has become the longest of this century. **********On this day 40 years ago they swarmed onto the boulevards of Paris, rallied under the Arc de Triomphe, and sang the ''Marseillaise'' in the - they went out there in open and free air. **********And now, on this day 40 years ago, Winston Churchill walked out onto a balcony in Whitehall and said to the people of Britain, ''This is your victory'' - and the crowd yelled back, in an unforgettable moment of love and gratitude, ''No - it is yours.'' **********Londoners tore the blackout curtains from their windows, put floodlights on the great symbols of English history. And for the first time in nearly six years Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and St. Paul's Cathedral were illuminated against the sky. **********Across the ocean, a half a million New Yorkers flooded Times Square and laughed and posed for the cameras. In Washington, our new President, Harry Truman, called reporters into his office and said, ''The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.'' **********'I Felt a Chill' **********On that day 40 years ago, I was at my post at an Army Air Corps installation in Culver City, Calif. Passing a radio I heard the words, ''Ladies and gentlemen, the war in Europe is over.'' **********I felt a chill, as if a gust of cold wind had just swept past, and - even though, for America, there was still a war on the Pacific front - I realized: I would never forget that moment. **********This day can't help but be emotional, for in it we feel the long tug of memory. We are reminded of shared joy and shared pain. A few weeks ago in California an old soldier with tears in his eyes said: ''It was such a different world then. It's almost impossible to describe it to someone who wasn't there, but when they finally turned the lights on in the cities again it was like being reborn.'' **********If it is hard to communicate the happiness of those days, it is even harder to communicate to those who did not share it, the depth of Europe's agony. **********The common men and women who somehow dug greatness from within their souls - the people who sang to the children during the blitz, who joined the resistance and said ''no'' to tyranny, the people who had the courage, who had the courage to hide and save the Jews and the dissidents. The people who became, for a moment, the repositories of all the courage of the West - from a child named Anne Frank to a hero named Raoul Wallenberg. These names shine. They give us heart forever. **********The War's Aftermath **********The glow of their memories lit Europe in her darkest days. Who can forget the hard days after the war? We can't help but look back and think: life was so vivid then. There was the sense of purpose, the joy of shared effort, and, later, the impossible joy of our triumph. **********Those were the days when the West rolled up its sleeves and repaired the damage that had been done, the days when Europe rose in glory from the ruins. **********Old enemies were reconciled with the European family. Together, America and Western Europe created and put into place the Marshall Plan to rebuild from the rubble. And together we created an Atlantic alliance, which proceeded not from transient interests of state but from shared ideals. **********Together we created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a partnership aimed at seeing that the kind of tyrants that had tormented Europe would never torment her again. NATO was a triumph of organization and effort, but it was also something very new and very different. **********For NATO derived its strength directly from the moral values of the people it represented, from their high ideals, their love of liberty and their commitment to peace. But perhaps the greatest triumph of all was not in the realm of a sound defense or material achievement. **********The Choice: Freedom **********No, the greatest triumph after the war is that in spite of all the chaos, poverty, sickness and misfortune that plagued this continent, the people of Western Europe resisted the call of new tyrants and the lure of their seductive ideologies. Your nations did not become the breeding ground for new extremist philosophies. You resisted the totalitarian temptation. Your people embraced democracy, the dream the fascists could not kill. They chose freedom. Today we celebrate the leaders who led the way - Churchill and Monnet, Adenauer and Schuman, de Gasperi and Spaak, Truman and Marshall. **********And we celebrate, too, the free political parties that contributed their share of greatness: the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats and Labor and the Conservatives. Together they tugged at the same oar, and the great and mighty ship of Europe moved on. **********I am here to tell you America remains, as she was 40 years ago, dedicated to the unity of Europe. We continue to see a strong and unified Europe not as a rival but an even stronger partner. Indeed, John F. Kennedy, in his ringing ''declaration of interdependence'' in the freedom bell city of Philadelphia 23 years ago, explicitly made this objective a key tenet of postwar American policy. **********That policy saw the new world and the old as twin pillars of a larger democratic community. We Americans still see European unity as a vital force in that historic process. We favor the expansion of the European community. We welcome the entrance of Spain and Portugal into that community, for their presence makes for a stronger Europe, and a stronger Europe is a stronger West. **********Yet despite Europe's economic miracle, which brought so much prosperity to so many, despite the visionary ideas of the European leaders, despite the enlargement of democracy's frontiers within the European community itself, I am told that a more doubting mood is upon Europe today. **********'Europessimism' **********I hear words like ''Europessimism'' and ''Europaralysis.'' I am told that Europe seems to have lost the sense of confidence that dominated that post-war era. Well, if there is something of a ''lost'' quality these days, is it connected to the fact that some, in the past few years, have begun to question the ideals and philosophies that have guided the West for centuries? That some have even come to question the moral and intellectual worth of the West? **********I wish to speak, in part, to that questioning today. And there is no better place to do it than Strasbourg - where Goethe studied, where Pasteur taught, where Hugo knew inspiration. This has been a lucky city for questioning and finding valid answers. **********We in the West have much to be thankful for - peace, prosperity, and freedom. If we're to preserve these for our children, and for theirs, today's leaders must demonstrate the same resolve and sense of vision which inspired Churchill, Adenauer, de Gasperi, and Schuman. **********Their challenge was to rebuild a democratic Europe under the shadow of Soviet power. Our task, in some ways even more daunting, is to keep the peace with an ever more powerful Soviet Union, to introduce greater stability in our relationship with it, and to live together in a world in which our values can prosper. **********The leaders and people of postwar Europe had learned the lessons of their history from the failures of their predecessors. They learned that aggression feeds on appeasement and that weakness itself can be provocative. **********We, for our part, can learn from the success of our predecessors. We know that both conflict and aggression can be deterred, that democratic nations are capable of the resolve, the sacrifices, and the consistency of policy needed to sustain such deterrence. From the creation of NATO in 1949 through the early 1970's, Soviet agression was effectively deterred. **********On Soviet Conduct **********The strength of Western economies, the vitality of our societies, the wisdom of our diplomacy, all contributed to Soviet restraint. But certainly the decisive factor must have been the countervailing power - ultimately, military, and, above all, nuclear power - which the West was capable of bringing to bear in the defense of its interests. It was in the early 1970's that the United States lost that superiority over the Soviet Union in strategic nuclear weapons which had characterized the postwar era. **********In Europe, the effect of this loss was not quickly perceptible. But, seen globally, Soviet conduct changed markedly and dangerously. First in Angola in 1975, then, when the West failed to respond, in Ethiopia, in South Yemen, in Kampuchea, and ultimately in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union began courting more risks, and expanding its influence - expanding its influence through the indirect and direct application of military power. **********Today we see similar Soviet efforts to profit from and stimulate regional conflicts in Central America. [Boos and shouts from the audience.]  They haven't been there, I have. **********The ineffectual Western response to Soviet adventurism of the late 1970's had many roots, not least the crisis of self-confidence within the American body politic wrought by the Vietnam experience. **********But just as Soviet decision-making in the earlier postwar era had taken place against a background of overwhelming American strategic power, so the decisions of the late 70's were taken in Moscow, as in Washington and throughout Europe, against a background of growing Soviet and stagnating Western nuclear strength. One might draw the conclusion from these events that the West should reassert that nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union upon which our security and our strategy rested through the postwar era. **********That is not my view. We cannot and should not seek to build our peace and freedom perpetually upon the basis of expanding nuclear arsenals. In the short run, we have no alternative but to compete with the Soviet Union in this, in this field, not in the pursuit of superiority, but merely of balance. It is thus essential that the United States maintain a modern and survivable nuclear capability in each leg of the strategic triad - sea, land and air-based. **********It is similarly important that France and Britain maintain and modernize their independent strategic capabilities. **********The Soviet Union, however, does not share our view of what constitutes a stable nuclear balance. It has chosen, instead, to build nuclear forces clearly designed to strike first, and thus disarm their adversary. The Soviet Union is now moving toward deployment of new mobile Mirved missiles which have these capabilities, plus the potential to avoid detection, monitoring, or arms control verification. **********Soviet Is Accused **********In doing this, the Soviet Union is undermining stability and the basis for mutual deterrence. One can imagine several possible responses to the continued Soviet build-up of nuclear forces. On the one hand, we can ask the Soviet Union to reduce its offensive systems through equitable, verifiable arms control measures. We are pressing that case in Geneva. **********Thus far, however, we've heard nothing new from the other side. A second possibility would be for the West to step up our current modernization effort to keep up with constantly accelerating Soviet deployments, not to regain superiority, but merely to keep up with Soviet deployments. **********But is this really an acceptable alternative? Even if this course could be sustained by the West, it would produce a less stable strategic balance than the one we have today. Must we accept an endless process of nuclear arms competition? I don't think so. We need a better guarantee of peace than that. And fortunately, there is a third possibility. It is to offset the continued Soviet offensive buildup in destabilizing weapons by developing defenses against these weapons. **********In 1983 I launched a new research program - the Strategic Defense Initiative. The state of modern technology may soon make possible for the first time the ability to use nonnuclear systems to defeat ballistic missiles. **********The Soviets themselves have long recognized the value of defensive systems and have invested heavily in them. Indeed, they have spent as much on defensive systems as they have on offensive systems for more than 20 years. **********Now, this research program will take time. As we proceed with it, we will remain within existing treaty constraints. We will also consult in the closest possible fashion with our allies. **********And when the time for decisions on the possible production and deployment of such systems comes, we must and will discuss and negotiate these issues with the Soviet Union. Both for the short and long term, I am confident that the West can maintain effective military deterrence. **********More Than a Truce **********But surely we can aspire to more than maintaining a state of highly armed truce in international politics. During the 1970's we went to great lengths to restrain unilaterally our strategic weapons programs out of the conviction that the Soviet Union would adhere to certain rules in its conduct - rules such as neither side seeking to gain unilateral advantage at the expense of the other. **********Those efforts of the early 1970's resulted in some improvements in Europe, the Berlin Quadripartite Agreement being the best example. But the hopes for a broader and lasting moderation of the East-West competition foundered in Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Nicaragua. **********The question before us today is whether we have learned - have we learned from those mistakes and can undertake a stable and peaceful relationship with the Soviet Union based upon effective deterrence and the reduction of tensions? I believe we can. I believe we have learned that fruitful cooperation with the Soviet Union must be accompanied by successful competition in areas - particularly third world areas - where the Soviets are not yet prepared to act with restraint. [Some members of the audience walked out at this point.]  You know, I've learned something useful. Maybe if I talk long enough in my own Congress, some of those will walk out. **********Policy Toward Moscow **********Let me talk about the reflections which have molded our policy toward the Soviet Union. That policy embodies the following basic elements: *********** While we maintain deterrence to preserve the peace, the United States will make a steady, sustained effort to reduce tensions and solve problems in its relations with the Soviet Union. *********** The United States is prepared to conclude fair, equitable, verifiable agreements for arms reduction, above all with regard to offensive nuclear weapons. *********** The United States will insist upon compliance with past agreements both for their own sake and to strengthen confidence in the possibility of future accords. *********** The United States seeks no unilateral advantages, and, of course, can accept none on the Soviet side. *********** The United States will proceed in full consultation with its allies, recognizing that our fates are intertwined and we must act in unity. *********** The United States does not seek to undermine or change the Soviet system nor to impinge upon the security of the Soviet Union. At the same time it will resist attempts by the Soviet Union to use or threaten force against others, or to impose its system on others by force. **********Ultimately, I hope the leaders of the Soviet Union will come to understand that they have nothing to gain from attempts to achieve military superiority or to spread their dominance by force, but have much to gain from joining the West in mututal arms reduction and expanding cooperation. **********I have directed the Secretary of State to engage with the Soviet Union on an extended agenda of problem solving. **********Yet even as we embark upon new efforts to sustain a productive dialogue with the Soviet Union, we are reminded of the obstacles posed by our so fundamentally different concepts of humanity, of human rights, of the value of a human life. **********The murder of Major Nicholson by a Soviet soldier in East Germany, and the Soviet Union's refusal to accept responsiblity for this act, is only the latest reminder. **********If we are to succeed in reducing East-West tensions, we must find a means to insure against the arbitrary use of lethal force in the future -whether against individuals like Major Nicholson, or against groups, such as the passengers on a jumbo jet. It is for that reason that I would like to outline for you today what I believe would be a useful way to proceed. **********'Four Practical Steps' **********I propose that the United States and the Soviet Union take four practical steps. **********First, that our two countries make a regular practice of exchanging military observers at military exercises and locations. We now follow this practice with many other nations, to the equal benefit of all parties. **********Second, as I believe it is desirable for the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union to meet and tackle problems, I am also convinced that the military leaders of our nations could benefit from more contact. I therefore propose that we institute regular, high-level contacts between Soviet and American military leaders, to develop better understanding and to prevent potential tragedies from occurring. **********Third, I urge that the Conference on Disarmament in Europe act promptly and agree on the concrete confidence-building measures proposed by the NATO countries. The United States is prepared to discuss the Soviet proposal on nonuse of force in the context of Soviet agreement to concrete confidence-building measures. **********Fourth, I believe a permanent military-to-military communications link could serve a useful purpose in this important area of our relationship. It could be the channel for exchanging notifications and other information regarding routine military activities, thereby reducing the chances of misunderstanding and misinterpretation. And over time, it might evolve into a ''risk reduction'' mechanism for rapid communication and exchange of data in times of crisis. **********These proposals are not cure-alls for our current problems. They will not compensate for the deaths which have occurred. But as terrible as past events have been, it would be more tragic if we were to make no attempt to prevent even larger tragedies from occurring through lack of contact and communication. **********'Much to Do' **********We in the West have much to do -and we must do it together. We must remain unified in the face of attempts to divide us and strong in spite of attempts to weaken us. And we must remember that our unity and strength are not a mere impulse of like-minded allies, but the natural result of our shared love for liberty. **********Surely we have no illusions that convergence of the Communist system and the free societies of the West is likely. We are in for an extended period of competition of ideas. **********It is up to us in the West to answer whether or not we will make available the resources, ideas and assistance necessary to compete with the Soviet Union in the third world. We have much in our favor, not least the experience of those states which have tried Marxism and are looking for an alternative. **********We do not aspire to impose our system on anyone, nor do we have pat answers for all the world's ills. But our ideals of freedom and democracy - [Boos and shouts.]  Is there an echo in here? **********Our ideals of freedom and democracy and our economic systems have proven their ability to meet the needs of our people. Our adversaries can offer their people only economic stagnation and the corrupt hand of a state and party bureaucracy which ultimately satisfy neither material nor spiritual needs. **********Freedom and Peace **********I want to reaffirm to the people of Europe the constancy of the American purpose. We were at your side through two great wars. We have been at your side through 40 years of a sometimes painful peace. We are at your side today because, like you, we have not veered from the ideals of the West - the ideals of freedom, liberty and peace. **********Here in Western Europe, you have created a multinational democratic community in which there is a free flow of people, of information, of goods and of culture. West Europeans move freely in all directions, sharing and partaking of each other's ideas and culture. **********It is my hope that in the 21st century - which is only 15 years away -all Europeans, from Moscow to Lisbon, will be able to travel without a passport and the free flow of people and ideas would include the other half of Europe. **********You are, today, a new Europe on the brink of a new century - a democratic community with much to be proud of. We have much to do. The work ahead is not unlike the building of a great cathedral. The work is slow, complicated, and painstaking. **********It is passed on with pride from generation to generation. It's the work not only of leaders but of ordinary people. The cathedral evolves as it is created, with each generation adding its own vision - but the initial ideal remains constant, and the faith that drives the vision persists. **********The results may be slow to see, but our children and their children will trace in the air the emerging arches and spires and know the faith and dedication and love that produced them. **********'The Cathedral' **********My friends, Europe is the cathedral, and it is illuminated still. **********And if you doubt your will, and your spirit, and your strength to stand for something, think of those people 40 years ago - who wept in the rubble, who laughed in the streets, who paraded across Europe, who cheered Churchill with love and devotion, who sang the ''Marseillaise'' down the boulevards. **********Spirit like that does not disappear, it cannot perish. It will not go. There's too much left unsung within it. **********I would like to just conclude with one line if I could, and say we've seen evidence here of your faith in democracy, in the ability of some to speak up freely as they preferred to speak, and yet I can't help but remind all of us that some who take advantage of that right of democracy seem unaware that if the government that they would advocate became reality, no one would have that freedom to speak up again. **********Thank you. Thank you all for your graciousness on this great day. Thank you and God bless you all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/18/business/zellerbach-in-talks-with-james-river.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zellerbach in Talks With James River", "print_headline": "Zellerbach in Talks With James River", "body_text": " **********The Crown Zellerbach Corporation said today that it was discussing possible transactions with the James River Corporation, another big paper concern. **********Spokesmen for both companies declined to elaborate, but analysts said that James River, based in Richmond, was probably considering buying Zellerbach's tissue paper operations. **********''James River is already big in tissue in the East, Crown has the commanding market share in the West,'' said John Maack Jr., an analyst with S.G.

Jaramillo juts out of a rolling grass field here that merges into the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It was under this field that Mr. Jaramillo was buried in a 1936 mining accident. The stone and its epitaph - ''a faithfull employee who died in the performance of his duty'' - are among the few reminders that coal mining once dominated this area. **********Across the field and a four-lane highway lies another monument of sorts: the sprawling, brown complex of the Storage Technology Corporation. With its spectacular growth in the 1970's and early 1980's, Storagetek exemplified the prominence of the high-technology industry in Colorado. Now the Storagetek plant, which produces data storage devices, symbolizes the problems plaguing that industry. Once, nearly 9,000 workers streamed through the plant daily. Today, the number is 4,100. **********Colorado's high-tech companies have gone through a dramatic boom-and-bust cycle over the last 15 years. Towns in the Boulder Valley - Louisville, Boulder and Longmont - as well as both Denver and Colorado Springs have attracted so many high-tech companies that the area has been dubbed ''the Silicon Mountain.'' Big companies such as Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard have operations in the state, as do scores of companies still in the entrepreneurial stage. A survey conducted by Colorado University found that 30 percent of the state's high-tech companies are less than five years old and 90 percent have sales of less than $10 million. **********But big or small, a surprising number of companies have fallen victim to the hard times that have also hit electronics companies in the more famous Silicon Valley. High tech in Colorado has experienced a string of failures - ranging in size from Storagetek's highly publicized plunge into Chapter 11 last October to the closing of Ed Owens's Microseconds used-computer store on 28th Street in Boulder. And although the area's growing space-technology industry has eased the pain, it is no cure-all. Colorado has lost at least 6,625 high-tech jobs since September, about 9 percent of its estimated high-technology work force. **********The Boulder Valley, which has the heaviest concentration of computer-products companies and which is the home of Storagetek and the Miniscribe Corporation, has taken most of those losses. ''The feeling is that we're suffering a mini-recession from the layoffs,'' says Philip Stern, a Boulder city councilman. Along the Boulder Mall, a retail strip that attracts tourists and students from nearby Colorado University, office space goes begging. Small businesses are ''pulling in their horns,'' said Steve Bosley, president of the Bank of Boulder. The publicity surrounding high tech's problems, he says, has caused uncertainty among all of the local businessmen. ''What I see is not so much a small company saying 'my business is down,' '' he said. Instead, he hears '' 'I'm not going to take on that new line,' 'I'm not going to take on the extra square footage,' 'I'm not going to hire the employee,' 'I'm not going to buy the computer.' '' **********High tech's layoffs have come so rapidly that some workers have been hit more than once. Jimi Stark, a computer assembler, recalls her boss at the Otrona Advanced Systems Corporation, a Boulder portable-computer company, calling a meeting one morning in October and telling 175 employees that the company could not raise additional money and that it was closing its doors that afternoon. ''People drove their fists into file cabinets, and cursed and screamed,'' she said. **********In March, Mrs. Stark found a job at N.B.I. Inc., an office automation company, but was temporarily laid off in a month. Today she is back at N.B.I., but ''it's almost like you don't want to get involved'' with extra insurance programs or with working toward promotion, she said, ''because you may not be there long enough to realize any benefits.'' **********About half of the area's high-tech layoffs came last fall at Storagetek and at Miniscribe, which also makes data storage devices. More bad news has been trickling in. In May, Miniscribe reported a first-quarter loss of $12.5 million. The same month, Denelcor Inc., a Denver-based supercomputer maker, announced that its chief executive had quit and that its survival depended on persuading investors to pump in more cash or on finding a merger candidate. May was also the month that the Mostek Corporation closed its Colorado Springs semiconductor memory plant, idling 400 people. **********June has not been much better. In the middle of the month, Storagetek laid off 500 more people. Last week, Amcodyne Inc., a Longmont data storage company, laid off 30 of 150 employees. And this week, employees of the Hewlett-Packard Company will be getting a longer July 4 holiday than they bargained for: Across the nation, many of the company's high-tech plants, including its four facilities in Colorado, will shut down for five days. **********Still, the cracks in Colorado's Silicon Mountain have done little to dim the state's enthusiasm for high tech. In a region grown used to booms and busts in mining and energy, electronics is being accepted as just another cyclical industry. Difficulties are viewed less as a regional quirk than as an extension of problems with intense competition showing up everywhere from Boston's Route 128 to California's Silicon Valley. E LECTRONICS companies first came to Colorado in the late 1950's and mid-1960's with the establishment of large manufacturing divisions by Hewlett-Packard and by the International Business Machines Corporation. But soon after Jesse Aweida and three other engineers left I.B.M.'s Boulder plant to form Storagetek in 1969, entrepreneurship spread like a brushfire. **********Even now, says Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, high tech is so popular with communities that even low-tech companies looking to settle here sometimes take on a high-tech aura. ''Anheuser-Busch is opening up a high-tech brewery'' in Fort Collins, north of Boulder, he joked. **********And Mr. Lamm says that the recent problems won't keep him from trying to lure more high-tech projects to the state. He is supporting a bill before the Colorado legislature that would appropriate $3 million to buy land for the Department of Energy's proposed ''superconducting supercollider particle accelerator,'' a huge physics research project that has also caught the attention of Texas and Illinois. ''It's a crapshoot,'' Mr. Lamm says of such competition. Of high tech in general, he adds: ''We knew there would be ups and downs. Failure is as American as apple pie. If you're going to have brilliant successes, you're going to have great failures.'' **********That willingness to accept the riskiness of the high-tech industry stems somewhat from the fact that Colorado's economy over all is still growing. The loss of about 5,000 computer industry jobs in 1984 was absorbed in an overall net gain of some 12,000 manufacturing jobs, many in Colorado's burgeoning military-aerospace industry. **********To the south, for example, companies in Colorado Springs are looking toward the Reagan Administration's ''Star Wars'' program. A $1.4 billion Air Force space command complex - the Consolidated Space Operations Center - is rising from the prairie east of Colorado Springs, and a flock of aerospace-industrial parks has cropped up nearby. **********The high-tech cutback ''has not had an impact,'' says retired Air Force General Jim Hill, president of the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce, ''if you look at the economy of Colorado Springs over all.'' In the early 1970's, the area's economy depended heavily on the Air Force Academy, the Army's Fort Carson and tourist visits to nearby Pike's Peak. Then three enterprising developers - armed with six-packs of Coors beer, made in Golden, Colo., and a slide show of the area's attractive scenery and other lures, such as cheap land and electricity and plentiful labor - set about selling the area to private industry. The result was an influx of more than a hundred high-tech and aerospace companies, including divisions of big-name operations: Ford Aerospace and Communications. T.R.W. Texas Instruments. Rolm. N.C.R. Honeywell.  While some of the high-tech problems have reached Colorado Springs, most notably through layoffs at United Technologies' Mostek division and other chip operations, the area has maintained a steady growth rate, successfully blending private high tech and space tech. Some expect the city's population, which has nearly doubled since 1970, to approximately 250,000, to double again by 1995 if the Air Force builds to the top of its projections. Already, the North American Aerospace Defense Command -NORAD - is buried deep inside nearby Cheyenne Mountain. **********Here in the Boulder area, the effects of the layoffs are expected to last into 1986. But it is hard to find signs - aside from empty office space - of the high-tech mini-slump. All in all, the mood of the community is upbeat, perhaps in part because most of the production workers hit hardest by the layoffs live elsewhere, in Longmont, north Denver and Louisville. **********''The trauma that has gone through some of the companies just doesn't seem to have made an impression on the community,'' says R.C. Mercure, known as ''Merc,'' chairman of Onecom Inc., a small Boulder telecommunications company. Mr. Mercure, a veteran of several start-up companies, says that although Colorado's entrepreneurs tend to be ''less flashy'' than their West Coast counterparts, their spirit here seems just as indomitable. **********Probably the best measure of that spirit is that five months after leaving Storagetek, Mr. Aweida is already off and running with a new company: the Aweida Systems Corporation in Boulder. It is selling computer peripherals made by other companies, but under its own name. ''We like to think big here,'' Aweida says of his new venture, which already has 22 employees, including several Storagetek veterans. At least a couple of area venture capitalists have expressed an interest in the company. **********With all this, some residents in the Boulder area are questioning the strict growth controls previously imposed by city government on new development. The city's love affair with high tech has had its rocky moments in the past. One reason is its traditionally cautious approach. In 1980, for instance, the city prevented the System Development Corporation, a large software company, from locating on county land because the area was zoned for green space. **********City Councilman Stern maintains that the city would do the same again to protect its elaborate planning system. But others think the layoffs have softened the city's attitude toward new industry. If the System Development Corporation were to try to settle here today, says Mr. Bosley at the Bank of Boulder, ''the city fathers would be hung for chasing away that kind of business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/business/bond-prices-end-day-mixed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOND PRICES END DAY MIXED", "print_headline": "BOND PRICES END DAY MIXED", "body_text": " **********Interest rates edged higher yesterday as bond prices finished the day mixed in light trading. **********Following the bond market's advances in the two previous sessions, traders became less enthusiastic yesterday when the Federal Reserve failed to stem an early rise in short-term rates. **********The rate on Federal funds, excess reserves that banks lend each other overnight, surged to the 9 percent level, where it remained most of the day.

The average six-month bill yield was 7.08 percent, down from 7.24 percent last week. **********The price on the closely watched 30-year Treasury bond - the 11 1/4 percent issue due in 2015 - finished at 107 yesterday, to yield about 10.49 percent. That is down from Friday's close of 107 11/32, which yielded about 10.44 percent. **********Although yesterday's trading lacked some of the vigor that had been evident late last week, Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs, Schaedle & Company, said the market held up well, in spite of profit taking, with blocks of retail buying, particularly from overseas. **********Some of the support for the market stems from what he sees as increasing doubts that the economy is as strong as indicated by the Government's report two weeks ago that it grew at a relatively strong 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter ended last month. The data that have come out to date have provided mixed signals about the economy's direction. **********Outlook for Further Fed Easing **********But Mr. Braverman said he expected to see a ''continuing stream of evidence to suggest that the economy is much weaker than the Fed and the Administration would like to see,'' leaving the door open for further Fed easing in the future. **********Mr. Braverman said he expected to see such evidence when the nation's auto makers report figures tomorrow on car sales for late June and the Labor Department releases its monthly unemployment report on Friday. Mr. Braverman said the cars sales figures would be lower and foreshadow lower retail sales. **********''The key question is: has the decline in interest rates as yet sufficiently spurred the economy to the point where it will not be necessary for the Fed to ease credit further,'' Mr. Braverman said.

Blackmun wrote the decision. Associate Justice Lewis F.

It has 6 million square feet of manufacturing space in 6-, 8- and 10-story structures on a tract that runs from 32d to 41st Street in the Sunset Park section. The Fourth Avenue line of the BMT subway parallels the complex and provides access to it. **********Of the 6 million square feet of space, almost a third - 1.8 million square feet - has been let by garment manufacturers, many of them forced out of Manhattan's midtown garment district by rising rents. **********As the Seventh Avenue costs continue to rise, officials at Industry City are trying to persuade even more apparel makers to move their work space to Brooklyn, even if their showrooms and offices are left behind in the garment center. **********Ira Press, director of leasing at Industry City for Helmsley-Spear Inc., said 85 percent of the apparel manufacturers in the complex relocated from Manhattan in the last five years. Even though 40 garment companies have moved in, he concedes that getting others to follow is not easy. **********''Once they come out and take a look at what we have, they sign up,'' he said. ''The problem is getting them here.'' A major hindrance, he said, is the ''Brooklyn reputation'' of rundown buildings, inadequate security and general undesirablity. On the other hand, he said, the complex can offer significantly cheaper rents. **********''We're 60 percent below Manhattan,'' Mr. Press declared, ''and 40 percent below Queens.'' Rents average $3 a square foot, including heat and taxes, he said, while many landlords in the Manhattan garment district are asking $15 a square foot and more when they offer lease renewals. **********He also noted that Industry City is just three miles from the Brooklyn- Battery Tunnel, making it relatively easy for manufacturers to get from factory to showroom. Some employees who live in Brooklyn find it easier to get to Industry City than to the garment center. **********According to Mr. Press, many buildings at the complex are well suited to the needs of garment manufacturers. Because they are so large, floors in the old buildings can accommodate table runs of more than 100 feet, which helps in setting up efficient cutting tables. Mr. Press added that many of the buildings offer natural light on three sides. **********What the complex cannot provide, however, is the broad array of support services that are available to small manufacturers in the garment district. When tenants need buttons, trimmings and the like, they have to send to Manhattan for them. **********The complex, originally called Bush Terminal, was built during the decade from 1915 to 1925 as a multi- tenant waterfront industrial project. Docking facilities are still available, Mr. Press said, but are not used. The physical configuration of the complex has changed little. A single-story, 16,000-square-foot warehouse is being constructed to replace a structure damaged by fire a few years ago. The new building is the first in 50 years. **********Although the 1.8 million square feet of garment space at Industry City is one of the largest such areas outside Manhattan, it equals only a small part of the space there. **********According to a survey by the consulting firm of Emanuel Weintraub Associates of Fort Lee, N.J., some 17.3 million square feet of women's apparel manufacturing and showroom space remain in the traditional garment district, which is between 35th and 40th Streets from Avenue of the Americas to 10th Avenue. **********Over the years, according to Mr. Weintraub, there has been a substantial migration to the other boroughs - particularly Brooklyn and the Bronx - as well as to New Jersey. He says the dispersion will persist as long as Manhattan rents keep rising. **********The growing competition for space results from expansion of the midtown office market into garment areas. Tenants fear that the Times Square Redevelopment Project will accelerate this trend. As rents continue to rise in the garment center, more manufacturers are forced to relocate or, as union officials have asserted, to go out of business. **********Jay Mazur, general secretary and treasurer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, said landlords in the garment district had raised rents ''unconscionably,'' with many manufacturers facing costs that have gone from $6 or $8 a square foot up to $18 or $20 a square foot."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/28/world/an-anti-apartheid-cleric-is-held-on-eve-of-planned-protest-march.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1985-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AN ANTI-APARTHEID CLERIC IS HELD ON EVE OF PLANNED PROTEST MARCH", "print_headline": "AN ANTI-APARTHEID CLERIC IS HELD ON EVE OF PLANNED PROTEST MARCH", "body_text": " **********A leading anti-apartheid activist was detained today, a day before he was to lead thousands of protesters in a march to demand the release of the jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela. **********The activist, the Rev.

After the elder got out of the car to speak to policemen and soldiers, witnesses said, five plainclothes policemen approached Dr. Boesak and told him that they were detaining him. **********The law under which Dr. Boesak was detained, Section 29 of South Africa's vast body of security legislation, gives the authorities the widest latitude in dealing with those detained under it. A senior police officer can detain people under the section who have committed or intend to commit terrorist acts or are withholding information about such acts. **********Expanded Powers **********People detained under the section are visited periodically by a magistrate and so-called inspectors of detainees, who determine whether those being held are ill treated and report any abuses to the Ministry of Justice. Detainees who have health problems are visited by a district surgeon and, if their ailments are considered serious, they can receive treatment at a general hospital under guard."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/26/world/fire-still-burns-in-naples.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fire Still Burns in Naples", "print_headline": "Fire Still Burns in Naples", "body_text": " **********Firefighters today continued battling a fire in a storage tank at an oil depot on the outskirts of Naples that exploded Saturday, fire officials said.

He added that his response to the revenue service question was discussed by the council's leaders and that General Singlaub was aware of it. **********Various Support Offered **********Mr. Koen also said that even though the council told the revenue service only of its plans to conduct educational campaigns, ''we had always intended to give support of other types'' to anti-Communist rebels ''in Angola and elsewhere.'' **********Dictionaries define materiel as material and tools needed for any work or enterprise, specifically weapons, equipment and supplies of armed forces. **********Johnnie Johnson, who succeeded Mr. Koen as council treasurer, said last week that the group's American fund raising for the rebels totaled from $100,000 to $300,000 this year. **********He said the money had been spent on such items as boats and clothing, but not weapons, for soldiers in the Honduran-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force, and for Misura, an Indian rebel organization. **********'Blessing of Government' **********Mr. Johnson said the aid was proper because it had President Reagan's backing and ''the blessing of the Government.'' **********Beyond the American contributions, General Singlaub has said he used the league's international contacts to help the rebels obtain lethal military aid from foreign governments, individuals and corporations. **********General Singlaub, 64 years old, was relieved as chief of staff of United States forces in South Korea in 1977 after publicly criticizing President Carter's tentative decision, later reversed, to reduce the number of American troops there. **********The council's tax-exempt status was granted by Internal Revenue Service headquarters in Washington after the Los Angeles district office referred the issue to the national level, citing ''no precedents'' for such a group receiving tax exemption as a charitable or educational organization. **********In its statements to the revenue service, the council said it was started in 1981 with a $16,500 interest-free loan from the World Anti-Communist League. **********In a 1981 report, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith described the anti-Communist league as ''a gathering place for extremists, racists and anti-Semites'' that was founded in 1966 with ''heavy support from Taiwanese and South Korean leaders.'' **********In an interview last June, General Singlaub conceded that the Latin American branch had been ''terribly anti-Semitic'' and that one European chapter contained former Nazi SS soldiers, but he said those extremist elements had been purged."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/business/hatfield-presses-for-military-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1985-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 970, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HATFIELD PRESSES FOR MILITARY CUTS", "print_headline": "HATFIELD PRESSES FOR MILITARY CUTS", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee asserted today that Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger ''cannot be a draft dodger'' and must accept a Pentagon budget smaller than he requested. **********The committee chairman, Senator Mark O. Hatfield, said he would strive to freeze next year's military spending at this year's level. **********That statement, and his comment about Mr. Weinberger, appeared to deepen the rift between Senate Republicans and the White House over a legislative package to reduce the deficit for the fiscal year 1986, which starts Oct. 1. **********Budget Freeze or Tax Increase **********Senator Hatfield, an Oregon Republican, said that without a freeze in the military budget, a tax increase would be inevitable. He also said he thought the Senate would approve a freeze. **********The Senator, who spoke with reporters after he and other Senate Republican leaders met with Mr. Weinberger in the office of the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, described the meeting with Mr. Weinberger as not ''overly satisfactory.'' **********Mr. Hatfield said the deficit problem ''is of such magnitude it calls for total mobilization, and Cap Weinberger cannot be a draft dodger - he has to be participating.'' **********While several of the Senators played down a possible ''break'' with the Administration, Senator Hatfield's call for a freeze was backed by others. **********Secretary Weinberger, according to participants, showed no sign of compromising. Over the weekend, President Reagan rejected any cuts in the military budget, saying would be ''very risky'' and ''we've squeezed that apple pretty good.'' **********''I do think there is some very clear unanimity that the defense budget will be frozen in a way which produces bucks,'' Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate Republican whip, said in a statement. **********Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, chairman of the Republican Conference, added, ''I think something close to a defense freeze is a possibility.'' **********Of Mr. Weinberger, Senator Hatfield said, ''I found no give in the position he has very clearly enunciated.'' **********''I hope Cap Weinberger and Ronald Reagan understand that we are going to need some give on their part to protect the Republicans who are running in 1986,'' said Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''Putting them between a rock and a hard place isn't going to help them.'' **********Asked if there was an impasse, Senator Chafee replied: ''Well, yes. But impasses can be overcome. We'll get there.'' **********Some key Republican Senators, including Barry Goldwater of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, oppose a freeze or major cuts in Mr. Reagan's military budget, which will make achieving a freeze difficult. **********Other Republicans, including Mr. Dole, have said that freezing the military budget would be difficult. But he has also said the Republicans will still aim for military budget cuts that will bring them close to the $20 billion savings in 1986 from a freeze. **********The President is expected to submit a 1986 military budget calling for appropriations of $313.7 billion, an increase of about 6 percent, after inflation, over this year's military budget. This is slightly below Mr. Weinberger's initial request of $324.8 billion. Mr. Hatfield and others are talking about freezing military appropriations in 1986 at the 1985 level of $284.5 billion. **********The reduction Mr. Reagan agreed to would reduce projected military spending, which affects the deficit, by $8.7 billion in 1986 and by $28 billion over the next three years. A freeze, according to the Administration, would reduce projected spending by $20 billion in 1986 and $106 billion over three years. **********Growing Annoyance Expressed **********The growing annoyance of Republicans was also expressed by Senator Heinz. Echoing recent comments by Senator Dole, Mr. Heinz said the White House's refusal to ''give'' on the military budget would hurt Republican chances in 1986, when 22 Republican Senate seats will be contested. **********Republicans in the Senate are trying to assemble a deficit reduction package that would save at least $50 billion in the fiscal year 1986 and more than $260 billion over three years. The goal is to cut the deficit, projected at more than $200 billion this year, to $100 billion in 1988. The Reagan budget, which will be sent to Congress Monday, falls $40 billion short of the 1988 target. **********In a telephone hookup today to the annual meeting of the National Association of Home Builders in Houston, Mr. Reagan asserted that cutting the Federal budget would lead to lower interest rates, always a vital interest of the housing industry. **********''Our primary goal for the second term is to insure strong economic growth with low inflation - and lower interest rates,'' he said. ''And to achieve this we have to cut Federal spending to control the deficit.'' **********Some progress was made on assembling the Senate package today. Senator Bob Packwood, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Republicans on the committee had endorsed some form of freeze or reduction in the cost-of-living increase for Social Security recipients. Such a cut would be necessary as part of the committee's endorsement of its target of reducing spending under its jurisdiction by $12.7 billion in 1986 and by $63.3 billion over three years, Mr. Packwood said. **********In a separate development, the Environment and Public Works Committee voted, 14 to 1, to reduce the ceiling of spending on Federal highways by $1.7 billion in 1986. **********But, in a reflection of how difficult it is to assemble such a deficit reduction package, other committees are still balking. According to staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the committee has not produced a proposal on military retirement. Moreover, most of the committees whose Republicans have said they could support spending cuts have made that commitment contingent on all other committees' meeting their targets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/world/sandinista-portrait-poet-militant-bible-devotee.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1985-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SANDINISTA PORTRAIT: POET, MILITANT, BIBLE DEVOTEE", "print_headline": "SANDINISTA PORTRAIT: POET, MILITANT, BIBLE DEVOTEE", "body_text": " **********Tomas Borge, the Nicaraguan Interior Minister, is a man of many public identities.

During a brief break, he telephoned the Minister of Industry and told him to be sure that blind people received the same salaries as sighted people in all state-run factories. **********Seven ragged but bright-eyed youths from the town of Masatepe also appeared before Mr. Borge that day. They told him they were a baseball team in need of equipment. **********As an aide took notes, Mr. Borge promised the boys some bats, balls and gloves. He sent them on their way with the admonition that being a revolutionary means being ''a good friend, a good student, a good son, and a good baseball player.'' **********Be a Priest, His Mother Said **********But Mr. Borge would be the first to acknowledge that being a revolutionary requires more than that. He has been one since his early youth, rebelling first against his mother, who wanted him to become a priest. **********''I told her that I would not be blackmailed by her gentleness and her naivete, and that I was a Communist,'' he recalled in a magazine interview years later. **********Now at the seat of power, Mr. Borge is often viewed as among the hardest-line of the nine Sandinista commanders who run Nicaragua. Some say he and his supporters form a power center that rivals the group around the supposedly more moderate President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra. **********As Interior Minister, Mr. Borge's domain is vast, and his power within it is all but absolute. In addition to the police and fire departments, he oversees the prison system, the state security and intelligence apparatus, the press censorship office, the customs service and the nationwide network of Sandinista Defense Committees. **********He also controls elite combat units believed to number about 5,000 men, and is in charge of formulating Government policy for the volatile Atlantic Coast region. **********A Man of Contradictions **********Mr. Borge cultivates distinct images that might seem contradictory in some men. He is the sentimental idealist who never misses the inauguration of a day-care center, but also the tough enforcer who snarls at opponents and periodically imprisons political activists in isolated cells. **********''He told me,'' said Enrique Sotelo Borgen, a conservative member of the National Assembly, ''that within half an hour after the first American paratroopers land in Nicaragua, all the opposition leaders will be rounded up and killed.'' **********At age 55, Mr. Borge is the oldest among the nine ruling Sandinista commanders, the only surviving member of the group of student radicals who formed the Sandinista Front in the early 1960's. After studying guerrilla warfare in Cuba, he became one of the most senior Sandinista leaders. **********He was tortured by the national guard, and guardsmen were apparently responsible for the killing of his wife only weeks before the Sandinista takeover in July 1979. **********Film Depicts His Ordeal **********Mr. Borge has established a filmmaking unit within the Interior Ministry, and as one of its first tasks, he assigned the unit to film a dramatization of how he was tortured in jail. He shows the film to visitors on request. **********Some diplomats and others in Managua believe that the six-year-old revolutionary Government has not been radical enough for Mr. Borge's taste. In an interview, Mr. Borge conceded there was some truth to that analysis. **********''Originally, the Sandinista Front had conceived of a different kind of revolution,'' he said. ''In ideal terms, it would be a deeply radical revolution, even at some point reaching the abolition of private property, a revolution within the classically socialist framework.'' **********''But reality taught us that in the special conditions of Latin Amerca and Nicaragua, this was not possible,'' Mr. Borge continued. **********Mr. Borge said that in the coming months, Sandinista leaders may decide to take ''firmer attitudes'' toward their domestic adversaries. **********'Those Ready to Die' **********''Without a doubt, United States imperialism has decided to destroy us,'' he said. ''This consolidating of revolutionary forces means we have to hit even those sectors which partially support the revolution, then they must be hit. We have to consolidate those who are ready to die for Nicaragua and its liberation.'' **********Like many Nicaraguans, Mr. Borge is a poet. His most famous work is the Sandinista anthem, which has been set to music and is sung before every Sandinista ceremony. It includes the line, ''We fight against the Yankee, enemy of humanity.'' **********Mr. Borge is eager to test his political skills on a speaking tour through the United States, but until now he has been frustrated by visa restrictions imposed from Washington. **********Hoping that trip will someday be possible, Mr. Borge has been studying English. Asked when he thought he might be granted a visa, Mr. Borge shrugged and pointed to his moon rock. **********''It seems it is easier for an astronaut to go to the moon than for Tomas Borge to go to the United States,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/world/iran-s-future-different-sort-of-ayatollah.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1985-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 559, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAN'S FUTURE: DIFFERENT SORT OF AYATOLLAH", "print_headline": "IRAN'S FUTURE: DIFFERENT SORT OF AYATOLLAH", "body_text": " **********His face is featured on huge posters at airports, shops and offices throughout Iran. The posters are equal in size to those of Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who calls him ''the fruit of my life.'' **********But Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, 63 years old, the ayatollah who was named last week to succeed Ayatollah Khomeini after his death, hardly resembles his spiritual mentor. **********Long considered the heir apparent, the stocky, grizzled cleric is known for his down-to-earth language and candor. Those traits are in sharp contrast with the stern demeanor and convoluted pronouncements of Ayatollah Khomeini, 83. **********Although Iranian press organizations refer to Ayatollah Montazeri as ''grand ayatollah,'' he lacks the lofty religious credentials of Ayatollah Khomeini and the handful of other leading clerics who hold that honorary title. Unlike them, he cannot trace his ancestry back to Mohammed. He is considered a man of no great intelligence, and his squeaky voice is often ridiculed. **********Less Rigid Than Khomeini **********Unlike Ayatollah Khomeini, who has a rigid approach, Ayatollah Montazeri has curbed his early radicalism to garner support among key interest groups in Iran. **********At the same time he has kept the support of radical elements, mainly because of his unswerving commitment to spreading the message of Iran's Islamic revolution to other Muslem nations. **********The son of a poor peasant family from the agricultural town of Nejafabad, in central Iran near Isfahan, Ayatollah Montazeri spent his childhood working on the family farm. **********At 11, he went to school in the holy city of Qum and later to Isfahan. He studied with Ayatollah Khomeini in Qum and later taught philosophy there. **********Enemy of the Shah **********Like many other Iranian clerics, Ayatollah Montazeri became an enemy of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi and was imprisoned and tortured for his political activities. He made secret trips to Iraq, where Ayatollah Khomeini was in exile, and became his personal representative in Iran. **********Early in the revolution, Ayatollah Montazeri gained a reputation as a hard-liner for his strong support for the summary justice of the revolutionary courts and his deep involvement in drafting Iran's far-reaching land redistribution bill. But his weekly sermons as the Friday prayer leader in Teheran were disruptive, and he was removed from the highly visible post. **********In recent years, he has worked to defeat new land-redistribution proposals and has strengthened his links to the politically important bazaar merchants by quoting verses from the Koran on the sanctity of private property. **********Ayatollah Montazeri lives in a heavily guarded house in a sealed compound in the center of Qum, where he teaches Islamic law and receives delegations of visiting dignitaries. **********He says little on matters of foreign policy and has been ridiculed by opponents of the regime for his simplistic view of the West. But although he defended the taking of the American hostages by Islamic militants in 1979, he told an interviewer that it was ''impractical to sever relations between us and the United States.'' **********He has occasionally shown an independent interpretation of events. When several Iranian leaders described Iraq's bombing of an Iranian border town early this year as ''a new crime of American imperialism,'' Ayatollah Montazeri saw the event differently.

Todd Conover, is expected to announce his resignation on Tuesday, according to Administration officials, opening the way to the complete replacement of three-member Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board, which includes the Comptroller. **********His term was to have run through December 1986, although rumors have circulated for more than a year that Mr. Conover wanted to leave. The Comptroller of the Currency and his staff supervise the country's 4,700 federally chartered commercial banks, including such money centers as Citibank, Bank of America, Chase Manhattan and Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust. **********In addition to Mr. Conover, William M. Isaac, the F.D.I.C. chairman, and Irvine H. Sprague, a third director, are expected to resign within months, having completed their terms. **********A Possible Successor **********Among the names mentioned by some as Mr. Conover's possible successor is Roger H. Mehle, the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance from 1981-83. **********Leonora Cross, a spokesman for the Comptroller's office, said she had no comment on reports of Mr. Conover's imminent resignation. But the Administration officials, who asked not to be named, said Mr. Conover will announce his resignation Tuesday. **********The 44-year-old Mr. Conover, one of the Administration's staunchest proponents of deregulation, has been a frequent target of Congressional Democrats and of groups representing small and medium-sized banks. **********In particular, Representative Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, has criticised the Comptroller for his outspoken advocacy of further banking deregulation, and, in particular, for approving plans by scores of banks to operate limited-service offices across state lines. **********Moreover, Mr. Conover has been criticized for not taking tougher measures against troubled institutions. Just months after Mr. Conover took office in December 1981, for example, Mr. St Germain accused the Comptroller's office of moving too cautiously against Penn Square Bank, the high-flying Oklahoma City energy lender that became one of the largest bank failures in the nation's history. Similarly, Mr. Conover was faulted by both Congressional Democrats and Republicans for his office's supervision of troubled Continental Illinois. **********For his part, Mr. Conover has argued, in the strongest terms, that his office could have done nothing to stop Continental from making loans that went sour. **********''Bank regulators do not and should not take over the management of any bank,'' Mr. Conover once said. ''Nor do they tell management which loans to make or not to make.'' **********But in November 1984, in an action that shook the banking industry, the Comptroller forced the directors at both First Chicago and the Bank of America to sign legally binding pledges that their banks would be run more prudently. **********New Strategy Seen **********Such tough action in the wake of the near collapse of Continental was seen by analysts to represent a new strategy, in which the authorities act early to prevent a bank's collapse, rather than waiting until it is about to fail. **********Senator Jake Garn, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the banking committee, has called Mr. Conover a model regulator. As with most of the Reagan regulatory appointees, Mr. Conover has urged relaxation of Glass-Steagall Act restrictions that largely prohibit banks from engaging in securities activities. **********Gerald M. Lowrie, director of Government relations for the American Bankers Association, said: ''We haven't agreed with him on all things, but he's been very forthright about stating his views and why. There's nothing subtle about Todd; he came here with a very strong bias toward market-place economics - let the markets work - and he hasn't budged one iota.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/15/business/pickens-led-group-buying-into-unocal.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1985-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PICKENS-LED GROUP BUYING INTO UNOCAL", "print_headline": "PICKENS-LED GROUP BUYING INTO UNOCAL", "body_text": " **********A partnership led by the Mesa Petroleum Company was disclosed yesterday as the mystery buyer behind the big run-up in the price of the stock of the Unocal Corporation, the nation's 12th-largest oil company.

But Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's largest investment banking firm, has gained the upper hand so decisively that yesterday Phibro-Salomon said it plans to change its name to Salomon Inc. **********Philipp Brothers, one of the largest and most respected concerns in the secretive world of physical commodities dealing, will be slimmed down sharply as it refocuses on its basic business, trading raw commodities. 600 Jobs to Be Cut The moves will slash 600 staff members worldwide from Philipp Brothers' staff of some 3,000. Nearly all of those reductions, according to Robert S. Salomon Jr., a Phibro-Salomon managing director, will come from the company's marketing and distribution operations, a low-margin business in which it largely acts as a middleman. On a smaller scale, it is also negotiating to sell a Brazilian pig-iron manufacturing operation, Mr. Salomon said. **********In addition, there will be an important management shake-up. Two young Philipp Brothers stars, who grew up and made their mark in its sugar trading operation, will take charge of the unit on Jan. 1, 1986. **********Martin N. Kaufman, who is 32 years old and is based in London, will become chairman of Philipp Brothers when Alan Flacks, the current chairman, and Ludwig Jesselson, an adviser and former chairman, retire at the end of this year. Henry S. Schachar, 31, will become president at the same time. Philipp Brothers will also leave its midtown Manhattan offices and move into Salomon Brothers' lower Manhattan offices next spring, Mr. Salomon said. **********Company sources said that Phibro-Salomon's management considered three options on how to restructure Philipp Brothers and chose the most drastic of these at a meeting late last week. They were determined to make sure that ''this is the last of these they will have to go through,'' as one official involved in the decision said. It was a plan said to have been pushed by Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Schachar, neither of whom was said to be available for comment yesterday. **********Phibro-Salomon's chairman, John H. Gutfreund, said that there would be a charge against the company's earnings because of the restructuring but added that it would probably come to less than the approximately $50 million that Phibro-Salomon would gain from a previously announced termination of Philipp Brothers' retirement plan. In the last restructuring, 250 jobs were cut. **********According to company insiders, the new attempt at restructuring is a recognition of the fact that the earlier one, conducted at the end of last year and early this year, fell short of the surgery needed. The declining inflation rate since 1980 has devastated the commodities markets and most companies that trade in those products, including Philipp Brothers. **********''At Salomon Brothers, we didn't really understand the problem last year, and that restructuring just didn't work,'' said a company source. ''What we are doing now is changing the entire character of the firm.'' **********The source said that Philipp Brothers' biggest problem was less the fact that the commodity markets have suffered than lack of strong management at Philipp Brothers. **********Return Termed Unacceptable **********Mr. Salomon said that Philipp Brothers' return on equity and return relative to the management resources it commanded has not been acceptable, although it has not been losing money. He pointed out that the oil markets have suffered but that Phibro Energy, which deals in the oil and other energy markets, has produced a satisfactory return.

By the mid-1970's, company after company was putting managers through courses to help them ''get in touch with their feelings.'' **********Corporations are looking at that goal more critically these days. Some psychologists still advocate ''personal growth'' training, but a rising number of detractors dismiss the emphasis as ''touchy feely'' psychology. **********Indeed, many of the old training programs are hard to take seriously. Ron Zemke, senior editor of Training Magazine, recalls attending a session that was titularly aimed at fostering self-awareness. Its methodology involved asking a group of managers to take off their shoes, lay down on blankets, listen to eerie electronic noises mingled with ocean sounds, have an ''out-of-body experience,'' and discuss that experience with each other. **********Nowadays, ''the fundamentally strange has dropped out'' of management training, Mr. Zemke said. He noted that companies spurn any program that looks obviously ridiculous - lacks ''good face validity,'' to use training jargon - or that does not come complete with data proving its efficacy. **********Indeed, the ''touchy feely'' days may be over. The Wilson Learning Corporation, a Minneapolis training concern that reaped $40 million from training packages last year, still gets many orders for programs on hiring and firing skills. But it has discontinued its ''wellness program,'' which covered physical and psychological fitness. ''We found that management wouldn't pay for three days of personal growth,'' said Matthew Juechter, Wilson's president. **********Still, managerial training as a whole is thriving. According to Training Magazine, last year's training tab for corporations topped $4 billion. And that figure does not include the salaries of in-house trainers or the cost of man-hours lost while managers were being trained. Each year the Fluor Corporation spends ''hundreds of thousands of dollars'' on trainer's salaries alone, said Paul Leonetti, director of training and executive development. **********Which courses have survived?

The message said any repetition of such events anywhere in Central America would have ''serious consequences for the perpetrators and for those who assist them.'' **********No Nicaraguan Response **********There was no immediate response to the allegations from Nicaraguan officials. **********The diplomatic note did not contain specific details of the purported support by Nicaragua for the Salvadoran guerrilla faction that took responsibility for killing the six United States citizens, who were shot as they sat in a San Salvador cafe last month. **********A senior State Department official, however, said ''we told them we were well aware of the fact'' that the Salvadoran guerrillas had their headquarters in Managua and were ''armed by Managua.'' **********''What we said is that they cannot disassociate themselves from acts by groups with which they have such close association and have so much influence over,'' he added. ''If they wanted these attacks to stop, they have enough influence to stop them. If they adopt a policy of supporting terrorism against Americans, this is going to have a very serious effect on relations with us, and we will react to the killing of Americans.'' **********Deterrent Effect Sought **********The State Department official said the diplomatic message was intended as a deterrent and as a way of influencing the Government of Nicaragua to try to prevent attacks on United States citizens anywhere in Central America. **********The official would not speculate on what action, if any, the United States might take if its military and civilian personnel came under attack in Central America. **********A White House official said of the warning, ''Our response to violent acts against Americans will be appropriate to the loss incurred. The time and place of our response will be of our own choosing.'' **********The White House national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, said today that the United States had no intention of invading Nicaragua or of breaking diplomatic relations with it. **********His remarks were made at a ''special briefing on Central America,'' which was timed to mark the overthrow of Gen.

The warning, though, went beyond Mr. Reagan's statement. **********While the senior State Department official would describe the protest only in general terms, the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington made public the text of a message it said had been delivered in Managua today by the United States Ambassador, Harry E. Bergold. **********According to the text made public by Nicaragua, the message said, ''We now have indications that preparations are under way to introduce a program of terrorist attacks against U.S. personnel in Honduras.'' It added that ''we are aware that the Government of Nicaragua supports those involved in these preparations and we believe that the Government of Nicaragua may be directly involved.'' **********Protest Cites 'Intelligence' **********The State Department official said the warning was less formal than a diplomatic note of protest. The Nicaraguan text said that the protest was based on ''specific available intelligence'' that terrorist attacks might take place against Americans in Honduras. The official said he could not discuss the nature of the reports. **********The warning said Nicaragua supports and is host to Salvadoran insurgent groups. The State Department official said one of the insurgent groups supported by Nicaragua is the Party of Central American Workers, which is one of the elements of the El Salvador guerrilla coalition known as the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front. **********''The Nicaraguan Government should use its influence to discourage attacks against U.S. personnel, personnel who are not, as they know, involved in combat,'' the protest said. **********The four marines slain by gunmen at a sidewalk cafe on June 19 were guards who were off duty from their jobs at the United States Embassy. Two United States civilians and several Salvadorans were also slain. **********Reagan 'Clear' About Move **********Although Mr. McFarlane said President Reagan had made it ''emphatically clear'' that the United States would not invade Nicaragua, the White House national security adviser was not asked about and did not discuss any other form of retaliation. **********The State Department official said the purpose of the warning was to tell the Nicaraguan Government that the United States was aware that Salvadoran guerrilla factions had headquarters in Managua and were supported by Nicaragua, and that small groups of Honduran ''terrorists'' had been trained and assisted by Nicarauga. **********''The idea is to save American lives by deterring Nicaraguan support for any terrorist action,'' the official said.

That move was made necessary because banks around the world, citing the civil unrest in South Africa over its apartheid policies, decided not to renew maturing loans to borrowers there. **********As a result, South Africa - with about $10 billion in foreign debt coming due within the next year or so, and with only about $2.5 billion in readily available funds - said that it could not meet its short-term payments despite its healthy trade surplus and that it would have to renegotiate the terms with its creditors. **********Talks Also Held in Washington **********In a television interview in Washington with the South African Broadcasting Company yesterday, Gerhard de Kock, governor of the Reserve Bank, confirmed that he had met with bankers in New York, and had talks in Washington with Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Gerald E. Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Jacques de Larosiere, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. **********In New York, banking sources said that Dr. de Kock had visited the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the Bankers Trust Company, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. None of the banks officially would confirm his visit. Last week, he met with John Reed, the chairman of Citibank, which is believed to be by far the largest American bank creditor of South Africa. **********The bankers stressed they were confident that, unlike some Latin American countries, South Africa wanted to repay and that it would be able to repay - as long as the political situation did not deteriorate so badly that the economy collapsed. **********Step Called a 'Standstill' **********In his interview with Fanus Venter of the South African Broadcasting Company, Dr. de Kock said he did not come to the United States to borrow money but to explain South Africa's action. He said the move was not a ''moratorium'' but called it a ''standstill'' to give South Africa the ability to arrange for funds to leave the country in an ''orderly fashion.'' **********Dr. de Kock attributed South Africa's problems to ''political considerations both at home and abroad,'' and said that South Africa's economy was basically sound and could pay all its loans and still have sizable reserves. **********Bankers interviewed yesterday in the United States and in Europe agreed with that analysis. **********According to the bankers, none of whom were willing to be quoted, there were many technical questions that Mr. de Kock could not answer. For example, it was not clear yesterday whether the moratorium on payments of principal would include foreign-bank deposits in South African banks. A deposit is a form of a loan to a bank. This issue is a critical point for many foreign banks that have large deposits in South African institutions. **********Overdrafts Questioned **********Other questions concerned whether the moratorium applied to outstanding overdrafts by South African banks on their accounts at foreign banks, and whether it applied to bankers acceptances, which are bank guarantees on trade transactions. **********Most disturbing to some bankers was that the South African Government still had not said who would represent it in the talks. The bankers said they hoped that South Africa would not choose an investment banking firm. Other possibilities are a Government official, a South African commercial banker or a private economic consultant. **********On the other side, the bankers have substantial conflicts among themselves, including which banks should represent the creditors in the negotiations. Because of the political sensitivity of the issue, which is especially strong in the United States, American banks do not want to play a prominent role. **********Bankers said that ordinarily the banks with the biggest exposure in South Africa - said to be Barclays Bank and the Standard-Chartered Bank, both of Britain - would be named chairmen of the creditors' group. But some bankers said they felt that might cause a conflict of interest. One New York banker said it was likely that a Swiss bank would be chosen as chairman. **********Another issue expected to be raised is how to treat those banks that say they want to continue lending to South Africa. The question is whether they should be more exposed than the others if conditions deteriorate, making it impossible for the country to meet its payments. **********The moratorium on principal payments does not apply to all loans, only to short-term credits owed by the private sector. The Government will continue to pay principal falling due on its own foreign debt, but most United States banks stopped lending to the Government several years ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/business/what-s-new-among-independent-booksellers.html": {"writer_name": "David Tuller", "pub_date": "1985-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHAT'S NEW AMONG INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW AMONG INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS", "body_text": " **********In the last two years, B. Dalton Bookseller, Waldenbooks, and several regional discount chains have opened more than a dozen outlets in and around Albany.  The spate of new book stores, many with bargain prices, spelled good news for avid readers in the area.  But for owners of independent bookstores, the encroachment of the giants into their territories meant hard times.  ''We've been surrounded-it's like a state of seige,'' said Barbara Shohet, co-manager of the Book House of Stuyvesant Park, a 10-year old Albany bookstore.  ''We're doing very nicely, but it's an uphill fight.'' **********A growing percentage of the country's estimated 8,000 independent booksellers are feeling the same kind of heat these days.  Dramatic chancges have swept through the book retailing industry in recent years, as once-modest chains have flexed their muscles.  ''In the late 1970's,'' explained Bernard Ruth, executive director of the American Bookseller Association, ''the large retailing establishments discovered books as a product.  And they began to market them like any other piece of merchandise.'' **********According to the Association of American Publishers, between 1980 and 1983, the sales volume of trade books and mass market paperbacks-the two categories that comrpise the bulk of general bookstore merchandise-increased to $2.3 billion from $2 billion.  According to BP Report, a trade publication, during the same period sales of the top nine chains leaped to $1.2 billion from an estimated $737 million, raising their market share to 52 percent from 38 percent.  Dayton-Hudson's B. Dalton and K Mart's Waldenbooks, the two largest chains, boast 738 and 898 shares, respectively, and have been opening more than 100 outlets a year between them. **********To make matters worse for the independents, book discounters are also encroaching on their markets. Crown Books, a 7-year-old discount chain, already has more than 180 outlets and annual sales topping $100 million.  Regional discounters, like Barnes & Noble in New York and Encore in Philadelphia, have also proliferated, and this year both Ddayton-Hudson and Waldenbooks opened discount operations with aggressive roll-out cmpaigns scheduled for 1985. **********The chains contend that independents are allies, not commpetitors, in the effort to bring books to the masses.  ''Well-managed independents should not feel threatened when we come into an area,'' said Harry Hoffman, president of Walden Books.  ''There may be a slight dip in business at first, but I think our presence broadens the overall market.'' **********Such assertions have not reassured most booksellers.  Independents have long depended upon the easy profits from popular current titles to subsidize the slower selling, older and more esoteric books they favor. Now the chains are grabbing the lion's share of those high turnover sales, and independents increasingly are turning to marketing ploys and special customer services to stay alive.  ''It used to be enough for a bookseller to love books to survive,'' said Chuck Robinson, co-owner of Village Books in Bellingtoon, Wash.

The shift of the economy to services, which account for nearly 75 percent of total domestic employment, is expected to continue through the end of the decade. **********Primary metal producers, including steel and aluminum manufacturers, were slow to bounce back from the 1981-82 recession but they can expect growth of 10 percent or more next year, the department said. However, it acknowledged that in some cases the high 1985 growth rate was more a reflection of their low base than a basic turnaround. **********Structural Readjustment Seen **********Commerce Under Secretary Lionel Olmer said, ''There are some emerging signs of structural readjustment in some industries.'' **********Car manufacturers, some of which were in serious financial trouble a few years ago, are expected to record strong profits for the third straight year. The department said car makers' profits would rise even if the United States and Japan ended voluntary limits on Japanese car exports to this country when the current pact expires in March. **********Sales of passenger cars will climb about 500,000 units, to 11 million, in 1985, with domestic producers turning out about 8.2 million cars. Import sales are expected to rise to 2.8 million units, from 2.4 million - capturing about 80 percent of the additional demand. **********The forecast assumes that the trade restraint agreement, which limits Japanese exports to 1.85 million cars, would be liberalized or terminated and that United States interest rates would not rise appreciably. **********High-technology industries will experience strong growth in 1985 and throughout the 1980's, with semiconductors and electronic computing equipment setting the pace, the department said. Production of semiconductors is projected to rise 37 percent in 1985 and about 25 percent a year on average through 1989. **********High-technology services industries such as information services and electronic data bases are also expected to grow smartly for the next several years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/05/business/us-closes-bond-firm-in-florida.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1985-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. CLOSES BOND FIRM IN FLORIDA", "print_headline": "U.S. CLOSES BOND FIRM IN FLORIDA", "body_text": " **********The Government closed a small Florida-based securities firm yesterday, accused it of fraud and estimated that its allegedly illicit activities would cost investors between $250 million and $300 million and possibly much more. **********Most of the victims are savings and loan associations, city and county governments and banks that had lent money to E.S.M. Government Securities Inc., the dealer in government securities that was closed. **********Yesterday's development was the latest in a string of scandals involving securities-related losses among banks, savings and loans associations and local governments. **********Investigators are not certain just how great the E.S.M. losses might be or exactly how they occurred. **********Inflow and Outflow Compared **********Thomas Tew, an attorney with a law firm that is acting as receiver and who spent the weekend trying to determine the extent of the problem, said E.S.M. had borrowed about $1.6 billion and had lent out about $1.3 billion. Considering that the firm had virtually no assets of its own, that gap alone indicates a loss of about $300 million. **********But Mr. Tew said the losses could be considerably greater, depending on whether the collateral backing the loans is intact. **********The collateral was in the form of government securities or government-guaranteed securities. If those securities cannot be found or have lost value, the losses could be substantially greater. **********Issue Concerning Collateral **********Similarly, if the collateral held by E.S.M. on behalf of those to whom it lent money had deteriorated in value, even these borrowers could experience substantial losses, Mr. Tew said. There were about 38 lenders and about 12 borrowers, he said. **********''One of the problems this weekend, while we were working on the books, was that we were unable to ascertain where the securities were,'' Mr. Tew said. Spot checks indicated that the securities were safely with the lenders, but Mr. Tew said he was not sure that all the collateral was where it should be. **********Mr. Tew said principals of the company had borrowed about $30 million from it, and he did not know if that would be repaid. The firm opened in 1976, he said, and in its first year it seemed to have made a profit. But, as the weekend audit indicated, in subsequent years it ''ran into a string of unreported losses of about $196.5 million,'' Mr. Tew said. **********Statements Are Questioned **********The complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that E.S.M. provided its customers with false financial statements and that it ''cannot meet $250 million to $300 million in obligations to customers in connection with securities transactions.'' **********At about 6:30 P.M. yesterday, District Judge William H. Hoeveler issued a permanent injunction freezing all the assets of E.S.M. Government Securities and the assets of three affiliated companies - E.S.M. Group Inc., E.S.M. Securities Inc. and E.S.M. Financial Group Inc. The court asked Mr. Tew, managing partner with Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley & Casey, to serve as receiver. **********Shortly after E.S.M.'s problems were announced at 8 A.M., the American Savings and Loan Association of Florida, a Miami-based institution with assets of about $1.2 billion, announced that it would experience a ''substantial'' loss as a result of its dealings with E.S.M. **********Morris N. Broad, American's chairman and chief executive, said that he did not know just how big the loss would be but that his institution would remain ''financially strong.'' **********An announcement issued by lawyers for E.S.M. said a special audit conducted over the weekend by Alexander Grant & Company had found that E.S.M. ''is unable to meet its financial obligations as they mature to its customers.'' The announcement added, ''E.S.M. has terminated operations on the advice of the special counsel and will not open for business on Monday, March 4, 1985.'' **********A spokesman for Alexander Grant said the initiative for the special audit had come from a principal of E.S.M. itself. **********Mr. Tew said Nicolas Wallace, E.S.M.'s president, and George Mead, its executive vice president, ''were extremely helpful.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/30/business/data-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA BANK", "print_headline": "DATA BANK", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY              Gross National Product   I Q'85   IV Q'84   Year Ago       In billions, annual rate   $3,810.6   $3,758.7   $3,553.3       Real G.N.P.

Still playing in the big ball game are Ogilvy & Mather and Doyle Dane Bernbach, both publicly held international agencies, and Mingo-Jones Advertising, specialists in promoting to the black community. **********The consolidation follows a major marketing reorganization initiated Feb. 1 that moved various liquor brands into different marketing units. **********One such move had all of the brands carrying the Seagram name being put together. Now all of them have been assigned to Ogilvy & Mather, and the billings could be around $40 million a year in addition to what the agency already has. **********Another unit set up in February was to handle premium-priced goods, and they seem to be joining Chivas Regal at Doyle Dane Bernbach, where the new billings are expected to be in the $20 million range. **********Mingo-Jones, which had been doing general advertising for Seagram Gin, is now going to be doing all of the ethnic advertising as needed. **********Out in the cold are Warwick Advertising, a Seagram agency for about 50 years, counting its predecessor agency; the William Esty Company, a subsidiary of Ted Bates Worldwide; Kenyon & Eckhardt, a subsidiary of Lorimar, and North Castle Partners in Greenwich, Conn. **********News of the loss apparently came as a surprise to all of them. And Esty promptly resigned the business of Seagram Vintners, with billings in the $1 million area, which was not involved in the consolidation. Now it will be free to go out and solicit new alcoholic beverage clients, which, according to Lawrence M. Wassong, president, were already contacted as of Monday. **********It was suggested by one of the losing agencies that Seagram is looking for more depth in marketing services and that this is why it has consolidated most of its business in its two biggest agencies, thereby making Seagram more important as a client. **********Another said that Seagram had asked its agencies to do profitability studies and found that most of them were not making money on Seagram business. And it is difficult (though not impossible) to ask for special treatment from an agency that does not find the account profitable. **********A recent report in Advertising Age indicates that the Seagram company spent a total of $116 million on advertising last year, down from $120 million in 1983. **********Ogilvy's new business will be all of the Seagram name brands as well as Canadian Hunter Whiskey, Seagram Cooler, Glenlivet Scotch, Taylor California Cellars and Taylor Champagnes. **********D.D.B. is getting Crown Royal, Kessler whiskey, Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Myers's Jamaican Rum, Mumm VSOP Cognac, Leroux cordials and liqueurs, Dr. McGillicuddy's Mentholmint Schnapps and Great Western Champagnes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/09/business/reagan-is-said-to-back-smaller-tax-on-gains.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1985-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN IS SAID TO BACK SMALLER TAX ON GAINS", "print_headline": "REAGAN IS SAID TO BACK SMALLER TAX ON GAINS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan, putting the final touches on the tax proposal he plans to send Congress soon, is likely to recommend a new method of taxing capital gains that would eventually be more generous to investors than the current law, Administration officials said today. **********They said the President had also tentatively agreed to propose limiting the amount of charitable contributions taxpayers could deduct, taxing individuals for a portion of the health insurance premiums their employers pay, and restricting deductions for mortgage interest payments on second homes. Mr. Reagan has promised publicly that homeowners could continue to deduct all the mortgage interest on their principal residence. **********The officials cautioned that the President was making tax policy decisions piecemeal during his European trip and that some might be changed when he returned home and could look at the package as a whole. **********They described his approach to capital gains as allowing essentially the same top rate of taxation as current law and permitting over time an adjustment to offset the effects of inflation on the value of stocks and other property. **********The officials said the President would almost certainly propose ending deductions for state and local income taxes, abolition of the investment tax credit and graduated tax rates for small businesses. **********Members of Congress and lobbyists who have been in touch with the Treasury said the Administration plan would limit some of the tax incentives now enjoyed by the oil and gas industry but would provide protection for owners of small wells and for producers who drilled into dry holes. Administration officials would not discuss the oil and gas provisions and suggested that the matter was still open. **********Those officials said proposals on tax rates for individuals and corporations and on the personal exemptions allowed for taxpayers and their dependents would not be fixed until the end of the process, when the overall revenue effect is better known. **********Mr. Reagan has told those traveling with him, according to one official, that he would like to cut the top tax rate for individuals below the 35 percent rate the Treasury Department recommended last November and that he would like to allow a $2,000 personal exemption, almost double the $1,040 permitted this year. **********But the officials said that would probably not be possible, given the President's decisions on other elements and his insistence that the package be ''revenue neutral'' - that is, neither raising nor lowering revenues gained from the current tax law. **********They said the President would probably agree to maintain the 35 percent maximum rate for individuals and the 33 percent rate for corporations recommended in November and would probably accept a personal exemption of $1,800. **********People at the Government Printing Office said they had been told to expect delivery of a 400-page draft tax package no later than next Tuesday, with distribution scheduled for the following Thursday. A Treasury spokesman said that the President and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d might not have their final meeting on the tax plan until early next week. **********The latest speculation in Congress was that the plan would be submitted May 20, although some said they still expected it next week. **********Momentum Grows in Congress **********In Congress today, momentum continued to grow for enactment of some form of a minimum tax on wealthy individuals and profitable corporations. Many now pay little or no taxes because they can take advantage of a variety of tax preferences. **********Representatives Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, and Marty Russo, Democrat of Illinois, with 55 Democratic co-sponsors, introduced minimum-tax legislation that they said would raise at least $22 billion in its first year. **********The House majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas, told reporters it would be ''a terrible waste of energy and agony'' to revise the tax code without raising revenues and called a minimum corporate tax a ''down payment on tax reform.'' **********Administration officials said the President's proposal might well contain provisions for a minimum tax on individuals and corporations. But they said the President would insist that the money be used to cut overall tax rates and not to reduce the deficit. **********On capital gains, officials said the President had provisionally agreed that 40 percent of long-term gains should be excluded from taxation and that the remaining 60 percent should be subject to the same tax as other income. With a 35 percent maximum tax rate, that would mean a top capital gains tax rate of 21 percent (35 percent times 60 percent). **********Under current law, 60 percent of long-term gains are excluded and the rest are taxed at a top rate of 50 percent. That makes for a top capital gains rate of 20 percent (50 percent times 40 percent). **********Adjustment for Inflation **********In addition, investors would gradually be permitted to make a limited adjustment of their gains to offset the effects of inflation, something they cannot do now, the officials said. They said that in the long run the proposal would be more favorable to investment than is the current system. **********The recommendations submitted by the Treasury in November would have treated all capital gains as regular income but would have allowed an adjustment for inflation. **********According to Administration officials, these are some of the specifics on other tentative decisions the President has made: *********** Depreciation. The system agreed to by the President would be less favorable to business investment than the current rapid depreciation system but more favorable than the proposal the Treasury made last November. *********** Charities. Charitable contributions could be deducted to the extent they exceeded 1 percent of income. All contributions are now deductible. In November, the Treasury suggested a floor of 2 percent. *********** Medical insurance. Workers would have to pay taxes on approximately the first $25 a month that their employers paid for their medical insurance premiums. Such benefits are not now taxed. The Treasury recommended taxing medical insurance premiums in excess of $70 a month for individual coverage or $175 for a family policy. Most other fringe benefits, including modest life insurance premiums and child-care facilities, would also not be subject to taxation. *********** Second homes. Despite heavy lobbying by the real estate and tourist industries, the decision was to disallow deduction of all mortgage interest payments on second homes. The interest might still be deductible if it did not exceed a taxpayer's investment income by more than a specified amount. *********** Dividends. One official familiar with the President's thinking said he expected Mr. Reagan to propose allowing corporations to deduct a small portion, perhaps 10 percent, of the dividends they pay to shareholders. The Treasury suggested that half of all dividend payments be deductible, but it has been widely reported since that the proposal was dropped. **********The Administration has failed to gain support for its overall plan from Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, sponsors of the main Democratic tax plan, or from Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin and Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, sponsors of the main Republican plan, in Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/07/business/dividend-meetings-058942.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of Oct. 7, 1985:          *2*MONDAY       *2*None Reported              *2*TUESDAY       AAR Corp   Loral Corp       Bank of NY Co Inc   Procter & Gamble       CBI Indus Inc   Standard Motor       Chesapeake Corp   United Telecom Inc       Diversified Energies   Weyerhaeuser Co       ITT Corp   White Consol Indus       LeaRonal Inc              *2*WEDNESDAY       Dayton-Hudson   Tokheim Corp       PacifiCorp   USLife Income Fund       Safeway Stores   Walgreen Company       TECO Energy Inc   Woolworth (FW)              *2*THURSDAY       Centel Corp   Owens-Illinois Inc       Fleet Fin'l Group Inc   Puget Sound Pwr&Lt       Ford Motor Co   Wisconsin Pub Serv       NERCO Inc              *2*FRIDAY       Aluminum Co Amer   Kaufman & Broad Inc"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/world/on-eve-of-rome-synod-a-top-us-bishop-sees-possible-need-for-changes.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Briggs", "pub_date": "1985-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ON EVE OF ROME SYNOD, A TOP U.S. BISHOP SEES POSSIBLE NEED FOR CHANGES", "print_headline": "ON EVE OF ROME SYNOD, A TOP U.S. BISHOP SEES POSSIBLE NEED FOR CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Bishop James W. Malone, the head of the American Roman Catholic delgation to an extraordinary Synod of Bishops that opens here Sunday, has raised the possible need for changes in key church policies in remarkably candid comments before a group of Catholic foundation heads. **********Bishop Malone, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said there were extreme conditions that would warrant an end to mandatory celibacy for priests. He also suggested a means by which Catholics who disagree with the church's ban on artificial birth control might consider the rule an ''ideal'' rather than an immediate demand. **********He also criticized Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the head of the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for being ''one of the obstacles'' to improving what Bishop Malone described as poor relations between bishops and theologians. **********The Bishop's remarks to a private meeting of philanthropists on Oct. 24 in Phoenix were made available to The New York Times this weekend in the form of a transcript. Bishop Malone spoke to the group and responded to lengthy and detailed questions. **********Synod to Last 2 Weeks **********His remarks reflect both the common loyalty among bishops to the Vatican and the considerable diversity of views among bishops who will be asked to review the effects of the Second Vatican Council, which ended 20 years ago. The 160 bishops chosen for the Synod will conduct two weeks of evaluation at the request of Pope John Paul II. The Synod has no decision-making power, and its results are regarded as nonbinding advice to the Pope. **********Bishop Malone's comments put into sharp relief many of the issues expected to draw the attention of the 160 bishops. In response to questions, he discussed the need for the church to adapt to new circumstances and to devise strategies to better inculcate a Catholic identity in young people. **********Troubled relations between bishops and theologians over the question of teaching authority and intellectual freedom have been a subject of growing controversy. Many theologians, including several who had been condemned as dissidents, were highly influential during the Second Vatican Council. **********Since then, the status of many liberal theologians has steadily declined. The Rev. Hans Kung, a prominent Swiss theologian, has been stripped of his license to teach in the name of the church. **********The ''theology of liberation'' popular in Latin America has been attacked by the church, and one of its proponents, the Rev. Leonardo Boff, silenced. The work of several other theologians has also been carefully scrutinized. **********Drive to Root Out Dissent **********Cardinal Ratziner, who oversees the work of theologians, has waged a stepped-up campaign to root out dissent since being appointed to his leadership of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1981. **********Bishop Malone, who is from Youngstown, Ohio, noted that ''there is a confrontation'' between bishops and theologians, but he strongly defended the role of the theologians as ''not merely one of serving the magisterium but of enriching it.'' ''Magisterium'' refers to the official teaching authority of the Pope and the Bishops. **********Bishop Malone said the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith held the key to harmony between the groups. **********''So much depends on the choice the Holy Father makes of the person who heads that office, so I would say that that is one of the obstacles today,'' he said. ''Not the only one but the most easily identifiable one.'' **********Asked whether theologians have the right to speak freely, Bishop Malone replied: ''Do you mean that they have the right to express their views? Yes. But I wouldn't want to go without some nuances on this. It has been a while since I have attended to that. In principle, yes.'' **********Regarding the contribution of theologians, he said: ''Ideally, there would be an openness on the part of the Pope and bishops to see that these new expressions of truth would be accepted. But there is a confrontation between the two.'' **********Assesses Celibacy Policy **********The usually soft-spoken, genial bishop also addressed the issues of celibacy and birth control. **********While endorsing the church's policy of a celibate priesthood, he said a change might be warranted if a dwindling supply of priests hampered the ability of the faithful to receive the sacrament of communion. **********''If the church-made law of celibacy so hobbles us that we can no longer be a eucharistic church, this law of celibacy would have to give way,'' Bishop Malone said. **********''So I am prepared to say, while in my opinion, celibate priesthood is desirable, that if we would envision a country and a time where persons of significant numbers would be deprived of eucharist because of a shortage of clergy caused by mandatory celibacy, then at that point the church should modify the celibacy requirement for that part of the world,'' he said. **********Widely Disregarded in West **********On the church's ban on artificial birth control, the Bishop said it was ''widely disregarded'' in the United States and other Western countries, a sign that ''a great number of Catholics are selective about what they select and what they reject of the teachings of the church.'' **********Bishop Malone said he supported the birth control teaching, but he emphasized that many Catholics might be unable to obey it. The 1967 birth control encyclical ''has within it some pastoral directives which encourage parish priests as confessors to encourage penitents to strive for the ideal which the encyclical teaches even though for certain reasons and at certain times they are not able to reach that ideal,'' **********Many studies have cited rejection of the encyclical - titled 'Humanae Vitae'' or ''Of Human Life'' - as a major source of disaffection from the church. **********Bishop Malone said that on a recent visit to Poland, Polish priests told him: ''The difference with you Americans is that you say the 'Humanae Vitae' teaching is wrong. We don't say that. We say it's right, but that for reasons we cannot do anything about, it is sometimes impossible for us to live up to it.'' **********Some Vatican officials, out of similar frustration over rejection of the encyclical, have also appealed to that strain of tradition that regards church law as something to aspire to rather than as an enforceable policy. **********Reconsideration Unlikely **********Bishop Malone said reconsideration of the encyclical could take place if the Pope assigned it as a topic for a synod of bishops. But he said that the prospect was highly unlikely and that free discussion depended on the actions of the Pope. At the last Synod on penance in 1983, the Pope's intervention pre-empted the question of finding a way to grant forgiveness to groups on the matter in addition to the traditional means through individual confession. **********''I think it is fair to say that there was a moderate groundswell for that,'' the Bishop said. But he said the Pope's stress on individual confession in the days leading up to the Synod effectively stifled the proposal. **********Bishop Malone reminded his listeners of the enormous influence the Pope can have in shaping the course of any such synod."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/business/prospects-the-drag-from-debt.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Already it has fractured computer experts, both in industry and academe, into two bitterly divided camps. **********On Monday night, the controversy over the proposal's feasibility came to the nation's mecca of computer research, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where a two-hour debate pitted a pair of scientific advisers to the Pentagon against two scientists who called the project a waste of the software industry's most precious resource - its programming talent. **********The debate was the first public airing of a technical and political dispute that has dominated the pages of industry journals and served as grist for lunchtime arguments in corporate cafeterias from Boston's Route 128 to California's Silicon Valley. **********Unsettled Questions **********The software in question would direct a space- and ground-based system designed to destroy enemy missiles within minutes of their launching. But the Pentgon has yet to settle on the system's basic design, so from the outset of the M.I.T. debate it was clear there would be little agreement on the issues, much less the answers. **********''A simple yes or no answer will probably not suffice,'' said Michael L. Dertouzos, director of M.I.T.'s Laboratory of Computer Science, who moderated the debate. **********By night's end, it was equally evident that many computer scientists, though hungry for funds to attack perhaps the biggest programming problem in history, have grave doubts. **********''It might not be impossible to put something up there that will work,'' conceded David L. Parnas, one of the debaters. ''But there will never be a day when we will trust it,'' he said, ''and thus we will get no benefit from it.'' A professor at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Dr. Parnas has become a leader of the opposition to the Strategic Defense Initiative. He resigned in July from a Pentagon advisory group studying the subject, calling its efforts futile. **********The audience that jammed M.I.T.'s Kresge Auditorium, estimated at 1,200, seemed partial to Dr. Parnas's views. The event drew computer experts from virtually every major high-tech company ringing Boston: programmers from Data General and Bolt, Baranek and Newman; systems designers from Digital Equipment and International Business Machines' Cambridge Scientific Center. **********It also attracted academics from the M.I.T. physics department, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Lincoln Laboratories. Already the impact of Star Wars research is being felt at M.I.T., which ranks among the top five contractors on the Strategic Defense Initiative this year, with about $59 million committed to research. In all, it is expected that about $26 billion will be spent on Star Wars research in the first five years of the program. **********Most of the M.I.T. activity is centered at Lincoln, the semiautonomous laboratory 15 miles west of the Cambridge campus, and only a part of the research involves computer aspects of the project. **********The programming tasks involved in designing a space defense system would be enormous. Coordinating hundreds of sensors and antisatellite weapons, the computer system must be capable of tracking about 30,000 warheads. It would have to allocate weapons to destroy them, while keeping track of which warheads were stopped and which had slipped through the defenses. **********Further complicating matters, the system must be trained to discriminate real warheads from 300,000 or more decoys. And it must be able to withstand attack, since the computers governing the system would likely become an enemy's first target. Making the whole thing tick could require between 10 million and 100 million lines of computer code - with little, if any, tolerance for mistakes. **********As the Internal Revenue Service learned when it installed a new computer system and as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has learned with the space shuttle, large programs brim over with bugs - including some that do not reveal themselves for years. **********Computer experts disagree over whether the increase in the number of bugs is proportional or exponential as programs grow larger. But they agree it poses a grave problem: In a survey of ordinary commercial software, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company found an average of 300 ''serious errors'' in every 1,000 lines of program. **********The experts even disagree on whether there will be sufficient progress in software development to make the space defense system feasible in 20 years. **********Dr. Parnas drew from his large supply of humorous stories about computer foul-ups as he argued that it would be virtually impossible to test Strategic Defense Initiative software exhaustively. ''It's unreliable,'' he said. ''One never really knows when the last bug has been removed.'' **********Arguments that ''redundant systems'' could be built - esentially computers that backstop other computers - left both Dr. Parnas and his debate partner, Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer science professor at M.I.T., unimpressed. Inevitably, noted Dr. Weizenbaum, there would be disputes among the computers, the kind of inconsistencies that have shut down several space shuttle launchings seconds before liftoff. **********More Dangerous Adversary **********''In a space shuttle launch, the adversary is nature, the conditions are known in advance, and we still have failures,'' he noted. ''In S.D.I. there is an adversary who is trying to blow up your whole system.'' **********The evening's harder task - proving that a still undefined computer system could work - belonged to Danny Cohen, a professor at the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California, and Charles L. Seitz, a California Institute of Technology professor. **********''There is no fundamental reason that it should be impossible to meet the computing requirements of S.D.I.,'' said Dr. Cohen, chairman of the Pentagon's advisory committee on the battle management system. **********Like other proponents of the system, Dr. Cohen dismissed the contention that a single, huge computer program would be required. Instead, he suggested that the answer lay in an old programming technique - writing in ''modules'' that would govern independent sensors, weapons and other hardware. **********The advantage of such a technique is that errors are contained. Just as one part of a modular sofa can be replaced, one part of a modular program can be fixed, or circumvented, when a software error crops up. Because many of the programs operate independently, or are only loosely linked to other parts, they avoid what Dr. Dertouzos called the ''Swiss-watch syndrome'' - depending on a central system that keeps ticking only if all the elements are precisely coordinated. **********Modular methods, Dr. Cohen noted, were used in programming Boeing 747's and the Apollo spacecraft. ''All of them have bugs,'' he said. ''Yet they are trustworthy. They work.'' **********However, Dr. Cohen acknowledged that success depended on ''an unconventional system architecture'' - the term Strategic Defense Initiative officials use to describe the still-undecided design of the overall system -that would allow a programmer to use conventional software engineering techniques. **********''There is no magic,'' he said. ''Overreliance on radical software development approaches may not produce a reliable system.'' **********By the evening's end, however, many in the audience said that Professors Cohen and Seitz had failed to answer many of the key criticisms. Software modules, they noted, are only as reliable as the communications links between them. And, their critics contended, the two scientists had said almost nothing about how the system could be tested, if at all. **********''By now, Parnas's critique is well known,'' said Robert Congdon, who works for a small computer company. ''They had no concrete rebuttals.'' **********Dr. Dertouzos warned that the computer industry confronts a ''double ignorance'' about the fate of giant projects in computer science. ''We are an experimental science,'' he said. **********''I hate to say it, but we are modern alchemists,'' he said, gesturing as if he were pouring one vial of chemicals into another. ''If it works, we take notes,'' he joked. ''If it explodes, well, we take notes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/17/business/about-real-estate-new-owner-to-renovate-3d-biggest-li-retail-mall.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1985-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 863, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  NEW OWNER TO RENOVATE 3D-BIGGEST L.I.

Many were built in the 1950's and 1960's as the nation's suburban housing developments took shape. **********Typical among these shopping centers is the sprawling Mid-Island Plaza in Hicksville, L.I. Built as a medium-size strip center in 1956, Mid-Island was enclosed, upgraded and expanded in 1969, bringing its size to 1.5 million square feet. **********Although it is the third-largest retail center on Long Island, Mid-Island has had problems, including a high vacancy rate. Now the shopping center is getting a new owner with money to spend on expansion. **********The center has always been a moneymaker. Its 140 tenants - which include Sterns as the anchor department store, The Gap, Casual Corner, J. J. Newberry, a Frusen-Gladje ice cream shop, Kinney Shoes, Record World and The Limited - had sales of $100 million last year and drew 12 million visitors. **********But Mid-Island, like other shopping malls of its era, has recently felt competition from smaller, boutique-style centers, discount shopping malls and entertainment-oriented, mixed-use facilities such as South Street Seaport. In addition, Mid-Island suffered a blow in 1980 when one of its anchor stores, Korvettes, closed after the company went bankrupt. The mall was once virtually filled, but its vacancy rate started creeping up and now stands at 35 percent. Today about 500,000 square feet of space is available for rent. **********Recently the owners of Mid-Island, Stackler & Frank, a real estate development company that built the mall, agreed to sell it for an undisclosed amount to the Delco Development Corporation, a Long Island-based company that says it will will pump $10 million into renovating and expanding the center. **********Delco Development, established in 1967 by Allen Yudell and his brother, Martin, is now building a high-fashion mall in Roslyn as well as a strip center in Hicksville a mile north of Mid-Island Plaza. Allen Yudell said: **********''We think this center has a great deal of potential. It has a prime location and is easily reached by car as well as by train and bus, and we have long been impressed with the area's demographics.'' **********The 70-acre center is on Route 106-107 between Old Country Road and Jericho Turnpike, two major east-west thoroughfares in Nassau County. It is also less than a mile from exits on both the Long Island Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway. According to the Long Island Regional Planning Board, the average per-household income in the communities within a five-mile radius of Mid-Island Plaza ranges from $40,000 to $48,000 a year. **********Although Mid-Island lacks a tenant for its second anchor store, it sits across the street from a Sears store, which the Yudells feel serves as another anchor for the mall. **********''We are currently analyzing the trade area and trying to determine if we will upscale the center's retail mix or if it will be turned into a promotional center like an discount or off-price mall,'' Mr. Yudell said during a tour of the center. ''We are talking to several stores that are not now represented in the trade area. But we think that with Franklin Avenue in Garden City having lost its importance as a mecca for the carriage trade, stores at the level of Bloomingdales, Saks or Lord & Taylor are not an unrealistic anchor tenant for us.'' **********Whatever its retail style, the center - which will be renamed Delco Plaza at Mid-Island - is to be enlarged and renovated. Plans are being drawn by the architectural firms of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum and R.A.L. Associates of Hempstead. The plans include the addition of 500,000 square feet of retail space and the redesign and resurfacing of all of the center's buildings. Under consideration is the addition of a skylight. Interior work will include replacement of the existing carpeting and hard flooring with a new surface. **********According to Ronald Bruder, president of the Brookhill Group, a Manhattan-based real estate development and consulting company, many older shopping centers have been successfully upgraded in ways similar to the ones Delco is planning for Mid-Island. **********''New shopping centers tend to be multilevel, multipurpose gallerias, but the regional malls can still be a very viable source of income for their owners,'' said Mr. Bruder, whose company has renovated shopping malls in the South and Northeast. ''There are, of course, risks involved in any major rehabilitation effort. But as a rule the dollar-for-dollar costs of rehabilitating a shopping mall center are more favorable than the renovation of an office or housing project. The renovation of a retail project usually invoves new signage, exterior work and new parking.

Gorbachev, hold a summit meeting in Geneva. **********John B.

Kenny Jr., a former arms control official and now president of the Arms Control Association, said he believed the Government was ''no longer going to respect the treaty.'' **********Officials Under Nixon **********The former officials, who served under President Nixon, said they were dismayed by remarks made Sunday by Robert C. McFarlane, the White House national security adviser, and on Tuesday by a senior White House official who asked that his name be withheld. **********During an interview on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. McFarlane said ''research involving new physical concepts, as well as testing, as well as development, indeed, are approved and authorized by the treaty.'' **********The unnamed senior official answered ''yes'' during a news briefing on Tuesday when asked if this was now a ''fixed position'' of the Administration. **********The new position outlined by Mr. McFarlane appeared to represent a substantial diplomatic shift, although it seemed to have little significance for the 15 major experiments now scheduled to ''demonstrate'' technologies for the Stategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' In the past, the Administration had acknowledged that field testing and, certainly, development of antimissile systems was forbidden by the treaty. **********But it had argued that the contemplated tests would either be of ''subcomponents,'' rather than components of a weapon, or would be ''disaggregated'' in ways that would make them less than an integrated, operational weapon, or that the beam brightness of directed energy devices would be kept too low to give them an antimissile capability. **********The new interpretation of the treay would apparently permit almost any level of field testing and the actual development of useable weapons. Administration officials said the new policy was agreed on at meetings last Friday and Tuesday of the Special Arms Control Group committee, of which Mr. McFarlane is the chairman. **********What the Treaty Says **********This is an issue because the main and explicit purpose of the treaty is to prohibit the development and deployment of nationwide, or even large area, antimissile defenses by either party. **********Article five of the treaty says the parties undertake ''not to develop, test or deploy ABM systems or components which are sea-based, air-based, space-based or mobile land-based.'' **********''Agreed Statement D,'' which was appended to the treaty by Mr. Smith and Soviet negotiators, says that ''in order to insure fulfillment of the obligation not to deploy ABM systems and their components'' the two nations ''agree that in the event ABM systems based on other physical principles and including components capable of substituting for ABM interceptor missiles, ABM launchers or ABM radars are created in the future, specific limitations on such systems and their components would be subject to discussion'' and agreement in accord with provisions for rewriting the treaty. **********Mr. McFarlane said on Sunday that Agreed Statement D meant the ''treaty does, indeed, sanction research, testing and development of these new systems.'' The reference to new systems is to such technologies as lasers or particle beams and new technology sensors to find and track targets, in contrast to the nuclear-tipped antimissile rockets developed by both nations in the late 1960's and early 1970's. **********The former Government officials, who helped write the treaty, said the Soviet Union had never agreed to Mr. McFarlane's interpretation, and Mr. Rhinelander said the Administration opinion conflicted with ''what we thought we did'' in negotiating the treaty. **********Mr. Smith said that disputes over legal nuances were less important than the question of ''whether the treaty is about to collapse.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/03/world/the-disaster-in-bhopal-lessons-for-the-future.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Diamond", "pub_date": "1985-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2372, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE DISASTER IN BHOPAL: LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE", "print_headline": "THE DISASTER IN BHOPAL: LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE", "body_text": " **********In this teeming central Indian city where an industrial gas leak in December killed more than 2,000 people, the problems and dilemmas faced by multinational companies in developing countries come into sharp focus. **********Vendors sell dried cow-dung for fuel while nearby factories install automated solar-energy devices. A business executive does financial statements on a computer while outside his window two men clothed in little more than rags try to push a rice-laden wooden cart out of a drainage ditch. **********At the airport on the edge of town, a jet lands on a wavy asphalt runway; the luggage is sometimes carried away on a cart pulled by a bullock. A new television transmission tower looms over the countryside; in front of it, a woman in a sari carries gravel for construction in a basket on her head. **********Old Ways Not Replaced **********The advances that have made India an industrial power have, in most areas, not replaced previous methods. Instead, the new technology forms a veneer on a continuum of life styles and perceptions that stretch into the past. **********In this setting, the Union Carbide Corporation and its Indian affiliate, Union Carbide India Ltd., built in Bhopal a complex pesticide factory where, on Dec. 3, a leak of methyl isocyanate caused the worst industrial accident in history. In addition to those killed, 200,000 people were injured. **********The accident, many Indian technological experts and others say, has raised questions about doing business in the third world - not only for the multinational companies but for the host countries as well. **********'A Lot of Risks' **********''Western technology came to this country but not the infrastructure for that technology,'' said Dr. S. R. Kamat, a prominent Bombay expert on industrial health and the hazards of development. **********''A lot of risks have been taken here,'' he said. ''Machinery is outdated. Spare parts are not included. Maintenance is inadequate. Bhopal is the tip of an iceberg, an example of lapses not only in India but by the United States and many other countries.'' **********Since the accident, scientists, Government officials, policy makers, medical experts, cultural specialists and business leaders - including officials from Union Carbide - have converged on the city to glean the lessons of Bhopal. The city, they say, has become a laboratory for the study of how industrial companies can better conduct business in the third world - and what steps might be taken to avoid a repetition of what happened here. **********Interviews with more than a hundred specialists, officials, residents of Bhopal and others suggest that several lessons have already begun to emerge. These are some of the issues being discussed: **********- Hazardous facilities often pose added risks in developing nations, where skilled labor and public understanding are often lacking. Special training is needed to compensate for these extra risks. **********- Public education is critical in developing countries, where people often do not understand the hazards of toxic substances. Repeated drills and clear warning signals are needed. **********- The more rural areas of the developing world should not be used to test complex new technology. **********- A sense of urgency about all safety problems and attention to worst-case possibilities - routine in industrial countries but often not transferred to developing countries - should be part of worker training, especially in plants with a high turnover of personnel. **********- The company headquarters should audit its plants in developing countries frequently, perhaps more often than it audits plants at home. **********- Sophisticated backup safety systems, often installed in industrial nations, are needed to compensate for lapses in training and staff in developing nations, where they are needed more. **********- Company executives should be technically - not just administratively - trained in businesses that use toxic materials; such training can compensate for a lack of technical know-how in the local plant staff. **********- Many areas of the developing world are growing rapidly and without zoning laws. Suitable buffers should be placed around the factory to prevent the dangers of crowding. **********- Cultural differences between foreign and host countries should be considered. If preventive maintenance is a new concept, it should be more thoroughly taught. **********- Host governments should closely and continually inspect hazardous factories and their managements, enforcing strict and quick sanctions for safety lapses. **********- In making agreements with multinational companies, the governments of developing countries should consider only those technologies that can be safely handled in the long run. It may be necessary to change laws that mandate turning factories over to local control completely. **********Foreign Operations Still Welcome in India Many technological experts note that India has tried to use new technology to solve its problems of food and medical care and that companies such as Union Carbide have been well-regarded as helping India to achieve those goals. **********Thus, despite the anger generated by the Bhopal accident, it is clear, they say, that multinationals do not face wholesale expulsion from India - although there is talk among state and central Government officials of nationalizing the Bhopal plant, which is on Government-leased land. **********And while there have been official statements that the Bhopal plant will not again make hazardous materials, many here believe that the plant will reopen. The jobs are needed in a country where unemployment is high and there is no welfare system: those without jobs often must beg or face starvation. **********''People here say: 'We have already lost 2,000 lives. Must we lose 2,000 jobs too?' '' said Paul Shrivastava, a native of Bhopal and an associate professor of management at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration, who returned home to study the accident. **********Officials in India note that multinational companies provide the country with technology, skill, capital and equipment that might otherwise take years to develop indigenously. The Government, they say, is keen to continue joint ventures between Indian interests and foreign companies. **********India and other countries provide multinational companies with benefits in return, according to a wide variety of studies in the United States. The companies have gained large new markets and have often been able to produce products inexpensively because of a cheap labor force and fewer requirements to install expensive environmental and worker-protection equipment, those studies said. **********In December, the Government approved 194 projects between Indian and foreign companies, according to the Indian Investment Center, a Government-sponsored group that tries to encourage investment. **********Those included, it said, 47 from the United States, the most of any country. The projects involved production of batteries, computer parts, steam turbines, oil-drilling tools and even a plant to make phosgene, a poison that is used in making methyl isocyanate, or MIC. **********In the last two years, agreements have been reached for four new Union Carbide plants: a battery plant; one to produce calcium carbide, which is used in making battery materials; one to bottle specialty gases such as helium and argon, and one to make equipment that separates oxygen from the atmosphere for bottling. **********Technology Spread Thin On an Ancient Culture **********There are many success stories of advanced technology in India, many specialists say. The country's airlines run a busy and virtually accident-free schedule, nuclear reactors supply electricity, Indian scientists and engineers do advanced research in chemistry, physics and biotechnology. **********The country has the third-largest number of technical students in college in the world, after the United States and the Soviet Union, according to a United Nations study two years ago. **********But the country has 750 million people and many technological industries to support, the Indian experts say. The considerable technical skill, they say, is spread thin. **********A recent study, ''Multinationals and Self-Reliance,'' by the Indian Institute of Public Administration in New Delhi found that of 1,695 top employees at seven leading foreign drug companies here, more than a quarter were only high school graduates. **********The new Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, has said that he wants more technology to help his country develop. Last month a study by the Birla Institute of Scientific Research, a respected private research unit, concluded that the growth of India's technological progress was much less than that in many other countries. It said India had the financial resources to grow faster. **********Dr. Shrivastava, the New York University professor, said the ability to handle new technology here is more a question of training and management than basic ability and discipline. **********''Much more attention must be paid to the support systems for new technology and the culture in which it exists before the technology is located here,'' he said. **********Bhopal has grown swiftly since it was made the capital of the state of Madhya Pradesh in 1956. But there is only one telephone for every thousand people, according to state officials; most of the population has running water for only a few hours a day, and there are few street signs, traffic lights, washing machines, hair dryers, computers or automated equipment of any kind. **********On the narrow, crowded streets of Bhopal's old city, 2,000 years of civilization fight for space. Cows, goats, scooters, buses, cars, carts, bicycles, water buffalo, three-wheeled taxis, horse-drawn carriages, men in business suits and women in tribal dress travel in both directions on 12-foot-wide thoroughfares hemmed in by shops with their wares in the line of traffic. **********When Union Carbide decided to build a factory in Bhopal, many people familiar with its development say, the city was a technological ingenue. **********''When we set up this plant, we used workers just out of the agricultural age,'' said Kamal K. Pareek, the senior project engineer during the building of the factory's MIC facility in the late 1970's. ''You just can't afford to do anything wrong in a factory like this. There are safety devices, but a high level of skill and understanding is needed to use them properly. **********''What we needed,'' he continued, ''were people who had grown up with technology, not workers who have had technology imposed on them by economic circumstances.'' **********He and other technology experts said there was a big difference between someone educated in science and someone who has grown up understanding technology. **********''People here have the ability to operate by rote, and the capacity for providing rote skills exists,'' Dr. Shrivastava said. ''But that is not the same as saying that new technology can be handled in all its dimensions.'' **********Key among the problems is the lack of emphasis on preventive maintenance, the Indian technological experts said. ''The idea of spending money now to save money later is a concept completely alien in what is basically a subsistence economy,'' said Kiran Rana, a chemical engineer and native of Kashmir in northern India who now lives and works in the United States. **********''We Indians start very well,'' Mr. Pareek said, ''but we are not meticulous enough to follow up adequately.'' **********Accident May Change Goals for Technology Officials here say that because of the accident they will more closely match what multinationals have to offer with the needs of the country. And particularly for toxic industries, they say, there will be much more examination of each plan from both the supply and the operational viewpoints. **********''Concern about hazards will be a major part of the scrutiny of new proposals from now on, particularly when chemical processes are involved,'' said L. K. Jha, a Government economist and former industrial adviser to the Prime Minister. **********''We have the technical capability to handle any kind of technology,'' he said, ''but we must insure that the more hazardous kinds are handled only by the most competent people and not in a routine fashion.'' **********He added that training levels for complex industrial plants had been inadequate, particularly for low-level employees. Government inspections, he said, will be increased. **********Such vigilance, many Indian officials and experts say, is long overdue. India has adequate environmental protection laws on the books, they say, but the laws have often not been enforced. **********Since the accident, many experts here have begun to question whether the Bhopal pesticide plant and other enterprises like it really perform the service that was specified under agreements with the Government allowing them to operate here: to transfer technological know-how to India. **********''An unfortunate assumption has been made - that when technology arrives here, it is transferred,'' said S. K. Goyal, head of the Corporate Studies Group, a Government-sponsored New Delhi University unit that studies corporate responsibility. **********''We are finding that the technology often just gets transferred to the premises of the subsidiary, not into the society as a whole,'' he said. ''It stays within the walls of the factory.'' **********Moreover, Indian experts are now saying, most of India is still rural and thus requires a different kind of technology than that which multinational corporations have provided in the past. What is needed, they say, is smaller- scale technology that is appropriate to small rural businesses and does not disrupt the social and cultural norms. **********This idea, called ''appropriate technology,'' is a subject of dispute among specialists who are trying to help developing countries progress. On the one side are those who argue that the smaller, less-efficient technologies are less disruptive to local values; the other group says that such a path is too slow and will not appreciably raise the standard of living of the people as much as is possible with industrialization and high technology. **********Some Indian technology officials contend that there is too much emphasis on high-powered goods and services while much of the country needs simple conveniences of life, such as a pulley to draw water from wells and a simple stove made from metal drums. Millions of people with such needs, they say, live in places like Bhopal, where new technology has not yet been integrated into the existing culture. **********Some also question whether the issues raised by the disaster will bring effective action. **********''This was a tragic accident,'' said K. L. Sahu, who collects official statistics on births, deaths, diseases and other aspects of life in Bhopal and the surrounding districts from a small government office in the city. **********''But industrial countries like yours,'' he said, ''may be more upset than people here. Two thousand people died in one place, but many more people die in smaller accidents. **********''It will take a year or so,'' he added, ''for this tragedy to be washed from the minds of the people. After that, many of the things we talk about now may be forgotten.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/05/business/shawmut-bank-investigated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shawmut Bank Investigated", "print_headline": "Shawmut Bank Investigated", "body_text": " **********The Shawmut Bank of Boston, which said it had disclosed all its failures to obey Federal cash-reporting rules, was told today that Federal auditors were looking at violations unreported by the bank. **********Gregg Ziegler, a Federal bank examiner, told the House Banking Committee that the newly found problems were related to a list of customers Shawmut had exempted from the requirement to report transactions over $10,000. **********He did not provide details after Government lawyers warned that he might jeopardize a Federal investigation of Shawmut. **********Mr. Ziegler's testimony came during the second day of hearings on violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, a law intended to help detect money laundering by drug dealers and other criminals. **********John P.

''What for?'' **********This is the poorer end of one of the world's poorest and most remote islands, Timor, where the cruelty of terrain and climate seems to know no bounds. Not even Kupang's Ferris wheel or its Mona Lisa coffee house, a decent restaurant by anyone's standards, seems worth that kind of detour. **********As for the unpolluted sea of clear aquamarine, the townsfolk turn their backs on it, in the manner of other island people who take for granted what foreigners find breathtaking. **********But Kupang has a special interest. It is the capital of the Indonesian province of Nusa Tenggara Timur, which includes the western end of Timor island and a couple of hundred other islands, 111 of them inhabited. This ''other Timor'' has not received the international attention accorded to neighboring East Timor - Timor Timur or ''Tim Tim'' in Indonesian -which Jakarta invaded and annexed nearly 10 years ago. **********Western Timor, part of Indonesia since the creation of the Republic of Indonesia in 1950, is a point of comparison for visitors going to the troubled east. Here similar Timorese people - Christians in a nation of Moslems - and a similar land have different histories, but some of the same problems. **********''My main problem?'' Governor Ben Mboi mused as he relaxed after dinner. ''When there are so many main problems, there is no main problem.'' **********Governor Mboi, a generous and talkative European-educated physician from the island of Flores, had invited the foreigners in town to join a 50th wedding anniversary party for the former Rajah of Kupang and his wife. **********Western Timor suffers most from a scarcity of water, the Governor said after a modest meal of local food and Australian wine, adding that two years ago there was no rain for 13 months. The soil is thin and poor. Per capita aid from the Government in Jakarta to the three million people in the province is only a fraction of what is sent to East Timor. Jakarta is developing East Timor rapidly to remove the economic causes of a guerrilla insurgency, to justify its seizure of the territory and, in the words of several officials, ''to overcome 400 years of Portuguese neglect.'' **********The Land Conspires **********The land itself conspires against the west. While East Timor grows some of the finest arabica coffee to sell and is steadily expanding its production of rice and other food for its own consumption, Western Timor's main export hope is cattle, particularly the white-booted Balinese cow, which Australians are breeding on a model ranch in the hills near So E, southeast of Kupang. **********Even one cow is a huge investment for a farmer in western Timor, where the annual per capita income is about $165 and people exist on the edge of sufficiency. Serious food shortages are avoided, the Governor said, only because of communication and transportation systems to distribute supplies from elsewhere. **********To be self-sufficient in food in this rocky place, a rural family would have to work 7 to 10 acres of land, Governor Mboi said. The average is about four-fifths of an acre. **********The paucity of economic resources is vividly illustrated in Kupang's sprawling market. Here there are no luxuries to satisfy dreams - unless a cake of soap would qualify. **********The wares, artistically arranged by vendors, included the most basic necessities: grains and beans, spices, cheap clothing and the omnipresent plastic pail. No paper products, no insect repellant, few medicinal items -there are medicine men who peddle those from door to door - and no locally weaved cloth, which a country weaver explained was produced only in necessity because the materials were too costly. Only foreigners could afford a handmade sarong, the woman said. **********A visitor browsing in the market, but not buying anything, was watched closely by a young man who said he had studied English in Bali. **********After a while he commented, apologetically: ''I guess these things are all out of date to you.'' **********''I do not believe too much in tourism,'' Governor Mboi said. **********But Kupang is getting a tourist hotel nonetheless. It will have 144 rooms ''of international standard'' looking down on a grassless hill to a small beach whose limestone underpinnings are being gradually depleted by local people trying to make a living by selling aggregate rock. **********''I figure by the time the hotel is finished, there will be no beach left,'' a local resident said. ''But at least there will be a paved road.'' **********Timor - mostly the east, but also to a smaller degree the western end - was once a destination for Australian vacationers. But tourism ended with the civil war in East Timor in the mid-1970's and has never revived. **********If tourism is ever to take off here, Governor Mboi says, it will depend on Bali, which is now so developed and overcrowded that people looking for a place to get away might be persuaded to drop in on Kupang. **********Kupang's new hotel will be called the Sasando, a truly melodious name. A sasando is a musical instrument, harplike in sound, that has been played in the region since the 15th century, Eduard Pah says. **********One of the nicest ways to spend an evening in Kupang is to get together with the Pah family for an informal session of music from the islands. **********Because of the largely Melanesian roots of Timorese, and the influence of the Portuguese, who came here in the 16th century, ahead of the Dutch, there are distinctive cultures in Timor that some fear could too easily be swamped not only by the West but also by Indonesia's Javanese majority and its more artistically advanced civilization. **********Mr. Pah, a retired teacher, and his wife, Suzan, who works in the local military hospital, may well be the world's experts on the music of Timor. Several years ago the Ford Foundation gave Mr. Pah, who was born on the island of Roti, a grant to preserve the sasando from extinction. **********Traditionally, a sasando was a 10-stringed instrument: a circular playing surface made of a length of bamboo mounted in a sound box fashioned from the broad leaf of the lontar palm. Mr. Pah now has a 32-string electronic version made in Australia of plastic and wood, an updating that does not seem to concern him, since he welcomes any effort to keep his beloved island harp alive. **********Timorese Jam Session **********When he is not traveling around Indonesia, or in Australia or Europe, Mr. Pah sometimes gathers six children and two daughters-in-law around him for a Timorese jam session, complete with Rotinese dancing. **********Mrs. Pah's clear soprano now and then drifts into a Western tune -''The Isle of Capri'' is one of her favorites. But before the evening ends, Mr. Pah comes back to base. **********''Before you leave Kupang,'' he says, ''let us sing you a Roti song of farewell.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/14/business/patents-treating-blood-plasma-to-curb-aids-virus.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  TREATING BLOOD PLASMA TO CURB AIDS VIRUS", "print_headline": "PATENTS;   TREATING BLOOD PLASMA TO CURB AIDS VIRUS", "body_text": " **********A method of treating blood plasma fractions to reduce the effect of viruses has been interpreted as offering advantages in preventing transmission of AIDS-related viruses to patients such as those suffering from hemophilia. **********Patent 4,556,558, granted Alan Rubinstein and assigned to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, covers heat treatment of the blood concentrate called Factor VIII to inactivate the AIDS microorganisms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/18/business/advertising-the-new-republic-adds-trade-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADVERTISING ;   The New Republic Adds Trade Campaign", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING ;   The New Republic Adds Trade Campaign", "body_text": " **********Can you imagine a magazine being around for 70 years and never running a trade ad to attract advertising?

Nowadays the financial rewards are still alluring, but stock and bond issues and corporate takeovers take place in an arena that pits one investment banking firm against another as never before. And the successful deal-makers are men and women who must possess the creativity of an artist, the fortitude of an athlete and the timing of a trader. **********In recruiting new investment bankers out of colleges and business schools, in fact, the big banks and brokerage firms look much more closely at candidates who combine those aptitudes rather than ones who have simply mastered their courses in business and finance and can make pleasant conversation. Indeed, they are looking more and more for candidates whose strong suits are flexibility and a sharp mind but who might not have any financial background. **********For those who can fill the bill, however, investment banking is among the highest-paying professions. Starting salaries of $50,000 a year with a likely bonus of $10,000 are commonplace for recruits with a master of business administration degree and little or no work experience to their credit. **********Demand is also strong for those with only undergraduate degrees, whose starting salaries are in the $30,000 range, and for graduates of business schools. That is because, in addition to heightened competition among Wall Street firms in takeovers and in the underwriting of securities, many large commercial banks are getting into the business of mergers and acquisitions, private placements and international bond deals, and their demand for people to staff these departments is soaring. ''All the big banks are trying to become players in the capital-markets area,'' said Kevin Sullivan, senior vice president of Warren Management Consultants, a New York executive-recruiting firm. ''It is causing the supply/demand ratios to go through the roof, both for new people and for seasoned Wall Streeters.'' **********A Fast-Paced Atmosphere **********The driving force behind any recruiting these days is the fast pace of the marketplace itself. At First National Bank of Chicago, J. Lynn Aylsworth 3d, senior vice president in charge of the capital-markets division, said the prime characteristic he would be looking for in the 12 to 15 people he expects to hire out of next spring's graduating class is the ability to be flexible and creative in light of changing market conditions for corporate-finance deals. ''We need people who have a trading mentality,'' he said, because ''the markets are operating on real time.'' **********Indeed, investment-banking products in this environment are constantly being structured to take advantage of ''windows of opportunity'' for certain types of deals, such as bonds that give investors the option of selling it back to the issuing corporation. **********At Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Douglas Ebert, executive vice president in charge of a new investment-banking group, said he wanted to hire ''someone who is a renegade, who does things a bit differently and has the initiative and guts to take a risk.'' That person, he added, should have a strong finance background, but above all he or she ''has got to have a fire in their stomach so that they don't mind having their dinner plans canceled if they have to put in 24 hours straight to get a deal done.'' **********John Perkowski, co-director of corporate finance at Paine Webber, said that at any point there might be as many as 10 to 20 financing products from which to choose and that he was looking for recruits who ''can become experts quickly'' and sell a new product idea to clients. ''Nowadays five different firms are going at a corporation with different ideas,'' he said. ''We need people who can link up what is going on in the markets with what a company wants.'' This year Paine Webber has hired 20 M.B.A.'s and 25 college graduates for its investment-banking effort. **********Recruits are evaluated on three levels, Mr. Perkowski said: ''intellectual capability, motivation and marketing skills.'' The first is critical, he said, because ''changes are rapid and complex, and we are working for the brightest lawyers and people in a company.'' In the area of motivation, he cited the following as examples of what he looks for: ''A demonstration of the competitive spirit, such as athletics, starting one's own business, and other things that show the willingness to work very hard and be the best.'' **********At Merrill Lynch & Company, Barry Friedberg, the director of the investment banking division, said that he too was looking more for personal qualities than precise technical skills in the recruits he hires, both from colleges and business schools. College graduates are brought into Merrill Lynch's investment-banking department for a special two-year program where they work on statistics and spreadsheet analysis. **********Well-Roundedness Prized **********And at Dean Witter Reynolds, M. William Benedetto, executive vice president and manager of investment banking, said, ''If all a graduate has is accounting and business, he or she better have some other activity, such as an interest in opera, to show he or she is well-rounded.'' More often, the investment-banking prospects hired right out of college major in such subjects as Chinese history, philosophy or other liberal-arts subjects. **********''We have de-emphasized business and accounting,'' Mr. Benedetto said. He added that college graduates who have majored in accounting and business and are hired by Wall Street investment-banking firms ''make good associate investment bankers. They are technically competent. But they often do not go much higher than that.'' **********Liberal-arts graduates, on the other hand, he said, show greater growth potential because they tend to be more flexible and have greater communicative skills.

He added that ''I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of graduates these days.'' Dean Witter hired 12 M.B.A.'s and 15 college graduates this year. The 1986 class, he said, ''will be even more weighted toward college graduates.'' **********Mr. Perkowski of Paine Webber said he also did not require a business degree for the recruits to his firm's investment-banking department.

Ford's sales for the year were $52.37 billion, up 17.8 percent from $44.46 billion. **********Car sales are continuing to increase, with the six major domestic producers reporting a 2.3 percent increase in the first 10 days of February over a year ago. (Page D4.) Higher auto sales in January were cited as the major reason for a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in retail sales last month. (Page D4.) **********In the fourth quarter, Ford said it earned $651 million after taxes in the United States, down 15 percent from 1983, largely as a result of higher taxes. The company has used up its tax credit carry-forwards earned during the slump that ended in 1983. Ford lost $1.54 billion in 1980, $1.06 billion in 1981 and $658 million in 1982. **********Ford's after-tax profits from its overseas operations rose $57 million, to $70 million, in the fourth quarter. **********Sales Record in Europe **********Overseas in 1984, Ford set a sales record in Europe. It outsold its European rivals the first time - although it came in a close second to Renault in 1983 - and posted an increase in its market share for the fourth straight year. The company's share of the domestic car market rose two percentage points in 1984, to 19.2 percent. **********Auto industry analysts said that Ford's earnings reflected renewed buyer demand for domestic cars in what may turn out to have been the auto industry's most profitable year in history. G.M. earned a record $4.52 billion last year, or $14.22 a share, and the Chrysler Corporation is expected to announce on Thursday that it, too, posted record profits. **********''It was a pretty good quarter for Ford and a very good year,'' said Harvey Heinbach, who follows the auto industry for Merrill Lynch. ''They enjoyed the benefits of stronger U.S. demand, and the only real weakness is in Ford's overseas operations.'' **********Worldwide sales of cars, trucks and tractors was put at 5.7 million, up 13.3 percent. Of that, 3.6 million vehicles were sold in North America. **********Caution From Executives **********''Their big jump in volume gave them a tremendous earnings improvement,'' Mr. Heinbach said. But Ford's top executives - Donald E. Petersen, the chairman, and Harold A. Poling, the president - cautioned that the company, which was hit hard by the gasoline shortage and sudden demand for small cars in the late 1970's, must remain profitable if it is to recoup the money it has invested in new products in the last five years. **********''One or two good profit years don't necessarily repair a balance sheet that was badly hurt in the early 1980's,'' the executives said in a statement. ''In the United States, Ford still has a cumulative loss of $1 billion after taxes since mid-1979.'' **********Ford has spent more than $16 billion on capital expenditures, research and development since then, and claims that it has made gains in quality and productivity. It has also updated the image of the cars it has introduced since then, borrowing and refining the aerodynamic shapes of its European models. **********Ford's new Taurus and Mercury Sable models, which are scheduled to go on sale later this year as replacements for the durable LTD and Marquis models, bear some resemblance to such hot-selling European models as the Audi 5000, and Ford hopes that the new cars will appeal to buyers who find foreign cars more attractive than what Detroit is offering now. **********But, the two executives noted, Ford's financial condition ''remains substantially diminished from historical levels.'' The company's debt is 66 percent higher than in mid-1979 and its equity is nearly $750 million less."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/02/world/around-the-world-prelate-in-el-salvador-criticizes-court-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Prelate in El Salvador Criticizes Court System", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Prelate in El Salvador Criticizes Court System", "body_text": " **********Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the Auxiliary Archbishop of San Salvador, today criticized the country's judicial system and interrogation methods. **********''We regret a practice that seems to be on the increase, namely interrogations and inhuman treatment of people accused of political crimes,'' he said in his weekly homily.''Generally, they end in declarations at times totally divorced from reality.'' **********The Archbishop also said four American churchwomen murdered in El Salvador five years ago would be remembered in special services in the country's Catholic churches Monday. **********The women were found dead on Dec. 2, 1980, near the town of Zacatecoluca.

Icahn, the Wall Street financier, announced a tender offer yesterday for control of Uniroyal Inc., one of the nation's major rubber companies, at $18 a share. Uniroyal later in the day termed the offer inadequate. **********Uniroyal's stock led the New York Stock Exchange most-active list yesterday on turnover of more than 4.3 million shares, closing up 87.5 cents, to $18.75. **********The fact that the stock closed higher than the Icahn offer indicated that the market was expecting a higher bid or possibly a leveraged buyout proposal. **********Mr. Icahn said he owns almost 10 percent of Uniroyal stock, the bulk of which was purchased last week. He said that the tender offer was conditioned on the defeat of anti-takeover proposals scheduled to be voted on Tuesday by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in New York. **********The stringent measures proposed by Uniroyal, which is based in Middlebury, Conn., would effectively remove it as a candidate for a hostile takeover. **********Proxy Fight **********Mr. Icahn, in opposing the measures, has started a proxy fight and heads a group called the Committee for the Protection of Stockholder Rights. **********He said the committee had got in touch with the company April 3 to state its opposition to the proposed measures and had told Uniroyal that it would be prepared to make a friendly offer to acquire the entire company but was rebuffed. **********Mr. Icahn's tender offer sought a sufficient number of shares over 50 percent to control the company, which has 34 million shares outstanding. **********He said that if his offer were successful, he would merge Uniroyal into a company that he would control and give $18 worth of debt securities for each Uniroyal share that had not been tendered by stockholders. **********Analysts were divided on what would happen now. Richard Haydon of Gabelli & Company said Mr. Icahn might increase his offer or another company might appear with a higher price. **********He said he thought the stock was worth somewhere in the low 20's and that Uniroyal, with a good balance sheet and ''superb management,'' was an underpriced equity. **********He said very few investors had focused on the company in the past because of its ''stigma as a high-cost producer in a marginal business.'' **********Robert Bartels, an analyst with William Blair & Company of Chicago, said the stock had risen yesterday only on speculation that some other bidder might appear. He said the only other likely candidate would be a Japanese tire company looking to gain a foothold here. **********But a Japanese company would not be able to put together an offer in the next few days before the stockholders meeting, he said, adding, ''They just don't move that quickly.'' **********Mr. Bartels said the stock was fully priced now and he was advising his clients to sell on strength. **********Donald F. DeScenza of Nomura Securities International Inc. said he did not see buyers lining up for Uniroyal. **********''I don't think the company has enough intrinsic earning power to justify a higher price and I don't see anything in the asset base to suggest that it has a high liquidation value,'' he said. **********Harvey Storch of Fahnestock & Company said he thought Uniroyal's unfunded pension fund liability of $307 million acted as a ''poison pill'' potent enough to keep many would-be acquirers away. **********Many analysts pointed to the pension liabilities, which have been whittled down from $476 million two years ago, as a barrier to any takeover, but some also said that Uniroyal had an adequate cash flow to compensate for that in part. **********Analysts said Mr. Icahn might be ''putting the company into play'' before the stockholders meeting in an attempt to realize a higher price on his investment. Others suggested that he was seeking ''greenmail'' - to have the company buy his stake at a premium. **********Mr. Icahn, however, said that he would not sell his Uniroyal shares back to the company unless the company made the same offer to all shareholders. **********Chief Executive Lauded **********Joseph P. Flannery, Uniroyal's chief executive, has done a ''very good job,'' Mr. Storch said, ''in increasing earnings, restructuring the company and divesting it of unprofitable or marginal businesses and working down the pension fund liability.'' **********Uniroyal said yesterday that it continued to urge its stockholders to vote for its proposed amendments to the company's charter. **********Among other changes, the proposals would stagger the terms of directors and require a vote of 80 percent of the stockholders to remove a director. **********AT A GLANCE **********UNIROYAL INC. **********All dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data **********Three months ended Dec. 3119841983 **********Revenues $518,400$507,300 **********Net income 61,50024,500 **********Earnings per share $1.66$0.66 **********Year ended Dec. 3119841983 **********Revenues $2,121,688$1,935,578 **********Net income 77,14666,998 **********Earnings per share $2.13$2.03 **********Main Lines of Business Contribution to 1984 revenues **********Tire and related products 48% **********Chemical Rubber and plastics 32% **********Engineered products and services 20% **********Total assets, Dec. 31, 1984 **********$1,453,418 Current assets ***********846,654 Long-term debt ***********168,655 Book value per share, Dec. 31, 1984 **********$19.47 Stock price, April 10, 1985 N.Y.S.E. consolidated close 18 3/4Stock price, 52-week range 9 3/4-18 3/4Employees, Dec. 31, 1984 20,600Headquarters Middlebury, Connecticut"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/17/world/for-un-at-40-mixed-message-from-reagan.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1985-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR U.N.

Gromyko. That moment summarized the double political edge reflected in domestic opinion polls: The public doubts the United Nations' effectiveness, but strongly thinks it should continue to exist. **********''I think the Administration has looked on the U.N. more as a nuisance center, a sounding board for those who don't like us, rather than as a center for the resolution of problems,'' said Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who was one of the United Nations' earliest supporters and remains one of its heartiest. ''This gradual drift away from a strong belief in the U.N. began during the Vietnam era and is not unique with this Administration. It has become a field for propaganda.'' **********If so, supporters of the Administration contend that the United States has at least become a sharper participant in this field. **********''I think the posture of the United States has greatly improved,'' said Charles M. Lichenstein, former deputy United States representative in the United Nations Security Council, who now is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ''It doesn't mean we win very many, but it does mean we state our case with greater clarity.'' **********The new budget restriction from Congress would require that, unless weighted voting is introduced next year, the United States will pay no more than 20 percent of United Nations agency costs. That would be a cut from the present 25 percent limit, under which United States support is expected to reach $196 million this year. **********The chief sponsor of the cut, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, says the motive is budget fat in the United Nations bureaucracy, not the frustrating nature of global politics at the world body. **********But observers of the birthday can note the significant shift from 40 years ago, when the United States provided more than 40 percent of the United Nations' budget in the initial postwar glow of world optimism. **********The change in attitudes since then was demonstrated most dramatically by the Reagan Administration when it decided to withdraw last year from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, one of the institution's major financing arms. **********Last week, the State Department, acting under another Congressional mandate, ordered tighter traveling restrictions within the New York area on more than 400 workers at the United Nations Secretariat who are citizens of the Soviet Union or five other nations suspected of clandestine activities. **********The 'Dockside' Farewell **********The mood shift from the founders' early hope was pungently expressed two years ago when Mr. Lichenstein, representing the Reagan Administration in the United Nations, advised members disgruntled at criticism and restrictions in the host country that they were free to move the organization elsewhere and that they would find him and other Americans ''down at dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail into the sunset.'' **********President Reagan said that the remark had ''the hearty approval of most people in America'' and that, ''if they chose to leave, goodbye.'' **********A week later, however, the President was less offhand and more diplomatic when he addressed the United Nations and praised its ''proud history of promoting conciliation and helping keep the peace.'' **********Such strong United Nations supporters as Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, say they think the President is failing internationally but capitalizing domestically on a trend among politicians in both parties to belittle the United Nations. **********''He is playing both ends,'' Mr. Leach said in an interview, ''with statesmanlike speeches on the one hand and feeding the appetite of the political right on the other, indulging the get-the-U.S.-out-of-the-U.N. syndrome.'' **********Administration officials say the true problem is within the United Nations body, not domestic politics, and that moderates among the nations that profess nonalignment must be encouraged to vote on the merits of issues rather than on bloc prejudice against the United States. **********Lieut. Gen. Vernon A. Walters, who recently replaced Jeane J. Kirkpatrick as United States delegate to the United Nations, spoke of this in a recent interview in U.S. News & World Report, describing the Administration's conclusion that the world body had been a ''measured disappointment.'' **********''The less naive hoped the U.N. would do more than it has in the way of conflict resolution,'' he said. Ignoring the U.N.?  Critics, however, contend that the Administration has ignored the United Nations at such times as when Washington was condemned by a majority for the invasion of Grenada. They also say the Administration has avoided the United Nations as well as the World Court in its policy of undermining the Government of Nicaragua. **********''This Administration uses the U.N. for strictly propaganda, and in 40 years I've never seen more neglect of the U.N.'s principles than these people show,'' said the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a Democrat who used to be a member of Congress and is now a professor of interational law at Georgetown University. ''They are telling the world we really don't believe in international law.'' **********Administration defenders such as Mr. Lichenstein say Nicaragua is not ''any of their business.'' **********''It's within the purview of the Organization of American States, a matter of self-defense against exported revolution,'' he said, contending that the Reagan Administration ''actually is one of the best friends the U.N. has.'' **********''We're telling them to shape up and start acting as if they're 40 years old,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/business/singapore-futures-laws.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Singapore Futures Laws", "print_headline": "Singapore Futures Laws", "body_text": " **********Singapore plans to introduce laws to prevent its fledgling financial futures market from turning into a ''casino,'' the Minister for Trade and Industry, Richard Hu, said.

Explanations were confined to news releases. **********Thomas Failla, a company spokesman, declined to comment on whether special measures had been taken to inform employees about the Institute accident or the company's response. He also declined to comment about the mood at Carbide's headquarters here, a complex of modernistic buildings on 650 acres of wooded land outside Danbury. **********More Stringent Controls **********Analysts said that the Institute accident might have no direct bearing on Carbide's sales and income. But, they added, it could lead to more stringent Government controls at its chemical manufacturing plants and is sure to increase the burdens of the company's management. **********Mr. Raman said the most damaging repercussions might be on the Bhopal case. Hundreds of lawsuits, seeking damages that run into billions of dollars, have been filed on behalf of those injured and killed in Bhopal. **********''Carbide has been taking a tough line in negotiations, but now their position is much weaker,'' he said. Among other things, he added that the Institute accident ''defines Carbide's problem in running plants as global - it is not confined to any one location.'' **********Another problem, analysts said, was that the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other Government agencies, might decide to impose tougher safety controls on the Institute plant, making it more costly to run. **********Closed After Bhopal Accident **********The plant is the only United States facility that makes methyl isocyanate, the chemical that leaked from Carbide's Bhopal plant on Dec. 4. The Institute plant was closed by Carbide after the Bhopal accident, and reopened on May 4 after a detailed Government inspection and repeated assurances by the company that it was safe. **********The company's plastic and chemical businesses had been troubled even before the Bhopal disaster because of reduced sales to the auto industry, steel companies and electronic concerns. Foreign sales had been reduced because of the strength of the dollar. **********But now, with the dollar declining and many American manufacturing companies experiencing increased demand, ''the outlook was in many ways improving, and a lot of people were becoming bullish,'' said Mr. Storch of Fahnestock. ''But now, an investor who looks at Carbide is going to ask himself,'Who needs this?'

H. Robins Company, besieged by health claims from its Dalkon Shield birth control device, filed yesterday for bankruptcy protection from its creditors. It became the second major American company to do so because of expanding damages from defective or dangerous products. **********The Richmond-based pharmaceutical company, which said it is otherwise financially healthy, said the claims and damage awards threatened its viability. The company said it became clear that the $615 million fund it established in April would not be enough to pay legal expenses and compensatory and punitive damages to thousands of women whose health problems included pelvic infections, sterility and spontaneous abortions. A few deaths have also been reported. **********Last fall the company urged women still using the device to have it removed and offered to pay the medical costs. It said yesterday that it has so far paid $1.6 million to 4,500 women for that purpose. **********In another case involving product liability, Eli Lilly & Company pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that it failed to tell the Government about four deaths and six illnesses related to its arthritis drug Oraflex. [Page A16.]  A. H. Robins said it hoped the Federal bankruptcy court in Richmond would set up a payment schedule that would enable it to survive while insuring that victims ''would be treated fairly.'' **********In a statement, the company's chief executive, E. Claiborne Robins Jr., called it ''essential'' that ''we move to protect the company's economic viability against those who would destroy it for the benefit of a few.'' **********Robins released no estimates of its total liability, but some financial sources said it could be as high as $2 billion. At the end of 1984, the company listed $309 million in assets. About 2.8 million of the intrauterine birth control devices were sold in the United States from 1971 to 1974, when the product was discontinued, the company said. Another 1.7 million were sold abroad, it said. But few suits have been filed outside the United States, a company spokesman, Roscoe E. Puckett Jr., said. **********Robins is filing for what has been called pre-emptive bankruptcy, intended to protect itself from billions of dollars in health claims from its products. In 1982, the Manville Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over asbestos claims. Both concerns had strong balance sheets at the time of filing but faced potentially devastating claims. **********In a Chapter 11 filing, a company asks a judge to postpone the payments of its debts until a manageable repayment schedule can be drawn up. The judge can order a company to be liquidated to pay those debts, but normally it emerges from bankruptcy and continues to operate. **********Legal experts said the likely result of the bankruptcy action would be to consolidate into one forum the thousands of cases that have been filed around the United States. **********On Aug. 2, Manville agreed to set up a $2.5 billion fund, proposed by a court-appointed attorney, to settle its claims, the only such fund larger than Robins'. Some legal experts then said that Manville's bankruptcy filing had been a mistake because the fund was probably larger than the company would have had to pay by fighting each claim separately. Some lawyers yesterday repeated that warning in the Robins case. **********Robins said its filing was spurred by the Aug. 9 refusal of attorneys representing most of the plaintiffs to agree to a class-action suit on the issue of punitive damages. In a class action, each victim receives the same award, determined from a lump sum payment. The damages awarded are usually far less those given in individual personal injury cases. **********It was unclear last night whether Robins will have the same protection as Manville. In July 1984, Congress said bankruptcy courts could deal only with existing debt, not potential product liability claims. **********George S. Deptula, a Syracuse attorney and member of a New York State Bar Association unit on business law, said the bankruptcy court, in theory, could continue the bankruptcy until pending claims are settled elsewhere, but existing creditors might challenge such an action. **********Called Victory for Clients **********Attorneys in the personal injury cases yesterday called the filing a victory that would lead to high awards for their clients. **********''What happened in the Manville case is exactly what will happen here,'' said Jerome F. O'Neill of the Burlington, Vt., law firm of Manchester & O'Neill, one of the lead plaintiff attorneys in the Robins case. ''Robins will not find itself protecting shareholders as it wants to. Instead, it will wind up paying as much to women as it would have otherwise.'' **********He said, however, that the company could save substantially on its legal costs and could save somewhat on punitive damages. **********As of June 30, Robins and its insurers had paid $378.3 million to settle 9,230 cases, the company said. Legal expenses totaled another $107.3 million. The company said about 5,100 cases were still pending, and the pace of new claims is increasing. **********Legal sources said the payment in settled claims has averaged about $65,000, but has ranged up to $300,000. By contrast, of 60 trials that have produced verdicts, the highest amount paid was $6.8 million. The company has won 27 of those cases. **********Analysts Not Surprised **********Financial analysts praised the company's financial performance and were not surprised at the bankruptcy filing. **********''A. H. Robins is a very fine company,'' said Craig B. Dickson of Interstate Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ''But in the current jury climate, punitive awards are very high. For an otherwise healthy woman to get punitive damages before a jury as the result of contraception problems is not very difficult for her lawyer.'' **********He added that the company would have to provide more money to victims than the company could earn in the next 10 years. **********Mr. Robins said the company intended to meet its ''new and ongoing obligations to suppliers of goods and services'' while a reorganization plan was being drawn. He said pay and benefits for the company's 6,000 employees would be unaffected and that no layoffs were planned. **********''Today's filing does not mean the company is going out of business, or that its assets will be liquidated,'' said Mr. Robins, whose family founded the business in 1866. In addition to the Dalkon Shield, the company is known for its Robitussin cough syrup. The company said it markets products in much of the world. **********In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Robins' stock dropped 62.5 cents a share, to $10.125. In 1983 the stock sold for $29.375. Chronology of Robins's Troubles June 1970 - A. H. Robins acquired the right to market the Dalkon Shield from the Dalkon Corporation. Robins said it had tested the device rigorously. **********January 1971 - The company began national marketing of the device. **********May 1974 - Robins implicated the Dalkon Shield in the deaths of four women who became pregnant while wearing the device and suffered septic abortions, caused by infection in the uterus. These findings were disclosed in a letter sent by the company to 120,000 doctors. Some 2.2 million women had been fitted with the shield since 1970. **********June 1974 - Robins suspended distribution and sale of the Dalkon Shield pending a safety study by the Food and Drug Administration. **********January 1975 - Robins removed the Dalkon Shield from the market. The company termed the action ''market withdrawal,'' not recall, because it was undertaken voluntarily, not at the order of the F.D.A. **********July 1979 - A Federal court awarded $6.8 million to a Colorado woman who charged that use of a Dalkon Shield had caused a miscarriage that almost killed her. It was the largest claim awarded to date in a case involving the product. **********September 1980 - Robins recommended to doctors that they recall all Dalkon Shields. **********June 1982 - A Federal appeals court ruled that individual claims filed by women who say they were injured through use of the Dalkon Shield did not have to be integrated into a class-action suit. **********October 1984 - Robins started a television advertising campaign aimed at convincing women still wearing the device to have it removed. Claims paid by Robins and its insurers at this time amounted to $244.7 million in 7,600 suits involving the device, with 3,768 still pending. **********April 1985 - Robins set aside $615 million to settle legal claims from women who used its Dalkon Shield. The reserve was by far the largest provision of its kind to date in a product liability case. **********May 1985 - A jury in Wichita, Kan., awarded nearly $9 million to a woman who charged that the use of the shield caused her to undergo a hysterectomy. The award was the largest made to date in the history of litigation involving the shield. **********July 1985 - A Federal judge rejected a request by Robins to grant class-action status to the remaining suits resulting from its Dalkon Shield. The move in effect upheld the 1982 appeals court decision. **********Aug. 21, 1985 - Robins filed for Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, citing in part the burden of litigation relating to the Dalkon Shield."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/02/world/around-the-world-gas-victims-in-india-protest-payment-delays.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Gas Victims in India Protest Payment Delays", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Gas Victims in India Protest Payment Delays", "body_text": " **********More than 7,000 victims of the gas leak at the Union Carbide plant here last month blocked traffic for six hours today to protest welfare payment delays. **********The demonstrators marched from the factory where the leak occurred, killing more than 2,000 people and disabling 50,000, into the center of Bhopal, where they tied up traffic. **********Official aid to the victims was suspended last week until the completion an investigation into eligibility. **********Ranjeet Singh, a senior city official, told a group of demonstrators today that the inquiry had been completed and that payments would resume Thursday, a member of the group said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/16/world/nicaragua-denies-charge-by-reagan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 530, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUA DENIES CHARGE BY REAGAN", "print_headline": "NICARAGUA DENIES CHARGE BY REAGAN", "body_text": " **********Interior Minister Tomas Borge has denied an assertion by President Reagan that Nicaragua supplied weapons to leftist guerrillas who staged a takeover of Colombia's Palace of Justice last month. **********Mr. Borge, speaking to a group of policemen late Saturday, also accused the military in El Salvador, which receives aid from the United States, of training Nicaraguan rebels in their fight against the Nicaragua Government. **********Mr. Reagan, in his weekly radio address Saturday, asserted that Nicaragua aided the rebel April 19 Movement, or M-19, which seized the Palace of Justice in Bogota, Colombia, last month and held it for more than a day before troops recaptured the building in a battle that left about 100 people dead. **********Reagan Did Not Elaborate **********''Nicaragua's connection with the recent terrorist attack against Colombia's Supreme Court is now clear,'' Mr. Reagan said in the broadcast.

M. Ericsson, Atlas Copco, Alfa-Laval, Stora Kopparberg, Saab-Scania, Scandinavian Airlines System, SKF, and the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank. He controlled or heavily influenced 9 of the 18 Swedish companies on Fortune's list of the 500 largest industrial concerns outside the United States. These 9, along with 20 smaller Wallenberg companies, accounted for 30 percent of Sweden's gross national product. **********In reality, the Wallenberg group was less an empire than a loose-knit sphere of influence based largely on minority shareholdings, the business expertise of Wallenberg executives, and respect for Mr. Wallenberg's insight and vast international contacts. His death left it to his 59-year-old son, Peter, to demonstrate that such an informal, private concentration of power can survive as a vital cog in one of the world's most advanced welfare states. **********Peter Wallenberg's test is being played out against a backdrop of public debate here, as in the rest of Europe, over the best dividing line between public and private ownership of business. Ninety percent of Sweden's industrial sector is in private hands, but much of the service sector is publicly owned and run. **********Several forces are chipping away at the once-prominent position of the Wallenbergs and other traditional Swedish industrial families. High taxes eat away at their resources. At the same time, a new generation of individuals who have made fortunes in real estate and stock market speculation have been accumulating holdings in companies that the Wallenbergs have managed to control with minority positions. And the growing holdings of corporate and institutional investors threaten the dominance of the old-line industrialists. **********''The Government wants capitalism without capitalists,'' said Mr. Wallenberg, discussing the pressures on traditional industrialists in a recent interview at the headquarters here of Skandinaviska Enskilda, the bank that was a power base for the family's ventures for decades. **********The onslaught of change has forced Mr. Wallenberg to sell stock in some family companies, most notably Kema Nobel, a large chemicals concern that included remnants of the enterprise created by Alfred Nobel, the 19th century industrialist who developed dynamite. The sale last year of the 32 percent stake in Kema Nobel -to help finance a corporate struggle with Volvo - marked the first time the Wallenbergs had disposed of an entire holding in a major corporation. The buyer was Bofors, an arms manufacturer controlled by Erik Penser, a Swede who moved to Britain for tax reasons after accumulating a sizable fortune from trading stock here. He had begun stalking Kema Nobel two years before Marcus Wallenberg's death and had quietly acquired a larger stake than the Wallenbergs'. **********In other cases, such as that of Stora Kopparberg, a timber and paper producer, and Alfa-Laval, an international leader in dairy equipment, the Wallenberg investment companies have had to increase their holdings to maintain their influence. **********But Mr. Wallenberg has given a clear signal that he is not limited to defensive maneuvers. Stora acquired a neighboring company, Billerud A. B., last year, creating one of Europe's largest forestry and paper concerns. ANOTHER task, requiring more subtlety on Peter Wallenberg's part, has been winning and keeping the support of the executives who worked closely with his father and extended the elder Wallenberg's clout throughout Swedish industry. **********''There's no direct taking over of something like that,'' said Mr. Wallenberg. ''It depends very much on interaction with people. I knew them all, but that didn't mean that they would carry on regardless. A lot of my job is asking questions. Most of the men who worked most closely with my father are a bit older than I am, which is a difference. I imagine that I listen to them more than he did.'' **********So far, none of the aging executives who played such an important role in Marcus Wallenberg's activities have retired, although Peter Wallenberg will soon find himself in need of a new generation of top aides. The coming generational shift is being watched by many in Sweden as a key test of Mr. Wallenberg's skill. **********The Wallenberg group has been the most durable and by far the grandest of several spheres of influence that formed around a handful of Swedish families and banks that capitalized on Sweden's unusual burst of engineering inventiveness in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They transformed what had been one of Europe's poorest agrarian countries into one of its more industrialized ones and endowed it with a disproportionate number of relatively large multinational concerns. **********Based on the Enskilda Bank, founded in 1856 by Peter's great-grandfather and merged with the Skandinaviska Bank in 1972, the Wallenberg group expanded dramatically as Marcus and his brother Jacob used the bank to buy into Swedish concerns that ran into trouble. **********Personality played a major role in Marcus Wallenberg's achievements. His talents made him an important Swedish diplomat during World War II and the country's first tennis player to reach the center court at Wimbledon. Nevertheless, his success may have also been a creature of its time. The Wallenberg group was already fraying at the edges by the time he died. **********To many Swedes, Peter Wallenberg's image is that of a man on the defensive. One industrialist, who said that ''major things just weren't done without knowing that Marcus Wallenberg approved in the background,'' described Peter as ''a guy you could drink beer and eat crayfish with but whom you don't respect in the same way.'' **********Peter Wallenberg deflects requests to compare himself with his father, saying such judgments are for others to make. A portly, bespectacled man whose appearance, despite the fine tailoring of his clothes, often reflects the dishevelment of frequent travel and long workdays, Mr. Wallenberg came to his job with far broader experience than most Swedes realized. **********He joined Atlas Copco, a manufacturer o/f compressors, mining and construction equipment, in 1953 after studying law at the University of Stockholm, spending three and a half years in the Swedish army, and working for a year in Lausanne, Switzerland, for the Swiss Bank Corporation. He remembers his many overseas sales stints with relish, including a three-year stretch in the late 1950's, when he lived in Upper Montclair, N. J., with his family. **********''I have always enjoyed practical things,'' he recalled. ''I started selling portable compressors. I could name a couple hundred machines from those days that don't exist any more.'' That direct industrial experience - something his father did not have - was broadened when he joined the Skandinaviska bank as an industry adviser in 1974 after 21 years with Atlas Copco. **********''Peter Wallenberg is much more professional than most people thought,'' said Per-Martin Meyerson, chief economist of the Federation of Swedish Industry. ''And he is at the center of professionalism in Swedish business,'' added Mr. Meyerson, referring to the phalanx of executive talent the family has recruited. **********The most celebrated test of Mr. Wallenberg's abilities was the unwinding last year of newly forged links between Volvo and the Wallenberg group. A year before his death, Marcus Wallenberg encouraged Pehr Gyllenhammar, then president and chief executive officer of Volvo, to build up 25 percent stakes in Stora Kopparberg and Atlas Copco, two of the oldest Wallenberg companies. **********The investments gave the cash-rich Volvo an outlet for funds it was barred by exchange controls from moving out of Sweden. Some Swedes said that it also positioned Mr. Gyllenhammar to assume the elder Wallenberg's mantle of industrial leadership. The speculation ran that Mr. Wallenberg saw more of the qualities for which he was known, including imaginative thinking and international stature, in Mr. Gyllenhammar than in Peter, who had become the apparent successor in the family business after the suicide of his elder brother, Marc, in 1971. **********Whatever was going on - most Wallenberg associates simply chalk up the deal to advanced age and perhaps illness - the Volvo involvement soon led to disagreements over management at Stora Kopparberg. The Wallenberg group then accumulated enough voting shares in Volvo to threaten Mr. Gyllenhammar's control. Then, early last year, the two sides negotiated a disengagement agreement. Volvo sold its stake in Stora Kopparberg and Atlas Copco to the Wallenbergs at a healthy profit, while the Wallenbergs sold off their 7 percent holding in Volvo, and reasserted control over their companies. **********''This is a small country; we can't afford these kinds of conflicts,'' said Peter Wallenberg, who stressed that relations with Volvo were very good now. Mr. Gyllenhammar, interviewed at Volvo's headquarters outside the west coast port of Gothenburg, had a similar view, adding cryptically, ''Without the face-off, it wouldn't be so comfortable.'' NO one can accuse Mr. Wallenberg of taking success for granted. Although he plays tennis every morning, work fills most of the hours between 6 A.M. and 1 A.M., when he typically gets to bed after two or three hours of reading. He is chairman of the financial committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and his interests in the United States include serving on the boards of Dillon, Read & Company and the Wharton School's Lauder Institute. ''I would guess that no more than half a dozen dinners a year are entirely social,'' he said. **********How much all of this effort earns for Mr. Wallenberg and his relatives is a closely guarded secret. He was reported to have said that his personal fortune is about $20 million, a figure he calls ''way off'' but will not correct. The family and charitable foundations controlled by it received about $5 million in dividend income last year via Investor and Providentia, the two main investment funds that hold most of the family's stock portfolio. The funds also realized almost $170 million in capital gains. **********''Our private wealth has always been considerably less than the public believes,'' Mr. Wallenberg said. The generation that will inherit that wealth is led by Mr. Wallenberg's eldest son, Jacob, and a nephew, Marcus, both bankers. (Mr. Wallenberg's other son and his daughter are in hotel management.) Whether the next generation will also inherit a major voice in Swedish business is the tougher question. Many Swedes are skeptical. ''Industrial logic is overcoming sphere-of-interest thinking,'' said Harry Faulkner, the president and chief executive of Alfa-Laval, the maker of dairy equipment that has long been part of the Wallenberg group. ''At the operating level, we don't think in terms of spheres of interest.'' **********VOLVO'S STYLE **********''He was a great patriot who liked big schemes and imaginative things,'' said Pehr Gyllenhammar of Marcus Wallenberg. Since many people say the same things about Mr. Gyllenhammar, who became chief executive of Volvo in 1971 at the age of 36, it's not hard to see why rumors started that Mr. Wallenberg saw the more domineering and dashing Mr. Gyllenhammar rather than his son, Peter, as the natural successor to the role of kingpin of Swedish industry. **********Under Mr. Gyllenhammar, Volvo has shrugged off a number of setbacks to grow into a giant with annual revenue of more than $10 billion. In addition to the cars and trucks for which it is best known in the United States, Volvo, with headquarters in Gothenburg, produces everything from mineral water and french fries to oil. **********Mr. Gyllenhammar represents a sharp break with the Wallenberg tradition in a crucial sense. He has fashioned Volvo in an American mold - a company with diverse shareholders, none large enough to challenge him. To the dismay of the Wallenbergs and other Swedes who believe that large shareholder-owners provide an important check on management, he recently reached a cross-investment deal with Skanska, Sweden's largest construction company. **********One thing making the debate about private-sector ownership less academic is the Social Democratic Government's commitment to ''wage-earner funds'' - investment funds controlled by Sweden's trade unions. Money for the funds comes from a business profits tax. Businessmen regard the funds as an attack on the very idea of private sector ownership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/29/business/new-york-air-fills-vacant-presidential-job.html": {"writer_name": "Todd Purdum", "pub_date": "1985-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 365, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York Air Fills Vacant Presidential Job", "print_headline": "New York Air Fills Vacant Presidential Job", "body_text": " **********Douglas C.

Gallaway, executive vice president of New York Air, had run the airline on an interim basis and will now continue as executive vice president under Mr. Birdsall. **********Frank Lorenzo remains chairman of New York Air and its parent, the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Continental. **********At Continental, Mr. Birdsall, 42, was vice president of market planning. In that post, he was instrumental in developing Continental's successful dual-hub strategy in Houston and Denver. **********New York Air, which has tried to promote itself as a more relaxing alternative to the Eastern air shuttle and People Express airlines on the busy runs between New York, Boston and Washington, has posted a profit for only one year since its founding. **********But in a telephone interview, Mr. Birdsall, a native of Port Chester, N.Y. who spent 12 years at Eastern Airlines before joining Continental in 1981, said he was confident that the carrier could succeed. He pointed to its record quarterly net income of $4.6 million on revenues of $59.6 million in this year's second quarter as a healthy sign. **********''I don't see New York Air as a problem that needs to be fixed,'' he said. ''I see it largely as an opportunity, the full potential of which has not yet been realized.'' **********Mr. Birdsall said he has long wanted to run New York Air, but had been too busy trying to help build Continental into a successful budget carrier to think of leaving. **********''Now Continental is at a point where from my point of view and I guess from Frank's as well, that I can come here and work on this,'' he said. **********Mr. Birdsall is a graduate of New York University and is married and has three children."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/06/business/finance-new-issues-us-steel-to-buy-its-pollution-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. Steel to Buy Its Pollution Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   U.S. Steel to Buy Its Pollution Bonds", "body_text": " **********The United States Steel Corporation plans to purchase more than $200 million of face amount tax-exempt pollution-control revenue bonds issued on its behalf by the Allegheny County Industrial Development Authority between 1973 and 1979.

Because the office is considered United States property, however, the Korean police need American permission before entering. **********Talks With the Students **********Thomas P. H. Dunlop, counselor for political affairs of the United States Embassy in Seoul, talked with the students for several hours today, but late tonight the group was still barricaded in the library.

''There are no hostages. We hope it ends soon.'' **********The students' protest is expected to increase the political pressure on President Chun Doo Hwan's Government, which suffered a shock in elections in February when the opposition party made an unexpectedly strong showing. The protest also comes at an awkward time for the Government because talks with North Korea are expected to begin next week. **********Students have often spearheaded antigovernment protests but their stance appears to have hardened since the Kwangju incident. In the uprising, students at Chun Nam National University in the southern city of Kwangju gathered to protest the military coup that brought President Chun Doo Hwan to power in 1979. The protest was joined by South Korean citizens and, after an eight-day standoff, South Korean troops moved in. **********The protest today was not the first here directed at the American Government. In December of 1980, an arson attempt damaged the United States Cultural Center at Kwangju. In March 1982 the United States Information Service office in Pusan was bombed, killing one student, and in September of 1983, the United States Information Service in Taegu was attacked. In November of last year, in a different incident, students occupied the offices of South Korea's ruling party. South Korean police moved in and arrested them. **********The protest was apparently long in the planning - the students were from five of South Korea's best-known universities and were members of a national student committee dedicated to investigating the Kwangju uprising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/13/world/after-all-hope-is-gone-the-search-goes-on.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1985-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 620, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AFTER ALL HOPE IS GONE, THE SEARCH GOES ON", "print_headline": "AFTER ALL HOPE IS GONE, THE SEARCH GOES ON", "body_text": " **********Even after any rational expectations of finding survivors had been given up, the search continued into the night. **********Through the afternoon and into the evening rescue workers combed the woods, looking for any of the 258 people aboard the chartered DC-8 who might have been thrown clear of the blazing crash, All they found were bodies and pieces of bodies. **********All were tagged and taken to a temporary morgue. **********By evening a broad area of the slopes between the runway and Gander Lake had been sealed off and uniformed Canadian Army soldiers were keeping all onlookers away. **********The rescue workers divided up the area around the crash and walked through the woods, chopping their way through the underbrush when necessary. **********Too Late for First Aid **********Apparently none of those aboard the plane were alive after rescue workers reached the scene. **********''We never got into administering any first aid,'' said Ron Delaney, chief of the Gander Volunteer Fire Department.

The notion that nothing can last runs deep. Perhaps as a result, the city has few monuments to collective experiences. **********Once in a while, though, Tokyo tries to remember, and some residents did that this weekend, the 40th anniversary of United States air raids that destroyed most of the city in one fiery night. **********On March 10, 1945, just after midnight, 300 B-29 planes saturated Tokyo with incendiary bombs, turning the heart of Japan's capital into an inferno. **********By the time the fires flickered out, many hours and even days later, Asakusa, Honjo and other eastern districts along the Sumida River had been obliterated. At least 100,000 people died, many of them drowning after having jumped into the blackened, death-dyed waters of the Sumida in vain attempts to escape. **********Flames Seen for 150 Miles **********A strong northwest wind blew that night, and it became a bellows, fanning flames to such heights that they could be seen by B-29 pilots 150 miles out in the Pacific Ocean. **********Katsumoto Saotome was 12 years old then. Now he is an author, and he has used the Tokyo air raid as a theme in novels. **********''It was like looking at a picture through a red filter,'' Mr. Saotome says. ''The fire was like a living thing. It ran, just like a creature, chasing us.'' **********Looking south across the central Ginza district, Fumi Suguyama thought the flames were ''the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.'' Others say they felt the same way, an ethereal moment amid the terror. **********Overnight, two-thirds of Tokyo's commercial districts were erased. More than a million people were left homeless and had to be evacuated from the city. **********Morale plummeted, and from the American perspective that alone made the air raids a success. The idea had been to make graphically plain to the Japanese that they were losing the war and, if it went on, they would die in growing numbers. **********Some Choose to Remember **********These days, the Tokyo raids get lost in the shuffle, overshadowed by the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that followed. But the destruction here was about as bad, and some have chosen to remember. **********They held organized tours this weekend through the areas that were burned out that night. They have also flocked to the Tokyu department store in the Nihombashi district to view an exhibition recalling the visit of ''B-san,'' as the bombers respectfully were called. In 12 days, 40,000 people passed by the photos and relics. **********Most were elderly. Some jotted down thoughts on paper and dropped them into a bowl as they left. **********''The whole family of a close friend of mine was burned to death at the Kototoi Bridge,'' wrote a 60-year-old Tokyo woman. ''Every time I call her to mind I feel a pain in my chest. I have already lived three times as long as she did. She had only 20 short years, a life of war, day in and day out.'' **********Revival did not come easily. **********For one thing, the required reconstruction was mind-shattering. From B-29 headquarters on Guam, a reporter for The New York Times wrote on March 11: **********''Imagine Manhattan from Washington Square northward to 60th Street plus the Borough Hall, Bay Ridge, Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Fulton Street sections of Brooklyn, add Long Island City and Astoria and Staten Island burned out so not a rooftop is visible, and the picture becomes clearer of the area laid waste by the American bombers yesterday morning.'' **********As bad as the destruction was, it was not as vast nor as thorough as this immediate report indicated. **********''We really couldn't do anything until Aug. 15,'' said Eika Takayama, a city planner at what was then Tokyo Imperial University. Aug. 15 was Japan's day of surrender. **********'Much Too Early to Rebuild' **********Even then, Professor Takayama said, ''city planning meant doing things like broadening streets, creating small parks, straightening out roads to open up public space. It was much too early to rebuild.'' **********Besides, he added: ''Planning works just so far. People build a city on their own.'' **********Many would say that Tokyo is a testament to nonplanning. It regenerated itself much as it was before - a labryinth of no-name streets, hodge- podge neighborhoods and confusion. **********That Tokyo made it back nonetheless is to state the obvious. It now is a city of 11.8 million that works. **********Its center is shifting ever westward, away from the older sections that had been destroyed. Now the metropolitan Governor, Shunichi Suzuki, wants City Hall to go west, too. **********He would move government offices from their traditional site in the space-short Marunouchi district, adjoining the Imperial Palace, to the skyscraper canyons of Shinjuku, a ''hot'' part of town on the western end. **********In Marunouchi, traditionalists view the plan with alarm. Businessmen in older neighborhoods fear their livelihood will be hurt. Their representatives in the Metropolitan Assembly have reacted accordingly. **********No Monument for the Dead **********The Tokyo Metropolitan Government sponsored no remembrance of the fire-bombings this weekend. No monument has been built to those who died. Any public reminiscences were the works of only a few activist groups. **********Mr. Saotome, the author, began 15 years ago to compile data and oral histories of the air raids because he felt time was ticking away. At first, the going was difficult. ''Most people were reluctant to speak to me,'' he said. ''Their attitude was, 'Can talking about it bring back my son?' '' **********''I would go to their houses two or three times,'' he said, ''finally persuading them that it was important, that historical facts would otherwise disappear. It happens, you know.'' **********''I myself lost my house, but luckily not my family,'' Mr. Saotome said.

''I've done them all.'' Not quite all, which is why the investor and entrepreneur has latched onto an idea that he thinks will furnish him with a new reason to get up in the morning. He is determined to buy back the company that he sold more than 30 years ago, the empire that made his name famous throughout the world: Avis Rent-a-Car. **********Late last month, Warren Avis stepped out of the past and declared that he and a group of investors wish to acquire the No. 2 rental car agency from the Beatrice Companies, which has put it up for sale. He may have to battle to get it, though, for last Thursday, the Wesray Capital Corporation, an investment firm headed by William E. Simon, the former Treasury Secretary, said that it was joining with some Avis licensees to consider a bid as well. **********Mr. Avis vows that, unless someone goes wild and offers a stratospheric sum, he will pay ''whatever the price is.'' His desire to own the company is not just some sentimental fling, he says, it stems from long-term frustration. He has watched his ''baby'' for years and always thought that it ought to be No. 1, not Hertz. So if no one else is going to get it there, then he will. The deal could cost him and his backers $200 million to $400 million. He says they can afford it. **********It can be tricky trying to talk to Warren Avis. He has done many things, and he can tell you all about them, but details get fuzzy. ''I can't remember a telephone number from here to there,'' he says. ''Names? Dates? Forget it. I could never be a politician. You give me anything in my hand and I will forget it. I went to lunch today with this huge briefcase and, sure enough, I forgot it.'' **********Chatting with a visitor, he must pardon himself seemingly every few minutes. The phone beckons. It seems like 20 or 30 business proposals is a light day for him. **********''That was the vice chairman of this transportation company,'' he says after one call. ''I like the guy. And, you know what? I just might end up buying his company. I just might.'' **********Mr. Avis has moved deep into his 60's. He will not say exactly how deep, because his second wife, Yanna, who is approximately half his age, is sensitive. An avid equestrian, Mr. Avis remains trim and looks like he could still take a medicine ball in the stomach. His suits are cut in the form-fitting fashion favored by youth. **********He has recently been investing in high-technology electronics companies. Over the years he has bought and sold dozens of enterprises - factories, hotels, condominiums. He says that his deal making has transformed the $8 million he collected from selling Avis Rent-a-Ca r to a substantially larger fortune. Whatever takes his fancy, he tries. Once, he was struck by the notion of bagging an elephant. So he went to Africa. ''I shot an elephant,'' he said. ''I found out what that was all about. I found out that the elephant has no chance. You get downwind and it's all over.'' **********He is always moving, jetting between his apartment, a farm in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a mammoth house built into the cliffs in balmy Acapulco. ''The way I live,'' he says, ''people never know what the hell I'm doing.'' NO one would have guessed rental cars and a household name for Warren Avis. He was born in Bay City, Mich., about 100 miles north of Detroit, where his father was in the lumber business. His working life began in the Michigan Department of Investigation, where he was an investigator specializing in auto dealerships. **********He did that for a couple of years. But the money was paltry. Already he was coming to believe one of his pet credos: ''There is nothing worse than dying broke.'' So he found a job with a drug company and slogged through Indiana, Illinois and Missouri hawking pills. He did that for a couple of years, making better money. **********Then he went into the Air Force, and had risen to major by the end of World War II. When he got out, he bought an interest in a Ford dealership in Detroit. And he started thinking. ''In 1945,'' he says, ''if you landed at any airport in America, you took a taxi. If you landed in New York and wanted to go to Westchester, you took a taxi and then to get back you had to somehow find a taxi. I have probably made life better for millions of people with the idea I had.'' **********The idea was to set up car-rental agencies at airports. Rental agencies, including Hertz, existed then, but they were situated downtown exclusively, often in garages. ''Nobody thought it would work. There was incredible trouble. You had to get all the airlines to cooperate. Where did you put the cars? There were no credit cards. I introduced the credit card for car renting.'' **********Mr. Avis had $10,000. He borrowed $75,000 more, and in 1947 he started what was then called Avis Airlines Rent-A-Car at the Detroit and Miami airports. At first, all the cars were parked right outside the terminals, and the counter person who rented you the car would escort you out and show you where it was. Business began ''very damn slow,'' he said. ''People just didn't know how to do it.'' **********They found out, and, with the founder working feverishly, the Avis network spread to other airports and then to the downtown sections. Within seven years, Avis was behind Hertz as the second-largest car-rental network in the world. Fretful that he couldn't expand it fast enough, Mr. Avis agreed in 1954 to sell the company for $8 million to Richard S. Robie, a Boston financier. Since then, it has been shuttled to ITT, to Norton Simon, to Esmark, to Beatrice. **********Warren Avis was not yet 40 when he sold his baby. He was rich. And so, as he puts it, ''I didn't break my neck at anything for a few years.'' He adds, ''I've never been interested in making a fortune and having a heart attack, as some people do. If you don't enjoy the money, then the money doesn't have any value.'' How did he fill the time? ''Easy,'' he says. ''Three months in Mexico for the winter. Three months in France for the summer. That took care of six months. I went to parties and so forth. I did some real estate deals. Then I got enthralled with the idea of factories.'' He bought and sold a few dozen factories in Michigan, including one that made bread, one that made steel, one that make electrical products. ''I thought it was a great way to go,'' he says. ''But then the management problems started to swallow me up. I don't want to be a slave to any business. When you get to unions and labor, I lose patience.'' **********He is chronically antsy. He bought four hotels, then sold them. ''Hotels were too slow,'' he says. ''Changing sheets didn't excite me.'' **********One year, his lawyer phoned him in Europe about investing in a bank in Warren, Mich. All right, Mr. Avis said. Buy it. **********He got back from vacation the owner of a bank. He installed himself as its chairman and showed up for his first directors meeting. **********''I walked out in the middle of the meeting and told my people to sell it,'' he says. ''I was totally bored to death. I didn't want to sit there and listen to a lot of loans being approved. Boring!'' A more exciting purchase was a choice piece of property on the cliffs of Acapulco, that tropical outpost of the rich and glamorous. Divorced from his first wife (with whom he had three children), he designed an extraordinary bachelor villa. Tall as a 10-story building, it was laid out in free-form fashion, with bedrooms and living rooms stashed away on multiple levels. Eight servants unobtrusively catered to all whims. **********The place became famous in the social whirl. Life magazine did a big write-up about it. Well-heeled overachievers with beautiful companions were always popping in. ''I can handle 150 people at the drop of a hat,'' Mr. Avis once bragged.  After 15 years of bachelorhood, in early 1981 Mr. Avis married Yanna Elbim, an actress who had appeared in plays and on television in France. These days, his dander rises if it is suggested that he was perhaps a playboy. ''You know what playboy means in the business world?'' he asks. ''It means you can't borrow money.'' IN the late 1960's, a time of social unrest and confusion, Warren Avis figured out precisely what he wanted to do next. He wanted to save the world. ''My interest was culture change in society. That's making a better world. I was interested in making America a problem-solving society rather than a conflict society.'' **********He came up with what he considered a revolutionary technique that he felt sure would make everyone's life better. It would ease world tensions. It would make employees and bosses love each other. **********He labeled the concept Shared Participation. The idea was that most problems spring from faulty communications. By assembling groups of strangers and nudging them to converse frankly about personal challenges and problems, new understanding would emerge. **********To test his concept, he created the American Behavioral Science Training Laboratories in Ann Arbor in 1967. Subjects would arrive at the lab for week-long sensitivity training sessions. Each person would be given a roommate. Mr. Avis liked to make the matches as bizarre as possible: a policeman bunked with a beatnik was a favorite. Cary Grant took the training, and later told Mr. Avis he had a great time and gave him a blurb to use on his book, ''Shared Participation.'' **********Mr. Avis paid the way for many Detroit policemen to go through the lab, since Detroit police officials generally badmouthed the whole idea and Mr. Avis felt that outbreaks of violence are often fomented by flawed police behavior. As a result of the training the policemen got, Mr. Avis insists, you can wander through Detroit nowadays and hardly ever run into a riot. **********After almost a decade of this, Mr. Avis closed down the center. He wasn't getting the top business executives he wanted. He wasn't getting political leaders. He wanted United States senators to check in. ''If we could have gotten the senators,'' he says. ''If they could have forgotten about their ego and self-serving interests, what a change we could have made.'' **********But the senators had other commitments, and so Mr. Avis scaled back his ambitions. **********''My interest was in changing the world,'' he says, ''and I found out it was a bigger and more expensive job than I thought it would be. I found out that Caesar, Hitler, Alexander tried to make changes in the world and it's a long, difficult procedure. You almost have to totally dedicate your life to do it. I don't want to dedicate my life to anything. I want to taste everything. I want the vacations. I want the play.'' **********He did other things. He rounded up some investors (he calls on a wide range of institutions and individuals for his myriad deals) and bought Teleflorist, and then, in 1977, hatched the idea of a toll-free number that would allow a customer to call and order crocuses or roses to be sent anywhere in the world. He called it Avis Flowers Worldwide. Before it could really get going, though, Norton Simon, which at the time owned Avis Rent-A-Car, sued Mr. Avis, contending he couldn't slap the Avis name on another venture. Mr. Avis eventually prevailed, but by then he had tired of flowers and he exited the business. THE company that oversees his wide-flung holdings nowadays is called Avis Enterprises. Its headquarters is in Ann Arbor. Mr. Avis is not much of a day-to-day manager. His staff takes care of that. ''I'm not an operational man,'' he says. ''I'm a strategic planner.'' **********The range of current projects includes the construction of a research center near the University of Michigan, ownership of several high-tech electronics companies, sundry condominium projects and that original Detroit Ford dealership. **********''I think his record shows that he's a good entrepreneur,'' says Rudolph G. Penner, who heads the Congressional Budget Office. In his years as a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, Mr. Penner had dealings with Mr. Avis on economic ideas the businessman was promoting. **********''Warren is a very innovative person,'' says Dave Owens, the president of Arc Associates, a Cleveland data communications concern that Mr. Avis bought last year. ''He has a hundred ideas a day. He doesn't meddle in daily operations, but he calls all the time with ideas. Not all the ideas can be used, but some of them are good.'' Does he have a sound grasp of Arc? ''Yes, he does,'' Mr. Owens says. ''He doesn't understand some of the technical details. But neither do I.'' **********The one truly wretched investment Mr. Avis admits to was a second plot of land he bought in Acapulco about a decade ago adjacent to a hot new nightclub. He planned to put up a hotel. The club went broke and his investment sank in value by a couple of million dollars. Not knowing what else to do with the land, he is building a ranch there for himself. **********Why does he need two places in Acapulco? ''Well, I don't know if I do.'' In spare moments, Mr. Avis writes books. He has published, at his own expense, a book on the history of business in pre-Christian times, another putting forth his social psychology idea and another espousing current expensing, a tax reform device to encourage investment. With current expensing, a business could deduct from its taxable income the cost of all capital assets except land and buildings, in the year in which the goods are acquired. Right now, he is finishing up a work on entrepreneurship to be published by Macmillan & Company. **********Rich as he is, he still likes to cut a quick deal. Last summer, he bought property next to New York's legendary 21 Club for $8.7 million. He said he was going to put up condominiums. But, shortly afterward, someone offered him $9.7 million for the parcel. He grabbed it. ''When you can put $1 million in your pocket, why not?'' **********HE waxes enthusiastic about **********Avis. Avis controls some 26 percent of the domestic car rental market, behind Hertz, which itself was recently sold by RCA to UAL Inc., the owner of United Airlines. Beatrice says that a number of possible bidders have expressed interest in the company, but hard bargaining has not yet begun. **********Mr. Avis stands by his prediction that he would win any bidding war. '' He admits, however, that he has not yet seen the company's financials. In anticipation, he says he has a list of new marketing ideas. One that he will divulge is to offer Avis traveler's checks. ''They've got an office in every city in the world,'' he says. ''It would be just tremendous.'' **********What does the rental car king think of all this? **********''It's my opinion that it's a long throw,'' says Frank Olson, the chief executive officer of Hertz. ''I don't really believe it's a viable possibility. The historical earnings of Avis and the balance sheet are not strong enough to allow such a buyout unless they've got an awful lot of cash to pour into it.'' **********What, though, if it does happen? And what of Warren Avis's boast that he'll propel his child past Hertz? **********''He can't live that long,'' Mr. Olson says. **********These days, Warren Avis spends three months of the year in Ann Arbor, where he rides horses every day (''I have a jumping course like Madison Square Garden''), three months in New York, where he mostly attends business meetings, three months in Acapulco, where he does a lot of water-skiing and wind-surfing, and three months in Europe, where he hops from city to city. **********Is there anything else he wants to do? **********''If there were,'' he says, ''I'd go do it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/30/world/around-the-world-st-lawrence-seaway-is-blocked-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  St. Lawrence Seaway Is Blocked Again", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   St. Lawrence Seaway Is Blocked Again", "body_text": " **********A freighter slammed into a drawbridge on the St. Lawrence Seaway today, injuring two people and blocking the waterway for the third time in a year. **********A seaway spokesman, Richard Juteau, said the Beauharnois Canal would be closed for at least 24 hours while engineers checked damage to the St. Louis bridge, about 25 miles west of Montreal. **********He said that if the drawbridge was not weakened, ships could sail around the area where a 60-foot section of the bridge fell into the water. **********Three trucks and a car plunged into the St. Lawrence River after the accident, according to Cpl.

Korvette's was the major tenant. It now has closed, but the shopping center, Douglaston Plaza, thrives. **********The rest of the land was zoned for housing. An investment group, the M.I.G.S. Development Corporation, proposed to build an imaginatively designed project of 1,100 apartments in buildings of three to eight stories with underground parking and a pool. The architect was Peter Gray, now of Walden, Vt. **********The plan found favor in the City Planning Department and among some community leaders, but it was fought by State Senator Frank Padavan of Queens and others who objected to high-rise development. Ultimately it was withdrawn. **********Since then a succession of builders has systematically developed that former sand pit with ''as of right'' two- and three-story attached housing along the grid-pattern streets from 65th Avenue to 69th Avenue. It fills the land beneath the steep and sudden slope to the city-owned Douglaston golf course, giving eastbound drivers along the expressway a striking picture of residential crowding. **********Now the final tract is in construction - a 4.1-acre strip running along 242d Street at the base of the 70-foot slope. To obtain a buildable site, the developer is digging out the base of the hill and shoring it up with an immense, steel-reinforced retaining wall. **********The project is called Colonial Town Houses. There are to be 42 houses in nine buildings, according to Lawrence Rosano Jr. of Bayside, the builder. A sales trailer is expected to open this month, and the first occupants should arrive in late July. **********The unusual depth of the lot - 105 feet - makes it possible to create a house 60 feet deep and still fulfill zoning requirements for a 30-foot rear yard and a 15-foot front yard. With a 60-foot depth, the second and third floors can be built either as two one- bedroom apartments per floor or one three-bedroom apartment. **********Each house may therefore have as few as three or as many as five condominium units, depending on whether buyers choose smaller or larger units. There could be as many as 210 dwelling units or as few as 126. **********It is basic, unfancy middle-income housing, conventionally financed. Mr. Rosano estimated that the labor and materials costs for this kind of construction are about $70 a square foot, compared with perhaps $90 a square foot for high-rise. **********Thus a 616-square-foot, one-bedroom condominium is expected to start at about $88,000. If the buyer wants to combine two one-bedroom apartments on a floor, it will be possible to buy 1,232 square feet. The average price is expected to be about $140 a square feet. **********There will be 42 single-car garages and 42 exterior parking strips for a second car alongside the driveway to the garage. In addition there are to be 180 parking spaces along the sides of the nine buildings. Altogether this means at least one space for each unit even if all 210 units are built. **********In Senator Padavan's view, the development is ''outrageous'' because it will bring in a density beyond what the area can reasonably handle. ''It will overtax the water and sewage,'' he said. ''There is no way fire engines can get in there now. The city did a miserable job. It should have been downzoned.'' **********An estimated 850 dwelling units - about 600 of them legal under the zoning law - have been created on 17 acres since as-of-right development began after the failure of the Gray plan. Most of the units are in the two- family-house form and some are condominiums. The exact number of units is uncertain because it is not clear how many owners of two-family homes brought in a second tenant, although it is illegal under the zoning law, to defray housing costs. **********About 200 units were in place when the Gray plan came forward for all the remaining land. **********''The community was wrong to reject the Gray plan,'' said Bernard Haber, chairman of Community Board 11 in Bayside. ''It was the same mistake communities make all the time when faced with a proposal that looks immense but in fact is more conducive to good planning. What we have now is a sea of cars and no provision for parking.'' **********By separating the open space and pedestrian circulation from the parking, the sense of crowding might have been relieved, he said. Downzoning the land, Mr. Haber maintained, would have had only a marginal effect. The R-4 zone allows 0.75 square feet of floor area for each square foot of land. A lower zone, R3-2, would have allowed 0.5 square feet for each square foot of land, and not solved the vehicular problem. **********But Mr. Rosano disagrees. At Colonial Town Houses, he said, enough parking has been provided to solve that problem for buyers. He also pointed out that many people prefer the neighborhood atmosphere created by private homes of the kind he is building."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/31/business/a-perilous-dip-in-brazil-s-exports.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1985-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1742, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A PERILOUS DIP IN BRAZIL'S EXPORTS", "print_headline": "A PERILOUS DIP IN BRAZIL'S EXPORTS", "body_text": " **********RIO DE JANEIRO **********Selling commuter planes to **********the United States, oil rigs to the **********Soviet Union and myriad other products to all points in between, Brazil's exporters last year became the toast of the International Monetary Fund and the foreign banking community. **********The exporters demonstrated, after all, that the country's worst economic crisis in decades could be overcome with good, salable products and hard work. As a result, the Brazilians were held up as models to other Latin American nations being urged to cover their huge foreign debt payments by earning more from exports. **********Brazil's achievement was impressive. A record $13.1 billion trade surplus fueled a 4.4 percent growth rate last year - the first expansion of the economy since 1980 - and supplied the dollars necessary to meet interest payments on the country's $102 billion foreign debt. It seemed the worst was over for Brazil. **********But the country's trade picture has suddenly turned cloudy. Having confidently expected a reprise of its 1984 performance, Brazil is seeing a dip in its sales and orders abroad. And the nation's lifeline to economic recovery no longer seems so assured. **********''The situation is becoming critical,'' said Roberto Caiuby Vidigal, president of the Brazilian Capital Goods Industry Association. ''We're living mainly off the contracts signed last year.'' **********The implications are potentially grave. A slump in Brazil's trade surplus in 1985 could affect not only the country's domestic growth, inflation and exchange rates, but also its relations with the I.M.F. and foreign creditors, especially if it is unable to keep up interest payments without new borrowing abroad. **********The main threats to Brazil's exports - the strengthening of the dollar and growing protectionist trends in the industrialized world - could also undermine the export efforts of other major debtor nations, notably Mexico and Argentina. All three nations prefer robust trade rather than domestic austerity measures as the best road to economic recovery. **********Some economists argue that a drop in exports could bring on another major debt crisis for Latin America. Already the most recent reduction in world oil prices has forced Mexico and Venezuela - which carry debt of $96 billion and $34 billion, respectively - to revise their trade estimates for the year. **********In the case of Brazil, the region's largest, most populous and most industrialized nation, the reversal of a three-year trend of rising exports has coincided with the March 15 inauguration of the country's first civilian administration in 21 years. Adding to the uncertainty that normally accompanies changes of Government, the President-elect, Tancredo Neves, has so far been unable to take office because of ill health. **********THE outgoing military Government has played down the 9 percent **********fall in exports for the first two months of 1985, attributing it to ''glitches'' and even blaming Brazil's annual carnival splurge, which stole three working days from February rather than March this year. **********But there is no silencing the whispers of concern. During January and February, exports were $314 million lower and the trade surplus $260 million less than during the same two months last year - and dramatically below the trade figures for the final months of 1984. Foreign sales of food products, notably coffee, sugar and orange juice, were 22 percent lower than a year ago. **********''In the most optimistic of cases, the trade surplus will reach $9 billion this year,'' according to Laerte Setubal, president of the Association of Brazilian Exporters. Officials are still hoping for a trade surplus of between $11 billion and $12 billion, but more bearish economists see a surplus of little more than the $6 billion recorded in 1983. **********The challenge facing the new Government of President Neves is how to rebuild the trade surplus cushion - and thereby avoid a new debt crisis - without damaging other aspects of its economic program. **********Mr. Neves has declared his twin objectives to be greater economic development and a simultaneous reduction of inflation. But both stand in the way of the easiest trade options: A big trade surplus could be preserved by further controlling imports, including imports of capital equipment, but this would discourage growth. And the competitiveness of Brazilian products could be stimulated through a ''maxi-devaluation'' of some 25 percent, but this would feed domestic inflation. **********Certainly, the last ''maxi-devaluation,'' in March 1983, gave enormous momentum to Brazil's exports. But it was also accompanied by incentives for exporters, which today run counter to the rules of both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the I.M.F.. The I.M.F. is pressing Brazil to cut back its huge public sector deficit and is increasingly intolerant of the export subsidies that contribute to the deficit. **********NEVERTHELESS, the Neves Administration has excluded the **********export sector from a 60-day credit and spending freeze, seemingly aware that the country's trade outlook could influence its upcoming talks on restructuring its debt with its New York-based Advisory Committee, which represents 600 creditor banks and financial institutions holding Brazilian debt. **********The negotiations were suspended in late January after the I.M.F. refused to condone overspending by the outgoing Government during the last quarter of 1984, but they should resume once the I.M.F. approves the new Administration's money supply and deficit targets. **********During the hiatus, however, the negotiating environment has been altered by the dip in Brazil's exports. The two sides had come close to agreement on rescheduling $45.3 billion of commercial debt coming due between 1985 and 1991, with Brazil pointing out that its record 1984 trade surplus eliminated the need for ''new money'' this year. **********Pointing to a small recovery in economic growth, a buildup of foreign exchange reserves and the expectation of a $12 billion trade surplus in 1985, Brazilian officials also argued that the country should be allowed an interest rate ''spread'' - the margin paid above the London interbank offered rate - close to the 1.125 percent granted to Mexico last fall for its rescheduled debt payments. Now, one foreign banker said, ''if the trade surplus is much lower and new borrowing is required, then obviously Brazil will be considered a higher risk and will have to pay a larger spread.'' **********In the short term, Brazil could tap its existing reserves to cover the gap between its trade surplus plus and the $12 billion or so required to meet interest payments this year. Further, it could discourage imports in areas where ''import-substitution'' by local producers is still possible. **********A tight lid on imports has been a key element in keeping the trade surplus high. Imports fell last year by $1.5 billion, to $13.9 billion (compared with a record $22.9 billion in 1980). But the real thrust of the trade surplus has come from the exports themselves, which jumped from $21.9 billion in 1983 to $27 billion in 1984. **********Brazil's exporters have proved to be tough, dynamic and imaginative, constantly finding new markets for existing products and developing fresh approaches to established markets. They frequently earned huge profits, but they also created the only new job opportunities in a troubled economy. **********Brazilian products are still in demand worldwide - if the price is right. The country's traditional exports, agricultural goods and raw materials, remain important sales items: coffee brought in $2.35 billion and iron ore $1.5 billion last year alone. Soya products, winter fruits and vegetables and, above all, orange juice, which earned $1.2 billion in 1984, are new - but already established - export products. **********Even more impressive, however, has been the growing sophistication of Brazil's industrial and manufactured exports. Its steel, leather and textile goods, although constantly struggling to duck beneath the protectionist barriers set up by industrialized nations, have long since found a place on world markets. And the nation can also boast of the quality and competitiveness of its heavy machinery, vehicles, aircraft, electronics goods and armaments. **********Brazil's arms industry earned over $1 billion last year in sales of everything from armored cars to rocket systems. This month, for example, Britain's Royal Air Force decided to purchase Brazil's Tucano pilot- trainer aircraft in a contract worth $150 million. **********Yet even efficient exporters - here and elsewhere - are vulnerable to variables beyond their control. This year's sudden strengthening of the dollar, to which the Brazilian currency is attached, is believed to be partly responsible for the country's recent trade setback. The dollar's muscle cheapened competing Western European products in the United States and inflated the cost of Brazilian goods in Europe, in each case by about 20 percent. **********The problem of an overvalued cruzeiro was already apparent last year when regular devaluations lagged behind the record 230 percent inflation rate. But this was compensated for by domestic export incentives and by the economic boom in the United States, which took well over half of Brazil's additional exports. **********NOW, however, Brazilian exports of steel and textiles are being further held down by ''voluntary restraint'' agreements and quotas in the United States. And in Brazil, domestic export credits have been frozen and the export incentive system has been phased out under the terms of an accord with GATT. **********''We're not seeking privileges,'' said Mr. Setubal of the exporters' association. ''We only want the same working conditions as our international competitors. If exports are good business, the entrepreneur will work and invest. If they are not, business will cool off. No one exports through patriotism.'' **********Significantly, Brazil has recently entered into two important ''counter-trade'' agreements, with Nigeria and the Soviet Union, under which the two countries will receive $500 million and $750 million, respectively, of Brazilian goods in exchange for oil exports to this country. Similar deals already exist between Brazil and both Iraq and Angola. **********While these accords add nothing to the trade surplus, they open up new markets for Brazilian goods to compensate for the oil that the country is obliged to import. Last year, oil and petroleum derivatives cost Brazil $6.5 billion, an amount equivalent to 47 percent of all imports. **********The trade dilemma facing the new Brazilian Government defies simple solutions. But two things seem clear enough: Brazil needs to export to keep alive its hopes for a solid economic recovery, and Brazilian goods, especially the manufactured exports, have the quality needed to penetrate world markets. Now the country must find the right mechanism to reconcile the problem with the solution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/27/business/lloyd-s-plans-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lloyd's Plans Inquiry", "print_headline": "Lloyd's Plans Inquiry", "body_text": " **********Lloyd's of London said today that it would investigate the conduct of three of its ill-fated insurance underwriting syndicates. **********But Lloyd's chairman, Peter Miller, said at the annual general meeting of the world's largest insurance market that Lloyd's would still insist that syndicate members be held responsible for any losses.

He appeared on the television program ''Donahue'' earlier in the week, and last night he spoke to the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. **********By Invitation Only **********Mr. Ortega, who spoke through an interpreter, said he had hoped to hold similar sessions in other cities around the country, but had been prevented from doing so when the State Department delayed approval of his visa. He said charges he had canceled the tour to avoid questions about a recent decree suspending political rights were ''disinformation'' and held up his passport as proof. **********In welcoming Mr. Ortega, Ruth W. Messinger, a City Council member, said she was looking forward to the kind of ''hard questions, thoughtful answers and useful dialogue'' that characterize the traditional New England town meeting. But for the most part, Mr. Ortega was spared that kind of sharp debate. **********Admission was by invitation only. And the audience, which included the poet Allen Ginsberg, Ron Kovic, a Vietnam veterans' activist, and a host of representatives from groups around the country that support the Sandinistas, made it clear from the start that it admired Mr. Ortega. **********''Many of us have long demonstrated against presidents,'' Kenneth Grossinger, a member of the Committee for Nonintervention in Central America, told Mr. Ortega. ''It's refreshing to be here in support of a president.'' **********Mr. Grossinger then presented Mr. Ortega with a check for $2,500, which he described as ''reparations'' for damages Reagan Administration policy has inflicted on Nicaragua. **********'A Revolution of Concern' **********Several speakers stepped up to the microphone to assure Mr. Ortega that they understood that the reimposition of a state of emergency in Nicaragua was a ''necessary'' measure. That action, announced last week, suspended habeas corpus and the rights of public assembly, travel, press and strikes. **********Others told the Nicaraguan delegation, which included Mr. Ortega, his wife, Rosario, several members of his Cabinet and the ambassadors to the United States and the United Nations, that they would do everything in their power to halt the Reagan Administration's support for anti-Sandinista rebels and prevent a possible American military intervention in Central America. **********''What my Government did, paralyzing me and wounding a generation, we will not allow ever to happen again,'' Mr. Kovic said. ''We know your revolution is a revolution of concern, of caring, of sensitivity.'' **********Richard Streb, a professor at Teachers College at Columbia University, asked why the Nicaraguan Government was not doing more to ''counter the obviously distorted information we are getting.'' **********''The problem,'' replied Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman, ''is that we can't really control what gets printed and aired.'' **********He urged Sandinista supporters here to press Nicaragua's case to try ''to change that situation'' since ''this is a free and democratic country,'' a remark that drew hoots from some of those present. **********One Question Draws Hisses **********The most pointed question of the session came from Lisel Burns of the Ethical Culture Society, who asked about the ''ethical'' criteria by which the Sandinista Front governs and wondered about the propriety of Mr. Ortega's purchase of more than $3,500 in designer eyeglasses while in New York. Her question drew scattered hisses from the audience. **********A moderator promised that Mr. Ortega would answer the question in final remarks summarizing the meeting. But the Nicaraguan leader did not do so in his 45-minute closing speech, which touched on subjects from the impact of the United States economic embargo to the similarities and differences between the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions. **********Mr. Ortega explained the imposition of a state of emergency by saying that he could either ''make our friends happy and deliver a dead revolution'' by taking no steps against what he called sabotage and terrorism on the part of the armed opposition, or protect the revolution ''and have some misunderstandings with our friends.'' **********He also defended his trip to Moscow earlier this year and said he would like to have good relations with the United States. But he was critical of Mr. Reagan's speech to the United Nations on Thursday, noting the President's reference to a baby saved from the wreckage of the recent Mexican earthquake. **********''That child was rescued by Mexicans,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''President Reagan could rescue thousands of children if he stopped arming mercenaries in Nicaragua.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/07/business/boom-aids-providers-of-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOOM AIDS PROVIDERS OF DATA", "print_headline": "BOOM AIDS PROVIDERS OF DATA", "body_text": " **********The boom in real-time information has been a bonanza for some companies that provide data, and it has sparked an influx into the business from other kinds of companies. **********The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, is working with Merrill Lynch & Company in a joint venture to provide stock quotations through computers. Last month, however, they announced that they would cut back their marketing effort and focus first on installing the system at Merrill Lynch. **********Another recent entrant into the business is Citicorp, the world's largest banking company, which last month formed a joint venture with McGraw Hill Inc. The joint venture will provide information about the oil and chemical markets, and allow people not only to trade over computers but also to use their terminals to arrange letters of credit, insurance and inspections of cargo. **********Systems Designer Acquired **********The three dominant companies in the financial information business -Reuters Holdings P.L.C., Telerate Inc. and Quotron Systems Inc. - are also broadening their focus. Reuters, for example, acquired Rich Inc., a designer of dealing room systems, in April. The result is that Reuters will not only provide information, but also the work station and computer architecture where it arrives. **********In another move aimed at broadening its scope, Reuters is bidding to acquire 20 percent of Instinet, a computer network that allows large stock trades off the floor of a stock exchange.

A key advantage of Telerate is its 25-year contract to get market data from the Cantor, Fitzgerald Securities Corporation, a major broker. Reuters is now getting data from MKI Government Brokers Inc, but MKI is a much smaller player than Cantor. **********Telerate's revenues are bounding ahead, and at an expected $150 million or more this year will be more than double the 1983 level. Although much of the revenues are reinvested, analysts at Dean Witter Reynolds expect Telerate's net income to grow at an annual average rate of 25 percent over the next five years. The stock has been drifting recently; it closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $15.125. **********The company that dominates stock quotations in the United States is Quotron, of Los Angeles, which doubled its profit and revenues between 1981 and 1984. Last year it had a net income of $27 million on revenues of $190 million, and it has been working on improving its technology to allow subscribers to compute data more easily. **********Quotron's stock has been little changed this year, partly because of concern about competition from the I.B.M.-Merrill Lynch joint venture.

Mr. Kerkorian gets tighter control over the United Artists unit, which he could use as a base for other acquisitions. **********A leveraged buyout of MTV for $471 million was offered by Forstmann Little and the music channel's management. Warner Communications then approved a plan to buy out American Express, its partner,in two-thirds of MTV, for $450 million. But Viacom has complicated matters even further. It wants to buy the cable music channel, too, and offered $310 million for Warner Amex's stake in MTV. If Warner Amex agrees, Viacom also would get the right to acquire the 50 percent of Warner Amex that Warner Communications says it will buy from American Express. The end result is likely to be a sale, rather than a buyout, of MTV. **********BankAmerica cut its dividend for the first time in more than 50 years. The move, which reduces the dividend to 20 cents a share, from 38 cents, will save the bank $109 million a year. BankAmerica had been paying out 86 percent of its earnings on dividends, far above the industry norm, and a $338 million second-quarter loss meant that its earnings would not cover the dividend payments. Analysts said the cut would help BankAmerica get back on its feet, but that more changes were needed. BankAmerica officials denied that Federal regulators pressured them into the move. **********A bailout of the Bowery Savings Bank may be planned by Warren E. Buffett, Laurence A.

Mr. Buffett is the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Tisch is chairman of Loews, and Mr. Ravitch is the former director of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. **********Carl C. Icahn appeared to win his bid for control of T.W.A., but Texas Air was not giving up. Mr. Icahn offered $24 a share - topping the $23 offer from Texas Air that was originally accepted by T.W.A. - and has amassed 45.5 percent of T.W.A. stock. As added insurance, Mr. Icahn has also played on union employees' fears of the anti-union tactics of Frank A. Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, by negotiating pacts that would cut T.W.A.'s labor costs and give the workers a stake in the company. Texas Air struck back with a $26-a-share offer, but analysts said it is just a matter of time before Mr. Icahn takes control. **********Beatrice's chairman was ousted in a move that analysts believe will be beneficial in the long run. James L. Dutt was replaced by William W. Granger Jr., whose own tenure is considered by most to be transitional because he is 66 years old. Analysts said that Mr. Dutt's style had caused excessive turnover, and that he had not done enough to assimilate the varied segments of the company's business. **********The Treasury sold a record $21.75 billion in new notes and bonds, and investors responded well, fueling a modest rally. But trading was at times erratic. The announcement of a $1.3 billion increase in the money supply had no effect. **********Stocks fell broadly, including a 21.73-point nosedive on Tuesday. By the end of the week, the Dow had lost 32.26 points, to close at 1,320.79. **********L. F. Rothschild rejected a takeover offer from General Felt, but realigned its organization. Rothschild's biggest stockholder, J. Rothschild of London, apparently favored a planned public offering to a takeover. Analysts said the General Felt bid shook the company, and that Rothschild will now bolster earnings and revitalize management. **********Leucadia bid again for National Intergroup, offering $35 a share, or $750 million, for the metals and financial company. Leucadia has been twice rebuffed in proxy fights, but now says it will pay cash if National Intergroup completes its sale of First Nationwide Financial to Ford Motor, and stops its purchase of Permian. **********The buyout of Mary Kay Cosmetics is in trouble. Republicbank of Dallas backed out of its tentative agreement to provide $45 million toward the deal, being arranged by Mary Kay Ash and her son, Richard Rogers. Analysts believe the bank was irked that it had not been asked to be the lead bank. **********Gulf Canada will sell some of its refining and marketing assets to Petro-Canada for $500 million. Olympia & York bought Gulf Canada's assets from Chevron last week. **********Saul P. Steinberg gained control of Frank B. Hall, the big insurance broker, when its top officer, Albert J. Tahmoush, resigned. Mr. Steinberg used his 20 percent of the company's stock to force out Mr. Tahmoush. **********Columbia Gas offered to pay its gas producers $800 million to revise its take-or-pay contracts.

The revisions would also ease the financial burden on Columbia from its court-ordered billion-dollar refund program. **********Miscellanea.

His soldiers accuse American and Salvadoran officials of organizing efforts to kill him, and they are deeply suspicious of foreigners who come into their area. **********Mr. Villalobos has often been accused by rebel officials and by outside observers of relying too much on military means to wage the civil war and of lacking political talent. **********Favored 'Final Offensive' **********In 1981, he argued for a rebel ''final offensive,'' saying it would lead to a mass uprising of the population. But the offensive failed to win wide support and ended in a decisive army victory against ill-prepared guerrilla units. **********Mr. Villalobos is also reliably reported to have either killed or ordered the killing in 1974 of Roque Dalton, a rival rebel leader. The slaying split rebel forces into opposing factions, a schism that has seemed to heal only in the last years of war. **********Last year, rebels under Mr. Villalobos's command forced more than 1,000 peasant youths to join rebel units, a roundup that caused hundreds of peasant families to flee guerrilla zones. Rebel units shot some deserters before the forced recruitment drive was halted. Mr. Villalobos now says the recruiting was a mistake. **********He is now leading a campaign to kidnap mayors and burn their offices. Rebel units have killed at least one mayor. A side effect is that they have also terrified villagers. **********Called Best Single Commander **********Purely as a military man, Mr. Villalobos is seen as perhaps the best single commander in the conflict. A senior United States Special Forces officer in El Salvador once called him a genius in the art of guerrilla war. **********His forces have performed less well in the last year, but from 1982 to 1984 they mauled the Salvadoran Army in the eastern third of the country, destroying main force units, repeatedly taking towns and seizing tons of equipment. **********Mr. Villalobos has shown himself to be be highly adaptable and ruthless when necessary. As the army improved its performance last year, he shifted from large battles that left his men exposed, to a war of elusive small units, mines, booby traps, assassination and deception. **********The army sent its best combat commander, Col. Domingo Monterrosa, to defeat the rebel forces in the east and to kill Mr. Villalobos. The two men sparred for almost a year in a very personal duel, and Colonel Monterrosa bloodied rebel forces in much of their operational zone. **********Said to Have Directed Killing **********Mr. Villalobos responded, according to two Salvadoran sources who knew Colonel Monterrosa, by sending a message inviting the colonel to join forces with him. **********When he declined, the sources say, Mr. Villalobos had rebels place a bomb on the colonel's helicopter, killing him. Rebel commanders with Mr. Villalobos called the operation ''a kind of trap'' that used several ''special units.'' They took full responsibility for the bomb blast. **********Asked about the future, Mr. Villalobos promised more war. **********''There is no possibility of economic development,'' he said, ''unless it is founded on a national solution based on the end of North American intervention and unless it is with our participation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/16/business/stocks-end-mixed-in-heavy-day.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1985-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCKS END MIXED IN HEAVY DAY", "print_headline": "STOCKS END MIXED IN HEAVY DAY", "body_text": " **********Stock trading soared yesterday, but prices ended mixed as profit taking hit some of the blue-chip issues. **********The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 3.75 points, to 1,230.79, while the Dow Jones transportation and utility averages rose moderately, as did most other key market indexes. **********Turnover ballooned to 155.3 million shares on the Big Board, from 124.9 million shares on Monday, on strong public as well as institutional participation.

The company said yesterday that Mr. Lay is still scheduled to become chairman at that time. **********Mr. Segnar, 58 years old, would not comment yesterday.

DEFECTOR IS CALLED A BRITISH DOUBLE AGENT", "body_text": " **********A Soviet intelligence operative whose defection led Thursday to an order for the expulsion of 25 Russians from Britain had been working for Britain as a double agent for nearly 20 years, Western intelligence sources said today. **********It was also learned from British officials that the agent, Oleg A. Gordiyevsky, defected in late July or early last month because he feared that his cover had been destroyed. The officials said he believed that his life would be in danger if he remained at his post as head of the London mission of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency, for even a few more days. **********The timing of his departure from the mission indicated that his decision was not connected with the recent defection of the West German senior counterespionage officer, Hans Joachim Tiedge, who fled to East Berlin at least two weeks after Mr. Gordiyevsky's defection. **********Speculation Dismissed **********In the mood of fevered speculation that followed the announcement of Mr. Gordiyevsky's defection Thursday, it was widely suggested here that Mr. Tiedge's sudden switch had alarmed M.I.5, the British military intelligence service, because Mr. Tiedge might have tipped off the Russians about Mr. Gordiyevsky. M.I.5 therefore decided, so the speculation ran, to call Mr. Gordiyevsky in. **********But authoritative officials, in addition to pointing out that the timing was wrong, said it was inconceivable that the West Germans, with their poor security record, would have been told that the British had a double agent high up in the K.G.B. **********The first disclosure that Mr. Gordiyevsky had been working for the West came late Thursday night from the Danish Justice Minister, Erik Ninn-Hansen, who said on television that the Soviet agent had started working for his Government shortly after he was posted to Copenhagen in 1966 with the title of press attache. **********Officials in Copenhagen suggested that Mr. Gordiyevsky had fed information to them from 1966 until his departure in 1970 and then from his return in 1972 to 1978. Three Soviet diplomats were expelled from Denmark in 1977, possibly on the basis of Mr. Gordiyevsky's work. **********According to these sources, Mr. Gordiyevsky was ''handed over'' to the British by the Danes when he was sent here in 1982 as an embassy counselor. He was promoted to London ''resident,'' or K.G.B. station chief, only a few months ago. **********British Dispute Danes **********That account was hotly disputed by the British, at least unofficially. Intelligence sources here said Mr. Gordiyevsky had been working for Britain from the start, while cooperating with the Danes as well. **********One retired covert operative said, ''It's pure poppycock to suggest that we took him over from anyone else.'' **********Plagued for years by revelations of treachery by Britons recruited by the Russians, the British Government appeared to be determined to take as much credit as possible for having brought a key figure over to the West. Mr. Gordiyevsky would appear to be the highest-ranking Western espionage source within the K.G.B. who has ever been publicly identified. **********Thwarting Defection Attempt **********Some diplomats here say Mr. Gordiyevsky may have been responsible in 1983 for foiling the attempt of Michael Bettaney, an M.I.5 officer, to become a double agent. Mr. Bettaney was apprehended and imprisoned after he had approached the Soviet Embassy and offered it information about M.I.5 operations. The embassy turned him down - possibly, it was being argued today, because Mr. Gordiyevsky had said he could not be trusted. **********Mr. Gordiyevsky, 46 years old, is said to be married and the father of two children. He is still being questioned at a ''safe house'' in the countryside near London. According to one report, American security officers have been involved in questioning him, but this could not be confirmed. **********The intelligence sources said he had gone to work for the West not because of lavish promises but for ''reasons of principle.'' They were unable to explain how a man carefully screened and rigorously trained for an espionage career could make such a momentous decision so quickly after his arrival in Western Europe. **********Mr. Gordiyevsky's wife is believed to be with him at the safe house, but the whereabouts of their children is not known. **********Britain Sanctions Defection **********While they have apparently garnered detailed information from the defector about K.G.B. operations and contacts in Britain and elsewhere in the West, the British would have preferred to leave Mr. Gordiyevsky in place, under cover, where he could have continued to feed them data. **********The British decision to sanction his defection may have resulted not only from his own reported fears but also from memories of the Penkovsky case. Col. Oleg Penkovsky, a K.G.B. agent who had worked for Britain in association with the British agent Greville Wynne, reportedly asked in 1962 to be allowed to defect. His request was turned down, and not much later he was trapped by his Soviet masters and executed. **********Foreign Office officials said they had heard nothing about reciprocal expulsions of Britons from the Soviet Union but conceded that such expulsions seemed highly likely. The officials denied a broadcast report that the British Government had prepared a list of 15 to 20 other Russians in Britain who would be ousted in the event of Russian retaliation for the British expulsion order. **********None of the 25 Soviet diplomats, officials, journalists and others named as spies left Britain today. One of them, Yuri A. Kudimov, said the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was being ''illogical and stupid.'' Mr. Kudimov, who was identified by the British Government as a correspondent for the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, denied he had taken part in espionage work of any kind. **********The 25 have been given three weeks to leave the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/business/west-german-prices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "West German Prices", "print_headline": "West German Prices", "body_text": " **********Producer prices in West Germany rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February from a month earlier and 3.1 percent from February 1984, the Government said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/30/business/fidelcor-to-buy-ivb-financial.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fidelcor to Buy IVB Financial", "print_headline": "Fidelcor to Buy IVB Financial", "body_text": " **********Fidelcor Inc., the parent company of Fidelity Bank, said it would acquire the IVB Financial Corporation, parent of Industrial Valley Bank and Trust Company, for $168 million. **********Fidelcor, which had $6.2 billion in assets at the end of June, operates 98 retail banking offices and 62 automated-teller machines.

With existing farm programs, costs to taxpayers have soared, food prices have in some cases doubled or tripled, crop exports have nosedived and farm income has fallen. Yet, as the debate in Washington this last month has made painfully clear, most Congressmen favor perpetuating the tangle of failed and contradictory programs or making them even worse, by imposing manadatory production controls over millions of farmers. **********American agricultural policies are a cruel joke. Sugar prices are pegged at four times world prices. The dairy program drives cheese prices to double world price levels. The wool program gave sheep ranchers far more in price-support payments last year than the entire wool crop was worth. The dairy, sugar and peanut programs alone add $7 billion a year to consumer food bills. The Government has spent the equivalent of more than $70,000 per full-time farmer since 1981 - yet farmers are not prospering. **********The current farm recession stems largely from the 1981 Farm Bill, which presupposed insatiable world demand for American crops - and that Congress could set price supports wherever it chose, since foreigners would have to buy American crops. Congress set high price supports - and foreign demand nosedived as it became cheaper to buy elsewhere. **********Since almost half of America's grain harvest is sold abroad, the 15 percent fall in export sales since 1981 has devastated wheat farmers. As it became obvious that price supports were too high, the Reagan Administration responded with the Payment In Kind program, which paid farmers not to grow crops. With the $10 billion P.I.K. Band-Aid, America tried to boost world prices by slashing its production. But this only encouraged foreigners to plow more land, which both further reduced America's share and kept world grain prices down. **********American agriculture is also depressed partly because of continual barrages of Government-sponsored cheap credit. Every time in past decades that farming was on the verge of shrinking to a reasonable size, Congress rushed in with more easy money. The result was soaring land values and continual overproduction. **********Almost every farm group is complaining about persistent crop surpluses. Yet the same lobbies are also demanding more cheap Federal credit. But agriculture is heavily overcapitalized right now - which is why the Government is spending billions annually to pay farmers not to sow on tens of millions of acres. **********Many Congressmen favor a special Federal boost for falling land values, one more bad idea from Capitol Hill. But for most export crops, debt-servicing costs - the result largely of high land prices - are a larger portion of production costs than labor. High land prices have made American farmers less competitive on world markets. Lower land values, though causing a temporary loan-servicing crunch, would make American agriculture more competitive for the rest of the decade. MANY Americans favor an agriculture policy designed to protect the small-sized, full-time family farmer. But there is no way for farm income support programs to be both equitable and effective. If Federal aid is to reduce crop sizes significantly, it must go to big farmers, who don't need the money. Small farmers do not produce a large enough share of the harvest to make a difference. **********Most full-time farmers are wealthy compared with other Americans. The average full-time farmer's net worth as of Jan. 1, 1984, was $790,000. The average net worth of a ''small'' full-time farmer (those with net sales between $40,000 and $100,000 a year) was $532,000. By comparison, the net worth of the average American household is $136,000. **********The best thing for the future of American agriculture would be for tens of thousands of farmers to cash in their chips. This may seem unkind - but the alternative is for the Government to perpetually pay farmers not to farm. Too much farmland was brought into production during the booming 1970's and much of that farmland - much of it low-quality acreage that is hard to work profitably - should be retired. **********We need an agriculture policy that admits the existence of world markets. For 50 years, Congress has tried to manage agricultural supplies and prices by paying farmers not to grow. Paid set-asides have always been used in conjunction with higher-than-market price supports. Thus, Government first encouraged farmers to grow, and then paid them not to grow. This is plain stupidity that we can no longer afford. **********Crop price supports should be slashed to between 75 percent and 80 percent of world market prices. This would dampen grain prices in the short run and make it too expensive for the European Economic Community to continue its lavish agricultural subsidies. The bankruptcy of the E.E.C.'s agricultural programs -knocking out the United States' biggest source of subsidized competition - would be one of the best thing that could happen for American farmers. **********Congress should get out of the agriculture business. The gold-plated farmer safety net is raising production costs, sending the wrong signal to foreign competitors and preventing farmers from reacting to market signals. Farmers can either endure a couple more hard years with deregulation and then recapture lost export markets - or become permanent wards of the state."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/24/business/finance-new-issues-low-bidder-fails-to-get-transcontinental-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 289, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Low Bidder Fails to Get Transcontinental Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Low Bidder Fails to Get Transcontinental Bonds", "body_text": " **********The Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation created a stir in the corporate bond market yesterday when it failed to award the bonds to the securities firm whose bid was most favorable to the company. **********Transcontinental officials declined to return phone calls and explain the action, but investment bankers on Wall Street were aghast at the way the sale was handled. **********''They didn't follow the rules,'' said an official at Salomon Brothers, whose bid called for a lower net interest cost to the company than the winning bid submitted by Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Salomon Brothers proposed to buy from Trancontinental 9 3/4 percent bonds at a price of 99.392 for a net interest cost of 9.989 percent.

''There are still a lot of potential investors who either did not participate in the auctions or have room for more bonds in their portfolios but are still on the sidelines,'' said one institutional salesman who asked not to be identified. **********The cautious investment policy of many investors stems from the cloudy outlook for the economy, with some analysts expecting the economy to rebound and put upward pressure on rates and others expecting sluggish growth and lower rates. Evidence exists to support both views, adding to the willingness of some participants to wait for more economic data and to keep a large part of their funds in highly liquid short-term issues. **********Not Clear-Cut **********Although yesterday's price declines coincided with a stonger than expected rise in July retail sales of four-tenths of 1 percent, many economists noted that the retail sales data were not clear-cut evidence of a strengthening economy. They noted that June's data were revised to show a decline of 1.4 percent rather than an eight-tenths of 1 percent decline as initially reported. Some analysts who expect the economy to remain sluggish put more weight on monthly sales reports by department stores and other retailers, which show that sales are weak compared with a year ago. **********The rise in sales from June ''looks as though sales began the third quarter on an upward trajectory,'' said analysts at Ried, Thunberg & Company, an economic analysis firm based in Westport, Conn. But they added that early Commerce Department reports on retail sales data are unreliable and concluded that July's gains point to ''a moderate pick-up in economic activity from the slow first half of the year.'' In the first half, gross national product increased at only a 1 percent rate, after inflation. **********New Issues **********Among new Treasury issues, the 9 1/2 percent notes due in 1988 were offered at 100 15/32, down 3/32, to yield 9.32 percent and the 10 1/2 percent notes due in 1995 were at 100 15/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 10.42 percent. In the long bond market, the 10 5/8 percent issue due in 2015 was offered at 99 14/32, down 14/32, to yield 10.69 percent. **********The three- and 10-year issues continue to trade at prices above the averages set at last week's auctions, while the 30-year bond has fallen below last week's average price of 99 22/32. **********In the short-term market, rates were mixed with little change for Treasury bills, while rates were up a few hundredths of a percentage point for other short-term issues. The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, a closely watched benchmark for other short-term issues, traded around 8 percent most of the day, before declining to 7 3/4 percent in the late afternoon. The Federal Reserve Board temporarily added reserves to the banking system by arranging overnight purchases of securities, leading many analysts to conclude that there are no signs of any adjustment in the Fed's monetary policy. **********Syndicate of 44 Firms **********Elsewhere in the credit markets, officials at Goldman, Sachs International said they have assembled a syndicate of 44 firms to offer $500 million of convertible Eurobonds for Rockefeller Center Properties. Rockefeller Center is a newly organized company whose chief asset is Rockefeller Center in New York City, and which plans to offer 30 million shares of stock at $20 a share in the United States as well as 15-year convertible debt issues in the Eurobond market. **********A $335 million convertible issue is expected to pay 8 percent interest for the first nine years, before rising to 13 percent.

Another convertible issue consists of $730 million face amount of zero coupon bonds expected to be offered at 22.58, or $225.80 per $1,000 face amount. Both issues may be converted into common stock after 15 years, with a conversion price of $11.82 for the interest-bearing bonds and $21.71 for the zero coupon bonds. **********If holders of the bonds do not convert them into Rockefeller Center stock, they will receive a seven-year floating rate note paying an interest rate of between one-fourth of one percentage point and one percentage point above the rate for London bank deposits of a maturity yet to be specified."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/17/business/frank-borman-s-most-difficult-days.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1985-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRANK BORMAN'S MOST DIFFICULT DAYS", "print_headline": "FRANK BORMAN'S MOST DIFFICULT DAYS", "body_text": " **********MIAMI FOR a man who heads an airline, Frank Borman is the ultimate pilot. His celestial exploits are legendary: America remembers how he read from the Bible on Christmas Eve as he commanded the first manned orbit of the moon. Since then, Mr. Borman's sights have become more terrestrial. For nearly a decade, he has headed chronically troubled Eastern Air Lines, the nation's third-largest carrier. But, in that time, Mr. Borman has failed to break the cycle of crisis that continues to haunt Eastern and has steered the airline dangerously close to financial disaster. **********Trouble struck again this month - the most serious Eastern has ever faced. The airline fell into technical default to its bankers over its inability to draft a new employee wage contract. Eleventh-hour negotiations eventually produced the needed agreement, but deeper problems remain. Eastern has been unprofitable since 1979 and it is unclear when - and if - it will begin making money. The airline has racked up $380 million in losses over the last five years, and its debt has swelled to a staggering $2.5 billion. Labor relations are touchy, at best, and the good will that Mr. Borman once enjoyed is now long gone. **********''When Borman came in, he had a wealth of good will from employees, and that's been totally dissipated,'' said D. Quinn Mills, a labor expert and professor at the Harvard Business School. ''That's happened in little pieces over the last two to three years. He's not very effective in that job any longer and that's unfortunate.'' Added Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers: ''Borman's image has been hurt and the company itself will probably just drift along in its lackluster way. Drifting is the best way I can put it.'' **********For his part, Mr. Borman predicts a rosy future for his company and himself. ''I'm confident we will emerge from 1985 and this decade as a tough, competitive and successful company,'' said Mr. Borman, 55, in his spacious office decorated with models of new planes and paintings of old ones. ''The average Eastern employee knows I care about him and his future. If I didn't think the employees felt that way, I'd leave and I don't intend to leave.'' **********Such optimism notwithstanding, many lay the blame for Eastern's current problems squarely on Mr. Borman, the astronaut-hero who became one of America's best-known businessmen when he took to the airwaves as Eastern's pitchman. Critics contend Mr. Borman spent money for the latest aircraft when the airline could not afford to do so - amassing the huge debt that now hangs like a noose. His blunt manner has only antagonized labor - ''like oil and water,'' said one analyst - just when the airline dearly needs labor concession. Given such deep- rooted labor and financial problems, it is virtutally impossible to foretell how the drama at Eastern will play out. **********EASTERN'S continued inability to make money leaves it vulnerable on many fronts: to a recession, low-cost competitors and any unforseen events that may come its way. Its financial weakness has forced Mr. Borman to yield an extraordinary amount of control to Eastern's lenders and its employees - who now hold the trump cards and are playing them with skill. Employees own 25 percent of the company and hold four seats on the board. Yet even this level of employee involvement still wasn't enough to stave off the frantic negotiations earlier this month, as labor battled the company and the bankers turned up the heat. **********When Mr. Borman took over as chief executive officer in 1975, the company was, even then, teetering on bankruptcy. He upgraded its aging fleet, streamlined its routes, improved its service and turned in four straight years of record profits. But that success began to sour in the early 80's, as the impact of deregulation unfolded and hit Eastern harder than most other airlines. Its East Coast corridor became the first battleground for fare wars and low-cost entrants scampered into its New York-to-Florida lifeline. ''Lots of other airlines didn't know how to spell People Express. We sure did,'' said Morton Ehrlich, Eastern's senior vice president for planning. **********With fuel prices hitting new highs in the mid-1970's, Mr. Borman directed Eastern on a highly controversial aircraft-buying spree, incurring enormous debt to buy new Airbuses and Boeing 757s. This has given Eastern the newest and most fuel-efficient fleet in the American skies - just as fuel prices have fallen to lows not seen in many years. The debt for those purchases consumes about $235 million in interest expense annually, pushing Eastern's debt-to-equity ratio to a precipitous 8-to-1. As a result, the first 6 1/2 cents of every dollar earned at Eastern goes to repay that debt. ''Their financial situation is very serious,'' said Hans Plickert, an analyst with E.F. Hutton. ''They're highly leveraged and their expenses virtually eat up all their revenues.'' **********Mr. Borman strongly defends his aircraft purchases, particularly the Boeing 757, which he claimed has been ''profitable from the day it hit the property.'' Debt aside, Mr. Borman maintained: ''If you don't have the latest equipment in a free market, it doesn't matter how friendly your people are. They're not working at People Express wages.'' Analysts say it is difficult to fault Eastern for miscalculating the direction of oil prices and that a modern fleet is an admirable goal. Despite this, they still question whether Eastern mortgaged its future with these planes. **********''Whether the airplane acquisitions were a good or a bad move is not the question. Eastern simply couldn't afford it,'' said one banker close to the company. Added Mr. Joedicke, of Shearson Lehman Brothers: ''Borman is an aeronautical engineer, a pilot, an astronaut. He's bound to have a predilection for equipment. Some may be safety, but some may be gadgets. He's attempted to buy the latest aircraft and that's desirable. But when you are $2.5 billion in debt, can you afford it?'' **********MR. BORMAN is repeatedly described as being autocratic, of running his operation like a military bureaucracy and of being irritatingly direct. Many say he has lost credibility with his workers through a series of well-publicized flip-flops. In the midst of tough labor talks in 1983, Mr. Borman threatened bankruptcy and said he would take a strike, only to back down on both counts. Over the years, Eastern employees have been asked to participate in a variety of different wage reduction programs under the promise of a profitable future that has yet to be seen. And, the continual financial crises have taken their toll on the psyche of employees. **********''We've had eight years of recycled crises every six months,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, District 100, which represents Eastern employees and is the biggest, toughest bargaining unit. ''The employees are tired of living like that.'' **********''Eastern's got a bureaucratic, militaristic and autocratic way of doing business that doesn't work,'' said Robert T. Brophy, chairman of the negotiating committee for the Air Line Pilots Association at Eastern. ''We all have our faults and one of Borman's is that he is very paternalistic, especially to the pilots. In negotiations, the company keeps drawing lines in the sand. It becomes a little like the boy who cried wolf.'' **********Even as staunch a supporter of Mr. Borman as William J. Usery Jr., the former United States Labor Secretary, who was hired by Eastern to mediate between it and its unions, admits that Mr. Borman has problems with his employees. But Mr. Usery has a more charitable explanation: ''Borman's fault is that he's too desirous to be helpful to employees. He promises to do things and later, he can't deliver them. It appears that he's not dealing fairly, but that's just not true. It's a minor miracle that he's kept the airline together.'' **********Mr. Borman bristles at his critics. ''All that military talk is the biggest baloney,'' said Mr. Borman, a short, athletic man who spent 20 years in the Air Force and lead the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. ''I've been chief executive officer of a major airline longer than anyone else, and I've taken Eastern through four of its most profitable years. And I unilaterally reject an autocratic approach.'' **********Yet the years have taken their toll: ''I'm tired of being a pincushion for people who keep taking liberties with the truth,'' he complained and added, referring to Eastern's unions, ''sometimes, I get frustrated up to here'' and drew his hand across his neck. **********The well-publicized labor negotiations that spanned the last several weeks were among Eastern's darkest hours - a crisis that some say Mr. Borman precipitated, one that Mr. Borman blames on the unions. What is particularly distressing is that it came after a year of tenuous labor rapprochement, resulting from the revolutionary 1984 wage agreement in which the employees gave up a scheduled 18 percent wage increase and accepted a one-year wage freeze in return for 25 percent of Eastern's stock and four seats on its board. This tradeoff reflected a belief by the workers that concessions on their part would be required to keep Eastern viable and their jobs secure. Still, the unions were awaiting the lifting of the wage freeze scheduled for Dec. 31, 1984. **********At the same time, Eastern had to submit to its lenders, by Dec. 31, 1984, a new business plan - which included a final determination of Eastern's 1985 wage costs. Eastern is chronically in violation of covenants to its loan agreements that require it to maintain a certain degree of financial health. But each year Eastern's bankers grant the airline a waiver that, in effect, makes these violations meaningless. Whether this waiver would be extended for yet another year depended on Eastern's ability to produce a 1985 wage contract. **********Negotiations between Eastern and its unions were going nowhere as the due date approached and on Dec. 31, Mr. Borman threw down the gauntlet. He announced that the wage freeze would be continued and that the 18 percent increase would not be instituted. It was an action that infuriated the unions, put the two sides in court and stopped the negotiations cold. **********Eastern claims it had no choice - it couldn't afford the $22 million a month to cover the higher wages and the unions were being obstinant, besides. The unions say that Mr. Borman was not only obligated to provide the 18 percent, but it would also have been a good-faith gesture to rebuild trust between the two sides and smooth negotiations.. **********Indeed, the talks didn't resume in a serious way until Jan. 18, when Eastern agreed to pay the 18 percent as a show of good faith to get the negotiations back on track. On Feb. 8, Eastern and its unions agreed to a two- year contract with a 5 percent raise in the first year above the frozen wage level and a 6 percent raise in the second year. These wage increases are to be offset by specific productivity improvements from the workers. Eastern expects that better productivity will offset the cost of the higher wages - resulting in no net increase in Eastern's expenses in 1985. **********BUT the real danger was more than a simple labor tiff. The lenders had agreed to extend their Dec. 31 deadline for an agreement - the day when the waiver would expire - by one month. But, Jan. 31 came and went and there was still no wage contract. This put Eastern into technical default on its bank loans - meaning that it was still making its interest payments, but with its waiver dead, it now was obligated to prove a level of financial health that it clearly could not show. As a result, the lenders could force acceleration of payment on Eastern's debt, a move that would bankrupt the company. **********While it was doubtful the banks would do that, the specter of bankruptcy was beginning to send ripples of fear through ticket agents and passengers. Bookings began to dip - and a dip in revenues could have sunk the company as surely as the bankers. Some $300 million in outstanding tickets were held by Eastern passengers. Had they cashed them in - a form of a run on Eastern's bank - the $360 million in cash and short-term securities that Eastern carries on its balance sheet could have quickly been wiped out. And, while most lenders were refraining from calling their loans due, had one bolted, it is likely others would have followed and the rush would have been on. **********''It was a self-induced crisis,'' said Randy Barber, a labor consultant to Eastern's machinist union. ''I'm not minimizing the diceyness of default or the need to come up with something to please the banks. But escalating the panic didn't have to happen. Eastern did everything to trumpet bankruptcy even though it knew the banks were not about to pull the plug - and that led to a drop off in bookings. Eastern had the cash to sustain that wage hike, and if I had to prioritize crises, it was more important to satisfy the bankers and that required hard collective bargaining. But not giving back the wages created a smokescreen that prevented real negotiations. It was a total distortion of priorities.'' **********Mr. Borman takes strong exception to this view: ''There is no way we could have afforded an extra $22 million a month, and I took my action because it was the only way to establish a deadline. If we paid the 18 percent one month, it would have slipped in again, month by month. If we didn't take a crisis then, we could have had a worse problem long term. I didn't create a crisis. It was a real one.'' **********Eastern's most recent predicament reflects the fact that over the years Eastern has had to trade control of the company with the unions and banks in order to gain financial relief. Eastern's bankers keep it on a short leash through the annual waivers to Eastern's chronic violations of its loan covenants - which, as a practical matter, means that Eastern's lenders must approve the airline's basic business plan each year. It is a level of power that is does not always sit well with Eastern executives.''I'm not comfortable in a situation where control has passed from us to them,'' said Wayne A. Yeoman, Eastern's senior vice president for finance. **********Eastern has yielded even more to its employees: With four representatives on the board - including two union leaders, Mr. Bryan of the machinists and Robert V. Callahan, president of Transport Workers Local 553, which represents Eastern's flight attendants - there are few secrets between the company and employees. With employees owning 25 percent of the company, the unions feel they have a greater say, and stake, in the way Eastern is run. **********''Now you have the banks virtually dictating Eastern's business plan and the company frustrated the employees so much that they demanded an unprecedented level in running the company,'' said Mr. Barber, the consultant. ''In a financial sense and in an employee relations sense, Eastern had to pay the piper.'' **********Mr. Borman says that the company will give up no more control. ''We've gone as far as we can go,'' he said. ''To yield further control will deny us access to the public equity markets.'' Yet, now that the door is open, many want to step through. The pilots union, for instance, is talking about become a secured creditor to Eastern and has proposed such schemes as financing and leasing airplanes to Eastern. ''If the lenders can pull the strings at Eastern, then why not us?'' said Mr. Brophy of the pilots union. **********AS part of the 1984 wage freeze, the employees began to participate in - and help direct - a massive productivity program. The savings from the wage freeze, plus an estimated $50 million in productivity savings helped account for a remarkable turnaround in Eastern's 1984 financial performance. Operating earnings, which had been about $100 million in the red, swung by some $300 million in one year's time to reach a $189.6 million operating profit for the year. **********Eastern closed the year with two consecutive quarters of net profit, although for the whole year it lost $37.9 million on revenues of $4.3 billion. This compares with a $183 million loss in 1983 on revenues of $3.9 billion. For 1985, the company is boldly predicting it will produce a profit - some $90 million. Yet past predictions of profitability have failed to come true. **********But even more than the numbers, 1984 marked a tentative beginning of better labor relations. Machinists began to do more work in-house that Eastern formerly sent out - and paid a higher bill. Employees were cited for the smooth workings and quick turnaround time at Eastern's new facility in Kansas City. Flight attendants and pilots were flying additional hours and employees in some cities would drop off lost luggage on their way home for a small fee, less than the cost of taxis that Eastern have formerly used. **********Still, this new program, as remarkable as it may be, had not been in place long enough to prevent a return to the old, adversarial style when the hard bargining hit. **********''Eastern has the most extensive employee participation system of any American corporation today,'' said John Simmons, president of Participation Associations, an Amherst, Mass., firm that has consulted to Eastern. ''But you can't make a radical shift to a new management style in the short space of 12 months. When you reach an agreement to become cooperative and work together, people think it will instantly happen, but you can't change 40 years of adversarial relations one year.'' **********While Mr. Borman's aerial exploits still inspire awe, the fact that he has slipped in the eyes of many is a source of disappointment. ''When Borman first came here, he swung a big hand and said 'I'm president,' '' said Mr. Callahan of the flight attendants union. ''No matter what was wrong, people always thought that Frank would make it right. **********''So when he began to act in a more corporate game-playing way, it was so out-of-character that people became upset. There was a sense of violation,'' he added. ''It was almost as though he was the parent and he had done something wrong. It was like thinking your father was a teetotaler and then coming home one day to find him drunk.'' **********FOR '85,NEW OPTIMISM **********Eastern's management predicts the company's fortunes are about to improve. Executives proudly point to the fact that the airline narrowed its losses in 1984 and are venturing to predict that 1985 may be the year that its money-losing streak is broken. **********They feel they are beginning to battle back effectively in the Northeast-to-Florida corridor. Two low-cost competitors, Air Florida and Northeastern, have either been knocked out or are seriously faltering. Eastern has a sophisticated capacity-control system, which sets up a multi- tiered fare scheme, that it claims has succeeded in pulling passengers off rival People Express. **********With Continental operating again in Houston, Eastern finds it cannot compete effectively against this full-service low-cost carrier and is pulling back there. But Eastern says operations in Kansas City are coming along nicely, as are Latin American routes. The shuttles to Boston and Washington and its Atlanta operation remain consistent money makers. **********Recently negotiated wage settlements will apparently give the airline two years of labor peace, and Eastern believes that much more can be gained through productivity improvements. ''I think we've got the formula for success spelled out,'' said Morton Ehrlich, Eastern's senior vice president for planning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/26/world/around-the-world-floods-kill-at-least-71-in-southern-brazil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Floods Kill at Least 71 In Southern Brazil", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Floods Kill at Least 71 In Southern Brazil", "body_text": " **********Floods caused by monthlong rains have killed at least 71 people and left thousands homeless in three southeastern Brazilian states, civil defense spokesmen said today. **********Damage and death tolls are expected to rise if forecasts of several more weeks of rain prove correct. **********In Espirito Santo, where it has rained continually since the end of December, 42 people have been killed and 8,289 left homeless, the civil defense service said. **********In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, 24 people were killed and 10,070 were left without homes, the service said. **********In Rio de Janeiro, the Governor's press office said exact figures were unavailable, but unofficial figures indicated at least five people had died in the coastal cities of Parati and Paracambi."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/business/business-digest-friday-august-2-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 633, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, AUGUST 2, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, AUGUST 2, 1985", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The House and the Senate approved a budget plan that would shrink the deficit by $55.5 billion next year and by $276.2 billion over three years.

The Vatican radio said recently that 51 Catholic churches were reopened by the Chinese authorities last month in Fujian Province alone. **********The Chinese Catholic Church broke with the Vatican in 1957 under Government pressure and now ordains its own bishops and priests. Rejecting the innovations of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), the Chinese church still celebrates mass in Latin. **********The Chinese Government's Religious Affairs Bureau, which supervises religious faiths in China, estimates that there are as many as three million Catholics in the country. **********Pope John Paul II has rejected the contention of the Chinese church that it is Catholic, but he has said that he favors a warming of ties with China. He repeated that appeal in a special message to the Chinese people in July. **********Taiwan Ties a Stumbling Block **********Similarly, the Vatican has played down its links with Taiwan, presumably in the hope of eventually establishing ties with Peking. The Vatican's diplomatic relations with Taiwan have been a stumbling block to normalization of relations with Peking. **********China has continued to crack down on priests and faithful suspected of maintaining ties with the Vatican. But recent developments have rekindled Vatican hopes for improvement. **********There have been visits by Roman Catholic prelates to China, including discussions with leaders of the Chinese church. Last January, the Rev. Aloysius Jin Luxian, who long supported ties with Rome, was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Shanghai. **********In July, a Shanghai court released the Rev. Ignatius Kung, 84 years old, who was appointed Bishop of Shanghai by the Vatican in 1950 and spent more than 30 years in forced-labor camps after having been accused of anti-Government activity. **********The Vatican's astronomical observatory recently signed an agreement of cooperation with China, including the transfer to a Chinese university of a telescope from the observatory at Castel Gandolfo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/08/world/star-wars-plan-for-europe-is-urged.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1985-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 674, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'STAR WARS' PLAN FOR EUROPE IS URGED", "print_headline": "'STAR WARS' PLAN FOR EUROPE IS URGED", "body_text": " **********A French general has called for France to lead Western Europe in the development of its own space-based missile defense program. **********The program would be separate from the United States Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' **********The call appears to reflect what a French official described as a ''European current of opinion'' moving away from the skepticism shown about the feasibility of the American program. **********The general's remarks were contained in a front-page article published this week by Le Monde. The general used the pseudonyn Hoplites to sign the article, but its authenticity was verified by officials of the French Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry. **********''Starting today,'' the general wrote, ''we must mobilize our capacities of thought and innovation and our intelligence services to remain in the space- war game. Europe will follow if France, Britain, and West Germany do not give up. As in all the real projects to build Europe, it is up to us to take the first steps.'' **********No Cooperation With U.S. **********No mention was made of cooperation with the United States or of France's becoming a subcontractor in developing American technologies. This was one of the novelties of the article since previous discussion of a European role has focused on participation in the American research effort. **********It was thought that the article might signal a debate developing inside theFrench military on whether steps should be taken to undertake a separate Western European or French space defense program. **********A French official said he believed that some form of cooperation with the United States was advocated by Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who will travel to the Soviet Union on Sunday for discussions that are expected to include nuclear issues. **********The official suggested that such cooperation was unlikely to take the form of a formal agreement with the United States, but might proceed on a commercial basis. **********'Inheritors of de Gaulle' **********The official described as ''inheritors of de Gaulle'' those officers and military experts likely to prefer a French or a French-led European program. He acknowledged that it was not clear whether the necessary funds could be brought together or whether Western Europe would have sufficient confidence in itself to press ahead with such an undertaking. **********The article called for an early decision. **********''If we wait for what will come out of the future negotiations on space disarmament,'' it said, ''we will lose five more years, and the door leading to the technologies of the future will close in our face. In any event, from now until 2010, other countries are likely to acquired nuclear arms and at least elementary strategic forces. Rather than risk an atomic exchange, wouldn't be better to have the means to protect our four or five largest cities and our nuclear arsenal?'' **********American Concept Is Praised **********The general praised the American program, saying that regardless of whether it offers total protection, it would limit the credibility of the Soviet Union's arsenal of SS-20 missiles. At the same time, he implicitly criticized the French position, stated by Mr. Dumas, that it was not necessary for the Europeans to come to terms with the theory of space-based nuclear deterrence for 20 more years because the American system could not be operational or partly operational until then. **********The United States, the article pointed out, managed to make the first atomic bomb in six years and to send a man to the moon in seven years. **********The question of time is important because France must decide in the next year or two how to replace its nuclear- armed Mirage IV bomber force and its medium-range nuclear missile force, both of which are expected to become vulnerable or obsolete in the 1990's. **********In developing replacement systems, France must consider whether their effectiveness will be compromised by Soviet defensive capabilities developed in response to the American space-defense program, and how French military funds can be best apportioned.

CBS said the option provided ''significantly increased'' pension benefits. **********Last July, in a decisive maneuver against the Atlanta broadcast entrepreneur, CBS offered to buy 21 percent of its own shares. It paid for the stock with a package of cash and new securities. Not only did the moveput value in the hands of restless shareholders, but the notes issued also carried conditions barring the type of offer Mr. Turner had made. **********Sharp Rise in Debt **********The exchange, however, substantially increased CBS's debt, to $1.3 billion, from $370 million at the end of 1984. **********To help pay it off, CBS said at the time that it would try to reduce annual expenses by $20 million a year below projections. The early retirement program would go a long way to accomplishing this. One industry expert estimated that it might save the company about $7 million a year, To some extent, CBS's experience is typical. At a time of relentless takeovers, many companies are taking a variety of costly steps to preserve their independence. The added debt often forces them into pruning that would not otherwise have been done. **********CBS, however, faces additional problems. Like the rest of the television industry, it is being hurt by a soft advertising economy. Wall Street analysts say that could mean a slowdown in the growth of broadcast revenue to 5 to 7 percent this year; in the last five years, this type of revenue increased 11 to 12 percent annually. **********Moreover, the demand for the television time left in the third quarter has been soft, and if things do not change quickly, the fourth quarter will also be soft, according to Dennis Leibowitz, a vice president and media analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********The retirement program is only one of several cost-saving measures prompted by the stock repurchase and the weak advertising economy. The CBS Broadcast division, which accounted for 80 percent of 1984 operating income, has been ordered to keep cost increases to 4 percent in 1986. **********Within the division, CBS News is trying to trim $6 million from its budgets. Ann Morfogen, a spokesman for the news department, said that the early retirement program had not affected plans to lay off 50 to 100 people. ''It is too early to tell what this means,'' she said. ''Some of those who leave may have to be replaced. Others may not.'' **********Commenting on the cost-cutting, Edward Atorino, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. said, ''CBS wants to allow margins to improve. If your revenues go up 5 percent and your costs go up 4 percent, the percentage increase in profits is better.'' **********Under the early retirement program, eligible employees have until Nov. 1 to decide whether to take the offer. One divisional executive who asked not to be named said that he expected, judging from what had happened at other companies, that about 25 percent of the eligible candidates would take advantage of early retirement. **********If an employee retired under the company's former retirement plan before the age of 62, benefits were reduced, according to Ann Luzzatto, a spokesman for CBS, The deadline appears timed to this year's budget planning. Between now and November, divisional heads are working on their 1986 budgets, which will be presented to the board in November. **********''They want to increase their margins,'' said one divisional executive, who asked not to be named. ''It is not that there is a fiat delivered from the tower, but corporate executives are being very tough this year. They want to make the individual budgets for the divisions tough enough to force managers to cut costs. If you are given a profitability target, and it is several million more than you thought you could make, you have to find a place to trim that money. That is not always so tough. Bureaucracies grow at night.'' **********The executive added that, by using the retirement incentive program, CBS hoped it would not have to lay off a large number of employees. Since the response to the retirement program will be clear by November, divisional heads would still have time to lay off people if they chose. **********''If there are to be layoffs, the extent of them would be affected to some degree by the response to the retirement plan,'' Mrs. Luzzatto said. **********However, Mr. Atorino of Smith Barney noted that the layoffs could have some negative effects. He said that, earlier in CBS's history, the company had reduced staff and lost a number of very talented executives."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/10/world/no-headline-018182.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 728, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave qualified endorsement today to the proposed American research into a space-based missile defense system, but asked that its ultimate benefits be extended to Western Europe. **********Speaking in a Munich seminar on defense issues, Mr. Kohl said it was ''too early to reach a final judgment'' on the system, which is officially called the Strategic Defense Initiative and has been dubbed ''Star Wars.'' **********But by the end of the decade, he said, the program must take account of ''the strategic unity'' of the NATO alliance and avoid possibly dangerous instabilities in a transition to deployment. **********(In Washington, a study by the Congressional Research Service said Western European officials generally favored research on the proposed program, but overwhelmingly opposed deployment.

It is not certain that the balance that would result from the deployment of defensive systems and the reduction in offensive weapons would really be stable. The strongest probability is still that the deployment of defensive systems would relaunch an offensive arms race.'' **********Mr. Kohl's guarded endorsement appeared to reflect his wish to sustain his close ties with the Reagan Administration without appearing to be an uncritical supporter of a program that has been criticized in West Germany. **********There has been concern that an effective American antimissile defense could lead to a separation of Western Europe from common defense goals unless it, too, is protected.  ''The United States' Strategic Defense Initiative,'' Mr. Kohl said, ''demands the closest and most confidential consultations because of its far- reaching consequences for our security. S.D.I. will give the United States a big technological advantage whether or not the research leads to its intended goals. Highly industrialized countries like West Germany and the other European allies must not be left behind.'' **********The Chancellor, who spoke warmly of his personal ties with President Reagan, said the European allies should be allowed to share in the technological benefits of space-defense research. **********He also said the United States plan had been a significant factor in bringing the Soviet Union back to arms control talks, which resume in Geneva on March 12. **********He disputed the Soviet view that the aim of the United States defense system was the militarization of space. **********''We would do well to point out that S.D.I. seeks to shift the balance from offensive nuclear weapons to defensive conventional weapons,'' Mr. Kohl said. **********He said that Moscow would probably attempt to split the Western allies by playing up its professed wish to avoid a militarization of space. He noted that the Soviet Union already had an antisatellite weapons system and was conducting its own military space research, ''without talking very much about it.'' **********The Chancellor predicted that at the new arms talks, the Soviet Union would probably propose a moratorium on the deployment of American medium- range missiles in Western Europe. **********''Any change in agreed deployment plans can come about only as a result of a concrete negotiated result,'' he said. **********Belgian Party Opposes Missiles **********GHENT, Belgium, Feb. 9 (Reuters) - Opposition to the early basing of medium-range missiles in Belgium emerged today at a congress of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens's Flemish Social Christian Party, delegates said. They said speakers had urged the Government to at least delay deployment. **********Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans got a rough reception when he tried to persuade delegates to uphold the unity of the Atlantic alliance by accepting the first 16 of 48 cruise missiles due to be placed in Belgium. **********According to the delegates, Mr. Martens ruled out a party vote on the issue.

However, he makes some assumptions that should not be accepted without thought. **********He suggests leveraging between 60 percent and 80 percent on a property which will also show an 8 percent cash return on the equity invested. I would suggest that it is difficult to find a well located property with assured future rent flow that is still priced so as to carry the leverage and provide an 8 percent to 10 percent capitalization rate on current net income. Leverage will require most or all of the flow from such properties. **********Investing in properties that do not have location and other sound fundamentals may mean a better price but probably also entails higher risk and thus a greater threat from the demands of leverage. However, a low- or no-leverage investor can achieve a reasonable return and look forward to the appreciation that most usually comes from buying a top property. **********It is also unwise to assume that appreciation in real estate can be taken for granted. That simply is not so today. An investor in real estate must exercise the same discretion and intelligence as, say, a buyer of stocks and bonds. Some investments do well, others do not, and the strength or weakness of the economy plays a big role. An unleveraged real estate investor has the ability to stick it out during a downturn. **********Appreciation is a key reason for investing in real estate, but it does not go in a straight line.

It has no cash earnings, analysts say. It cannot collect from customers for most of the cost of the plant. It is borrowing to meet interest payments on previous borrowings. It has paid no preferred-stock dividends since last October and no common dividends for 18 months. **********Banks have lent Lilco more than $1 billion to meet short-term cash needs, and they keep extending deadlines. Under an austerity plan crafted by the company's chairman, William J. Catacosinos, shortly after he took over in January 1984, the company furloughed 20 percent of its work force, although some have returned. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $7.125 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, is selling at one-third of its book value. **********On top of all this came the storm, with millions of dollars of damage. And that was exacerbated, some critics say, by shortcomings of the strapped company's maintenance procedures, an already depleted storm recovery fund, and no storm insurance because of past high claims. **********Analysts and state officials yesterday estimated it would cost Lilco $25 million to $30 million to repair its transmission and distribution systems. Furthermore, the loss of power to two-thirds of its nearly one million electric customers throughout Nassau, Suffolk and Queens Counties means $5 million to $10 million in forgone power sales for the weeklong repair period. the analysts said. **********The company has declined to provide its own estimates, and in any case it is unclear how much the blow will hurt the crippled company. Analysts agreed yesterday that while the cost of the storm would be a major misfortune for another utility, for Lilco its significance is dwarfed by the company's other problems. **********''With all Lilco has been through, this storm is not going to break them,'' said Mark D. Luftig, a vice president of Salomon Brothers who has followed the company for more than a decade. Nonetheless, he said, ''Lilco is still operating on a razor's edge. They are not out of danger of bankruptcy.'' **********Lilco appears to have enough credit to borrow the money for the repairs, provided it gets a $68 million rate increase pending before the state Public Service Commission, said Frank M. Herbert, director of the agency's office of accounting and finance. **********Beyond that, the key to Lilco's future is the Shoreham plant, utility analysts agree. Twelve years behind schedule and more than 40 times over budget, the plant has virtually engulfed the rest of the company: It now totals 63 percent of Lilco's $7.1 billion in capitalization. **********Until the plant operates commercially, Lilco can collect from customers only a small part of what it cost to build Shoreham. The plant is now in low-power testing, but both New York State and Suffolk County have refused to do the emergency planning required to bring the plant to full-power operation. **********The utility has been carrying the enormous interest costs of the plant by borrowing increasing amounts of money and scavenging its other operations. In early 1984, Lilco laid off nearly 1,000 people, including many maintenance workers, to save $100 million. It received a rate increase of $170.5 million from the state last year to avert bankruptcy. A consortium of banks, led by Citibank, has extended the utility millions in credit. **********Lilco's earnings for common stock last year totaled $340.3 million. But none of those earnings comprised cash, analysts said: All was in the form of credits, money the company expects to earn when Shoreham operates commercially. Those credits are called ''allowance for funds used during construction'' and basically constitute a paper accounting entry. Last year, that entry totaled $397.3 million. **********Borrowing 'Just to Exist' **********Meanwhile, Lilco is ''continuing to borrow money just to exist,'' Mr. Luftig of Salomon Brothers said. **********The most recent borrowing was $225 million in June, from the Citibank consortium, Mr. Herbert said. Only about $80 million of that money is left, he said. The rest was used for payroll, property taxes and the interest payments on money it has already borrowed, he said. **********Lilco also has a $150 million bank line of credit with the Citibank consortium; the money has not yet been spent, Mr. Herbert said. It could be used to pay the storm damage as well as the tens of millions of dollars in other expenses Lilco will have to meet next year. ''Lilco has negative cash flow,'' Mr. Herbert said. He added, however, that the company could make the storm damage payments without a rate increase beyond the $68 million now being considered. **********The company also owes $500 million to banks for past payments on its 18 percent share in the upstate Nine Mile 2 plant. The utility eventually will owe $1 billion for that $5.35 billion plant. But the Niagara Mohawk Power Company, the lead partner, has been making the recent payments for Lilco. Repayments to Niagara Mohawk will come due beginning in 1988. Lilco also owes the banks another $550 million for nuclear fuel and short-term credit. **********Deadlines have come and gone for repayment of the debt, and banks keep extending them. Analysts expect the next set of deadlines, in mid-1986, to be extended again. ''It's better for the banks to keep Lilco solvent, hoping they can eventually be paid,'' said Nancy A. Fertig, a utilities analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''If Lilco were to file for bankruptcy, the banks would have to get in line with everyone else.'' **********One analyst drew an analogy to American banks continuing to roll over loans to poor Third World nations, on the theory that keeping the countries solvent increases chances of eventual loan repayment. Analysts said the banks are likely to continue bankrolling Lilco as long as there is some chance Shoreham will operate. **********Other American utilities most often mentioned as having financial problems rivaling those of Lilco are the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the lead partner in the troubled Seabrook project; the Consumers Power Company in Michigan, which is faced with absorbing the cost of its indefinitely deferred Midland nuclear plant, and Middle South Utilities, which has faced roadblocks in collecting for its Grand Gulf nuclear plant in Mississippi. **********At BB-, Lilco has the second-lowest Standard & Poor's bond rating of any major American utility, after Public Service of New Hampshire, with a B-. The Metropolitan Edison Company, the General Public Utilities Corporation unit that operated the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, has been recovering financially from its 1979 accident and is rated BBB-. **********There are questions whether Lilco's poor financial condition contributed to the severity of the hurricane damage and the time it is taking to fix the problems. The state Public Service Commission this past April said the utility's tree-trimming program - cutting off limbs that might down power lines - was acceptable. **********Task Force Convened **********Governor Mario Cuomo has convened a task force to determine if the damage or slowness in repairs was linked to any preventive maintenance cutbacks by Lilco, but some analysts and Lilco critics think the company's weakened financial condition has had to worsen its storm response. **********''It's naive to think that Lilco laying off several hundred workers won't have a negative impact on the company,'' said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the state Consumer Protection Board. The board voiced concern about the integrity of the Lilco system as recently as Sept. 18, in a petition to the Public Service Commission. **********Carol A. Clawson, a Lilco spokeswoman, said she could supply no figures on tree-trimming or maintenance programs or the company's financial condition. Mr. Catacosinos, Lilco's chairman, did not return a phone call. The company has been far more reticent since its entire top management was forced out in early 1984. **********Beyond all of its financial problems related to its borrowings, Lilco must also absorb a $1.35 billion state penalty for mismanaging the Shoreham project, the largest such penalty ever levied against a utility. And it must absorb at least $160 million as a mismanagement penalty for construction of the Nine Mile 2 nuclear plant. **********Financial experts agree that the key to Lilco's financial future is being able to recover a substantial part of Shoreham's $4.5 billion cost from customers. ''You cannot separate Lilco from Shoreham,'' Mr. Herbert said. Mr. Luftig added: ''Lilco needs Shoreham to survive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/30/business/dow-surges-on-volcker-s-remarks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Surges on Volcker's Remarks", "print_headline": "Dow Surges on Volcker's Remarks", "body_text": " **********Stock prices rose sharply yesterday on Wall Street and the Dow Jones industrial average finished fractionally below its record levels.

The average share rose 24 cents. **********Discount Rate Cut Seen **********Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said Mr. Volcker, in remarks Monday night in Toronto, seemed to de-emphasize the importance of recent strong growth in the money supply. ''I think he's setting the stage for cutting the discount rate before Thanksgiving,'' Mr. Yardeni said. That rate is currently at 7.5 percent. **********The feeling in investment circles is that the Fed has given up hope that the  economy will rebound on its own and may feel that business needs the help of lower interest rates. In his comments, Mr. Volcker said the Fed currently had a  fairly accommodative monetary policy. **********Other market indicators followed the Dow's lead.

Sources close to both Unilever and Chesebrough said the rumors were false. **********Beatrice, the recipient of a buyout bid from Kohlberg, Kravis, was the day's  most-active stock, on volume of nearly three million shares, and fell 3/8, to 43 1/2. Kohlberg yesterday improved the preferred stock portion of its bid for Beatrice, a consumer products company. **********Hoover rose 1 1/8, to 43, in over-the-counter trading. The company agreed to  be acquired, for $43 a share, by the Chicago Pacific Corporation. Scott & Fetzer, which has long been considering a leveraged buyout candidate, gave up and instead agreed to be acquired by Berkshire Hathaway at $60 a share. Scott &  Fetzer's stock responded with a 3 3/8-point rise, to 58 1/4. **********Warnaco, which has been climbing steadily in recent days, advanced another 5/8, to 27. Traders said there were rumors of a leveraged buyout at the company. Warnaco officials did not return telephone calls. **********Triangle Industries rose 2 1/8, to 29 3/8. The company reported sharply higher nine-month profits. Xerox rose 1 5/8, to 50, despite a loss of $15 million in the third quarter. Other technology issues took part in the upturn with Digital Equipment rising 1 1/4, to 112 7/8, and Data General up 3/4, to 42. **********Brokerage stocks, predictably, rode Wall Street's new-found enthusiasm higher. Paine Webber gained 1 7/8, to 27 5/8, Merrill Lynch 1/2, to 28 1/2, and  American Express, which is also a component of the Dow, gained 1 5/8, to 44 3/4. **********Dreyfus's Mr. Gordon said Wall Street might be more hopeful than realistic on interest rates. But he added that the movement in the bond market seemed to have snapped the equity community out of its lethargy. **********Jack Conlon, head trader of E. F. Hutton & Company, believes stock prices could continue to climb for the next couple of sessions. But he thinks the rally will end soon after that, with the market correcting before rising again at the  end of the year. **********But Mr. Conlon said the economic environment continued to make investment decisions difficult and that was why there was an obvious lack of euphoria on Wall Street despite the market's near-record levels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/04/world/army-plans-for-what-if-latin-war.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1985-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 830, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMY PLANS FOR 'WHAT IF' LATIN WAR", "print_headline": "ARMY PLANS FOR 'WHAT IF' LATIN WAR", "body_text": " **********The Army has begun a study to determine the military and civic actions that would be necessary if American troops were ordered into a hostile situation in Central America, officers said today. **********President Reagan and senior Administration officials have repeatedly said they have no intention of deploying combat forces to Central America except for periodic maneuvers, such as those coming to a close in Honduras. **********But Administration officials have also said the United States must be prepared, under the Rio Pact of 1947, to dispatch military forces to the region if the security of the Western Hemisphere is threatened and if members of the pact agree to collective action. **********What the Study Will Examine **********Officers said these were among the kinds of questions the study would seek to answer: *********** What kind of artillery training will be necessary to prevent gunners from causing what the Army calls ''collateral'' damage, which means killing civilians?

Father Boff studied from l965 to l970 in Munich, West Germany, where he obtained a doctorate in theology. **********The question of the bishops' and Pope's authority, they noted, led also to serious conflict between the Vatican and the church in the Netherlands and to the Vatican's interrogation of the Dutch theologian Edward Schillebeeckx in l979. **********According to a key adviser of the Brazilian Bishops' Conference, Father Boff's interrogation in Rome last September ''revolved largely around the question of the authority and hierarchy in the church.'' **********''It was no special questioning about the theology of liberation as such or about its Marxist elements,'' the adviser said. ''The issues were those raised by liberal Protestant and then by liberal Catholic theologians, including Boff.'' **********Greater 'Democracy' Promoted **********But several priests said the movement to seek ''greater democracy'' in the church was related to liberation theology because it sought to bring the church closer to the faithful, with preference for the poor. **********In Brazil, the world's largest Roman Catholic nation, several cardinals and numerous bishops have for some time been promoting greater democracy by voluntarily reducing their own power. In a number of places, diocessan meetings take place regularly in which the bishop has a voice but not the last word, and in which decisions are taken through the votes of all parish representatives. **********Archbishop Jose Ivo Lorscheiter, the president of the Brazilian Bishop's Conference, reached by telephone, said that the Vatican document would be transmitted to all Brazilian bishops without further debate. **********Asked if the Bishops Conference, which includes many supporters of Father Boff, would issue its own position, the Archbishop said: ''Boff has already been heard and this is the word of Rome.

As prices rose, the yield of 30-year Treasury bonds - a closely followed benchmark for other interest rates, such as home mortgages - fell to about 9.9 percent yesterday, from 10.51 percent on Oct. 28. **********''The sentiment in the market is that the next move by the Fed is towards an additional easing in monetary policy,'' said Edward J. Sawicz, an economist with the Discount Corporation of New York. **********Discount Rate Rumors **********Predictions that the Federal Reserve would reduce the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions continued to circulate, as they have periodically since early June. Even though the credit markets have been premature in expecting such a visible move toward an easier monetary policy by the cental bank, many economists maintain that there are good reasons for expecting lower rates in the future. **********So long as inflation is not rising, and the economy is expanding at a rate of 3 percent or less - as many are predicting for the current quarter - analysts expect continuous speculation in the credit markets that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy and promote lower rates. **********''The outlook for the economy is friendly for the credit markets, and the market benefits from the anticipation that Congress will do something to reduce budget deficits,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities. The positive outlook is reflected, he added, ''by very strong demand at the five-year-note auction.'' **********Besides the outlook for the economy and Federal budget, market participants cited other reasons for the rise in note and bond prices yesterday. ''The buying of the five-year was boosted by all the money managers who missed the earlier rally,'' one trader said. Another noted that the yield on the five-year notes, after increasing from last week's low levels of about 9.04 percent, was enough to entice many buyers, even though they could not buy the issue at the 9.20 percent yield that was quoted as recently as late Tuesday. **********Short Positions Cited **********Other traders noted that much of the demand for the five-year issue was from securities firms that had established large short positions in that maturity range before the auction. They added that some firms were content to hold large amounts of Treasury issues because there is a lull in Treasury financing until the last half of December, and because they expect the Fed to buy a sizable amount of Treasury issues in the near future. **********William Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America, agreed with many other traders who have said that the bond market rally is vulnerable if there is not a continued flow of good news about the economy and budget. But despite those concerns, ''there has been good retail buying, as prices dipped over the past few days,'' he noted. **********New 30-year Treasury bonds were offered yesterday at prices higher than the average levels set at last week's auction, while 10-year notes remain lower than the auction price. The 9 7/8 percent bonds due in 2015 were offered late in the day at 99 25/ 32, up 18/32, to yield 9.90 percent, up from Friday's auction average of about 99 14/32, to yield 9.93 percent. The 9 1/2 percent notes due in 1995 were offered at 99 10/32, up 13/32, to yield 9.61 percent, down from about 99 22/ 32 last Thursday, to yield 9.54. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new Treausry notes due in five years, two months: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price#99.901 Average Yield#9.13% Low Price#99.942 High Yield#9.13% High Price#99.942 Low Yield#9.12% Accepted at low#60% Total applied for$25,109,855 Accepted$7,519,471 N.Y. applied for$22,444,767 N.Y. accepted$6,695,427 Noncompetitive$820,000 Interest set at#9 1/8% The 5-year notes mature Feb. 15, 1991."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/business/take-a-ride-on-the-reading-collect-25-million.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1985-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1978, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAKE A RIDE ON THE READING, COLLECT $25 MILLION -", "print_headline": "TAKE A RIDE ON THE READING, COLLECT $25 MILLION -", "body_text": " **********IN 1973, four Chicago-area businessmen got a chance to do in real life what most people can only do in a Monopoly game: Buy the Reading Railroad. **********''Anyone who's ever played with toy trains has always wanted to own a railroad,'' said John W. Sullivan, a member of the group that bought a controlling stake in Reading at a time when it was in bankruptcy proceedings and seemed to most investors to be of limited, if any, value. **********The trains, of course, disappeared from the Reading Company not long after Mr. Sullivan and his colleagues made their investment. But their whimsical gamble on a down-and-out railroad has made millions for them - aires - mostly because the Reading owns a big chunk of center city Philadelphia, where a rundown area is changing to become valuable commercial real estate. **********Today Mr. Sullivan is president and chief executive of the Reading Company, which emerged from a 10-year bankruptcy reorganization on Jan. 1, 1981, as a small real estate, energy and industrial concern bent on developing its Philadelphia properties and on diversification through the acquisition of small and mid-sized companies. (There have been three such acquisitions so far.) To use the coal and coal refuse it owns, the company has also jumped into the energy field. **********The Reading's rolling stock, which once criss-crossed New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was conveyed in 1976 to Conrail - the company created by the Government to absorb the bankrupt northeastern railroads, including the Penn Central Corporation, another railroad molded by bankruptcy into a diversified non-railroad company. Like Penn Central, the Reading - which emerged from its reorganization with a huge tax loss carryforward to apply against future earnings - is profitable and growing. **********''They certainly have gotten started well,'' said John E. Keefe, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''There's a lot of potential there between the real estate, the energy and the tax loss. So far, they have a pretty good track record.'' Indeed, last year the company reported earnings of $3.8 million, or $1.13 a share, on revenues of $25.2 million. **********Reading officials concede that it may be a few years before their energy projects generate significant revenues. And some analysts say that Reading's major real estate project - developing part of a convention center planned for center city Philadelphia - will also be slow to produce profits. ''The convention center is a mark in their favor, but it's a long-term mark, and it's not going to put any cash in the pockets of their shareholders for a while,'' said Thomas T. Taylor, president of Offutt & Taylor, a Baltimore investment firm. **********Analysts also point out that one of Reading's acquisitions was a disappointment and that another has run into problems. And, they add, some investors are wary of the company because both energy and real estate have been notoriously unstable in recent years. **********But whatever problems it has, Reading has come a long way since it was in the throes of bankruptcy. **********The four partners' initial investment in Reading - Mr. Sullivan says it was ''under $250,000,'' and others say it was more like $25,000 - currently amounts to about 30 percent of the shares outstanding, and is worth about $21 million. The company's stock has jumped from 2 cents a share during the bankruptcy proceedings to about $21.25 on the over-the-counter market. And Mr. Keefe of Drexel Burnham Lambert, who thinks Reading's assets are worth $32.50 a share, is projecting earnings of $1.20 a share for this year and $2.70 for 1986. MR. SULLIVAN says that he and his partners - his brother-in-law (an attorney) and two Chicago stockbrokers - had little idea of where the company would end up when they bought into it a dozen years ago. ''It was strictly a speculative investment,'' he said. **********When Reading's reorganization was finally completed in 1981, Mr. Sullivan, who until 1979 had been chief executive of the Skil Corporation, a power tool maker (he left after the company merged with the Emerson Electric Company), became its chief executive. Thomas A. Reynolds Jr., a partner at Winston & Strawn in Chicago, became a part-time chairman, and stockbrokers E. Lee Cotten and John D. Mabie took seats on the board of directors. **********As it began its new existence, one of the Reading's big assets was a tax-loss carryforward totaling $170 million - the result of the money-losing years as a railroad company just before bankruptcy. The Government had also agreed to pay the company $168.8 million for the rail assets absorbed by Conrail, an amount that covered most of Reading's creditor claims and liabilities. **********Most important, as it turned out, the company was left with the old Reading Terminal and the buildings and land - 13.5 acres - surrounding it in what was once a seedy, rundown section of downtown Philadelphia. The redevelopment of much of the east side of downtown Philadelphia in the past decade drove up the value of this real estate, bringing an unexpected payoff. **********First, in the mid-1970's, the Rouse Corporation - the Maryland-based company that developed New York City's South Street Seaport area and Baltimore's Harborplace - built a huge shopping mall called the Gallery in the area known as Market Street East. (A second mall, Gallery II, was completed in 1983, right next to the Reading property.) Then in 1978, the city began to construct a commuter rail tunnel and a new rail station under the property owned by Reading. The commuter tunnel, completed in 1984, made Market Street East an attractive site for new office buildings. Investors, including the Bass Brothers, began to buy property in the area. **********Amid all this activity Reading embarked on its first major real estate venture - the construction of One Reading Center, a 32-story office tower. Built on a lot adjoining the Reading Terminal Headhouse and largely financed by a construction loan of $73 million, it was completed last year and is now 74 percent leased. **********Last month, Reading sold the building for $107 million to the Heitman Advisory Corporation, a pension fund management concern. The sale, says Reading, will produce a profit this year of $4 million, with additional profits of up to $14 million likely over the next five years, depending on the building's occupancy level. THE company's current real estate activities center on the plans of the City of Philadelphia and the State of Pennsylvania for a convention center on other Reading property. If the deal goes through, Reading would swap some of the land on which the center will be built for a nearby site, where Reading would build a hotel complex. The Reading Terminal train shed, which adjoins the site of the planned convention center, would also become part of the center, and all this development would presumably enable Reading to raise the rents it charges to merchants at the historic Reading Terminal Market, a hodgepodge of food and specialty outlets directly under the train shed. **********Although the development of the site would be a big step for Reading, analysts do not expect it to have a major impact on the company's profits for a number of years. And the convention center is not a sure thing. It has faced sporadic protests from business owners in the neighborhood, who fear being forced out of their locations. And the project has been bogged down by the state government's refusal to release funds appropriated for construction until several of its conditions are met. **********Still, Mr. Sullivan remains optimistic. ''If there's going to be a convention center built in my career,'' he said, ''it will be built in this location.'' **********Meanwhile, Reading continues to sell off its non-Philadelphia real estate, mostly along the erstwhile railroad's rights of way. Already, about 250 parcels have been sold for about $15 million. According to Ronald B. Lankford, Reading's chief financial officer, about $12 million worth of properties - just under 200 parcels -are left. **********Mr. Lankford also says that Reading is eager to get on with its acquisitions, specifically of companies with less than $100 million in annual revenues that Reading can operate as independent subsidiaries (keeping current management on) and buy largely with bank borrowings. The company wants to use its tax benefits to shelter the cash flow of the companies it acquires, making their earnings in effect untaxed. The benefits begin to expire in 1991. **********''We've essentially been opportunistic so far,'' said Mr. Sullivan. ''That may change in the future as we develop some particular expertise.'' **********In fact, Reading's first major diversification attempt, its $36 million purchase in 1981 of Imperial Clevite Inc., a maker of automobile and truck engine parts, was a flop. Battered by the recession, I.C.I. posted big losses from 1981 through 1983, when it was recapitalized. As part of the recapitalization, Reading reduced its equity from 87 percent to 5 percent. **********The second purchase, the 1984 acquisition of SWS Industries, a window maker based in Moonachie, N.J., for $11 million, has also run into some snags. Analysts say that SWS's profit margins may not turn out to be as high as Reading hoped. A fire in the plant in July disrupted operations for three weeks, also hurting earnings. ''It hasn't been a disaster, but it has not been what they expected,'' said Mr. Taylor of Offutt & Taylor. Mr. Sullivan says that SWS' should soon begin posting stronger earnings. READING's third acquisition, completed early this year, was its $1.5 million purchase of the American Lignite Products Company, of Ione, Calif., 35 miles east of Sacramento. But in this case, Reading was much less interested in American Lignite's marginally profitable wax business than in its reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal from which montan wax, used in making carbon paper and shoe polish, can be extracted. Reading wants to use the lignite that remains as fuel, instead of discarding it as waste. It will begin construction next month of a cogeneration plant, fueled by the lignite, that will create steam for wax operations as well as 15 megawatts of excess electricity - enough to light a small town. It plans to sell the energy to Pacific Gas and Electric. **********The plant, in which the Combustion Engineering Company of Stamford, Conn., has a 20 percent stake, will cost about $38 million to build and should be finished in 1987. Reading estimates that its 30-year contract to sell the electricity to P.G.&E. will eventually bring in $2 million to $4 million in annual operating profits. **********Noting that the company is embarking on this project ''in the face of a falling energy market,'' Mr. Taylor of Offutt & Taylor nonetheless thinks it may eventually pay off. ''They're teamed up with a strong partner in Combustion Engineering. And rather than going after the quick fix, they're trying to maximize values over the long term,'' he said. **********Reading has a natural interest in energy because of the coal reserves it owns in Pennsylvania. And in fact, says Dr. Thomas A. V. Cassel, the head of Reading's energy operations, the California plant is likely to be followed by a similar operation in McAdoo, Pa., where the company hopes to generate profits out of otherwise worthless piles of anthracite coal silt that it owns. The company is now looking for a partner to share the building costs and use the power the plant would generate. **********The project, said Mr. Sullivan, ''affords us an opportunity to turn a waste material into a valuable asset.'' It is much the same sort of gamble he and his partners took when they invested in the once-fabled, but failed, railroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/business/old-court-owners-sued.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Old Court Owners Sued", "print_headline": "Old Court Owners Sued", "body_text": " **********The conservator of the Old Court Savings and Loan Association has filed a civil suit against the Maryland thrift institution's owners and directors charging that they misappropriated funds and failed to meet their responsibility to depositors.

''It will be Bitburg.'' In Washington, Donald T. Regan, President Reagan's chief of staff, said the President was ''upset'' and ''wounded'' by criticism of his plan to visit the cemetery next Sunday but would go ahead with it. [Page A8.] [According to Administration sources in Washington, Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, has told the White House that he believes Mr. Reagan should not cancel his visit to the Bitburg cemetery because to do so would damage relations with West Germany. It is unclear whether Mr. Kissinger offered his expression of support directly to Mr. Reagan or through a senior Administration aide.] Commentators and a wide spectrum of politicians in Bonn concur that the dispute has put enormous strains on West German-American relations. **********In comments that will appear Monday in the large-circulation daily Bild Zeitung, Franz Josef Strauss, the Bavarian Premier, says preparations for the trip ''were unclever, and the results are embarrassing.'' The conservative politician said that instead of going to Bitburg, Mr. Reagan could lay a wreath  at the unknown soldier's monument in Munich. **********Mr. Strauss said that if the cemetery stop was removed without a substitute,  ''then a bitterness would remain that could lead to a poisoning of the atmosphere between the two present-day allies.'' **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, without actually demanding cancellation of the Bitburg visit, accused the Chancellor of  sowing divisions between West Germany and the United States. **********''The Chancellor has not succeeded in arranging the President's trip in a manner that would encourage understanding rather than undermining it,'' said Mr. Vogel. **********The Social Democrats, who are regularly accused by the conservative Kohl coalition of fomenting anti-Americanism in West Germany, have clearly savored being able to accuse the Chancellor of stirring anti-German sentiment in the United States. **********Greens Demand Cancellation **********Only the leftist Green Party has consistently demanded canceling the cemetery visit. A party spokesman, Heinz Suhr, said today that Mr. Kohl should take more seriously protests in the United States and Israel ''than the false ideas that the dead were heroes that one hears in the ranks of his own party.'' **********Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann said her polling organization, the Allensbach Institute, had found that despite the emotional controversy, Mr. Reagan's stopover in Bitburg had overwhelming popular support in West Germany. ''We rarely find such majorities among the Germans, where opinion tends to be polarized,'' she said in an interview. **********She said that two days ago her organization asked 1,000 people whether the television images they had seen of the Bitburg cemetery showed ''German'' or ''Nazi'' graves. She said 92 percent responded ''German'' and 4 percent ''Nazi.'' **********Miss Noelle-Neumann, a trusted adviser to the Chancellor, speculated that perhaps every second household in the country had photographs displayed of brothers, fathers or grandfathers killed in fighting in World War II. **********''The Germans feel that you shouldn't identify a fallen German soldier as a former Nazi,'' she said. **********''Kohl usually has a fine feeling for the popular moods here,'' Miss Noelle-Neumann continued. ''Sometimes he takes steps that are quite surprising to the journalists. Kohl's ideas about Bitburg are probably quite well grounded  in the German situation. They may be very bad concerning the American situation.'' **********Many political commentators and politicians expressed bitterness and astonishment at reports here of Senator Arlen Specter's suggestion today in Washington that Congress might take retaliatory measures against West Germany, an ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, if Mr. Kohl did not free President Reagan from his Bitburg commitment. [Asked by an interviewer on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' if the Bitburg visit could harm United States-West Germany relations, Mr. Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said, ''I think that it will.'' He added: ''The relationship is a delicate matter and  it's based upon a lot of points. We have to decide many matters in the Senate with respect to trade issues. There has been a growing movement in the Senate that we are spending too much on NATO.''] Spokesmen for the Kohl Government declined to comment on an article in The New York Times today that said that among the dead in the Bitburg cemetery were soldiers from the Waffen SS division that massacred 642 French villagers in Oradour-sur-Glane in June 1944. It is not known if any of the men in the cemetery had taken part in that attack. Misunderstanding Is Seen **********In an interview, Bernhard Vogel, the Christian Democratic Premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, where Bitburg is situated, asserted that a misunderstanding had arisen in the United States because Americans did not distinguish between the elite Waffen SS combat units and the SS men and women who built and ran Nazi death camps. **********When told that soldiers of the 2d Waffen SS Panzer Division - which committed the massacre at Oradour - were buried in the cemetery, Mr. Vogel responded: ''I  can't answer the question of whether among 2,000 men there might be a few who committed crimes.

They did so at the start of a three-day meeting of the 90 member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade.

India said the agenda did not represent its position but also agreed to continue with the meeting. Many officials fear that these nations may return to the attack later in an attempt to have this meeting's final resolution exclude the services sector from preparatory work for the new trade round. **********The United States and other industrial GATT members are pushing for the new trade round, the eighth since the end of World War II, because they consider it an essential part of their strategy for defeating growing protectionist pressure in the world. **********Last weekend the United States, Britain, West Germany, France and Japan disclosed another part of their emerging strategy when they said they would try to depress the dollar's value by increased intervention in the currency markets with the aim of helping to reduce the huge United States trade deficit. **********France's Position Modified **********At the economic summit conference held in Bonn last June, France opposed setting a date for opening new trade talks. Since then, howevewr, France has modified its position, agreeing with its Common Market partners to push ahead with talks if the developing world agrees and if efforts are made to correct out-of-line foreign-exchange rates. **********Last week's five-nation agreement to realign the dollar's value was warmly welcomed by the French Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, as showing American acknowledgement of the need for monetary reform. Officials of other nations generally believe this has made France more willing to participate in trade talks. **********Most governments of industrial countries see a formal commitment to start the new trade round as an important long-term weapon against protectionism and as a way of restoring credibility to world trade. **********Developing World's 2 Views **********The developing world is divided by the industrial world's call for new GATT trade talks. Many of the poorer countries that are successful exporters favor the negotiations as likely to increase their access to markets. **********But a small group dislikes the emphasis being placed on freer trade in both goods and services, preferring to see the talks confined to removing barriers to trade in goods alone. They fear that the industrial countries have a natural advantage over them in the services sector and that multinational service companies will use freer trade as a means to increase their direct investments in the developing world. **********But in the past GATT has reached decisions by consensus, meaning that nobody objects even if they do not fully approve the outcome. As a result, strong oppositon from even a few countries can seriously delay the decision-making process. **********Washington's special trade representative, Michael B.

Further, the company said that the attorneys representing individual victims lack the authority to do so and that none of the plaintiffs, including the Indian Government, have standing to bring cases in this country. **********More than 2,000 people died and 200,000 were injured as a result of the leak of the toxic methyl isocyanate last Dec. 3, causing the worst industrial disaster in history. **********Single-Page Response **********Union Carbide's filing before Judge John F. Keenan in Federal District Court in Manhattan was only a single page in response to a suit by the Government of India and to a separate, consolidated suit by several dozen American attorneys seeking unspecified damages on behalf of all the Bhopal victims. Union Carbide did not say when it would file for dismissal of the actions. **********The American attorneys representing both India and the Bhopal victims are to submit a schedule for pre-trial examination of witnesses. Judge Keenan will have to rule on the issues of jurisdiction and representation of victims and decide on a schedule for further litigation. **********Yesterday's filing raised issues that could take years to sort out, attorneys for both sides said. One complication is that Indian attorneys representing Union Carbide have asked courts in Bhopal to dismiss claims there, too, using the same ''forum non conveniens'' - or ''inconvenient forum'' - argument being used in the United States, according to some attorneys involved in the case. **********''Carbide is trying to get everything dismissed in both places, misleading the courts,'' contended Clarence Dias, president of the International Center for Law and Development, which specializes in third world litigation. He and others said the tactic makes a difficult issue even thornier since judges in both countries will have to become more aware of each other's cases. **********India's Right to Sue **********Another thorny issue is that Union Carbide contends that American attorneys do not have the right to represent individual victims in their suit since India in February passed a law giving it the right to sue on behalf of the victims. **********Also, many victims signed up with more than one American attorney in the suits that have been consolidated, casting uncertainty on which lawyers are authorized to represent which victims, said Bud G. Holman, attorney at Kelley, Drye & Warren who signed Union Carbide's filing yesterday. **********The filing furthermore challenges India's right to bring a suit in the United States on behalf of Bhopal victims, Mr. Holman said. In its suit filed on April 8, India said its right stems from an interpretation of the ''parens patriae'' doctrine whereby a country can act on behalf of its citizens. India said that includes litigation in a foreign country, but such interpretation has not been recognized in United States courts, although there is very little case law on it, legal experts say. **********Who Made the Decisions **********Michael Ciresi, an attorney for Robins, Zelle, Larson & Kaplan, the Minneapolis law firm that filed India's suit, said yesterday that the forum for the trial cannot be chosen until after examination of witnesses in a discovery proceeding. **********''We have to find out who made the decision on the plant's design, where the operative actions took place,'' he said. ''The issue of control must be decided before the forum issue can be decided.'' **********Mr. Holman and Union Carbide spokesman Thomas Failla said they themselves did not have enough information to comment on any legal actions by the company in India. Mr. Failla said, however, that ''India has a well-developed judicial system, entirely capable of handling this case.'' India also has a history of making far smaller judgments in personal injury cases than have been made in the United States. Mr. Failla declined to comment on that issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/13/business/consumer-credit-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumer Credit Report", "print_headline": "Consumer Credit Report", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve Board said that the consumer installment credit report for June, scheduled for Tuesday, was now tentatively scheduled to be released on Wednesday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/27/world/around-the-world-truck-driver-is-hurt-by-mine-in-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Truck Driver Is Hurt By Mine in South Africa", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Truck Driver Is Hurt By Mine in South Africa", "body_text": " **********Two land mine explosions damaged two farm trucks and injured a driver near the Zimbabwe border today in what was thought to be the first mining of roads in South Africa by anti-apartheid guerrillas, the authorities said. **********A statement from Army headquarters said the driver suffered leg wounds in the first explosion. **********Another farm truck was damaged in the second blast, but the driver was reported unhurt. **********The statement said the planting of the mines was ''presumably'' the work of the African National Congress, a banned and exiled group committed to the overthrow of apartheid. **********Meanwhile, the police reported that a black councilman shot one man dead in Huhudi township near Vryburg when a mob of blacks attacked his house, and that one black man was killed and two houses set were afire in a fight between two rival bands of blacks in Chesterville township near Durban."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/13/business/california-amplifier-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/business/dividend-meetings-197482.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of Jan. 7, 1985:          *2*MONDAY       None              *4*TUESDAY       AAR Corp   Procter & Gamble       Central Soya   Weyerhaeuser Co       Pillsbury Co              *2*WEDNESDAY       Bard (CR)   Woolworth (FW)       Walgreen Co              *2*THURSDAY       Adams Express   Idaho Pwr       Conrac Corp   Petroleum & Resources              *2*FRIDAY       Aluminum Co   Amer Ohio Mattress"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/business/briefs-049743.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 455, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues *********** Citicorp is issuing $500 million, up from $350 million, of 20-year floating-rate Euronotes, with a minimum coupon of 5 percent, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

The Ford Motor Company, for example, once raised sheep to provide the wool for its cars' upholstery. Now it buys elsewhere half the components that go into a car, if not the entire car itself. **********The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company has stopped making truck radial tires and is marketing a competitor's product. **********The United States Steel Corporation is turning to outside vendors to maintain its equipment and to make the molds into which it pours molten steel. And it would like to buy steel that it could turn into finished products. **********The General Electric Company no longer makes microwave ovens, CAT scanners or the ice makers in its refrigerators; South Korean, Japanese and other American companies, or joint ventures with them, are increasingly bringing those good things to life. **********Even the International Business Machines Corporation, which as recently as the late 1970's prided itself on producing everything from the semiconductors to the software used in its computers, has now embraced a vastly different strategy. **********Many New Alliances **********The first sign of change at I.B.M. was its entry into the personal computer market in 1981 with a machine that was assembled mostly from other companies' products and was sold through such retailers as Sears, Roebuck & Company and Computerland. **********Now it is involved in a slew of alliances with and investments in other companies. **********''I encourage each product manager, wherever they are, to look outside as well as inside the company to find the lowest cost, the highest quality,'' said Jack D. Kuehler, who is I.B.M.'s senior vice president in charge of manufacturing development. **********Such changes fly in the face of the conventional business wisdom descended from industrialists such as Carnegie, Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. They not only owned huge factories, but the raw materials that fed those factories. In that way, they made sure that high-volume production was never interrupted. **********To develop demand or insure that there was always a market for their manufactured goods, many of these industrialists moved into distribution or the manufacture of final products. Thus, the aluminum companies branched beyond the production of aluminum to market beverage cans, pots and pans. **********Vertical Integration the Key **********The control of all the key aspects of a given business - known as ''vertical integration'' - was the foundation for the rise of the American industrial marvel. **********But it also came to be embraced as a justification for building huge empires even when their size did not necessarily mean big profits and their managers lacked the skills to run the expanded operations. **********Now, a new generation of American managers - having contemplated the globalization of markets, the strong dollar, rapid technological change and ever-shorter product life cycles - is questioning their elders' faith in the omnipotent corporation. **********''What we're really talking about is the restructuring of the American economy,'' said Jeffrey R. Williams, an associate professor of industrial administration at Carnegie-Mellon University, in Pittsburgh. **********The big question of the moment is whether the restructuring - or de facto breakup of big corporations - is good or bad for America. **********Operating More Flexibly **********Some management experts and economists believe that the ''disaggregation'' or ''disintegration'' of large corporations will substantially improve the competitiveness of the United States in world markets. ''The American economy is going to operate more flexibly, and, as a result, we're going to be more competitive,'' said Michael J. Piore, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Mass., and the author of ''The Second Industrial Divide.'' **********Others, such as Robert B. Reich, a professor of business and public policy at Harvard University, see the trend as just another dangerous sign that the United States is consigning itself to the eventual role of a second-rate industrial power that merely assembles what the Japanese build. **********Union leaders are also concerned, especially about large companies' growing practice of buying, or ''out-sourcing,'' components, products and services. They fear that the practice, a sensitive issue in the current contract talks between the Chrysler Corporation and the United Automobile Workers union, will only accelerate the movement of highly paid manufacturing jobs to lower-paying American companies or foreign countries. **********''Out-sourcing is a serious problem in all American industries,'' said Donald F. Ephlin, the union's vice president in charge of dealing with the General Motors Corporation. **********A Rise in Divestitures **********Whether it is a problem or a boon, virtually everyone agrees that this corporate disassembling helps explain the huge increase in divestitures - there were 900 last year, with a market value of $29.4 billion, according to W.T. Grimm & Company, the mergers and acquisitions specialists. **********It also helps explain the corresponding surge in the number of joint ventures and other alliances between American and foreign companies. And it makes finding a solution to the record trade deficits all the more difficult. **********''Today more U.S. companies have decidedly mixed feelings about protectionism than five years ago,'' said Michael E. Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business School and a leading authority on corporate strategy. **********There is also a growing conviction on the part of academicians, consultants and business executives that the split-up is radically changing the form of the corporation that has dominated American industry for much of this century. **********Acting Like Contractors **********''Big companies will act more like prime contractors that hire other companies to perform highly specialized tasks in the making and selling of products,'' said Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, an associate professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business who has written extensively about joint ventures and how companies decide whether to make or buy parts and services. **********And John J. Nevin, Firestone's chairman, noted, ''More and more companies are saying it is not required that you manufacture a product if you need to continue to market it.'' **********With technology changing so quickly, said Fred W. Garry, a vice president for corporate engineering and manufacturing at General Electric, ''you may not necessarily want to tie yourself down to making some piece of a product or providing some service.'' He added, ''You may want to let it rest with a specialist.'' **********American manufacturers may moan about the mounting competitive threat from Japan, Korea or Taiwan. Yet the proliferation of dependable, cost-efficient suppliers in those countries is driving down the price and driving up the quality of components. **********And that development is giving American companies much more flexibility in deciding which components - or entire products, for that matter - they should make themselves and which they should buy: They can determine where in their business systems their greatest competitive strength lies and focus their resources accordingly. **********Choosing the Critical Part **********Thus, G.E.'s Major Appliance Business Group is focusing much of its engineering and financial resources on designing and manufacturing a state-of-the-art compressor, which it feels is the vital part of a refrigerator, according to Richard L. Burke, the vice president of the Major Appliance Group's production division, while it buys ice makers from a Japanese supplier. **********Similarly, the Xerox Corporation now buys about 20 percent of the electronic components that go into its photocopiers; as recently as 1979, it bought virtually none of them. Such out-sourcing has enabled Xerox to come up with the funds for a new photo-receptor plant and a new toner plant, said H. Barry Bebb, a vice president in Xerox's Reprographics Business Group. - areas where it thinks it enjoys a competitive advantage. **********The dismantling of big corporations is also significantly altering the way they are managed. One of the most noticeable changes is the effort to develop closer, long-term relationships with suppliers - much as Japanese companies such as Toyota have done. **********''American companies are realizing that to control the critical steps in a business system, you don't necessarily have to own them yourself,'' said Quincy J. Hunsicker, a director of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. **********Ford, Xerox and General Electric are among the companies dramatically reducing the number of suppliers they do business with, even as they buy more components from outside vendors: They want to make themselves more important to their suppliers, thereby increasing their leverage with suppliers. **********'A Preferred Customer' **********''We realized that we had to become a preferred customer,'' said Nicholas Scheele, the director of supply policy and planning at Ford, which has pared the number of its North American suppliers by about 30 percent since the end of 1981. **********At the same time, the suppliers are being given an unprecedented amount of responsibility. Ford now frequently involves them in designing the parts that they have been asked to manufacture. A. O. Smith, for example, designed the engine subframe for the Taurus and the Sable, Ford's newest midsized cars. And that kind of involvement is becoming the rule rather than the exception in other industries as well. **********''By 1990, if a supplier is not capable of joining the auto companies in the design work, he is not going to be in the business,'' predicted Martin L. Anderson, a consultant who was the co-author of a major study of the auto industry for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********The ''disintegration'' trend is having an equally dramatic impact on labor-management relations. While in some industries, such as steel, relations have deterioriated because of out-sourcing, in others, such as autos, it appears to be leading to closer, more constructive ties between management and workers. **********Auto workers at General Motors' Rochester Products division, in Rochester, worked with company engineers to design an efficient process for manufacturing fuel-injection systems - a product that G.M. had been buying exclusively from outside suppliers. Now the union is exploring other ways, including changes in work rules, to make the plant even more efficient. **********No Guarantee on Future **********''Just because we're building that product in that plant now, doesn't guarantee we'll do so in the future,'' said Marvin Holler, the first vice president of U.A.W. Local 1097. **********While it remains to be seen whether this kind of worker attitude spreads to other industries or fades away as out-sourcing grows, one thing is already clear: Companies are reaping bigger profits, developing products faster and making a better showing against foreign competitors by doing less themselves. **********California Steel Industries, a company that imports steel slabs from Brazil and other countries and finishes them in plants bought from the Kaiser Steel Corporation, has just moved into the black - a feat that an integrated Kaiser Steel had not been able to achieve for several years. **********Firestone today makes money on truck radial tires - a boast it could not make three years ago. The RCA Corporation, which lost about $575 million manufacturing and marketing its own videodisk player, has made ''very high profits'' marketing Japanese-manufactured video cassette recorders, said David Lachenbruch, the editorial director of Television Digest, a newsletter for the consumer electronics, broadcasting and cable industries. **********Keeping Out Japanese Brands **********Aside from profits, some companies see marketing someone else's product as a key way to keep Japanese brands out of their markets, or at least to limit their inroads. The auto industry may have created the biggest stir by adopting this tactic, but it is hardly the only one embracing this strategy. **********General Electric decided that it was not worth its while to manufacture small refrigerators, which constitute a tiny market in the United States. Instead, it markets small refrigerators purchased from Japanese, Korean and American companies - in order to prevent Japanese brands from establishing a toehold in the United States. **********A growing number of machine tool builders, including the current industry leader, Cincinnati Milacron Inc., are buying complete or nearly complete Japanese products. Richard T. Lindgren, the president and chief executive of the Cross & Trecker Corporation, said that by enhancing and customizing Japanese-made machine tools for American customers, his company would be able to recapture some of the huge market share now held by Japanese brands in some product lines. **********The big unanswered question is whether in the long run American industry will be better or worse off if integrated corporation really disappears. If all highly skilled manufacturing jobs do indeed go to Japan, Professor Reich of Harvard worries that the United States' superiority in research and development will soon follow. **********He is not alone in these fears. Engineers and financial executives are locked in ''constant battle'' over these issues at I.B.M., according to Professor Reich. **********Nor is the battle confined to I.B.M. One RCA manager found little reason to rejoice in the company's success in selling Japanese video cassette recorders. RCA's video cassette recorder business is like a castle built upon the sand, he said. ''We may have made a ton of money, but we are not building anything that will really last.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/business/mesa-will-post-gain-on-unocal.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1985-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MESA WILL POST GAIN ON UNOCAL", "print_headline": "MESA WILL POST GAIN ON UNOCAL", "body_text": " **********The Mesa Petroleum Company, citing a number of complex accounting practices and tax rules, said yesterday that it would report an after-tax gain of about $83 million, or $1.22 a share, for the quarter ended June 30 as a result of its attempt to acquire the Unocal Corporation. **********Because Mesa's chairman, T. Boone Pickens Jr., failed to gain control of Unocal - and because the battle for the company was long and costly - many financial analysts had expected Mesa to report a loss of as much as $20 million from its dealings. **********In its statement, Mesa referred particularly to its accounting treatment of several aspects of the transaction with Unocal. **********As part of the agreement to end Mesa's pursuit of Unocal, the California oil company offered to exchange bonds for one-third of its stock, with the face value of the bonds amounting to $72 for each share exchanged. **********Mesa received $589.4 million in Unocal bonds in exchange for Unocal stock that Mesa bought for under $400 million. Yet Mesa will not be reporting a gain on the transaction. Since other shareholders also turned in their stock under the offer, Mesa's ownership percentage in Unocal did not change. Under tax law, Mesa can thus claim that virtually all of the $589.4 million amounted to a dividend. By law, companies can exclude from taxation 85 percent of the dividends they receive. **********Mesa will also assume that the full $1 billion it deployed to pursue Unocal was spent to acquire an additional 14.6 million shares in Unocal that Mesa continues to hold. That point is critical because Mesa will be writing down those shares to slightly below their market value, and the resulting loss of nearly $600 million will generate huge tax benefits that will contribute to Mesa's second-quarter profit. **********David H. Batchelder, a Mesa vice president, said the company's accounting was not unusual. ''People have been doing this for some time,'' Mr. Batchelder said, adding that Mesa's tax lawyers had agreed with the treatment and that a number of other companies, including the Teledyne Corporation and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., had used similar accounting techniques. **********Mesa's auditors, Arthur Andersen & Company, have also approved of the treatment. ''We have concurred with the accounting of the transaction,'' said David L. Moore, manager of the Mesa account for Andersen. **********'A Novel Approach' **********Some Wall Street analysts, however, were surprised. **********''It's certainly a novel approach,'' said Rosario Illacqua, the oil analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. ''I've tried to come to grips with this. I would have never assumed that the $589 million was a dividend. Mesa is clearly alert to all the nuances of the tax business.'' **********In Washington, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service indicated that the transaction would probably be scrutinized.

Icahn in his bid for the carrier. **********The action was a substantial victory for Mr. Icahn, strengthening his ability to take over the airline. Mr. Icahn, who has accumulated 45.54 percent of the outstanding T.W.A. stock, has made an offer of $24 a share for the rest of the common stock. Texas Air, which holds about 6 percent of the carrier's stock, has made a competing bid of $26 a share. **********Robert Joedicke, the airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., who has followed the twists and turns of the takeover battle closely, was unwilling yesterday to predict the outcome of what he called a ''soap opera.'' **********''Obviously there can be many more skirmishes before the final battle,'' he added. **********Texas Air Proposals **********The board went out of its way to point out some of the advantages of Mr. Icahn's offer to stockholders and to note various risks if it had gone along with the proposals that would, in effect, have ''locked up'' the merger with Texas Air. **********In an attempt to thwart Mr. Icahn, Texas Air had proposed to the board that it give it options on stock that would dilute Mr. Icahn's holdings. In addition, Texas Air had proposed that the board grant it options to buy T.W.A.'s reservation system and international division - two of the carrier's most valuable assets. Without those assets, Texas Air believed T.W.A. would no longer be attractive to Mr. Icahn. **********A spokesman for T.W.A. said in a statement that ''the board considers it very important to T.W.A. stockholders that, in light of Mr. Icahn's presumptive ability to block the Texas Air merger, T.W.A. should have available to it Mr. Icahn's merger proposal. We think $24 a share, which is 33 percent above Mr. Icahn's initial offer of $18 a share, is an excellent price for our stockholders.'' **********Analysts have said that Mr. Icahn's holdings are large enough that he could simply not vote his shares to prevent Texas Air from getting 51 percent in a shareholder vote. **********Union Support **********Mr. Icahn's position was further bolstered yesterday in his battle with Frank Lorenzo, the president of Texas Air, when members of two major T.W.A. unions - the Air Line Pilots Assocation and the International Assocation of Machinsts and Aerospace Workers - ratified agreements worked out by their leaders with Mr. Icahn. **********The workers would give major concessions in wages and benefits, the pilots 26 percent a year and the machinists 15 percent a year, in return for profit sharing and stock ownership. **********After yesterday's board action, Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Texas Air, said in an interview, ''We were very disappointed but the board gave very fair consideration to our proposal.'' **********Mr. Icahn in a statement said, ''I want to express my appreciation to the members of the T.W.A. board of directors for the responsible actions today, taken in the interest of T.W.A.'s shareholders and employees, the traveling public and the communities served by T.W.A.'' He added that he was hopeful that he could complete the merger with the carrier by Nov. 30. **********Many Twists **********Yesterday's surprising action was one of many twists in the takeover battle. Only last June 6, C.E. Meyer, the president and chief executive of T.W.A., had called Mr. Icahn at a hearing in Washington one of the greediest men on earth, who was determined to liquidate the airline. Yesterday, Mr. Meyer voted to thwart Texas Air, which had spent a week huddled with T.W.A. advisers to come up with proposals that would block Mr. Icahn and that would be acceptable to the board. **********In a statement, T.W.A. said that a factor that influenced the board's decision was that Mr. Icahn's offer could be consummated more quickly than Texas Air's since it was not subject to review by the Transportation Department. **********T.W.A. also said that its board had been influenced by the significant concessions that two of unions had granted to Mr. Icahn and that would be major factors in making the airline substantially more competitive and profitable. **********Retaliation Feared **********On the other hand, the airline said, the board was concerned that if it accepted the proposals from Texas Air, there could be retaliation from the unions, which might have interfered with operations over the next six to seven months that it would take to complete a merger with Texas Air. **********One source, who was at the meeting, said that one of the speakers had warned of wildcat strikes if Texas Air won control of the airline. **********The board was also reluctant to sell the carrier piecemeal. ''These routes and the PARS system are the heart of T.W.A.,'' a company spokesman said, ''and the board did not want to take any action that could lead to dismemberment of the airline.'' PARS is a reservation system. **********The board also decided to reject a proposal worked out by Texas Air and T.W.A. advisers over the past week that would have barred both Mr. Icahn and Texas Air from voting their shares and would have left the decision of what bid to accept to the remaining minority shareholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/03/business/well-completions-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Well Completions Fall", "print_headline": "Well Completions Fall", "body_text": " **********Petroleum companies completed a total of 41,318 oil and natural gas wells in the United States during the first six months of 1985, down by a slim 120 wells from a year earlier, the Petroleum Information Corporation reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/19/business/computerland.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Computerland", "print_headline": "Computerland", "body_text": " **********A state judge signed an order directing the founder of Computerland, a computer retailer, to surrender stock worth as much as $400 million to a group of investors led by a rival retailer.

But Democrats in Congress and some officials in the Administration say they believe the White House has overstated its case. **********At the same time, however, even many of the Administration's critics agree with two of President Reagan's other major concerns about Nicaragua: that many Sandinista leaders are Marxist-Leninists and that they have aided El Salvador's leftist guerrillas. **********Reagan Sees a 'War Machine' **********Mr. Reagan has accused the Nicaraguans of building ''a war machine'' that ''dwarfs the forces of all their neighbors combined.'' **********In February, Vice President Bush belittled ''some who still insist'' that ''these Marxists have no extraterritorial ambitions.'' **********In interviews with more than two dozen officials in the White House, the Defense and State Departments, Congress and private organizations involved with Central American affairs, these were some of the main findings: **********- The Salvadoran and Guatemalan regular armies, with 48,000 and 40,000 troops, are each nearly as large as the Nicaraguan Army, which has 40,000 regular troops and another 20,000 militia members on active duty, according to Defense Department figures. When all the other Central American armies are combined, they are far larger than Nicaragua's. On the other hand, when army troops and militia are lumped together, Nicaragua's military forces are larger than those of any other Central American country, although Guatemala claims to have a 900,000- member Rural Civil Guard. **********- Senior Administration officials, in speeches and in public reports, have frequently said Nicaragua intends to attack its neighbors. But State and Defense Department officials say unofficially that they do not believe Nicaragua has any such intention. **********- President Reagan has said that ''the Sandinista military buildup began two and a half years before'' the United States-backed Nicaraguan rebels took up arms and was not a result of rebel attacks. But Defense Department records show that the first shipment of heavy Soviet-made arms to Nicaragua came many months after the first reports of rebel attacks. **********- Nicaraguan officials have said one reason for their buildup is that they fear an American invasion. Administration officials confirmed that since at least 1983, the United States had used a ''perception management'' program, as a classified Defense Department document called it, to keep the Nicaraguans concerned that the United States might attack. **********- White House and State Department officials were unable to verify the accuracy of several quotations that the President and others have attributed to Nicaraguan leaders in support of their assertions about Nicaragua's intentions. In one case, the State Department acknowledged that it knew of no Sandinista official who ever used an often-quoted phrase that Nicaragua seeks a ''revolution without frontiers.'' **********Even the Administration's critics agree with several of the President's fundamental assertions about Nicaragua. **********Many of them say they are convinced that Nicaragua has supplied arms and other assistance to El Salvador's leftist rebels, although there is disagreement about the scope of that assistance and whether it continues. **********Representative Michael D. Barnes, Democrat of Maryland, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, said that ''there is no doubt'' about Nicaragua's ''support to the left in El Salvador.'' **********Administration critics also agree that many of Nicaragua's leaders are Marxist-Leninists with close ties to Cuba. To some Administration supporters, that fact alone is sufficient evidence of aggressive intent. **********There also is widespread concern that Nicaragua could become a Soviet military base. ''There's a possibility for air bases and submarine pens,'' said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Soviet and Nicaraguan officials have denied such assertions. **********Army's Size and Ability Are a Matter of Dispute **********A White House spokesman said Otto J. Reich, Ambassador for Latin American public diplomacy, was the official best suited to outline the Administration's concerns about Nicaragua and the evidence to support them. **********In an interview, Mr. Reich described the Nicaraguan Army as ''enormous in relation to its immediate environment'' and added that ''invasion is one of the things we are concerned about.'' **********The Defense Department estimates that the Nicaraguan Army includes about 40,000 regular, active-duty troops and another 20,000 civilian militia members on active duty, for a total troop strength of about 60,000. **********The department also estimates that El Salvador has 48,000 troops on active duty, Honduras has 21,000 and Guatemala has about 40,000, for a combined troop strength of about 109,000. Costa Rica has no army but does have a 9,500- man Civil Guard. **********Nicaragua also has a civilian militia of 50,000, in addition to those on active duty, and Administration officials sometimes include the militia in their public statements about the size of the Nicaraguan Army. **********Carlos Tunnerman Bernheim, the Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States, said the militia included ''all types of people: factory workers, students, women, children and old people.'' **********All of them, he said, ''have had some minimal training,'' adding that they would be issued weapons if Nicaragua were invaded. **********A Defense Department official, acknowledging that the militia includes some women and children, said that ''we don't know how well trained they are'' or how many have arms. **********Costa Rica has a 10,000-member civilian militia, Honduras has a 4,500- member ''public security'' force and Guatemala claims to have a 900,000- member rural defense force. **********Of the assertions of a possible Nicaraguan invasion of its neighbors, Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman of Nicaragua said, ''To believe that is to believe that in addition to being evil, we are also insane.'' **********A senior Defense Department official directly involved with Central American affairs agreed, saying that ''we don't expect an attack'' because ''we don't think they would be that stupid.'' **********''That would be the solution'' to the Nicaragua problem, he added, because the United States would ''most certainly'' attack. **********Administration officials frequently point to Nicaragua's armor as evidence of aggressive intent. Nicaragua has more tanks than any other country in the region. **********In a speech last month, Vice President Bush said Nicaragua had ''over 150 tanks.'' And Government white papers describing a Nicaraguan threat point out that Nicaragua has ''heavy ferries to give additional amphibious mobility'' to the tanks, as one white paper said. It also noted that Nicaragua's borders with Honduras and Costa Rica are ''largely defined by rivers.'' **********Defense Department officials say the Nicaraguans have 110 Soviet-built T-54 and T-55 tanks that are 25 to 30 years old. Col. Lawrence L. Tracy, the State Department's military adviser for Latin American public diplomacy, said the tanks ''couldn't survive against modern antitank weaponry.'' Colonel Tracy is one of the authors of the Government's most recent white paper, issued in March. **********Since most of Nicaragua is too hilly for tanks, to be used against Honduras they would probably have to be loaded on flatbed trucks and driven up the Pan-American Highway, Colonel Tracy and others said. **********That could be ''suicidal,'' Colonel Tracy said. The Honduran Air Force, which includes more than two dozen jet fighters and bombers, ''could easily take them out,'' a senior Defense Department official said, since Nicaragua has ''no significant air force to speak of.'' **********Mr. Reagan, in a 1983 session with reporters, said Nicaragua had ''fighter planes, bombers and so forth.'' **********Defense Department officials say Nicaragua has no jet fighters or bombers or other modern combat aircraft, except about 10 sophisticated Soviet helicopter gunships. **********Mr. Reich said, ''If all the Nicaraguan tanks were to simply occupy a plain in southern Honduras, they could humiliate the Honduran Army, and the Government could collapse.'' **********But Mr. Reich also acknowledged that the ''Sandinista military hasn't shown us much so far'' in its war against the rebels. **********Nicaraguan Buildup: When Did It Start?Ambassador Tunnerman, like other Nicaraguan officials, said that ''we had to increase our military because we are facing aggression from the contras,'' as the rebels are often called. **********But a senior State Department official contended that ''they announced their intentions and were rushing pell- mell to buy tanks long before the contras were a threat.'' Nicaragua denies that. **********The first clear statement of Nicaragua's intent was a Government paper called ''the 72-hour document.'' Published in Managua in the fall of 1979, a few months after the Sandinistas came to power, it reported ''in detail on an extraordinary meeting Sept. 21 to 23'' of the Sandinista leadership, a State Department cable from Managua said. The United States Ambassador called the document ''remarkably frank,'' and Reagan Administration officials frequently cite it. **********Of military plans, the document said, ''Though we do not wish to downplay the need for a strong military to take care of national defense, we would like to point out that at the present time there is no clear indication of an armed counterrevolution'' and ''what merits our attention is domestic factors.'' **********At the same time, in 1979 Cuba was sending a variety of specialists to Nicaragua, including military advisers, and a Defense Department official said that showed that the Nicaraguans ''had this buildup planned all along.'' **********Bosco Matamoros, an official in the largest rebel group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, said recently that armed rebels began attacks in Nicaragua in 1980. That is also when Sandinista officials began complaining of attacks. And in recent interviews, rebel leaders have said they began receiving training and assistance from the Argentine military in 1980. **********In February 1981, Nicaragua announced it would form a large citizen militia. By then, 67 Nicaraguan soldiers had been killed in attacks by several hundred rebels, many of them former Nicaraguan National Guardsmen who had been operating out of Honduras for more than a year, press reports of the time said. **********Also in February 1981, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra asserted that Nicaragua needed a large militia because ''there is a danger that the thousands of former National Guardsmen abroad'' could find support from the United States. **********Months later, in mid-1981, a senior Defense Department official said, Nicaragua acquired its first Soviet- made tanks. Until then, another Defense Department official said, they had been receiving ''small arms and light artillery, mostly.'' **********Late that year, President Reagan authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to begin aiding the Nicaraguan rebels. **********U.S. Has Stirred Fears of Invasion **********Nicaraguan officials have repeatedly said they are worried about a United States invasion, and since at least 1983 the Reagan Administration has intentionally reinforced those fears, senior Administration officials confirmed. **********A 1983 Defense Department document on ''Central American initiatives'' mentioned a ''perception management program'' to be ''coupled with the activities of'' the Big Pine II military manuevers held that August in Honduras. The Defense Department ''will take the lead'' in the program, the document said, with help from the C.I.A. and the State Department. **********A senior State Department official confirmed this week that the program was still in place and said its purpose was to gain concessions from the Nicaraguan Government. ''Every time there's an invasion scare, they make some concessions,'' he said. Another senior official said, ''We do our best to keep them concerned.'' **********Statements from the President and other senior officials in Washington raise invasion concerns in Managua. But the most important element of the program, officials said, has been a series of large-scale American military maneuvers in Honduras, beginning in early 1983. From the start Administration officials have said the maneuvers were intended to intimidate Nicaragua. **********''One of the central purposes is to create fear of an invasion,'' a senior Administration official said. The American troops ''push very close to the border, deliberately, to set off all the alarms,'' he added. **********Ambassador Tunnerman said that ''with 12,000 troops on our border'' and a ''corresponding escalation of statements from the Government'' in Washington, ''we have reason to be concerned.'' **********The Defense Department is preparing for large-scale maneuvers along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border that will begin within a few weeks. **********The Administration intentionally scared the Nicaraguans in another manner last November, when officials in Washington said a ship docking in Nicaragua might be carrying Soviet fighter planes. **********Administration officials said later that no planes had been unloaded. But during the MIG crisis, as Nicaraguans now call it, American surveillance aircraft flying over Managua caused a series of sonic booms, further alarming the Nicaraguans at a time when tensions were already high. **********Such planes frequently fly over Nicaragua and other countries without causing sonic booms. **********Mr. Reich confirmed that the booms were intended to scare the Nicaraguans. Another senior State Department official said that ''there is talk about doing the same thing again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/04/world/conservative-majority-is-cut-in-newfoundland-legislature.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Conservative Majority Is Cut In Newfoundland Legislature", "print_headline": "Conservative Majority Is Cut In Newfoundland Legislature", "body_text": " **********Newfoundland voters, disgruntled over persistently high unemployment, reduced the majority held by the Progressive Conservative Party in provincial elections. **********The Progressive Conservatives won 36 of the 52 Provincial Assembly seats in the election Tuesday but lost 8 to the resurgent Liberals. **********The Conservatives, also unpopular for imposing a two-year wage freeze on civil servants, have been in power in Newfoundland since 1972."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/10/world/around-the-world-7-die-in-nicaragua-in-dance-floor-attack.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  7 Die in Nicaragua In Dance-Floor Attack", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   7 Die in Nicaragua In Dance-Floor Attack", "body_text": " **********An unidentified attacker threw a hand grenade onto a crowded dance floor at a students' party in the northern town of Ocotal, the police said today.

The funds would be distributed by the Agency for International Development and not the Central Intelligence Agency, which has been the main conduit for American support to the insurgents. **********In addition, the bill would continue a law that bans the use of any American funds for military purposes in Nicaragua. **********Most Democratic leaders remain opposed to any bill that would channel aid directly to the rebels, known as contras. But the leaders acknowledge that some compromise package providing nonmilitary aid is likely to pass Congress, and some think the bill offered today could ''do very well,'' as a senior Democrat put it. **********Republicans 'Not Happy' **********However, House Republican leaders are ''not happy'' with the proposal and have declined to support it, said Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming, a party spokesman on the Nicaragua issue. In particular, he said, most Republicans would prefer using the C.I.A. to supervise the support operation. In addition, they would like to repeal the ban on military aid. **********Both parties acknowledge that the dispute over aid to the rebels has become enmeshed in political manuvering. Many Democrats want to move quickly to pass an aid bill so they can protect themselves against charges that they support the Sandinista regime and decline to encourage democratic forces in this hemisphere. **********The political stakes increased last week when President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua made a well-publicized visit to Moscow. At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader, said many of his colleagues had a ''lingering fear'' of what Mr. Ortega and the Sandinistas might do next. They wanted to make sure, he added, that their constituents know they have ''no brief whatever'' for the Nicaraguan regime. **********Ready to Raise the Ante **********The Republicans, on the other hand, concede they are enjoying the Democrats' discomfort and are in no hurry to ease it. ''Do we let the Democrats off the hook by sanctifying their proposal?'' asked Mr. Cheney. **********That Democratic proposal is similar in many respects to a plan advanced two weeks ago by Republican leaders.

''We were very frustrated that we didn't have a policy coming out of the debate two weeks ago,'' said Representative Dave McCurdy, the Oklahoma Democrat who drafted the compromise. ''We ended up with a total nonpolicy.'' **********The McCurdy bill tries to resolve what Mr. Wright described as the ambivalent view of many Democrats on the issue.

He was killed less than a month after signing an accord with Mr. Gandhi to end the three years of political strife in the Punjab. **********Many politicians fear that the Punjab could be thrown into even greater turmoil as emotions rise during the election campaign, the central issue of which is certain to be the dispute between moderate and militant Sikhs over the accord with Mr. Gandhi. **********Assam Troubles Recalled **********Some people have pointed out, for example, that the scheduling of elections in 1983 in Assam, another troubled state, led to the slaughter of thousands of people and a bitter dispute over the legitimacy of the vote. **********But Mr. Gandhi has apparently decided that even with the death of Mr. Longowal, the leading Sikh moderate, the accord negotiated last month stands a better chance of winning voter approval now than later. **********''It's obviously a risk,'' said a Government official involved in Mr. Gandhi's decision. ''But I would argue that it's even riskier to postpone the elections and give the extremists a chance to consolidate. **********''Right now,'' he said, ''they're on the run.'' **********On the floor of Parliament today, Mr. Gandhi vigorously defended his decision to hold elections, saying that ''we shall not allow divisive forces to prevail'' simply because of the assassination. **********Gandhi Hopes 'India Wins' **********The Prime Minister, contending that it does not matter who wins the elections on Sept. 25, said: ''What matters is that the lamp of democracy is not extinguished. What does matter is that India wins.'' **********Mr. Gandhi, whose 41st birthday came on the day of Mr. Longowal's death, has often been described as an amateur politician reluctantly thrust into leadership after his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assasinated Oct. 31, 1984. **********But the election decision seemed a reflection of Mr. Gandhi's increasing confidence in his own political instincts, no doubt reinforced by the recollection of the sympathy vote he received last December. **********An associate of the Prime Minister said today that he was not surprised. ''It's very much a part of the kind of man he is,'' the associate said. ''He does not want to give the impression that he is weak.'' **********Akali Dal Unity Is a Key **********Whether the vote upholds the Punjab accord is likely to hinge on whether the Akali Dal, the mainstream Sikh political organization, remains united after the death of its leader. **********Initial reports were that leaders of the party had chosen a moderate former agriculture minister, Surjeet Singh Barnala, as party ''convener'' to succeed Mr. Longowal. But today, it was reported that a party faction was challenging the choice. **********In a development more ominious for the chances of unity, two outspoken party critics of the Punjab accord were reportedly talking with at least some youths known to have ties to the extremists. **********One critic, Prakash Singh Badal, is a former Chief Minister of Punjab state who is likely to try to seek the job again this year. If Mr. Badal opposes the agreement, its chances of acceptance will be reduced. **********Badal a Possible Thorn **********Aides to Mr. Gandhi clearly hoped Mr. Badal, a proven vote-getter, would drop his earlier opposition to the accord for the sake of party unity. They noted that hours before Mr. Longowal died, Mr. Badal pledged to work for unity, and they said he could not easily walk away now. **********Despite Mr. Gandhi's professed indifference to the outcome, aides say he is deeply concerned that Akali Dal moderates win, or at least do well enough to be given the chance to rule in a coalition government. **********Paradoxically, politicians say the worst thing that could happen from Mr. Gandhi's perspective would be for the Akali Dal to lose badly to Mr. Gandhi's own ruling Congress Party. **********If that happened, the moderate Sikhs might then feel shut out of power and return once again to protests and agitations. As a result, there is talk that Mr. Gandhi might eventually invite the Akali Dal to form a coalition. **********Other Sensitive Issues **********Also being watched in the next few days is whether several other sensitive issues are likely to be debated in the election campaign, leading to increased divisions and tensions. **********Increasingly, for example, opposition politicians in New Delhi are criticizing Mr. Gandhi's Government for its failure to protect Mr. Longowal. **********Like Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic in 1948, Mr. Longowal insisted that people not be screened for weapons when they came to see him. **********But there has been evidence that security was lax, and there have been charges in Parliament and elsewhere that Mr. Gandhi's Government, for all its talk, failed to guard against the obvious terrorist threat to Mr. Longowal.

The new members will increase the Parliament's size from 434 to 518 members and the number of languages its does business in from seven to nine. **********''The new seats will be very comfortable instead of supercomfortable,'' a parliamentary spokesman, James Pond, said. **********Warding Off Luxembourg **********The European Parliament is in a hurry to enlarge its chamber to stop Luxembourg, where most of the Parliament's 3,000 staff members already live, from making another bid to become its permanent home. **********Luxembourg already has a splendid parliamentary building capable of housing the expanded assembly. But in 1980 the Parliament tired of holding its monthly sessions in Luxembourg and Strasbourg alternately, and settled for Strasbourg, attracted by better communications and superior cuisine. The members want to keep things that way, hence the rush to enlarge the chamber and destroy Luxembourg's case. **********The world's only directly elected multinational parliament, Europe's Parliament finds that its powers are either too strong or too feeble to give its members the influence and prestige they feel entitled to. **********Yet on Wednesday, the 40th anniversary of V-E Day, it will offer President Reagan exactly the kind of neutral platform outside German soil that White House officials say he is looking for to carry his message of reconciliation to the whole European continent. **********When he enters its futuristic building, he will be leaving France and going into territory permanently ceded to Europe, first in the form of the Council of Europe, a half-forgotten, powerless association of European nations created after the war that now lends its buildings to the Parliament. **********Full Range of Beliefs **********At the speaker's podium, President Reagan will see in a semicircle in front of him the directly elected representatives of all 10 Common Market countries, reflecting the full range of the continent's political beliefs, from Communists on the far left to fascists on the right. But the Parliament's overall flavor is center-right. **********The Parliament plays a powerful symbolic role, representing the Common Market's commitment to democratic values and popular control. But its actual role in decision-making is weak. **********The Common Market's executive Commission in Brussels has the sole right to propose new community rules aimed at freeing trade between the member countries and integrating Europe's economies more closely. Only the Council of Ministers, representing the 10 member governments, can pass these recommendations into law. The Parliament is asked for its advice on all new legislation proposed, but its views bind no one. **********At first the members were appointed by national legislatures. Since 1979, when direct elections were introduced, the members have been trying to increase their power, arguing that they have a duty to represent the ideals of European unification against the nationalistic views of member governments. **********Many members acknowledge that their present powers often seem too limited to be of much use. When they rejected the Common Market's $20 billion annual budget last year in a dispute with member governments over agricultural spending, the gesture proved largely pointless because they could not agree on spending cuts. **********Meanwhile, the Parliament has never dared exercise its power to dismiss the whole executive Commission because this would lead it into a confrontation with the member governments, which appoint the commission members. **********Many members believe the Parliament has had most success in influencing Common Market policy in very detailed ways, often by holding up proposed legislation by refusing to give any opinion on it until changes are made. In 1983 it scored its most spectacular victory when it forced European governments to ban all imports of seal skins, effectively cutting the number of seal pups killed in Canada from 165,000 in 1982 to only 20,000 last year. **********THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT **********What is it The European Parliament is the deliberative body of the European Communities, whose most important and best-known part is the European Economic Community, or Common Market. Under their charter, the Treaty of Rome, power in the Communities is exercised primarily by the governments of the 10 member countries through the European Council of Heads of State or Government, the Council of Ministers and the executive Commission of the European Communities. **********The power of the Parliament was strictly limited, but its members have been widening its political influence in subtle ways, diminishing the authority of the member governments and the Council. Parliament meets in annual session, divided into monthly, weeklong meetings held in Strasbourg. But most of its specialized committees sit in Brussels, and its 2,000-strong secretariat is based in Luxembourg. Last year, it cost about $200 million to run, not counting members' salaries, which are paid by the national governments. **********Functions and Powers **********The Parliament imposes a measure of democratic control over the executive organs of the Communities, particularly those of the Economic Community. It advises on legislation drafted by the executive Commission for enactment by the Council. It scrutinizes the Economic Community's budget, which last year amounted to $24 billion. **********It has two real sources of power, and the members have begun to exploit them. Parliament can totally reject the annual budget, which it has done twice - in 1979 and 1984 - or reject parts of it, as it did in 1981. It can also dismiss the executive Commission as a bloc by a vote of censure, something it has never done. **********Membership **********The 434 members, previously chosen by their national legislatures, were first elected by direct, universal suffrage in 1979. A second election last June rearranged the Parliament's makeup at the expense of the traditional parties and added members from the political fringes, such as the nationalistic, right-wing National Front of France and the left-of-center Green coalition of West Germany. **********The President of Parliament, elected by the members in secret ballot for a term of two and a half years, is Pierre Pflimlin of France. Of the 10 member countries, Britain, France, West Germany and Italy hold 81 seats each, the Netherlands 25, Belgium and Greece 24 each, Denmark 16, Ireland 15 and Luxembourg 6. Spain and Portugal are expected to become members next year. **********The members, who are elected for five-year terms, sit in the chamber not as national delegations but in political groups. The election last June produced the following factions, listed with the number of seats each holds: **********Socialist Group, 130; European People's Party Group (Christian Democrats), 110; European Democratic Group, 50; Communist and Allies Group, 43; Liberal and Democratic Group, 31; Group of the European Democratic Alliance, 29; Rainbow Group (made up of four subgroups: the Federation of the Green-Alternative European Link, the Agalev-Ecolo, the Danish People's Movement Against Membership of the European Community and the European Free Alliance in the European Parliament), 19, and the Group of the European Right, 16. **********In addition, six seats are held by members not attached to any political group. **********In 1984, 118.5 million voters, or 60 percent of those eligible, took part in electing the Parliament compared with 111 million voters, or 62 percent, in 1979. The number of eligible voters, and the size of Parliament, increased when Greece became a member in 1981."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/19/world/china-gets-high-marks-on-settling-refugees.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1985-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA GETS HIGH MARKS ON SETTLING REFUGEES", "print_headline": "CHINA GETS HIGH MARKS ON SETTLING REFUGEES", "body_text": " **********Of the millions of Vietnamese who have fled their country by boat or on foot since the Communist victory in 1975, few have attracted less attention around the world than the 280,000 who came north to China. **********Among Vietnamese populations abroad, those in China are second in numbers only to those who have found new homes in the United States. Although the overwhelming majority of those who came here are of Chinese ethnic descent, settling down has not always been easy, and years after arriving thousands are still actively seeking acceptance elsewhere. **********A glimpse into the lives of people in China's only refugee community of any size was provided recently by Poul Hartling, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who discussed the matter at a news conference in a visit that included talks with senior Chinese officials, visits to refugee camps and the signing of a new aid agreement. **********Mr. Hartling, a former Danish Prime Minister, announced that the United Nations would give an additional $12 million from 1986 to 1988 to help China resettle the Vietnamese. It would bring total United Nations assistance to the Peking authorities to more than $51 million since 1978, when the refugees first started arriving here with tales of official discrimination by the Hanoi Government against those of its citizens who were of Chinese origin. **********Refugees Sent to Farms **********According to figures given by Chinese officials, the United Nations assistance is barely a quarter of what the Peking Government has spent on the problem. The Chinese put their commitments to date at more than 600 million yuan, or $211 million at current rates of exchange. Much of this has been invested in the 196 state-run farms to which China has directed most of the Vietnamese citizens, as well as about 4,000 refugees from Laos. **********Mr. Hartling said the United Nations agency considered a resettlement program a success when 80 percent of those involved were satisfied with their new lives, a criterion that he said had been met among the Vietnamese here. **********But he acknowledged that soundings taken by the international agency indicated that about 20 percent of the refugees remained unhappy, with a large number still requesting transfer to other countries, mainly the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada or France. **********The refugees are concentrated in four Chinese provinces, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian and Jiangxi, and in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Many were formerly city dwellers and find adjustment to the rural life difficult, according to officials in the United Nations office here. **********Efforts Are Praised **********Mr. Hartling spoke highly of the efforts made by China to help the refugees integrate. He said the greatest success so far had been at the port of Beihai on the Gulf of Tonkin, in the Guangxi Zhuang region, where 11,000 refugee fishermen have been established as trawlermen. **********''They have the same work, they have the same pay, they have the same social and other facilities,'' Mr. Hartling said. ''They are certainly not discriminated against.'' **********But Mr. Hartling and other United Nations officials said a major point of friction had been China's strict birth control policies and the failure of many refugee families to observe them. **********According to the United Nations officials, China places no impediment in the way of refugees seeking to settle elsewhere, but there are few offers from the countries where the refugees would like to settle. So far, only 1,300 have left China, and several hundred others are marooned in a transit camp at Fangcheng in the Guangxi Zhuang region. Mr. Hartling said ''a handful'' had returned to Vietnam."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/world/around-the-world-greek-paper-charged-with-printing-secrets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Greek Paper Charged With Printing Secrets", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Greek Paper Charged With Printing Secrets", "body_text": " **********A pro-Government Greek paper was prosecuted today for publishing two documents on an espionage case that the public prosecutor said revealed The editor of the newspaper, Eleftherotypia, was charged with publishing two top secret documents that the newspaper said were sent by the head of Greek intelligence, Lieut.

Its home is in Columbus, Ohio, at a new research park adjacent to Ohio State University, which this fall is introducing a doctoral program in welding engineering. **********Both developments signify the changing times for manufacturing, as well as the growing importance of new welding techniques. **********''We're the first tenant'' at the park, Ronald C. Reeve, the institute's director, said last week. ''This was founded by Battelle Memorial Institute, the State of Ohio and the university, as well as the Welding Institute in Cambridge, England.'' **********Edison's location has a logic of its own: Ohio is the center for a large amount of industry involved with steel use, tire making and other manufacturing. Companies in the area include Cincinnati Milacron, a large producer of robots, Hobart Brothers, maker of welding equipment and welding supplies, and Lincoln Electric. In fact, one of the originators of the welding engineering program that began at the university in 1947 was the late James F. Lincoln, founder of Lincoln Electric. **********While the British welding organization, with its 550 employees, has been known as the world leader for welding research, Edison hopes to emulate it with support from about 100 corporate members like General Electric, International Business Machines, General Dynamics and Exxon, as well as smaller companies. Several visiting Britons are among the 40 Edison staff members busy at research. **********Mr. Reeve says Ohio State has the ''only degreed welding engineering program in the country at the undergraduate level.'' By this he means that many other engineering schools like the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Arizona and the Colorado School of Mines offer welding courses as specialties, but Ohio State says it offers the only bachelor's degree in welding engineering. It also has a master's degree program, as do others. **********Now Ohio State has taken the logical next step - a doctoral degree program in welding engineering that it says is the first in the nation. **********Far removed from the acetylene torch used in auto repair shops, welding engineering involves many specialties such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronics, industrial engineering, and the use of exotic alloys, ceramics and polymers. **********In fact, even the 10 professors in Ohio State's welding engineering department offer a wide variety of backgrounds - materials, aerospace, theoretical and applied mechanics. **********Dr. Karl F. Graff, who heads the welding engineering department at Ohio State, says the welding students get plenty of ''hands-on experience,'' along with their study of new ways of bonding materials like micro bonding and the use of lasers to weld. One example of a welding engineer's job might be designing, changing and attaching a new arm for a robot used to weld components moving along an assembly line. **********A growing need for welding engineers is in the robotic field, and Dr. Graff distinguishes their skills from those of robotic engineers. ''When one uses robotics in welding, it probably is best if the engineer knows welding first and then learns the robotics,'' he said. ''He can do that faster than an engineer who knows robotics engineering but has little knowledge of welding.'' **********Ohio State has 160 students majoring in welding engineering, plus 50 working toward master's degrees or a doctorate, according to Dr. Graff, who recalls that a decade ago enrollment numbered about 40. **********''We view welding as an important part of manufacturing.'' Dr. Graff said. In fact, the new interest in the field probably reflects the emphasis on productivity to regain competitiveness with foreign manufacturers. **********''Production in the manufacturing area involving joining of materials has become so important,'' Dr. Graff said. ''Industry needs faster and more reliable production methods.'' A sign of the changing times is that Ohio State's bachelor's degree holders in welding engineering receive offers of around $29,000 a year. **********Dr. Graff said that the typical mechanical engineer with a master's degree in welding might go into design-related jobs such as designing welded structures. The electrical engineer with a master's degree in welding might take jobs related to controls and processes, and the physics major might focus on testing of welded materials. **********Welding experts do research in many fields. For example, at Ohio State, Dr. Laszlo Adler, a professor of welding engineering, uses ultrasonics to detect hidden flaws inside objects. The hope is that computerized ultrasonic scanning devices might replace quality control inspectors, testing every component instead of just random ones, thus saving money by improving quality."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/09/business/dunlop-and-btr-reach-an-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dunlop and BTR Reach an Accord", "print_headline": "Dunlop and BTR Reach an Accord", "body_text": " **********Dunlop Holdings P.L.C. and BTR P.L.C. said that they had reached agreement on an increased offer by BTR for Dunlop.

The customers consist mostly of savings and loan associations and small banks across the country. **********Mr. Sorkin also alleged that Bevill, Bresler, a large regional securities dealer that opened in 1972 and is based in Livingston, N.J., had engaged in fraud by hiding its unhealthy financial condition from customers. **********Situation Unresolved **********The situation remained largely unresolved tonight after a hearing in Federal District Court before Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise. There will be another hearing early Tuesday to determine whether any Bevill, Bresler units will be allowed to continue in business, whether they will be placed under bankruptcy protection or be put into receivership. **********The Bevill, Bresler group of companies consists of five securities units: Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corporation; Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Government Securities Inc.; Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc.; BBS Government Securities Group Inc., and BBS Securities Group Inc. **********The events began Sunday morning when Bevill, Bresler's officers called a meeting with officials of the S.E.C., the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National Association of Securities Dealers, according to Jonathan L. Goldstein, an attorney for Bevill, Bresler. **********The company's officers told the government regulators that one of the units, Asset Management Corporation, could not meet its obligations as they fell due. While conceding that the unit should be moved into bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Goldstein said, the company's officers sought to keep a healthier unit, Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc., operating as a way of trying to pay off the other unit's customers. **********Late Sunday night, a voluntary petition was filed under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code for Asset Management, while the other units remained in business. **********However, this morning that petition was challenged by the S.E.C. The agency sought to have Asset Management put into receivership because of what it said was risk to its customers if it were allowed to remain in operation under bankruptcy code protection, Mr. Sorkin said. **********In a second hearing late today, the S.E.C. alleged that another unit, Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Government Securities, suffered heavy losses from its securities trading. It put the losses in the millions, but said that the precise amount was not known. Borrowings by the Asset Management unit from its customers were used to finance these losses, according to the S.E.C. **********Asset Management operated in the unregulated Government securities business. Most of its business consisted of repurchase agreements, or repos, in which it sold securities to customers and agreed to purchase them back at a set future date for a set price. These were, in effect, loans to the securities company. It also conducted reverse repos, where securities were bought from customers, with an agreement to sell them back at a set price on a future date. **********Repos and reverse repos are a common and accepted form of transaction. These are also the kinds of transaction engaged in by E.S.M. Government Securities Inc., the Florida- based company whose collapse last month is expected to cost its customers more than $300 million in losses. **********In fact, there have been some links between E.S.M. and Bevill, Bresler. Two of E.S.M.'s three founders - Ronald Ewton and George Mead - formerly worked for Bevill, Bresler, according to records they filed with the State of Florida. E.S.M.'s records show Andrew Dale Ledbetter, a principal officer and an owner of Bevill, Bresler, formerly worked for E.S.M. **********As of tonight, Judge Debevoise said that he would put BBS Government Securities Group Inc., parent company for the Asset Management unit, and Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Government Securities, into receivership.

Mr. Vraciu said it was ''of no architectural value and insalubrious.'' **********Reports of destructive remodeling of old city centers have also been received from the provinces. Some villages were reported to have been put on notice that they would be razed to create more arable land. **********The projects, which contrast with a general policy of stark austerity in meeting citizens' basic needs, are ascribed by Rumanians and diplomats to Mr. Ceausescu's striving to place his personal stamp on all Rumania, in what is being officially called the ''Ceausescu Epoch.'' Choirs, broadcasters and writers maintain an almost continuous chorus in praise of the President, 67 years old. **********A great variety of his books, bearing such titles as ''Militant Solidarity With All Democratic and Progressive Forces for a Better and Juster World,'' fill store shelves otherwise poorly supplied because of a paper shortage.

Tappan Jr., chairman. **********Appearing before Wall Street analysts in New York, Mr. Tappan said the company's engineering and construction business was recovering from a low point a year ago, but was not expected to be profitable until sometime in 1986. Fluor is one of the nation's largest engineering and construction companies. **********Industry analysts said the size of the write-offs was higher than anticipated, but most hailed the move as a pragmatic step toward putting the faltering company on more solid financial footing. **********'Change Was Needed' **********''What they are doing is excellent,'' said William G. Siedenburg, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''It is a firm recognition that change was needed.'' **********The write-offs would reduce Fluor's stockholders' equity to about $1.2 billion, or a book value of about $15.13 a share. Fluor's shares closed unchanged at $15.75 today in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The company, which has an agreement to sell its oil and gas unit for $190 million, and is trying to sell a portion of its substantial coal holdings, said some of the write-downs were related to the reduced market value of those properties. Among some other businesses, Mr. Tappan said the company hopes to find a buyer, by year-end, for a portion of its 50 percent stake in the Massey Coal Company, which is co-owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. **********In additon, Mr. Tappan told reporters that ''about one-third'' of the $410 million, or about $137 million, was attributed to the write-off of good will recorded when Fluor acquired the St. Joe Minerals Company for $2.2 billion in 1981. Good will is an accounting term indicating the premium paid above the listed net worth of an asset. **********Lead Prices Are Low **********Mr. Tappan said that part of the write-off was related specifically to St. Joe's lead business. Mr. Siedenburg of Smith Barney said that lead prices have remained surprisingly depressed in recent weeks, despite the lower value of the dollar and declining inventories. The lower dollar is expected to raise the costs of imports, making domestically produced lead more competitive. **********The company said another portion of the write-off was related to the early prepayment of long-term debt. Fluor's long-term debt will be less than $300 million at the end of its 1985 fiscal year, or below 20 percent of its total capitalization. A Fluor spokesman, Rick Maslin, said the company was ''comfortable'' with that ratio. **********Fluor has steadily reduced its long-term debt since Mr. Tappan became chairman last September, after the death of J. Robert Fluor. The debt total, which exceeded $1.1 billion after the St. Joe acquisition in 1981, stood at $487.3 million at the end of July, down from $724.8 million at the end of Fluor's 1984 fiscal year. **********Cash Reserves Increased **********At the same time, Fluor has increased its cash reserves by selling various operations. Deborah L. Thielsch, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation, said Fluor should increase its cash and liquid assets to ''a minimum'' of $250 million at the end of January 1986, compared with $128 million at the end of July. ''Their financial position is much improved,'' she said. **********The company's operating losses are continuing, Mr. Tappan said, because of a prolonged coal strike, company reorganizations, severance payments for early retirement and other one-time realignment costs. Mr. Maslin said operating losses in the fourth quarter would be about $40 million. **********Fluor lost $81.9 million in the first three quarters, before recording a $55.7 million gain on the sale and leaseback of its corporate headquarters in Irvine, Calif. **********Fluor flourished during the oil boom of the late 1970's. It had a major presence in the Middle East, as a designer and builder of huge refineries, petrochemical plants and other large complexes. **********Daniel Unit Is Profitable **********Its oil-related business has yet to recover from the industry's two-year-old slump, although its domestic construction arm, the Daniel International Corporation, has maintained a steady increase in orders and is profitable, Miss Thielsch said. **********A few major construction companies, such as the Ralph M. Parsons Company and the Morrison Knudsen Company, remained profitable through the industry's slump, largely by avoiding the trouble spots that have affected Fluor. **********Mr. Maslin said the company did not anticipate addition layoffs from its present worldwide employment of 29,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/13/world/around-the-world-tanzanian-leader-says-he-will-step-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Tanzanian Leader Says He Will Step Down", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Tanzanian Leader Says He Will Step Down", "body_text": " **********President Julius K.

That afternoon, he said, he had killed a colonel in the Philippine Constabulary. **********''That colonel was responsible for the death of two comrades, so he had to die,'' said the rebel, a member of the Communist insurgency, the New People's Army, which is waging a growing guerrilla war against the Government of Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********''This kind of killing doesn't bother me because it is justice,'' said the rebel, known as Ka Totoy. **********Son of Impoverished Farmer **********Ka Totoy, 21 years old, is the son of an impoverished tenant farmer. His ruthless attitude toward killing seemed representative of that of dozens of rebels interviewed during a six-day journey with the guerrillas in the Bicol region of southeastern Luzon. **********To him, the movement he has joined promises a new deal for the have-nots in a feudal agricultural system with little social mobility. His notion of Communism does not go much beyond a call for a more equitable sharing of wealth. **********But with the expansion of the guerrilla movement have come reports that the rebels extort money from villagers and that this has led to a decline in support for the guerrillas. **********The Philippine Government places the rebel force at 10,000 to 12,000, about twice the estimate it had just a year ago; the Communists say they have more than 20,000 armed fighters. **********Regardless of the exact count, officials in Manila and Washington have expressed increasing alarm at the rapid growth of the insurgency. **********''The N.P.A. is winning - it's that simple,'' said a Western diplomat in Manila whose specialty is military affairs. ''They aren't about to overthrow the Government now. But if the tide is not turned over the next three to five years, the Communists could be unstoppable.'' **********Perhaps more significant than the growth in the rebels' fighting force is the extent of the group's influence or control in provincial areas as described by some village residents, businessmen, farm owners and poor farmers themselves. **********The Philippine Government maintains that the rebels have a hold on only 4 percent of the villages in the country; Western diplomats estimate that the rebels control 20 percent or more. One Filipino businessman, reflecting views expressed by several others in the Bicol region, estimated that the Communists' shadow governments, called ''barrio revolutionary councils,'' control about 50 percent of the neighborhoods in many towns. **********For his part, President Marcos has branded the rebels ''plain criminals, bandits or bored young people seeking adventure.'' He has repeatedly said the Government is in control of the problem, and has vowed to ''keep the rebels running until we run them to the ground in the next few months.'' **********He added that the Government would soon ''put an end to the insurgency once and for all.'' **********The President's view that the insurgency can be quickly squelched is not shared by Philippine or Western diplomats who specialize in military matters. But there are signs that in some areas of the country, the rebel group is experiencing problems of its own. **********Civilians in the Crossfire **********As the insurgency has expanded its operations, there have been reports of forced taxation, sabotage and the killing of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire between the guerrillas and the military. Many Filipinos, even persistent critics of the Government, say they suspect the insurgency will change in character as it grows. **********''Once the N.P.A. reaches a critical mass in an area, it looks like they start flexing their muscles,'' said Jaime V. Ongpin, a leading businessman and a Marcos opponent. **********Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, Acting Chief of Staff of the armed forces, has said the rebels are probably financing firearms procurement from abroad through various international contacts. But he said the Philippine military had not found evidence of support from any foreign government. **********Poor farmers, whose homes are generally bamboo huts without electricity or plumbing, are the foundation of the insurgents' support. Typically, the farmers who are rebel sympathizers have only seen one form of Government presence - the military on patrol. All were asked if the Government had ever done anything for them. ''Nothing whatsoever,'' most replied. In a break with the doctrinaire leftist approach that undermined its popular support in the 1970's, the New People's Army is now also making a concerted effort to garner sympathizers from among business executives, professionals and even some landlords. **********As the economy has worsened, law and order has deteriorated and military abuses have continued, many middle-class Filipinos have become more and more disaffected with the Marcos Government and have become receptive to the more radical alternative offered by the rebels. **********''I am a sympathizer because I believe this is the only alternative,'' said a 38-year-old attorney from Legaspi, about 210 miles southeast of Manila in Albay Province. **********The rebels' resort to violence, according to these sympathizers, is justified because, they say, the Marcos Government retains its hold on power through the violence practiced by the military, which tripled to roughly 200,000 troops after martial law was declared in 1972. **********The appeal of the rebels in the countryside is that they have often proved effective in dealing with local problems and improving the living conditions of the poor. **********''We're doing,'' said Ka Tibo, a 35-year-old rebel, ''what the Government ought to be doing.'' **********All the rebels have adopted a nom de guerre. The ''ka'' comes from ''kasama,'' the Tagalog word for comrade or companion. A first name or a Filipino nickname follows. **********A 44-year-old farmer, working about 12 acres of land in Albay Province, said he first saw the New People's Army in 1980, when about 30 armed guerrillas came by. At first, the farmer said, who identified himself only as Erning, he was frightened since he had never seen men carrying M-16 rifles before. **********But he said his fears subsided when they assured him they were there to assist him with whatever difficulties he faced. Erning said he told them that robbers regularly seized more than one-fourth of his coconut crop. He was defenseless against the raiding parties, he said, and the police never came to his remote farm. **********Today, the farmer said, he has no such problems. ''I never see the robbers anymore because they are afraid of the N.P.A.,'' he said. ''The N.P.A. has been very helpful to me.'' **********In this predominantly coconut-growing region, the big farms are typically worked by tenants, who are paid with a share of the crop. Traditionally, the sharecropping arrangement gives the landlord two-thirds of the yield and the tenant one-third. **********When the New People's Army controls an area, according to the rebels and residents, the shares are reversed and the tenant gets two-thirds of the crop. One manager of a big farm said that in the area he was familiar with, about 90 percent of the farms now practice the rebel-enforced brand of sharecropping. **********''There's no real choice,'' the farm manager said. ''It's take one-third or nothing. In this area, the N.P.A. is stronger than the Government.'' **********In one province, a 28-year-old tenant farmer, who was the beneficiary of rebels' agrarian policies three years ago, said, ''Because of this N.P.A. reform, we have uplifted our family.'' **********With the additional income from the crop, the farmer said, he was able last year to build a three-room house of concrete blocks with a cement floor. It replaced a smaller bamboo and thatch home with a dirt floor. **********Why People Join the Rebels **********Interviews with the rebels indicate that their reasons for joining the movement vary. Ka Marte, a 30-year-old rebel officer, said he had been picked up by the military for being a suspected Communist supporter in 1974 and was tortured and beaten before being released. ''I came to know then that there was no other solution than what I am doing now,'' he said. **********But most rebels seem to have joined because of what they describe as a belief in the need for a new social order, a commitment generally to the principles espoused by the movement and a desire to give direction to their lives. **********''The N.P.A. is my family now and the movement is my religion,'' said Ka Andy, a 19-year-old member of the urban guerrilla units of the New People's Army. **********Rebel leaders say that it takes one to two years of screening, ideological preparation and training before someone will be welcomed as a member of the insurgent group. ''We need to arm them ideologically and organizationally,'' said Ka Oggie. **********The rebels' clothes are largely military fatigues, but there is no uniform. The shoe of the revolution, judging from this group of guerrillas, appears to be the black high-topped Converse All Star basketball sneaker. One rebel was carefully drying his ''I Love Las Vegas'' T-shirt. Another young Communist was humming the Madonna hit song ''Material Girl.'' **********What the Rebels Believe **********The essence of the rebel ideology is that there are three ''root causes'' for the troubles of the Philippines: first, imperialism, defined as the influence of the United States and its purported agents of neocolonial domination, like the International Monetary Fund; second, bureaucrat capitalism, in which Government officials, working closely with the United States Government and multinational corporations, enrich themselves at the expense of the Filipino people; and third, feudalism, the system in which the elites, especially farm owners, maintain themselves by oppressing tenants. **********In their teach-ins, the Communist armed propoganda units link these three purported evils to local difficulties such as rural poverty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/01/world/jamaica-struggling-to-meet-fund-goal-for-youth-festival.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAMAICA STRUGGLING TO MEET FUND GOAL FOR YOUTH FESTIVAL", "print_headline": "JAMAICA STRUGGLING TO MEET FUND GOAL FOR YOUTH FESTIVAL", "body_text": " **********With encouragement from the Reagan Administration, Jamaica is organizing an international youth conference and festival for early April as a show of solidarity among young people in the non-Communist world. **********But the event, which Jamaican officials say ''stands in stark contrast'' to youth festivals regularly sponsored by the Soviet Union, is in financial trouble and is going to have to be significantly reduced in scale if $5 million is not raised in the next eight weeks. **********This week, Jamaican officials have been trying to obtain money and services for the event from businessmen and entertainers in the United States and from governments and foundations in Europe and West Africa. They are also trying to sell the television rights to the festival, which is to include several popular and classical music concerts, dance presentations and a film competition. **********About $2 Million Raised **********Jamaican officials say the conference and festival, which grew out of discussions two years ago in Vienna on how to mark 1985 as the International Youth Year designated by the United Nations, are expected to cost about $7 million. The United Nations is helping to distribute invitations to the conference, the officials said, but it is not helping with expenses. **********Olivia Grange, the deputy chairman of the organizing committee for the conference and festival, said Jamaica had raised about $2 million, including $1 million from the United States and $100,000 from West Germany. **********''The event is in trouble,'' she said. ''If we don't get the money, it won't be truly international. We would have lost the impact.'' **********About 1,200 young people from more than 100 democratic countries as well as exiles and dissidents from Poland, other Eastern bloc countries, Chile and South Africa have been invited to the four-day conference to discuss ''major world questions and problems confronting democracy.'' Heads of state from several African and Latin American countries have been invited to speak. **********Hopes of Selling 6,000 Tickets **********Jamaica hopes that another 6,000 young visitors will buy tickets to the festival, which is to run from April 1 to April 9. That period encompasses the conference, which is to begin on April 6. **********''This is the first time that the free world has invited youths from all over to have an international conference,'' Prime Minister Edward P. G. Seaga, who is perhaps the closest ally the Reagan Administration has in the Caribbean, said in an interview. ''This is something that has been the domain of Communists,'' he continued.

Miss Grange, who is one of Mr. Seaga's closest aides, has been in New York since last Sunday, trying to raise funds and sign up entertainers to perform without charge at the festival. **********At the same time, Errol Anderson, a former Minister of Youth in Jamaica and the chairman of the organizing committee for the event, has been on a fund-raising trip to Europe and West Africa.

''It was amazing to make alcohol, and then drink it,'' Mr. Reich recalled. **********And it didn't stop there. ''If I could make it,'' he reasoned at the time, ''why not sell it?'' **********That was the beginning of New Amsterdam Amber Beer, an all-malt lager that has been selling nicely since it made its appearance in New York in October 1982. In that time, it has achieved a reputation as a beer for connoisseurs, a beer that wins prizes at Great American Beer Festivals and is available only at places such as Joanna and Texarkana and the very best delis. It has also secured a niche as the city's only indigenous beer - a mark of Mr. Reich's marketing savvy, as the beer is actually brewed upstate in Utica. **********This June, however, Mr. Reich's company, the Old New York Beer Company, which has had its headquarters in a converted warehouse in Manhattan's meat district, will open its own brewery at 11th Avenue and 46th Street. That is ideally situated, Mr. Reich said, near the new convention center as well as the Circle Line, and should pull in lots of tourists for the free tours he plans, modeled on the Heineken brewery in Amsterdam. **********The new brewery will be able to produce 30,000 barrels a year, a capacity Mr. Reich does not expect to reach until 1990. This year he expects to produce 9,000 barrels. That puts Old New York Beer among the top ranks of micro-breweries, but minuscule compared with the brands of Miller and Anheuser-Busch. Budweiser, as Mr. Reich notes, sold 260,000 cases in an hour. ''My annual production is what Bud makes in 15 minutes,'' he said. Last year, he sold 7,000 barrels, or 85,000 cases, of New Amsterdam beer, and earned about $50,000 on sales of $1.2 million. **********Like his kitchen chemistry, Mr. Reich's career is based largely on happenstance. In 1971, as a college student in Boston, he became active in the food co-operative movement - ''a liberal economic concept, which I don't believe in anymore.'' But before he lost the faith, he went to Rumania to attend a conference on food co-ops, and spent a week in France discovering Pernod, champagne, Beaujolais. ''I said, 'This is phenomenal stuff,' '' he recalled. **********Back in New York as a lending officer at Citibank, he taught a wine-tasting course. One of his students was an executive at Hearst Magazines. Mr. Reich said he wanted to start a food and wine magazine, and the executive recruited him to the business side of the company. **********A year later, however, there was no new magazine, and Mr. Reich was feeling a yen to run his own company. When he dabbled successfully with homemade beer, he said, ''I decided, let's make beer and sell it.'' He put together a limited partnership, mostly of friends, and invested $10,000 of his own. He hired one of the nation's leading brewmasters, Dr. Joseph L. Owades, who is director of the Center for Brewing Studies in Boston and an international consultant on brewing techniques. They lined up brewing capacity at the West End Brewing Company in Utica. **********And they developed a beer, based largely on Mr. Reich's own taste for full-bodied beers such as Britain's Bass and Whitbread ales. New Amsterdam, in the words of its founder, ''has a distinctive fruity and almost spicy aroma'' and a ''full-bodied flavor as complex as vintage wine.'' **********Most major American beers mix rice or corn with malt to create a lighter beverage; New Amsterdam is made entirely from malt and has a high hop content. It is not for the six-pack drinker, Mr. Reich readily admitted. Turning the Schaefer slogan around, he said, ''It's the beer to have if you're having one. With dinner.'' **********IF his venture into beer was accidental, New Amsterdam's success was not. Mr. Reich set out with a marketing strategy to go after upscale restaurants - Joe Allen's, Carolina, the Quilted Giraffe - where young upwardly mobile professionals had been ordering imported beer. ''This is Yuppie beer, I guess,'' he said. ''Yuppies drink it. We sell in SoHo, TriBeCa, the West Side, all the bars on Third Avenue.'' **********Bottles of New Amsterdam, each with a tag with Mr. Reich's name and a description of the beer, are now available in 350 restaurants in Manhattan; 107 carry it on draft. The toniest supermarkets and delicatessens stock it, for as much as $9 for a six-pack. Thanks partly to New York Air, which used up 6,000 cases last year, the beer has found a market in 22 other states, and other states are clamoring for supplies. ''We've always managed to sell a lot of beer,'' Mr. Reich said. **********To finance the Manhattan brewery, Mr. Reich has raised $2.2 million from venture capitalists, and reduced to 25 percent his own stake in the company. His crusade is to turn New York into a brewery town, he said, the way it used to be in the 1800's, when the city had 121 breweries. The last of those - operated by the F&M Schaefer Brewing Company - closed in 1976. (''Remember Miss Rheingold?'' Mr. Reich asked nostalgically.) He is delighted when veteran bartenders tell him that New Amsterdam tastes like Trommer's, a New York beer that went out of business 30 years ago. **********He poured a glass of New Amsterdam, and sipped with satisfaction. A companion suggested that the taste was a trifle strong. ''That's how I like it,'' he said. ''That's what American beer used to taste like.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/12/business/business-people-chase-ohio-appoints-president.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chase Ohio Appoints President", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Chase Ohio Appoints President", "body_text": " **********Richard C.

The affidavit was part of a suit filed by Peabody against Mr. Posner's company last week. **********In a statement issued yesterday, Mr. Posner called Mr. Begel's statements ''pure fabrication.'' He said, ''There is no truth at all to those statements.'' **********Kurt Katz, Peabody's president, said he had never heard of Mr. Posner's supposed offer before it was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. He said that Mr. Posner had been trying to obtain a premium payment for his shares in Peabody to vote them in favor of the Pullman-Peabody merger. ''He wanted greenmail if you will, or preferential treatment if he went along with our deal,'' Mr. Katz said.  If it is determined that the offer was made, it could pose serious legal problems for Mr. Posner, according to securities lawyers. **********''If the chief executives of those companies were making decisions on the basis of offers of $10 million or the receipt personally of such sums without informing their shareholders that those payments were behind their actions, that raises potentially serious disclosure problems,'' said one Government regulator. He added that Mr. Begel's affidavit might be regarded as public disclosure on the part of Pullman. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission would not comment on whether it was investigating. **********Posner Investment in Peabody **********The Chesapeake Financial Corporation, one of Mr. Posner's investment vehicles, was spurned in April 1984 when it made a $124.6 million merger offer for Peabody, a diversified industrial company involved in the energy, pollution control and other businesses. Chesapeake said in an S.E.C. filing last week that it owned slightly less than 35 percent of Peabody, but intended to increase that to more than 50 percent. **********In June last year Peabody agreed to merge with Pullman, a manufacturing company based in Princeton, N.J., that had been well known as a manufacturer of rail cars before selling that business. The deal involves a swap of preferred stock valued at $127 million that would leave Pullman with about 45 percent control over the merged company. Mr. Posner's company would end up with about 15 percent of the merged company, to be called Pullman-Peabody. Pullman is about 30 percent owned by the Signal Companies. **********The shareholders of the two companies must still vote on the merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/27/world/around-the-world-senate-panel-restores-funds-for-soviet-studies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  SENATE PANEL RESTORES FUNDS FOR SOVIET STUDIES", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   SENATE PANEL RESTORES FUNDS FOR SOVIET STUDIES", "body_text": " **********The Senate agreed this week to restore $4.8 million for a State Department program that provides grants to American scholars for research on Soviet and Eastern European affairs. **********Money for the year-old program had been deleted by the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this month as it tried to keep a measure appropriating $12 billion for the Justice, State and Commerce Departments in line with spending targets set in the budget resolution for the 1986 fiscal year. **********The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Richard G.

Prices rose almost a point early in the day on reports of large purchases by securities firms, then fell quickly after the Treasury's announced bidding results showing that demand was good, but not as strong as rumored. **********The new 10 5/8 percent bonds due in 2015 sold with an average yield of 10.66 percent, well below the 10.82 percent yield quoted for the issue last Friday. By late in the day, the new bonds were offered with a yield of 10.67 percent, up from the mid-afternoon low yield of 10.61 percent. **********Money Supply Up $1.3 Billion **********With attention focused on the auctions and sales of the Treasury's new notes and bonds, the Federal Reserve's late afternoon announcement of a $1.3 billion rise in the nation's basic money supply, to $596.7 billion in the week ended July 29, had little effect on rates. **********Major Treasury financings are always a time of tension in the credit markets, especially when the outlook for interest rates is as unclear as it is now. The fear of higher interest rates later this year caused note and bond yields to rise about half a percentage point between July 5 and the end of the month, but those yields began to decline the past week as securities firms started soliciting orders for the Treasury's auctions of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds totaling a record $21.75 billion. **********''The jury is still out on the direction of rates this year, and the dealers still have large inventories, but it seems that yields were high enough to attract good demand at the auctions,'' said one government securities dealer. The 9 1/2 percent three-year notes sold Tuesday at an average of about 99 30/32, to yield 9.53 percent, but were offered late yesterday at 100 1/4, to yield 9.40 percent. The 10 1/2 percent 10-year notes sold Wednesday at about 99 13/32, to yield 10.60 percent, but were offered late yesterday at 100 6/32, to yield 10.47 percent. **********Victor Chang, a managing director at Ehrlich-Bober Government Securities, noted that the outlook for the economy holds the key to future changes in rates. Although Federal Reserve officials said in mid-July that they expected economic growth to rebound to a 4 percent rate or more in the second half ''it is not clear from July's data that the rebound will materialize.'' **********Buyers' Outlook on Economy **********In general, aggresssive buyers of Treasury notes and bonds expect the economy to remain weak and interest rates to fall, while those who have shunned the Treasury auctions expect that the economy will strengthen and interest rates will rise. Foreign investors - who have absorbed a large part of the Treasury's offerings in the past few years - are also worried that the dollar will continue to weaken in foreign exchange markets, thereby reducing the value of their investments. **********''I would say that Japanese buying was very moderate'' at the bond auction, and less than the amounts bought at 30-year auctions earlier this year, said Atsushi Saitoh, executive vice president at Nomura Securities International. ''Japanese investors have many of the same worries as American investors'' Mr. Saitoh said, adding that ''everybody is puzzled about the direction of U.S. interest rates and the dollar.'' **********Gen Yamaguchi, assistant vice-president at the Nikko Securities Company International, estimated that Japanese securities firms bought roughly $1 billion of the 30-year bonds, ''or not as much as the street expected.'' **********While Japanse investors seemed to be wary, but still willing to buy sizable amounts of bonds, their counterparts in Europe were more cautious, analysts said. Gary Klesch, president of Quadrex Securities, a London firm, said demand in Europe for dollar denominated bonds was very weak, because of fears that interest rates might rise. He noted that in the past two weeks there has been a dearth of Eurobond issues denominated in dollars, but many issues denominated in other currencies. **********Several market participants said that a few Japanese firms - particularly Nomura and Daiwa Securities America - were especially willing to increase their participation in the auction in order to enhance the prospects of their being designated as ''primary'' dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********Although the level of the M-1 basic money supply measure - consisting of currency and all kinds of checking accounts - remains above the Fed's growth target of 3 percent to 8 percent for the second half of the year, analsyts do not discern any significant moves by the central bank to reduce money supply growth by tightening credit policy and raising interest rates. **********They noted that the Fed has not made reserves scarcer in the banking system, and that financial institutions are borrowing between $400 million and $500 million daily at the Fed discount window, a level that is not much different from the early months of this year. **********Some traders have been worried by a trend toward higher rates for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market - a closely watched benchmark for other short-term rates. In June, the overnight rate averaged 7.53 percent, rising to 7.88 percent in July and 7.92 percent in the first seven days of August. **********''The rise in the Federal funds rate does not represent a tightening by the Fed so much as the cessation of its easing moves,'' said Mr. Chang, of Ehrlich-Bober. He said the Fed has not made bank reserves scarcer, but the pattern with which reserves are supplied has been altered enough to put upward pressure on the rate. The June average rate in the Federal funds market was depressed, he noted, by an aberration early in the month when funds were trading around 7 1/4 percent or lower, and some traders mistakenly predicted that the Fed would soon take overt measures to reduce interest rates further. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price#99.686 Average Yield#10.66% Low Price#99.508 High Yield#10.68% High Price#99.865 Low Yield#10.64% Accepted at low#91% Total applied for$15,031,547 Accepted$6,500,901 N.Y. applied for$13,519,599 N.Y. accepted$5,996,254 Noncompetitive$464,000 The 30-year bonds mature Aug. 15, 2015."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/05/business/the-big-winners-in-the-phillips-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1985-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 923, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE BIG WINNERS IN THE PHILLIPS DEAL", "print_headline": "THE BIG WINNERS IN THE PHILLIPS DEAL", "body_text": " **********Although the Phillips Petroleum Company is escaping with its independence intact, the view on Wall Street is that the real winners in the fight for control of the Oklahoma oil giant were Carl C. Icahn, T. Boone Pickens and the Phillips shareholders.  By forcing Phillips to sweeten its offer to shareholders, Mr. Icahn proved that he and T. Boone Pickens are an effective one- two punch. Even among those on Wall Street who have not been fans of either, there was unqualified admiration for their ability to come out ahead - and improve the lot of all Phillips shareholders in the process. **********''Carl Icahn forced Phillips to improve its deal,'' despite all the roadblocks it threw in his way, one Wall Street arbitrager said. In the process, Phillips also offered to kick in up to $25 million to pay for Mr. Icahn's expenses. ''He got a better deal for everybody; he's entitled to it,'' another trader said. **********Under the new plan , Phillips is offering to swap a $4.5 billion package of debt securities for about 50 percent of the outstanding shares. It also would authorize distribution of $300 million of a new preferred class of stock as an extra dividend on the remaining common shares, and it would increase the annual stock dividend to $3 a share. **********Mr. Pickens, a Texas oilman who is chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, took the first shot at Phillips, forcing it to agree to a recapitalization plan. Then Mr. Icahn, a financier, stepped in and contended it was not enough. Both men hammered home the theme that shareholders deserved better. In the end, the shareholders agreed by voting down the Phillips recapitalization plan and forcing the company's hand. **********The Phillips takeover battle was closely watched, not just because of its size and drama, but because it carried a message for all companies whose stocks are trading well below what they could realize by selling their assets piecemeal. **********Raiders May Be Encouraged **********As Wall Street sees it, the Phillips settlement is likely to encourage corporate raiders such as Mr. Pickens and Mr. Icahn to search for similar companies. It also demonstrated that a company should not try to convince its shareholders of one thing when a savvy marketplace will say another. **********Phillips, for instance, contended that the original recapitalization plan was worth the same $53 it had guaranteed to Mr. Pickens for his acquiesence last December. But by voting it down last week, shareholders - including many professional money managers - were, in effect, saying they knew better - that it was probably worth the $48 or so that was the Wall Street consensus. **********With Carl Icahn willing to offer a deal that was worth $55 a share, there was little surprise that shareholders held out. The deal they will receive under the new exchange offer of debt for equity is estimated by analysts to be worth from $53.50 a share to $56 or more, depending on whose arithmetic is used. William C. Douce, the company's chairman, said yesterday that the package is worth $56 to $57 a share. Thus, Mr. Icahn will improve the value of the 154 million Phillips shares by anywhere from $750 million to well over $1 billion. **********The Biggest Winners **********Those Phillips shareholders who stayed for the duration clearly are the biggest winners. Phillips stock was languishing in the mid-to-upper $30 range before Mr. Pickens began his assault last fall. That the new Phillips offer is considered a more appropriate level was seen in the trading action of Phillips's stock yesterday, which traded as high as $50.75 and closed at $49.875, up 50 cents for the day. Even more important, the new market for the Phillips bonds that will be issued in the exchange offer to shareholders was positive, with all three bonds trading above par on a when-issued basis. **********Mr. Icahn and his group of investors, who purchased a 7.5 million share stake to start their bid, will be ahead by at least $50 million, according to Wall Street traders. **********Mr. Pickens has the option of proceeding with his previously agreed upon deal to sell his 8.9 million shares shares to Phillips for $53 a share, or of taking the new Phillips offer. Under the $53-a-share deal, his company, Mesa, would be reimbursed for up to $25 million in expenses, and would pocket $89 milllion in pretax profits. **********Arbitragers had the bumpiest ride of all. When Phillips was put ''in play'' by Mr. Pickens - as the ''arbs'' refer to a takeover bid - the price of Phillips shares zoomed to above $55. Most arbitragers came in in the $52 to $56 range, say Wall Street traders, and do not stand to make a killing on the new Phillips offer. When Mr. Pickens agreed to the recapitalization plan, Phillips stock plummeted below $45, burning many arbitragers. They say they are glad to realize some profit - even small - under the new Phillips offer. **********'I'm Thrilled' **********''I'm thrilled over the new deal,'' said one arbitrager who had bought more Phillips stock when it dropped. He figures the Phillips shares, after the exchange offer is completed, will trade at $40 or more, based on what oil companies with similar debt structures and dividends trade at. **********Phillips will be taking on more than $4 billion in new debt to complete the new offer to shareholders. But it will also be selling off $2 billion in assets to reduce debt. Analysts said its new debt structure would not be onerous."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/25/world/around-the-world-greeks-quit-nato-unit-over-class-lesson-coup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Greeks Quit NATO Unit Over Class-Lesson Coup", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Greeks Quit NATO Unit Over Class-Lesson Coup", "body_text": " **********The Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou announced today that Greece would no longer take part in the NATO Defense College. **********The statement, made in Mr. Papandreou's name by the Socialist Government's spokesman, Dimitri Maroudas, followed the withdrawal last week of the Greek students and instructors attending the current session. **********Greece acted to protest a classroom exercise based on a hypothetical situation in which the Greek Army in a coup seized control from a left-wing Government. **********Mr. Maroudas also made official today earlier reports that Mr. Papandreou would visit the Soviet Union in the first half of February. **********A source at NATO headquarters in Brussels said by telephone that the fictitious exercise, drawn up by an American academic, had been used six years without Greek objections."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/04/business/british-coal-chief-chosen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Coal Chief Chosen", "print_headline": "British Coal Chief Chosen", "body_text": " **********Ian MacGregor, the 73-year-old Scottish-born American who led Britain's National Coal Board during the bitter yearlong strike that ended in March, will be succeeded when his appointment ends next September by Sir Robert Haslam, Energy Secretary Peter Walker said today. **********Sir Robert, 62, is chairman of the state-owned British Steel Corporation and of Tate & Lyle P.L.C., a sugar company. **********Mr. MacGregor was chairman and chief executive of the steel company before Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked him in 1983 to try to cut losses in the coal industry. **********Mr. MacGregor began an aggressive campaign to close unprofitable operations in an effort to have the Coal Board break even in 1986.

Some others were less hopeful, but several Senators said they would try to reach an agreement on an overall framework by the weekend. **********'Absolutely Relentless' **********The budget talks appeared to be helping the bond market as well, which has been absorbing a major Treasury refunding. ''The bond market is absolutely relentless,'' said Jon Groveman, an analyst for Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''It's totally ignoring the refunding; it's just chewing through it.'' **********Stock prices have been doing little for the last week, but the market appeared to be revving up its engine in preparation for another advance. Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, said ''all that really happened is that you spent six days without giving up much ground.'' **********The market's unwillingness to decline, together with yesterday's easy penetration of a technical barrier at the 1,440/1,450 area of the Dow, gave the market the go-ahead, Mr. Wachtel said. **********Blue Chips Surge **********Blue-chip issues dominated the active list yesterday, with American Telephone the most domineering, as 2.9 million of its shares changed hands. The stock gained 5/8, to 23 5/8. Earlier this week, the company settled suits with MCI Communications. **********Other active blue chips included Allied-Signal, up 7/8 to 45 3/4; Eastman Kodak, up 1 5/8, to 48 7/8; I.B.M., up 1 1/4, to 140 1/4, and Texaco, up 3/8, to 35 1/8. Allied-Signal on Wednesday announced a major restructuring that involved the spinoff of 30 businesses. **********UAL fell 1 1/2, to 48 1/8, capturing the 10th spot on the active list, with volume over 1.3 million shares. Richard Ferris, chairman of the United Airlines parent, said he expects depressed earnings in the fourth quarter and next year. His predictions of major fare wars also hurt other airline stocks for a while yesterday, although most recovered by the end of the day. Delta fell 1 1/2, to 37 3/4. Northwest Airlines, however, gained 2 1/4, to 52 1/4. Speculators figure that trouble in the airline industry might force Northwest into a merger, perhaps with Delta. **********General Electric, another component of the Dow, rose 1 3/8, to 66 1/2. The company's board has a regularly scheduled meeting today. There has been speculation that the company might decide to repurchase some of its stock. G.E. officials said they do not comment on such matters. **********Drug Companies Strong **********Merck gained 3 3/8, to 124, and Upjohn rose 3 1/4, to 132. Both drug companies would be prime beneficiaries of the declining dollar. **********Despite Wall Street's continued push upward, some investors are becoming nervous, and note that one sign of a weakening rally is when analysts expand the price-to-earnings ratios they permit for stocks. **********But conversely, analysts also note that in each of the next three months about $10 billion to $20 billion worth of Individual Retirement Account money might enter the stock market. **********The American Stock Exchange index gained 2.04, to 240.77.

At the site at Monroe Street and Reid Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, she joined 300 other parishioners and friends to celebrate the beginning of construction of the three buildings that will be their new church. **********''I won't be happy until I see a church here,'' said Mrs. Simpson, whose son, Robert, is pastor of the church. ''But I feel a great sense of hope. People are getting together and going forward.'' **********From $1 million in insurance money, as well as parishioners' contributions and the proceeds from bake sales, baby-sitting and benefit dances, the congregation has raised nearly half of the $3.1 million it needs to rebuild the 101-year-old church building. **********The construction is to begin today, and the contractors expect to complete the initial restorations on the sanctuary and a new chapel within a year. **********But more than the money, parishioners say, it is their faith in God and unwavering belief in their own ability to rebound from the disaster that has brought them closer to restoring Janes. **********''People here love their church,'' said L. Gilbert Palache, who emigrated from Panama and joined the church in 1970. ''Some people cried that night the church burned, but since then we've stayed together.'' **********The day after the fire, the Rev. Robert O. Simpson, the pastor, and the church's nine trustees met with the congregation at the pastor's residence and pledged to start rebuilding the church immediately. **********''There's something energizing about a church fire,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''People come out of the woodwork to be of assistance.'' **********Adopting a businesslike approach, the church's 619 members agreed to contribute an average of $1,800 each over a three-year period. **********''Some can afford it, but most will have to tighten their belts,'' said Mrs. Simpson, who is the building fund committee chairman. She said no one has complained about the financial pinch. $5,000 From Chamber ''Contributions have come in from everyone, including the unemployed, the nonprofessionals and senior citizens,'' said Mr. Simpson, who characterized his congregation as mainly black and middle class. **********The church has received a few large donations, including $5,000 from the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, which in a Christmas gesture of good will solicited donations from other chambers. It received checks from businesses and individuals from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania. **********Bake sales, raffles and benefit dances have brought in as much as $3,300 each. Local politicians have raised about $2,000 from merchants and other business executives. But most contributions, like the $10 that 11-year-old Tieece Baskett earned baby-sitting, have ranged from $1 to $250. **********Church members praised Mr. Simpson for his meticulous efforts in pushing the fund drive and the construction ahead. ''He works hard and has kept the faith going,'' Mr. Palache said. **********Mr. Simpson has helped choose everything from the architect and the contractor to a new $270,000 pipe organ and the bricks for the new church. **********Yesterday, the theme of the worship service was unity and rebuilding. As they have since the fire, the church members gathered at the community center of the Cornerstone Baptist Church, at Lewis and Putnam Avenues, a few blocks from their church. **********Among the hymns they sang was ''How Firm a Foundation,'' the hymn that the congregation had chosen to commemorate the Janes church's 125th anniversary on Nov. 11, 1984 -the day after the fire. **********''Although the outer building was burned, your inner faith was not consumed,'' the Rev. Dr. Wilson T. Boots, the United Methodist district superintendent, told the congregation. **********After the service, the church members marched five abreast down blocked-off streets to their church. **********With a backdrop of the skeletal brick church, the congregation stood together on a muddy plot where their chapel will be built, and recited the Lord's Prayer in unison. **********Afterward, young and old said they did not once consider abandoning the hope of rebuilding. **********''There were times when the waters of life here were very deep and the road very dark, but we never gave up hope,'' said Elnora G. Henderson, who is 83 years old, and struggled up from her wheelchair to dig one of eight ground-breaking holes on the site. **********''There's no place better than the church,'' said Osmenio Knight, 8, who was in his Cub Scout uniform. ''I've been going there since I was a kid.'' **********''I don't live in the area now,'' said Thelma Murdauch Williams of Manhattan, a retired professor of education at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, who has been a member of the church since 1943. ''But I come back because these are my roots.'' **********A Covered Atrium **********Adjacent to the new red-brick church will be a two-story building to house a chapel, the minister's office, classrooms and a library-learning center. A third building, with two stories, will have classrooms, choir rehearsal studios, a multipurpose room and a kitchen. A covered atrium will connect the three buildings. **********Mr. Simpson, who attended nursery school at Janes and has been its pastor 12 years, concedes that the church has a long way to go to raise the remaining $1.6 million for the construction. **********''I don't worry,'' he said.

''The name of the game is to avoid paying a penalty.'' **********The biggest change has to do with non-cash fringe benefits - such ''perks'' as personal use of a company car, boat, plane or personal computer. **********Theoretically, fringe benefits have always been taxable, but over the years companies became accustomed to giving their workers certain benefits without reporting them as income. Then the 1984 tax act decreed that a few benefits, such as merchandise discounts for store employees, would remain non-taxable, but all other fringe benefits not specifically excluded, primarily personal use of a company car, would become taxable to employees. The new rules went into effect in 1985.  ''This is the first year that non-cash fringe benefits are being added back to gross income on W2's,'' said Martin E. Rosenfeld, a Northbrook, Ill., certified public accountant who specializes in withholding tax matters. ''People should be aware that this add-back now exists, that it must be reflected on their 1040's, and that if they don't do something about it, they may face a penalty.'' **********Mr. Kess gives the example of an executive whose company provides her with a Mercedes in connection with her job. If the annual lease value of the car is $4,000, and if the executive's personal use of that car is 40 percent of total use, then she would have to include an additional $1,600 (40 percent of $4,000) in income for 1985. Not only is that $1,600 subject to income tax, it is also subject to F.I.C.A. (for Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax. **********The hitch is that the company may not have withheld any tax on the executive's personal use of the car. Alternatively, it may have lumped the entire $4,000 lease value into her salary, leaving it to her to calculate the value of her business use of the vehicle on Form 2106 (Employee Business Expenses) and then deduct this amount on her 1040. **********Employers have been given several options regarding how to report on the value of such fringe benefits, and whether or not to withhold on them. But tax experts say there is widespread confusion, and urge people who receive such perks to make sure their withholding is adequate. ''Even if your company is withholding,'' said Mr. Kess, ''it may not be withholding enough.'' **********There are two other changes that may trap unwary taxpayers this year. The first concerns affluent individuals who are subject to the ''alternative minimum tax'' because they have sharply reduced their taxable income through extensive use of tax shelters or other devices. For the first time, they must now take the alternative minimum tax into account when making estimated tax payments. Previously, such individuals were permitted to base their estimated tax payments on their regular tax, which was typically much lower. **********The second change affects retirees on Social Security who also receive outside income. If the total amount of their ''combined income'' (as determined by an I.R.S. formula) exceeds $25,000 for single individuals or $32,000 for married couples filing jointly, a portion of their Social Security benefits is taxable. Such individuals should include the taxable part of these benefits when they figure their estimated tax payments for 1985. Although the rule regarding the taxability of benefits was in effect last year, it was waived in connection with estimated tax payments because it was new. **********There are two methods for paying your income tax in a timely fashion. Wage earners, of course, generally have taxes withheld from their paychecks. People who will owe more than $500 in tax on other income typically make estimated tax payments on Form 1040-ES four times a year. **********The penalty for underpayment of estimated tax is non-deductible, and can constitute a significant addition to your tax bill. It is calculated as a percentage of the tax you should have paid to avoid the penalty, but did not, and is adjusted semiannually. For the first half of 1985, the penalty rate was 13 percent; for the second half, it is 11 percent. HOWEVER, there are two ''safe harbor'' rules you can use to avoid the penalty. First, there is no penalty if your estimated tax payments equal your 1984 tax bill. Second, you can also escape penalty if you pay at least 80 percent of the tax you will owe next April 15 by Jan. 15, the deadline for the final installment of 1985 estimated tax. **********Tax experts say the best way to remedy an underpayment penalty is to ask your company to increase your withholding. The reason is that withholding is treated as if it were paid proportionately over the year, even though a large chunk may not have been paid until late December. Thus, withholding can retroactively wipe out a penalty for underpayment of estimated tax earlier in the year. But estimated tax payments, by contrast, are only counted against the tax you owe for the most recent quarterly period, not against earlier ones. **********Of course, if you expect your 1985 taxable income to drop below 1984's - because you purchased some tax shelters, perhaps - you may wish to decrease your withholding by increasing the number of exemptions you claim on your W-4 form. **********The most exemptions you can claim without your employer having to notify the I.R.S. is 14. You are permitted to claim more than that, but the I.R.S. may ask you to show how you determined the number of allowances you claimed. Don't let that put you off, however: Allowing the I.R.S. free use of your overpayment is tantamount to giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. **********But be prepared for a bit of an administrative tussle, both with your employer, who may balk at the extra paperwork, and also with the I.R.S. Warren S. Shine, a tax principal with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney, tells of an I.R.S. form letter he received after claiming more than 14 exemptions. ''They challenged me to substantiate my deductions, and threatened to bounce me back to only one exemption unless I replied within 15 days,'' he said. ''It was almost approaching harassment.'' But he responded by the deadline, and that was the last he heard of the matter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/23/world/south-africa-says-13-died-in-clashes.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1985-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA SAYS 13 DIED IN CLASHES", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA SAYS 13 DIED IN CLASHES", "body_text": " **********The authorities said today that 13 people were killed Thursday in clashes with the police in the black township of Mamelodi. Until today, only two deaths had been confirmed by the police, although witnesses had reported at least six dead. **********It was one of the highest death tolls in a single day since the Government decreed a state of emergency on July 21 in several magisterial districts. **********The newly confirmed deaths in Mamelodi, near Pretoria, brought to at least 36 the number of people killed in townships around the country since last Sunday. It was one of the worst five-day periods of killings since widespread violence broke out in black townships in September 1984. **********Speculation on Mandela **********Meanwhile, Nelson Mandela, jailed leader of the exiled and outlawed African National Congress, met with his lawyers for two and a half hours in his hospital room in Cape Town, where he is recovering from surgery to remove an enlarged prostate gland. **********The two lawyers talked to reporters after the meeting but did not shed light on widespread speculation that Mr. Mandela's release from prison was imminent. **********The lawyers, George Bizos and Ismail Ayob, said prison regulations prevented them from discussing what they and Mr. Mandela talked about. They said they did not know when Mr. Mandela would be returned to Pollsmoor Prison, near Cape Town, where he is serving a life sentence for sabotage and treason, and would neither confirm nor deny that negotiations were going on for Mr. Mandela's release with the Minister of Justice. **********No Indication of Release **********Winnie Mandela, the black nationalist's wife, spent 20 minutes with her husband at the hospital and then flew to Johannesburg. She again said she had no indication from the authorities that her husband would be freed. ''We have had no move from the quarters that should be responsible for his release -the Government,'' she said. **********She said she would fly to Brandfort, a remote area in Orange Free State to which she was exiled in 1977, for the funeral Saturday of a victim of unrest and would return to Cape Town on Sunday. Mrs. Mandela has been defying an order to return permanently to Brandfort, which she left in August after her home and adjacent clinic were destroyed by arsonists. **********Soldiers and riot policemen, meanwhile, have been withdrawn from townships around Port Elizabeth, a move that had the effect of meeting a major condition made by blacks to end a four-month-old boycott of white-owned businesses. The police dismissed any suggestions that they were being influenced by the demands of ''certain organizations.'' **********Meeting With Police Officials **********But the withdrawal of troops from the townships, under cover of darkness Thursday night, came after a delegation that included representatives of the Port Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce met with police officials over the boycott issue and community grievances. **********Leaders of the boycott, which has crippled many businesses, have lifted the boycott for two weeks and said they would then decide whether to reimpose it. Another of their demands, the release of boycott leaders from detention, has also been met. **********''Since the community leaders were released there has been a tremendous falloff in violence,'' Tony Gilson, director of the Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview, adding that the police were ''obviously'' aware of that. ''There is a lesson here, that you don't solve anything by locking people up.'' **********The police opened fire on residents in Mamelodi when thousands of residents, many of whom were elderly women, gathered at a local administration office to protest the continuing presence of troops in the township, the banning of weekend funerals and high rents. Witnesses said some of the dead were shot by police riot squads, and others were trampled when the crowd of about 50,000 fled gunfire and tear gas. **********'Particularly Violent Mobs' **********The police reported at first that only two people had died in the violence but said today that they found bodies in different parts of the township overnight. **********A police spokesman said riot-squad patrols had been ''confronted by particularly violent mobs'' and were ''bombarded with petrol bombs, half bricks and other objects.'' **********In several incidents, the spokesman said, ''police were forced to open fire with shotguns and tear smoke.'' **********He said the police were investigating the deaths and could not say how many of them were caused by police action and how many people were killed by ''rioters.'' **********The township was reportedly quiet today, as soldiers and policemen patrolled the area. Scores of residents, who were among thousands who took part in a work stoppage Thursday, left their homes only after the police warned them through loudspeakers to go to work. **********The Mamelodi Parents Association asked today for an urgent meeting with Louis Le Grange, Minister of Law and Order, ''to protest the actions of the police in our townships.'' **********'There Was No Provocation' **********A spokesman for the group said there had been no warning from the police before they opened fire on the crowd. **********''The demonstration by our mothers was peaceful,'' he said. ''But they were not given a chance to air their grievances. There was no provocation, and we feel the police acted harshly in using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition on our elderly citizens. **********''We will not be stopped by the shootings on innocent people.

Mr. Scavullo had agreed to make the Roberts commercial. **********The renowned still photographer is making his television commercial debut with Covermark. And it brought together some important names in the fashion and movie businesses.

They had all agreed to make the commercial for a total of $78,000. **********''We all waived our big fees,'' said Suzanne Kennedy Flynn, creative director for Shaller, Rubin & Winer Inc., a 35-year-old advertising agency with $29 million in billings. The agency has had the Roberts account since the fall of 1983. ''All of the work was print; this is the first commercial,'' she said. Miss Flynn, a former associate editor in chief of Town and Country and beauty and health editor of Harper's Bazaar, became a consultant to the agency three years ago. She approached Mr. Scavullo with the project because she knew of his interest in moving from still photography to video and film. **********''This isn't your usual commercial,'' said Vincent Vallarino, a New York art dealer, who introduced Mr. Scavullo and Dennis Powers, a former Young & Rubicam Inc. vice president turned documentary film and video producer. Last year, Mr. Scavullo and Mr. Powers formed a partnership. Covermark is their first commercial. **********From Mr. Scavullo's point of view Covermark presented the perfect situation.

''I wanted control,'' said Mr. Scavullo, who insisted that he have the right to choose the Covermark model. She is Nathalie van Walsum, a 17-year-old high school graduate who was born in Rumania and raised in Brazil. The daughter of a Dutch diplomat, she began modeling just a few months ago.

The waterproof cosmetics effectively hide serious flaws caused by acne, burns and birthmarks. For the past few years, the company has considered expanding its marketing. In 1981, it placed ads in Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. ''But we were unprepared for the response,'' said Mr. Roberts, who has since reorganized the company's distribution and sales system.

Our performance since Mr. Reagan took office is the economic miracle of the 1980's. And our huge advantage is in our technology. **********Mr. Gorbachev: I know that. If I may quote your C.I.A. people again, your military equipment is produced with ''more sophistication, more quality, better performance, more safety, more quality control'' than ours.

Not on your life.'' **********Mr. Bush: Is that why you got rid of Marshal Ogarkov? **********Mr. Gorbachev: That's none of your business.

But experts emphasize that the findings endorse protectionism only in the most extreme scenarios, and the economists remain loath to be seen as granting a seal of approval to Capitol Hill's broad calls for protectionism. **********Their work has been almost entirely ignored in the Washington fray over some 300 bills that would curtail imports of everything from Japanese television sets to Canadian logs. Those debates tend to pit ardent free-traders against adamant protectionists, with neither side acknowledging the complexities of the dispute, economists say. **********Cautious Approach Noted **********''Those of us who work on 'new wave' theory are very leery of pushing it too hard,'' said Paul R. Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The research is very sensitive to precise details that are very hard to ascertain. And you don't want it to be used for catch-all arguments to protect everything.'' **********For the most part, economists sneer at the groundswell of support for protectionism, which Professor Krugman said ''is taking place without any intellectual foundation at all.'' He added, ''It's still very hard to find a reputable academic economist who has something good to say about protectionism.'' **********But it is not impossible. Virtually everyone agrees there are some exceptions to the doctrine of free trade. The critical question is how often such exceptions occur. **********Argument for a Surcharge **********Roger E. Brinner, chief economist of Data Resources Inc., a consulting concern in Lexington, Mass., is one of a minority of economists who say protectionism might be useful today. He favors giving the President authority to put a surcharge on imports from Japan, and his company conducted a study showing that a general import surcharge could eventually raise America's national income. **********By contrast, most other economists' studies of a surcharge have come to opposite conclusions. **********''If anybody asked me to turn in my economist's card,'' Mr. Brinner said, ''I'd say: 'Let's get out of elementary economics. Let's go to a level where we can talk about optimal tariffs and bargaining power.' '' **********Optimal tariffs and the use of protectionism as a bargaining chip are among the exceptional circumstances under which most economists concede that there may be legitimate grounds to interfere with free trade. **********Some of the Points Made **********Their ''respectable'' arguments for protection include these: *********** A country could use its bargaining power, threatening to close its own markets unless other nations open up to trade. The problem with this approach, according to Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, is that ''it's something like a nuclear deterrent - it only applies if it isn't used.'' So it is a good bluff, but imposing trade restraints is still seen as a sure path to inefficiency and retaliation. *********** In some circumstances, a country can apply ''optimal tariffs,'' which are duties on particular imports of which the country is a major buyer. The idea is that the importer can force down the price of the foreign good and save foreign exchange. However, this happens only when the importing country can affect a product's price significantly, and most studies suggest that in any case the optimal tariff would be fairly low. *********** ''New wave'' research suggests that in some situations - such as in an industry with only a few companies competing - a country could improve its standard of living by imposing protection if no one else retaliated. But administration of such a policy might require skillful, even Machiavellian, maneuvering that would be difficult to achieve in a slow-moving democracy such as the United States, according to Professor Krugman and others. *********** If the marketplace is not working as it is supposed to, a country might interfere and emerge better off. For example, if a currency's strength is temporary, yet is causing companies to make long-lasting decisions to move abroad, then some say it makes sense to protect those companies from the currency effect. The problem is that it is very difficult to know whether the currency's strength is merely temporary and how to help just those companies that might move abroad. *********** A country might be willing to accept a small drop in its standard of living to preserve certain industries that it deems necessary for national security, such as shipping or steel. It could maintain these sectors through government subsidies or by protecting them from foreign competition. **********Various Views Expressed **********A few other rationales are sometimes offered. For example, a few economists at Cambridge University in England criticized theories of free trade in the 1970's but since then have been largely quiet. **********And an economist at the University of Wisconsin, John M. Culbertson, recently has mounted a well-publicized but lonely battle against traditional economic views of free trade, partly because of growing international labor competition. **********Economists say these approaches appear to have almost no following in the United States today. **********A common argument, particularly in noneconomic circles, is that free trade is a mirage and that as long as other countries protect their industries the United States must protect its industries. **********National Security Cited **********''I don't think pure free trade has ever existed anywhere in the world,'' said Rudolf A. Oswald, chief economist of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''Clearly trade has always been restricted for national security reasons. And it would seem that national security would include certain industries that may be necessary for long-term stability of a country.'' **********Most economists remain skeptical of the new wave. They tend to stick to the free-trade doctrines that have dominated their field since the time of Adam Smith two centuries ago. **********''There have always been several exceptional situations in which a trade restriction or a subsidy might be to a country's advantage,'' said I. M. Destler, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But they tend to be pretty hard to apply in practice.'' **********Singling Out One Industry **********Today, for example, it is difficult to give protection to one industry, such as steel, while denying it to others, such as textiles or sugar producers. And while the threat of an import surcharge might persuade some countries to open their markets, other countries might just retaliate. Or they could react by limiting their exports rather than opening up to more American goods. **********Economists also stress that tariffs or other measures to protect steel or shoes might help those industries but only by denying cheap imports to consumers. Moreover, such measures would impede the natural dynamism of the economy as it moves from old industries to new ones, some say. **********''You may save some jobs in particular sectors that you protect, but you weaken the economy and destroy other jobs,'' said Sven W. Arndt, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/11/business/middle-south-unit-rate-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Middle South Unit Rate Rise", "print_headline": "Middle South Unit Rate Rise", "body_text": " **********A state judge, overruling the state's Public Service Commission, ordered a $113.9 million rate increase today for the Louisiana Power and Light Company to help pay for the Grand Gulf nuclear power plant, effective immediately. **********Company officials said they had requested an increase for the average monthly bill to $67.46, from $61.09 - up 10.4 percent. **********Bill Tregre, a company spokesman, said Judge Leo Higgenbotham's order gives the company enough money to cover all of its $12.5 million a month due on the $3.5 billion Grand Gulf plant. **********The commission had refused to grant any increase to the company, despite an earlier order by Judge Higgenbotham that the company had to have more money to help pay off the plant at Port Gibson, Miss.

She installed new ministers in a third of the governmental departments, and chose a new party chairman - Norman Tebbit, a tough right-winger - to prepare for an election in 1987 or 1988. **********The major surprise of the shake-up, which had been predicted for months, was the demotion of Home Secretary Leon Brittan. From one of the so-called ''great offices of state,'' he was moved to the Department of Trade and Industry, where he replaces Mr. Tebbit. Mr. Brittan has been criticized as a poor communicator and may have damaged himself by his role in the suppression last month of a BBC television program on Northern Ireland. **********Senior Conservative sources said, however, that the main reason for Mr. Brittan's removal was the demand by the backbenchers for a change in at least one of the three top jobs.

Opinion polls and by-election campaigns in recent months have indicated that Mrs. Thatcher's failure to make a dent in unemployment - it stands at 3.2 million, a record - is costing her a great deal of support. **********Emphasis on the Job Issue **********Lord Young of Graffham, 52, a self-made millionaire business executive, was named as the new Employment Minister. Mrs. Thatcher brought him into politics only last year, nominating him as a life peer, and she is known to consider him one of the ablest people in the Government. She said of him a few months ago, ''Other people bring me problems; he brings me solutions.'' **********To emphasize the importance she attaches to job creation, the Prime Minister allotted a second Cabinet seat to the Employment Department. It will be filled by a Cabinet newcomer, Kenneth Clarke, who had been a minister in the Department of Health and Social Security. **********Two other newcomers are considered ''wets,'' or liberals, like Mr. Clarke, which would appear to confirm a slight shift in the political balance in the Cabinet. They are Kenneth Baker, who was thought to have done a better job than his boss, Patrick Jenkin, and was chosen to succeed him as Environment Secretary, and John MacGregor, who moves from Agriculture into the important No. 2 job at the Treasury. **********Mr. Jenkin was dropped from the Cabinet, as was Peter Rees, Mr. MacGregor's predecessor. According to her aides, Mrs. Thatcher thought that Mr. Jenkin had mishandled the hotly disputed bill to eliminate some local governments, including London's, and that Mr. Rees had failed to earn the confidence of his embattled superior, Mr. Lawson. **********Mr. Tebbit, the new party chairman, is 54. A former airline pilot, he has often been mentioned as a possible successor to Mrs. Thatcher as party leader. He won fame of a sort several years ago when he advised Britain's unemployed to ''get on your bikes'' and look harder for jobs, and when Michael Foot, then the opposition leader, called him ''a semi-house-trained polecat.'' But his image was softened somewhat when he was badly hurt last year in the Irish Republican Army bombing of a Brighton hotel. His wife was paralyzed in the explosion. **********His predecessor, John Selwyn Gummer, has taken much of the blame for the Tories' weak performance in recent by-elections. Unknown when he took over two years ago, he was never able to make much of an impression on television or among the Conservative M.P.'s."}}
