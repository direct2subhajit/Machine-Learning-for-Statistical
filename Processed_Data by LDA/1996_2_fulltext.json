The slogan recalls the \"wide track Pontiac\" rhyme used for nearly a decade starting in 1959. **********The ad is a preview of the wave of Grand Prix ads that will be shown on prime time television shows from late September to early next year. Pontiac estimates that its Grand Prix print and television ads, by the Bloomfield Hills, Mich., office of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, a unit of the MacManus Group, will be one of the largest auto ad campaigns this fall. **********All advertisements will carry the theme \"wider is better,\" Bill C. Heugh, Pontiac's Grand Prix brand manager, said. \"Wide track\" cars typically have wheels that are farther apart -- both side-to-side and front-to-back. That gives drivers a more stable-seeming ride and conveys a sporty image, Mr. Heugh said. **********The redesigned Grand Prix is one of the first Pontiacs to be developed under  the new strategy by G.M. of assigning each of its divisions an image and the goal of directing its products to certain types of consumers. Pontiacs are suppose to appeal to young, style-conscious consumers. **********Indeed, Pontiac's hope is to appeal to car enthusiasts with its wide track theme. \"We kind of go for a life style,\" Mr. Heugh said. The ads are intended to attract \"people who are into their cars,\" he added. **********Pontiac expects to spend about $70 million to $80 million on the campaign, well up from the $17.7 million Pontiac spent advertising the marque last year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a New York company that tracks advertising spending. **********The television ad running this week shows an athlete practicing the long jump near the scenic ruins of the Anasazi civilization near Albuquerque, N.M. The man, trying to clear the hood of a Grand Prix parked in the desert, bumps the car as he lands. As he looks over his shoulder at the car, an announcer calls the Grand Prix \"the car you'll never get over\" and tells viewers to call a toll-free number to receive a videotape and other materials about the car. **********Starting this fall, Pontiac will run Grand Prix ads on prime time shows such  as \"Friends,\" \"Seinfeld\" and \"Home Improvement,\" as well as during college and professional football games, Mr. Heugh said. **********Print ads for the Grand Prix, appearing first in Sports Illustrated's Olympic issue, show the front of a cherry red Grand Prix stretched across two pages. A line between the wheels emphasizes the distance between them. Other ads are scheduled to run this fall in magazines, including Newsweek, People, Time and Good Housekeeping. Because factories only recently began building the redesigned 1997 model, the ad blitz will hit in late September, when dealers are expected to have plenty of the cars in their showrooms. **********Pontiac is also promoting the car through tie-ins with other companies. For instance, cars will be given away in the new McDonald's Olympic scratch-and-win  game. Starting in September, Pontiac will team up with ABC. The network will give away a Grand Prix every night for a week while it promotes its fall lineup  of shows, Mr. Heugh said. **********Time will tell whether the \"wide track\" ad theme proves as popular with this  year's car buyers as it was with the city of Pontiac, Mich. There, the road that loops around the city is called Wide Track Drive. It was named after the \"wide track Pontiac\" slogan became popular more than three decades ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/05/business/air-france-sets-a-merger-amid-protests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Air France Sets a Merger Amid Protests", "print_headline": "Air France Sets a Merger Amid Protests", "body_text": " **********Air France introduced a long-anticipated plan today to merge its international and regional carriers despite fierce opposition from unions, which staged a disruptive one-day strike at the regional carrier, Air France Europe. **********Air France Europe canceled two-thirds of its 500 flights after unions called  the second 24-hour strike in less than a week to protest against a merger that they fear will lead to wage cuts and job losses. **********The chairman of the state-owned Air France Group, Christian Blanc, said a merger was needed to prepare the company for the liberalization of the European  airline market next year. **********Mr. Blanc said he planned to merge the two carriers in the spring, creating a structure similar to that of rivals British Airways and Lufthansa. **********He said he wanted to cut costs by sharing functions and reducing wages at Air France Europe, among the highest in the world, in line with those of Air France. **********With the European market opening to competition in 1997, Mr. Blanc said that  \"if we don't react, we're going to lock ourselves into a downward spiral leading to bankruptcy.\" **********Air France last month reported its first operating profit in seven years -- the fruits of a three-year restructuring program and state aid -- but Air France Europe's performance has deteriorated and it is losing money at the operating level. **********Air France reported an operating profit of 413 million French francs, or $80.32 million, in its most recent fiscal year while Air France Europe had an operating loss of 549 million francs, or $107 million. **********Company officials said Air France Europe, which has had three overhauls in six years, is losing almost $19 million a month. **********Mr. Blanc said the alternatives to a merger were to sell off Air France Europe, whose costs are 30 to 40 percent above those of its rivals, or to pare it down to a low-cost, no-frills business that would offer its employees \"a sad  future.\" **********But unions charged that Mr. Blanc had bled the regional carrier to justify his proposal. **********\"They gave us a few extra routes, all of them money-losing, and naturally the deficit grew deeper,\" said Julie Corbeau, a union delegate. **********Labor unrest at Air France has forced managers and the Government to backtrack in the past. **********Ground crew strikes in 1993 led to the departure of Bernard Attali as chairman.

But Who Said It First?", "body_text": " **********The maxim ''leave 'em wanting more'' apparently does not count for much in the magazine business. Indeed, after the last few weeks of seeing the faces of the actors Matthew McConaughey and Gwyneth Paltrow on what seems like just about every magazine cover in the country, readers could be forgiven for wanting to be left with considerably less. **********Since the beginning of July, Mr. McConaughey -- featured in the new film ''A Time to Kill'' -- has appeared in all his 5-o'clock-shadowed hunkdom on the covers of Vanity Fair, Interview, Texas Monthly and Entertainment Weekly. He has also appeared on the inside pages of Newsweek, Premiere, Rolling Stone and People. **********In the same period, the willowy Ms. Paltrow -- who plays the lead in ''Emma'' -- has been splashed across the covers of Vogue, US and New York magazines, and has been the subject of articles inside Newsweek and Time. **********For the news weeklies, coming out with the same cover at the same time is par for the course; their lead articles are generally determined by the biggest breaking news. But for most other magazines, featuring the same topic simultaneously -- or worse, after the competition -- is considered anathema. They devote tremendous energy to getting something no one else has, or at least getting it first. **********''One is constantly aware of the question, 'Are we the only ones who are doing it?' '' said Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview magazine. ''Ninety percent of the time someone appears on our cover, it's an exclusive because we have made sure that we will be the only place that he or she will appear that month.'' **********Sometimes, as in the cases of Mr. McConaughey and Ms. Paltrow, it does not work that way. The buzz is too overwhelming, the pickings otherwise slim. Editors are eager to anoint the next Brando on their pages. Publicists pick and choose those who will be granted interviews with their clients. And suddenly, magazines find themselves scrambling to showcase the celebrity of the moment, suggesting that they would rather follow the crowd than be left behind. **********''Every once in a while it happens,'' said Graydon Carter, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair. ''The word spreads in the way that bad jokes from Wall Street spread around disasters. It goes over the oral pipeline.'' **********The pipeline generally originates in Los Angeles: Hollywood reporters see early screenings and the buzz about new movies and emerging stars begins to trickle eastward, to editors' offices in New York. **********Even though Vanity Fair jumped on Mr. McConaughey early -- and had the acute pleasure of being the first to hit the newsstands with a cover of the actor -- the magazine almost missed out completely on him. **********Interview magazine had been guaranteed an exclusive with Mr. McConaughey for its August cover. Then Vanity Fair wanted him for August, too. So Joel Schumacher, the director of ''A Time to Kill,'' called Ms. Sischy of Interview himself to ask if she would consider sharing Mr. McConaughey with Vanity Fair. And Ms. Sischy agreed. **********''It ain't about hoarding,'' Ms. Sischy said. ''It's about doing it your way.'' **********In the end, rather than featuring Mr. McConaughey alone on the cover, as originally planned, Interview shot a new photo spread of the actor with Ashley Judd, who plays his wife in ''A Time to Kill'' and has been linked with him romantically in real life. **********Entertainment Weekly also made adjustments in the wake of the media frenzy about the star, featuring  Mr. McConaughey on the cover with his co-stars, Sandra Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson, rather than by himself. **********''That was a definite response to the Vanity Fair cover,'' said Richard Sanders, the executive editor of Entertainment Weekly. ''But we also did individual shots, just in case we changed our minds.'' **********In general, however, Mr. Sanders said his magazine's main competitors were Rolling Stone, US and Premiere -- not Vanity Fair. ''Our policy is not to worry too much about Vanity Fair,'' he said. **********Indeed, magazines do not consider every other magazine an equal threat. US, for example, did not mind that Vogue and New York also had covers on Ms. Paltrow. ''Both of those magazines are really not targeted to our readers,'' said Barbara O'Dair, the editor of US. **********And New York magazine did not mind the situation, either. ''I thought that we could do a piece that would place her in context as sort of, 'New York Girl Made Good,' that was different from what either of those magazines would do,'' said Kurt Andersen, the editor in chief of New York. **********Vanity Fair was not the first to write about Mr. McConaughey this summer. **********Jeff Giles of Newsweek wrote his two-page profile three weeks before Mr. McConaughey's movie was released, sensing the deluge of coverage to come. ''The blizzard of stuff on him was completely insane,'' Mr. Giles said, ''and I can't tell you how good it felt to be off the stands for three weeks by the time it happened. **********''Let's face it, this guy has 10 anecdotes, and you'd like to be the one to print them first.'' **********Mr. Giles was not so lucky with his profile of Ms. Paltrow, which wound up coinciding -- to his surprise -- with New York magazine's cover article on the actress and Time's inside report that same Monday (Time did not get an interview with Ms. Paltrow -- her publicist refused to grant one, because Newsweek got there first -- but ran an article anyway.) **********''She's great in 'Emma;,' she seems to be a very cool person,'' Mr. Giles said. But, he added, ''I didn't know anyone who wasn't sick to death of her by noon on Monday.'' **********''I wish it hadn't happened,'' Mr. Giles said. ''It embarrasses me. I would rather be first or not at all.'' **********Gregory Curtis, the editor of Texas Monthly, said that it was highly unusual for his magazine to become part of a feeding frenzy. **********''If I had it to do over again, and I knew what was going to happen, I would definitely have had the story on the inside,'' Mr. Curtis said. ''I'd rather stand apart from the crowd than be in it whenever possible.'' **********But Mr. McConaughey is a Texan -- he also had a featured role in the well-received film ''Lone Star,'' set in south Texas -- and Texas Monthly  would not have wanted to miss the rise of one of its own. **********''It's better than not having it,'' Mr. Curtis said, ''and looking like you didn't know what the main thing was.'' **********Interestingly enough, People magazine did not consider either Mr. McConaughey or Ms. Paltrow prominent enough to put on the front cover. **********''They're not big enough to carry the cover nationally,'' said Landon Y. Jones Jr., managing editor of People. ''It's hard to put people who are mostly well known in New York or L.A. Somebody really has to play in middle America.'' **********So who starts the sizzle that surrounds newly rising stars? Most of the time, it is generated by publicists. But in the case of Mr. McConaughey, publicists say the press came to them. **********''They saw screenings and they all went crazy,'' said Pat Kingsley, a prominent agent at the public relations firm PMK, who represents Mr. McConaughey. ''It was a matter of trying to field requests.'' **********Indeed, in the case of Mr. McConaughey, several editors took credit for discovering him themselves. **********In the case of Ms. Paltrow, however, the publicity blitz was more conventionally orchestrated -- largely because ''Emma,'' based on the Jane Austen novel, was by no means a guaranteed blockbuster. **********''It's small compared to what's out there,'' said Stephen Huvane, the publicist for Ms. Paltrow. ''We decided Gwyneth would do more for this film than she does for others because it really needs her help.'' **********Mr. Huvane said he and Miramax, which produced the film, had carefully chosen their magazine outlets -- Vogue to reach an upscale audience, US to reach the mainstream and New York to reach New Yorkers. ''I don't believe in doing two magazines with the same audience,'' Mr. Huvane said. ''That's just a waste.'' **********Some say such periods, when half a dozen magazine editors seem to have one idea between them, are an inevitable part of the game. **********''I think people in magazines tend to get a little more neurotic about that kind of competitive pressure than they should, because it's in the hundreds of people who are ever aware that Details and Vogue and New York all did the same thing,'' said Mr. Andersen of New York. ''It's very intra-industry for the most part, and I think editors often tend to forget that.'' **********Others say a pack mentality reflected poorly on all the players. ''You're supposed to be ahead;  you're supposed to be anticipating what people want to read, surprising them,'' said Mr. Curtis of Texas Monthly. ''When you're part of a group like that, you wonder if you're just flowing with the tide or going with the wind rather than charting your own course for your reader -- letting the buzz determine the magazine, rather having the magazine determine the buzz.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/31/business/business-digest-124478.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-31", "snippet": "Business Digest column", "word_count": 604, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Stocks Slump on Fears Fed Will Raise Rates Soon **********Stocks slumped in the slowest trading session of the year -- 258 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange -- after unexpectedly strong economic data heightened fears that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates to counter inflation. **********The Dow Jones industrial average lost 31.44 points, closing at 5,616.21, after being down nearly 60 points early in the day.

Among other things, the announcements ordered working women to stay at home, closed schools for girls and laid down death by stoning as the punishment for adultery and drug offenses. Alcohol consumption was also banned, with the threat of public lashings for offenders. **********When a similar regime was imposed in Kandahar and Herat, two of Afghaistan's main cities, it made less impact. But with the Taliban ruling Kabul, only a few hours' drive west of here, many Pakistanis worry that its influence could cross the frontier, the more so since the Taliban, who are mostly ethnic Pashtuns, share a history and a culture with millions of Pashtuns in Pakistan. **********Because Pakistan's support for the Taliban was never publicly declared, it was never officially explained. Diplomats say Pakistan's intelligence chiefs despaired of a succession of Afghan rebel leaders who Pakistan, with weapons and money from the United States and Saudi Arabia, supported during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. After 1992, when Mr. Najibullah's Soviet-backed Government collapsed, these rebel leaders launched a civil war, compounding the carnage and chaos. **********The Taliban, with roots in Muslim religious schools set up when 3.5 million Afghan refugees were in Pakistan in the 1980's, pledged to end the banditry and to re-unite the country under the banner of Islam. In Kabul, a relatively modern city by Afghan standards, the Taliban message frightened many people, but it has strong appeal in rural areas where conditions had changed little in centuries until 1979. **********Now, with two-thirds of Afghanistan under their control, the Taliban are closer to ending the fighting than anybody has been since 1979. For Pakistan, peace in Afghanistan would bring a major dividend, including the possibility of re-opening trade routes to Central Asia and curbing the flood of opium, heroin and automatic weapons that have made large parts of Pakistan virtually ungovernable. **********Other neighboring countries are deeply wary of the Taliban. For Iran, the Taliban's Islamic militancy is less important than the fact that the Taliban are mostly Sunni Muslims, long at odds with the Shiite Muslims who predominate in Iran. **********Iran backed the Government ousted by the Taliban, which was headed by Persian-speaking leaders from Afghanistan's Tajik minority. Russia, wary of the spread of militant Islam to the newly independent Central Asian states, also backed the Government, as did India. **********But Western diplomats in Islamabad say that there has been no sign that the Taliban leaders want to spread their beliefs beyond Afghhanistan's frontiers, or that they are inclined to back terrorism."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/14/business/mobil-in-saudi-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mobil in Saudi Venture", "print_headline": "Mobil in Saudi Venture", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Corporation said today that it had agreed with the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. to begin a $2 billion expansion of their 50-50 joint venture petrochemicals complex at Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.

Today, Hypermedia Communications Inc., publisher of New Media magazine, trades in the $3 range. Rest assured no one on the roadshow for  the initial public offering of Wired Ventures Inc. will remind investors of the  Hypermedia story. **********Wired Ventures, the San Francisco-based publisher of Wired magazine, recently filed for a public offering at up to $12 a share, which would give the company a market valuation of about $450 million. That valuation represents a multiple of  17.9 times last year's revenues for the company, which continues to post net losses, and the deal clearly intends to position Wired among the Internet companies it covers rather than the magazine companies it competes with. **********Indeed, to reinforce that perception, Wired Ventures started its own search  tool, Hotbot, to compete with the likes of Infoseek, Excite and Altavista. Wired Ventures is also the publisher of Hot Wired, a separate magazine that exists only on the World Wide Web, with its own content. **********Most Wall Street analysts are restricted from talking about the Wired initial public offering, which is being underwritten by Goldman, Sachs and Robertson Stephens, because their firms are likely to be in the syndicate that ultimately  sells the offering. But among independent followers of the market for initial public offerings and technology companies, the deal is cause for a mixture of fascination and consternation. **********\"The irony here is they really have two major businesses,\" said Tony Perkins, publisher of The Red Herring, a San Francisco-based magazine that follows the venture capital and technology markets. \"The magazine is presumably doing at least break even, but in the financial world, people value magazines at just two times earnings; Hot Wired is losing over $1 million a month, but is driving all  the value in the I.P.O.\" **********Mr. Perkins said he felt Wired would gain exposure from the offering, but that it was coming too early, before the company had developed a viable business model for Hot Wired. **********\"You're really asking the public market to play venture capitalist at this point, and it is priced unreasonably high,\" he said. \"The bottom line is if you're doing $7.5 million in revenues and you're losing $3.5 million, you're still pursuing a hobby, not a business.\" **********But Richard Shaffer, publisher of Venture Finance, a newsletter that tracks venture capital and initial public offerings, said Wired Ventures looked more like a viable business than most companies that had gone public in the current Internet mania. \"I find it hard to justify the market cap and the multiple, even in the midst of a mania,\" he said. \"On the other hand, at least Wired has real advertisers, real paying subscribers, and an audience. There is a real business  there; it just doesn't happen to make money.\" **********Mr. Shaffer said Wired was justified in claiming a higher value than New Media because the fascination of the public with the Internet far exceeded its interest in multimedia. \"Wired's done well at positioning itself in the middle of the Internet hype because it's caused a lot of the Internet hype,\" he said. \"Wired is more than another magazine publisher; it's the cheerleader for the digital age.\" **********Last week, getting a jump on the offering, a group of large investors paid $10 a share for 1.25 million shares of Wired Ventures in a private placement. Wired said those investors included Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, CUC International, Tudor Investment Funds and Advance Magazine Publishers, a unit of the Newhouse company Advance Publications. Wired plans to sell 6.3 million shares, representing a 17 percent stake, in the initial public offering at the maximum price of $12 a share.

''Instead they were asking me, like: 'What are you doing here? Who's in charge of this?' '' The next day another partygoer was visited by the police, who asked the same questions. **********For these former refugees -- a growing, high-profile sector of urban life here -- the authorities' scrutiny  came as no surprise. **********''I knew people here would be paranoid about a bunch of us getting together,'' said Ms. Elston, 30, who sells golf club memberships for a Vietnamese-American joint venture. **********In the last two or three years, hundreds of young Vietnamese-born Americans have returned here to do business and seek their roots. They work as consultants for foreign companies, open restaurants and boutiques, take jobs at local English-language publications and, quite often, work on personal memoirs that they hope will help them sort out their cultural identities. **********Some, like Trang Hoang, 25, who trains promotional personnel for Johnny Walker Scotch, discover that despite their years in the United States they are ''Vietnamese, totally Vietnamese.'' Others, like Trinh Ai Lan, a 25-year-old freelance television producer, declare that they are ''100 percent American.'' **********But not all have resolved the question. **********''I'm not really sure where I belong,'' said Hoang Mai, 26, a writer. ''I think we've all come to the conclusion that you can never figure it out.'' **********The Government seems similarly uncertain what to make of its refugee children with their Vietnamese appearance and their thoroughly American ways. It wants the money and the expertise they bring back with them, but it fears the cultural influence of these Westernized free-thinkers and warns that there may be subversive ''hostile forces'' among them. **********''The motherland can have only one attitude and that is to welcome them home with open arms,'' Pham Khac Lam, who heads the Government's National Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, said in an interview. But he added, ''There are still dark forces who have not given up their schemes'' of bringing down  the Communist Government. **********In a recent address to Government leaders, Mr. Lam tried to reassure them that the returnees, known as Viet kieu, are mostly benign. But he also voiced disappointment that they have not proved to be the economic boon that many officials here had hoped. **********The number of overseas Vietnamese visitors -- for brief or extended stays -- has risen each year, from 160,000 in 1993, to 200,000 in 1994, to 265,000 last year, he said. They represent a significant portion of the two million or more Vietnamese living abroad, about half of whom are in the United States. **********But for all their numbers, the returnees have registered only 58 investment projects in the country, worth a total of less than $100 million, Mr. Lam said. Also, he said, overseas relatives send home $600 million to $700 million a year. But since this money typically is not funneled through banks and is dispersed in small amounts around the country, its economic effect is diluted. **********These numbers are all the more disappointing to the Government because, although in many respects it treats returnees like other foreign citizens, charging them higher rates for hotels and air tickets, it has tried to encourage them to invest with tax breaks and business incentives that free them of many of the regulations  that other foreign investors complain about. **********''What we have found is that there are not so many rich men among the overseas Vietnamese,'' Mr. Lam said, contrasting them with the overseas Chinese millionaires who have proved a windfall for their homeland. ''So we are thinking, the main contribution of overseas Vietnamese will be gray matter. Vietnamese are head people, not pocket people.'' **********Indeed, the numbers he cited confirm what is evident among the young returnees here: most Vietnamese-Americans return for personal rather than business reasons. **********Miss Mai, who has lived in Hanoi for the last year, is one of those who is writing about her experiences, struggling to decide whose fate was happier, her own, growing up in Oakland, Calif., or that of her parents and sisters who remained behind in a Vietnamese village. **********''I freaked out when I saw my sisters in pajamas and conical hats,'' she said, recalling their reunion after a separation of 20 years. **********''They were just like everything I had seen on television. They harvested rice. Their skin was dark from the sun. Their mannerisms were totally nha que,'' she said, mixing California syntax with the Vietnamese slang for country folk. **********''But they are happier,'' she asserted. ''I know that for a fact. They sell noodle soup, they raise pigs, their life is hard. But it is a very innocent life. They are all involved with each other. They all eat together. They all look out for their parents.'' **********Growing up in the United States  with four older siblings, Miss Mai struggled and succeeded, graduating from the University of California at Davis. **********''We lived the American dream,'' she said. ''It means having opportunities. It means the chance to be more than you were before. It means not bending over 12 hours a day in the rice paddies.'' **********''I remember at night, drifting in the boat, with the wind blowing and the rain coming down, everyone felt sure about America,'' she said, describing her escape in 1975 at the age of 5, as Saigon fell to the Communists. ''People started telling stories about where we were going. It was a gift. It was a blessing. And I've always been grateful, because it was such a close call.'' **********Grateful, but still wondering about the life she might have lived. **********''They are happy with simple things in life,'' she said of her family here. ''The hand-to-mouth existence makes it simpler to define your life. Choices complicate things.

The Pentagon described the reports at the time as either false or wildly exaggerated. \"We have no knowledge of live prisoners of war being held back since the Korea War,\" a Defense Department official said in January. **********Kenneth Steadman, director of national security and foreign affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the nation's largest veterans group, said today, \"We've been watching this carefully for 40 years, and have not seen any evidence of any live Americans held as prisoners of war\" in North Korea. **********\"I would hope that it's true,\" he said of the Pentagon report. **********While Mr. Lee's report offers nothing like conclusive evidence that Americans are being held against their will in North Korea, it cites \"a variety of additional sightings reports\" in recent years suggesting that many Americans prisoners of war may still be alive. **********\"Several defector reports cite that there have been numerous Americans teaching English and American customs at the foreign-language department in Amnokgang College or a military reconnaissance school in Pyongyang,\" the report  said. \"These English language instructors are sometimes identified as U.S. defectors, but more frequently as 'American P.O.W.'s.' \" **********The report also cited the account of a Romanian-American, identified only as  Mr. Oprica, who worked in a North Korean factory in the 1970's. **********According to the report, Mr. Oprica told the Pentagon in 1988 that during a sightseeing trip around North Korea in 1979, \"the bus driver appeared to be disoriented and drove the bus through a collective farm\" where Mr. Oprica saw \"7-10 Caucasians, including one individual with blue eyes, working in the fields.\" **********\"The workers appeared to be in their 50's,\" the report said. \"Mr. Oprica was  told by a female passenger that the Caucasian farmers were American prisoners of war.\" While the report said Mr. Oprica was not able to recall the woman's name,  Pentagon investigators last year tracked down another Romanian passenger on the  bus who \"confirmed seeing Caucasians working on a farm.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/world/does-keeping-the-peace-spoil-gi-s-for-war.html": {"writer_name": "Mike O'Connor", "pub_date": "1996-12-13", "snippet": "Senior US Army officers say that year of peacekeeping in Bosnia has cost American soldiers some of their ability to fight conventional war, because they use skills directly opposed to combat training; photo; officers propose to give 10,000 troops ...", "word_count": 1240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Does Keeping the Peace Spoil G.I.'s for War?", "print_headline": "Does Keeping the Peace Spoil G.I.'s for War?", "body_text": " **********After nearly a year in Bosnia, American soldiers have lost some of their ability to fight in a conventional war, officers say. **********While insisting that the loss of combat skills is not serious, senior Army officers nevertheless say they would like to give the 10,000 combat troops returning to bases in Germany up to half a year to rest, catch up on training and practice traditional warfare. **********With the great majority of American combat soldiers based in Europe either just completing a tour in Bosnia as peacekeepers, or now assigned here, there are few available to respond immediately to a military threat. **********Senior Army officers say this is a manageable consequence of the change in what is expected of the military as it tries to learn to stretch itself to carry out peacekeeping assignments while at the same time retaining its ability to fight. **********But many lower ranking officers -- those with more direct responsibility for troops in combat -- are considerably more concerned about their soldiers' readiness. And even among senior officers there is disagreement over how much keeping the peace in Bosnia has reduced the Army's fighting skills. **********The Army's chief planning officer in Europe, Col. Gary Goff, said soldiers returning from Bosnia would need considerably more retraining than those coming back from the Persian Gulf war, while Maj. Gen. John M. Le Moyne, head of Army operations in Europe, said the soldiers are, ''probably in the best shape of any army returning from the field in modern history.'' **********It is the experience in Bosnia that has highlighted the issue, as the Army confronts something new: The demands of switching soldiers from a combat force to one that has to learn the skills of peacekeeping. Then, after the soldiers spend more than a year away from much of their  normal training regimen, they have to be remade into first-rate traditional warriors again. **********Senior American officers in Europe say, barring a crisis, they will probably take until late May to bring all the returning soldiers back to full readiness. **********''In a crisis we would still need about two months of retraining to get  everyone coming back now ready,'' Colonel Goff said. **********Senior officers say that if disaster were at hand and no troops were available from the United States, soldiers based in Europe could be sent into action much sooner. **********''If the fate of the nation were at stake, we would be at the dock before the ships arrived,'' said Maj. Gen. William L. Nash, commander of the First Armored Division, which just completed its Bosnia tour. **********With the menacing barrels of their tanks pointing down, and doing nothing more than intimidating motorists at the checkpoint they were running,  a group of American soldiers said that in many ways their work in Bosnia runs counter to their traditional training. **********''We were taught how to sneak around in these tanks quietly, surprise the enemy and destroy him in combat,'' said Second Lieut. Brian O'Keefe. ''But here we are supposed to stay out of combat by being obvious. To me, it's like teaching a dog to walk backwards.'' **********Sgt. Felipe Paul said: ''I'm a tanker, that's what I do, been one for 14 years. But let me tell you, those skills are perishable. You got to use them, and all I'm doing here is checking people's driver's licenses.'' **********The sergeant's arms went out like wings as he recalled what for him was the beauty of an assault with a company of tanks swooping across the lands in a coordinated attack. **********''You've got to practice that,'' he said, ''but in Bosnia, we're parked.'' **********The First Armored Division, with some 10,000 combat soldiers, was the core of the American forces here until it was replaced by about 5,000 combat troops of the First Infantry Division last month. Both divisions are based in Germany and together they are almost all of American ground combat forces in Europe. **********A brigade, about 1,000 combat soldiers, of the First Infantry Division is assigned to peacekeeping work in Macedonia, leaving in Europe some 1,600 combat troops as part of a lightly equipped force based in Italy to handle emergencies. **********In 1990 there were 213,000 United States soldiers in Europe, all of them pointing their weapons toward a single adversary: the Soviet bloc. Today, there are only 65,000 soldiers, most of them not assigned to combat roles, based in Europe and responsible for possible action in 83 countries. **********As they cleared out large rounds of ammunition and stowed gear in the tight quarters of their Bradley fighting vehicles to prepare for the trip home, soldiers at the huge staging area in Slavonksi Brod, Croatia, said  recently that in some ways they were  better fighters after being in Bosnia. **********''We know our equipment better, we know how to keep it all going 24 hours a day, because we had to,'' said Specialist James Cunbee, a Bradley driver. ''And we know how to pace ourselves on a mission like this one, where you have to be ready to go 24 hours a day yourself. And then, with all that time working with your own unit, you really get to know how to work together better than in any training exercise.'' **********What the soldiers say they've discovered about skills acquired and skills gone rusty matches rather closely what many officers report, and what Army experts sent to study the experience in Bosnia say they too are finding. **********Essentially, since the first American soldiers entered Bosnia last December, almost everyone has become better at what they do individually, or in small groups. But where the job is to coordinate those groups into the effort of a larger combat force, there are likely to be problems. **********''My guys are great at driving three Bradleys down a road in a straight line and setting up an unconcealed observation post,'' said Capt. Thomas Boccardi, commander of a company of Bradley fighting vehicles. ''But when it comes to attacking a position, or holding a piece of terrain against an assault, that's where we'll need work.'' **********Even with thousands of peacekeepers in Bosnia, the work is usually done in small groups. The trouble that creates is that in conventional warfare the coordinated force of large units -- often combining infantry, tanks, aircraft and artillery --is what gives the United States Army its punch. **********Planning and coordinating a conventional battle falls to the staffs of military units. General Nash said  that because his staff officers have been coordinating a peacekeeping force, not planning battles, they are not as good at warfare as when they arrived. **********He said it would take less than a  month of practice using computer simulators to bring the skills back. **********''Calling it a brush-up is too light, but if you called it retraining, that would be too heavy,'' he said. **********Other officers, including the Army's chief planner in Europe, Colonel Goff, say that while refreshing individual units might only take a month or so, getting all the units through the limited number of training sites in Europe would take much longer. **********There has been some training in Bosnia. Rifle ranges were set up, artillery and helicopter ranges were created in some open areas and most  of the tank and Bradley crews will have practiced gunnery at an American base in Hungary on their way home. **********But as a measure of how difficult it is to recapture even basic military skills, without that practice, Colonel Goff said, it would have taken as much as 18 months to retrain the returning soldiers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/21/world/iraqi-arms-plant-destroyed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraqi Arms Plant Destroyed", "print_headline": "Iraqi Arms Plant Destroyed", "body_text": " **********United Nations monitors have completed the demolition of an Iraqi weapons plant used to make anthrax and other germ warfare agents, the world organization said today.

He was 69. **********The cause was heart failure, the state-run National Radio reported. **********Born Luis Miguel Gonzalez Lucas in Madrid, he adopted his father's bullfighting nickname, Dominguin. **********He had already achieved great renown before \"The Dangerous Summer\" of 1959, when he and his brother-in-law, Antonio Ordonez, fought the series of bullfights chronicled by Hemingway, a contest for popular acclaim as the world's top toreador. **********As Hemingway explained: \"Bullfighting is worthless without rivalry. But with  two great bullfighters, it becomes a deadly rivalry\" that can force a matador to push beyond his abilities until he is injured or killed. **********The brother-in-law won. And indeed, later in the summer, Dominguin was gored  during a routine pass. **********But in his heyday, Dominguin's fame opened other avenues of adventure. **********He carried on a highly publicized romance with Ava Gardner and was photographed with her in 1954, the same year he married an Italian actress, Lucia Bose, with whom he had three children. **********Picasso was the godfather of their youngest child, Paola, and the family regularly visited the artist at his home in France. The bullfighter's fame was credited for the fact that even though Picasso was considered an enemy of the state by the dictator Francisco Franco, Dominguin could make these visits and return to Spain without incident. **********Born on Dec. 9, 1926, Dominguin first appeared as a junior bullfighter at age 11 in Lisbon. He was rarely far from the ring for the next two decades. **********In 1941, in Bogota, Colombia, he became a full-fledged matador, permitting him to face the largest bulls, in a fight known in Spanish as the alternativa. But the test was considered invalid in Spain, where he had to repeat the process in 1942, when he was still in his mid-teens. **********At age 20, he was on the fight card on Aug. 28, 1947, in Linares, Spain, when the greatest bullfighter of the day, Manolete, was gored and died. **********Two years later, in the Madrid bullring, Dominguin thrust his right arm in the air and raised his right index finger, claiming the throne for himself as the new No. 1 bullfighter. The gesture set off sharp debate among aficionados. **********\"He had a style of attracting attention like some actors on stage who captivate the audience even if they don't say a word,\" said Jose Carlos Arevalo, editor of 6 Toros 6, a weekly bullfighting magazine in Madrid. **********In Hemingway's words: \"Luis Miguel was a charmer -- dark, tall, no hips, just a touch too long in the neck for a bullfighter, with a grave mocking face that went from professional disdain to easy laughter.\" **********Domiguin continued fighting regularly in Spain until the early 1950's. His career then shifted to Latin America, but he returned to the Spanish ring in the late 1950's, setting up the rivalry with Antonio Ordonez, a younger man who had  married Dominguin's sister. **********Dominguin \"would consider himself a bigger draw at the gate\" because of his fame, Hemingway wrote in \"The Dangerous Summer,\" which grew out of a reporting assignment for Life magazine. But Ordonez \"would consider very strongly that he  was a better matador,\" he added. **********Hemingway and most Spanish aficionados agreed with Ordonez, and Dominguin retired shortly thereafter. **********Hemingway wrote that he was unmoved by Dominguin's style of cape work in the  ring. But he also expressed great respect for the matador: \"He was proud without being arrogant, tranquil, at ease in the ring at all times and in full control of everything that went on. **********\"It was a pleasure to see him direct the fight and to watch his intelligence  at work. He had the complete and respectful concentration on his work which marks all great artists.\" **********Hemingway also praised Dominguin's \"reflexes, his tremendous repertoire of passes and his encyclopedic knowledge of bulls.\" **********Unlike some bullfighters, Dominguin also regularly served as his own banderillero, the fighter who plunges sharp sticks into the bull's back before the matador steps into the ring with the red cape and sword for the final passes and the kill. **********Dominguin returned to the ring in 1971 at 44, quite old for a bullfighter. His last fight was on Sept. 12, 1973, in Barcelona. **********His first marriage ended in divorce in 1968. In 1987 he married Rosario Primo de Rivera, niece of the founder of the Spanish ultra-rightist Falange movement,  which supported Franco. **********He is survived by his wife; by his son, Miguel Bose, whose successful career  as an actor and pop singer prompted Dominguin to grumble in later years that he  was simply known as \"Miguel Bose's father\"; by two daughters, and by his brother, Pepe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/03/business/norwich-life-insurance-to-sell-shares-to-public.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-10-03", "snippet": "Norwich Union Life Insurance Society of Britain says it plans to sell shares to public next year (S)", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Norwich Life Insurance To Sell Shares to Public", "print_headline": "Norwich Life Insurance To Sell Shares to Public", "body_text": " **********The Norwich Union Life Insurance Society of Britain said yesterday that it planned to sell shares to the public next year.

While the rest of his family ate together, he was served meals alone in his own room. His family allowed him out of the house only about once a year, and then mostly at night so the neighbors would not see. **********\"The idea was that if you're born deformed, you should be concealed as much as possible,\" said Mr. Takahashi, who is now 49 and runs a center for the disabled. \"And that view still survives in some households.\" **********Mr. Takahashi's experience was extreme, but the stigma was not. Physical and  mental disabilities seem to arouse powerful feelings of shame across Japan, and  these emotions offer a disconcerting glimpse of the way in which society here sometimes works. **********Japan lacks any law prohibiting discrimination against the handicapped, although advocates for the disabled are trying to change that. **********To be sure, Japan is in many ways one of the most sensitive and civilized societies in the world. This is a country where school gym classes do not allow  captains to pick teams, so that weak children will not feel bad about being picked last. **********Tokyo is one of the few major cities in the world where a blind person can ask a taxi driver the fare on the meter and count on not being cheated. Yet even if individuals do not prey on the handicapped, society sometimes seems to. **********Japanese society emphasizes conformity, and the essence of the Japanese proverb about \"the nail that sticks out gets hammered down\" is drummed into children from the moment they set off for the first day of school -- sometimes in identical uniforms. The disabled are the nails that stick out, and they complain that they get hammered. **********\"Japanese consider someone different an outcast, a source of shame,\" said Naotaka Kumeta, a 25-year-old man who lives in the city of Shizuoka and uses a wheelchair. \"People think it shameful that I like to go out and about. They say, 'Remember, you're handicapped!' \" **********Mr. Kumeta, a tall man with bushy eyebrows, was injured in 1990, while studying at a college in Oregon. He had gone to Oregon as an exchange student in high school and loved it, particularly the sports -- he wrestled the 152-pound and 160-pound weight classes and played defensive guard on the school football team. **********Then one day he was driving his 1977 Mustang -- \"very fast,\" Mr. Kumeta admitted sheepishly -- without a seatbelt, and he fell asleep at the wheel. **********Mr. Kumeta was in a coma for two months and woke up in a hospital back in Japan to learn that brain injuries had left his right side paralyzed and his left side with tremors. **********\"I thought I wanted to die,\" Mr. Kumeta recalled. An American Christian missionary instilled a renewed desire to live, and Mr. Kumeta's mission in life  now is to win better treatment for the disabled. **********Japan, like many countries, lags behind the United States in building wheelchair ramps and elevators, although new buildings tend to have them. **********When Mr. Kumeta visited Tokyo recently by train, he had to be met at Tokyo Station by a railway employee -- alerted in advance -- who led him through a labyrinth of underground passageways to make his connection to a commuter train. **********\"People say that Japan is a very developed society,\" Mr. Kumeta said quietly  as he rode that train, his wheelchair parked near the door, as just about everyone in the train car gazed at him. **********\"But for the handicapped it is very backward, decades behind the United States. Look at how people are staring at me -- it's like that all the time.\" **********The next stop was Shinjuku, Tokyo's busiest subway station -- and one with no elevators. A railway employee and a couple of Japanese businessmen helped carry  Mr. Kumeta in his wheelchair down a long flight of steps. **********Americans see Japan as a harmonious society, Mr. Kumeta said a few minutes after that humiliating episode, but the harmony is achieved by excluding those who do not seem to fit. The exclusion, he said, usually means that the disabled  are often discouraged from working, from marrying, from going to movie theaters  or restaurants. **********\"When I'm alone in a coffee shop,\" Mr. Kumeta said, \"people think, 'Troublemaker!' \" **********Disabled people in many countries feel that they are treated inequitably, of  course. But the vehemence with which the handicapped raise the issue in Japan is striking, particularly because their complaints have less to do with architecture and more to do with discrimination and social exclusion. **********\"I think I can overcome the physical barriers,\" said Chieko Okada, a 22-year-old university student who is in a wheelchair. \"If there are no elevators, then I can use a staircase if someone will help me. But the psychological barriers are really difficult to overcome.\" **********Miss Okada attended special schools for the disabled as she was growing up, and then when she applied to universities she was repeatedly told that she would not be allowed to take the entrance examinations. **********Finally Miss Okada was accepted at a university near her home, and now she has just graduated. But when she applied for jobs she was told that companies could not accept a disabled person, and she ended up taking a job with a center  for the handicapped in Tokyo. **********She looked for a small apartment near her new job site, and landlords repeatedly turned her down. **********\"Sometimes I want to cry out: 'I'm here! I live here too!' \" Miss Okada said. \"Even though it's weaker than it used to be, there's still this feeling that the disabled should be excluded.\" **********Still, it is not that anybody with a physical disability is denied opportunities. After all, a partly paralyzed politician named Ichiro Hatoyama rose to be Prime Minister, from 1954 to 1956. **********The real problem, the disabled say, is that they are normally excluded from the mainstream of society, in ways comparable to racial segregation. **********\"This isn't an open society that tries to embrace outsiders or different people,\" said Mr. Takahashi, the director of the center for the disabled. \"Consciously or unconsciously, society tries not to open the door but rather to  exclude outsiders, those who don't seem to fit.\" **********Mr. Takahashi and others say that when they visit the United States they find attitudes a world apart from those of Japan. In America, they say, they may be regarded as foreigners but at least are acknowledged as inhabitants of the same  planet. **********\"Basically, America is a country of immigrants,\" said Akiko Saito, an advertising copywriter who works as a volunteer helping the physically and mentally disabled. **********\"People in America are accustomed to different people, different ethnic backgrounds, different religions and so on. But Japan is not like that, and in Japan, the disabled have long been isolated. People just do not know how to make contact with them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/04/world/pact-on-land-mines-stops-short-of-total-ban.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pact on Land Mines Stops Short of Total Ban", "print_headline": "Pact on Land Mines Stops Short of Total Ban", "body_text": " **********An international conference agreed today that within the coming decade, the use of land mines should be curtailed and that eventually mines must be made easily detectable or self-deactivating. **********But despite a worldwide campaign to completely ban land mines, the Conference on Conventional Weapons meeting in Geneva stopped short of outlawing them. **********At least 100 million land mines scattered around the world kill as many as 10,000 people every year and maim about 20,000. **********The new agreement -- an updating of a pact called the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices  -- has provoked widespread criticism because it allows nations to use mines in a number of situations and gives them at least nine years to use up stocks of so-called \"dumb\" mines, which are difficult to detect. **********The pact, which includes no enforcement provisions or methods of verification, will not be reviewed again until 2001. **********The head of the United States delegation to the talks, Michael J. Matheson, welcomed the agreement and said it could result in a decline in civilian casualties. **********He called it \"an important first step toward the goal of eventual elimination of antipersonnel mines altogether.\" **********But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who has led a battle in Congress to outlaw the use of land mines by the United States, called today's agreement \"a deplorable failure.\" **********Legislation sponsored by Senator Leahy would bar the export of mines though 1997 and would ban their use by the United States for the year 1999. The Senator says he hopes the 1999 ban would become permanent. **********Though the Pentagon was recently reported to be considering a ban by 2010, it has not endorsed such a move, and the Geneva conference could not muster the strength to go beyond Washington's position. **********Russia, China and India have also been reluctant to phase out mines. Many nations argue that the weapons serve an important defensive purpose. **********Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in an unusually strong statement, expressed \"deep disappointment\" today at the Geneva conference's limited success. **********\"There have been attempts to differentiate between smart mines or good mines  and bad ones,\" he said. \"Yet no mechanism, no contraption can legitimize a weapon that inflicts such appalling yet random suffering on so many societies.\" **********The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a coalition of more than 400 organizations, said the new agreement \"will not make a significant difference in stemming the global land mines crisis.\" **********Leaders of the campaign say the pact will only spur the production of new generations of \"smart\" land mines, which can deactivate themselves automatically within the required 120 days. \"This is not merely a dangerous precedent,\" the campaign said in a statement in Geneva this week. \"It is a cynical disregard of  the humanitarian principles central to international laws for the conduct of war.\" **********European and Canadian negotiators at the conference, held at the United Nations Geneva headquarters, were prepared to back a ban on mines. Germany, the  Netherlands and Canada are among nations that have abolished their use. **********On April 22, Britain became the latest of about three dozen countries to review mine policies and announce readiness to support an international ban. **********During the debate, 15 former high-ranking American military officers -- among them Gen.

AT&T has argued that the acquisition would give Britain's dominant telephone company unparalleled access to the American market even though United States companies are restricted in Britain. **********In addition, the changes enhance prospects for transforming London into Europe's main communications hub -- in much the way that Heathrow, outside London, is Europe's most-used airport. Thanks to technological advances and European Union plans to open national telephone markets to full competition in 1998, business customers could use rival carriers to route their international calls into and out of London. **********The new F.C.C. rule would essentially offer to relax what is known as a ''proportionate return'' requirement currently imposed on all foreign phone companies that offer service into or out of the United States. This rule requires a company like British Telecom to hand off its calls to American long-distance carriers in the same proportion that each American carrier sends calls over to Britain. **********In effect, the rule blocks foreign carriers from shopping for the lowest possible prices among American long-distance companies. It also blocks BT from taking full advantage of its current global alliance with MCI because BT cannot capture the biggest possible volume discounts. The new F.C.C. rule would not allow BT to hand over all its United States-bound calls to MCI, American officials said, but it would be able to hand over a good many more. If BT owned MCI outright, it could probably save even more because all profit that now flows to MCI would flow to it instead. **********''What we are really trying to do is liberate consumers all over the world from the tyranny of the accounting-rate regime,'' said Don Gipps, head of the F.C.C.'s international bureau. Accounting rates are the prices set by governments for completing international phone calls, and have by all telling been far higher than actual costs. **********On the British side, Government officials will undo one of the last big vestiges of the duopoly controlled by British Telecom and Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of Cable and Wireless. **********As of Jan. 1, AT&T and 42 other companies will be allowed to carry calls into and out of Britain over their own networks. Until now, they had only been allowed to offer international service over lines they leased from BT or Mercury. **********The difference may or may not turn out to be significant. BT, which has been fending off considerable competition for several years now, already offers among the lowest international rates in Europe. **********But the shares of both British Telecom and Cable and Wireless dropped slightly last week, when London announced its plans, suggesting there is room for more competition. **********''BT and Cable and Wireless are certainly in the lead in keeping prices down, but the danger is that the price reductions travel faster than their plans,'' said Peter Roe of Paribas Capital Markets in London. Indeed, BT's chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, told investment analysts last week that he expected revenue from international calls to fall because of increasing competition. **********But Mr. Roe and some other analysts think BT will gain more than it loses from further liberalization in the markets. **********BT officials say that over the longer term, they expect to more than offset the impact of greater competition by becoming a magnet for overseas traffic from the rest of Europe. ''We would like to be seen as the European hub,'' said Eric Barr, a spokesman, noting that BT had successfully defended itself from new competitors for several years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/09/business/the-media-business-pixar-plans-end-to-commercials.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Pixar Plans End To Commercials", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Pixar Plans End To Commercials", "body_text": " **********Pixar Animation Studios, best known for its work on the film \"Toy Story,\" said today that it would stop making commercials after finishing its current slate of projects so it can concentrate on longer-format and interactive entertainment. **********Pixar will move the 18 employees who are currently producing commercials to other projects.

Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries stepped up its expansion into the growing used car industry yesterday, when it announced it had signed an agreement to acquire Alamo Rent-a-Car Inc. for $625 million in stock, thereby insuring a steady supply of vehicles for the company's nascent used auto supermarkets. **********Alamo, the fourth-largest rental car company in the nation, operates in 42 states, Canada and 10 European countries. It fits neatly, analysts and company officials say, with another recent Republic acquisition: Auto Nation USA, a developing chain of giant-sized used car lots. **********''Alamo is a great strategic fit,'' said Thomas Galvin, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. ''It provides a brand name fit with Auto Nation and a significant source of used car inventory. I think the strategy outlined by the team at Republic is now being crystallized.'' **********Mr. Galvin said he expected the deal to increase 1997 earnings. He raised his estimate for Republic's earnings a share to 55 cents, from 50 cents. **********Michael Egan, Alamo's chairman and founder, who owns about 90 percent of the shares of the closely held company, will oversee the rental car division at Republic. Republic will issue 20 million shares to finance the purchase, which will be done under a pooling of interests agreement. **********News of the Alamo deal pushed Republic's stock price up $2.875 to close at $33.625 in Nasdaq trading. Republic, a diversified company with holdings that include an electronic security business and solid waste landfills, has acquired 19 companies since Mr. Huizenga took over in August 1995. ''This merger dovetails nicely with Republic's strategy of assembling consumer-oriented, service-related business that provide steady cash streams and possess strong brand names,'' said Robert Friedman, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor's Inc. **********The former chairman of Blockbuster Entertainment, Mr. Huizenga suffered a setback last month when he was forced to abandon his bid to acquire ADT Ltd., the nation's largest home security business, for more than $4 billion in Republic stock. Despite stock analysts' initial enthusiasm for the deal, Republic's share price slid downward, making it impossible for the two companies to agree on the ratio for the stock swap. **********In his pursuit of Alamo, Mr. Huizenga, the Florida billionaire who owns the Miami Dolphins, the Florida Panthers and the Florida Marlins, edged out another shrewd investor with a ravenous appetite for acquisitions: Henry Silverman, chief executive of HFS Inc. in Parsippany, N.J. **********HFS had bid about $500 million for Alamo earlier this year, analysts said, after purchasing Avis Inc., the third-largest car rental concern. ADT is now selling its domestic vehicle auction sales operation. **********Industry analysts suggested that the Alamo merger could give Republic an advantage over competitors in the used car market and open the door to an alliance between Republic's Auto Nation and General Motors, which has been buying back cars from rental agencies for resale. **********Rental agencies are generally a steady source of used cars because they trade in their fleets every six to 18 months. Given that General Motors supplies as much as 75 percent of Alamo's fleet of 150,000 cars, industry analysts say that Auto Nation could become a new sales outlet for both Alamo and General Motors. Alamo could also provide a vehicle for Auto Nation to enter Europe and Canada. Republic's next target could be automobile dealerships. **********''We're moving into the automotive industry,'' said Steve Berrard, president of Republic. ''People think of us as a used car mega-store operator. But we look at our role as broader than that. We want to be a provider of transportation to consumers, be it new cars, rentals or used vehicles.'' **********Republic entered the automobile industry when it purchased Auto Nation USA and then Car Choice Inc., developers and operators of used car superstores in Dallas, Detroit and Coconut Creek, Fla. The company expects to open five Auto Nation superstores by the end of the year and a total of 80 by 2000. **********But Mr. Huizenga is not the only investor to regard used car sales as an expanding area of opportunity, especially since the average new car price soared above $19,000. Used cars will account for about 73 percent of the 55 million cars that will be sold this year in the United States, up from 64 percent six years ago. And a half-dozen companies are setting up used car super-dealerships to meet the demand. **********Last March, Hertz, the nation's largest rental car company, said it would open 39 used car lots this year to sell cars driven by its customers.  Circuit City, an electronics retailer, has opened five used car lots under the Car Max name, and an alliance of nine dealers who own a total of 118 auto dealerships plans to open 100 outlets over the next five years under the Driver's Mart Worldwide name.

The fiscal discipline required by the plan has caused European governments to enact austerity measures, and in recent weeks, the French Government has come under increasing pressure as unemployment has mounted. **********The Italian decision sent the lira and government bonds surging in value today. The lira rose to 996 to the mark, after trading earlier in in the day at about 1,000. It later fell back to 999 to the mark. **********Mr. Prodi, who said the lira's re-entry into the exchange rate mechanism ''was a matter of a few hours, or a few days,'' has a lot at stake. Passage of the 1997 budget, which is intended to cut $41 billion from next year's deficit, came only after bitter debate. To achieve passage, Mr. Prodi was forced to impose a one-time tax on middle-  and upper-level incomes, and despite a promise to pay a tax rebate in 1999, the added tax provoked protest demonstrations last weekend. **********The Government has called the measure a ''Eurotax,'' implying that it was the price Italy had to pay to remain economically and politically part of Europe. **********The lira was taken out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992, when the currency was sharply devalued by a wave of speculation. Its re-entry will be more symbolic than real, given the 15 percent bands within which currencies may fluctuate under the present mechanism. **********Still, the political rewards for Italy will be a boost to Italian prestige and an assurance that the nation is on track to be included in the plan for a single currency, which is set to begin in 1999. Countries will qualify for the plan only if their currencies have been within the exchange rate mechanism for at least two years. **********As for the economic rewards of rejoining the mechanism, they will be mixed, at best. A stronger lira would exert downward pressure on prices in Italy, enabling the central bank to reduce interest rates further and bolster the economy by easing the strain on businesses that borrow.  But it would also hamper Italian exports, by raising the price in foreign currencies of Italian goods. **********Such an effect could further slow an already sluggish economy, given Italy's high reliance on export sales to keep factories running, a reliance that has only been heightened by sluggish consumer demand as a result of the Government's austerity policies. Earlier this month, the European Commission lowered its forecast for Italian growth this year to eight-tenths of 1 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier. **********Antonio Fazio, the director of the central bank, predicted today that consumer price inflation in Italy, which is now hovering at about 2.6 percent, would average out between 2 percent and 3 percent in 1997. **********Crucial to Italian success in the European monetary committee -- the group of central bank and government economists that is to decide the lira's fate at a meeting in Brussels on Saturday -- will be Rome's ability to reach agreement with France over the exchange rate at which the lira should be readmitted.

With American help, at least 2,000 Kurds are likely to be settled temporarily in Siloppi, Turkey, and from there many are expected to be resettled in the United States. **********But Kurds in northern Iraq continued to express dismay about the slow pace and limited scope of the operation. Outside the military headquarters today, at least a dozen men from Erbil, a five-hour drive to the south, said they had tried without success to persuade those inside that their past employment by the United States made them eligible to leave. **********''We're afraid that we'll have the same fate as the Vietnamese who helped the Americans in Vietnam,'' said a 27-year-old man too fearful to give his name. **********Most of those assured a right to leave have already packed their bags and are simply waiting for a final go-ahead, according to a Kurdish employee of the State Department agency, who also insisted on not being identified.

But over all, the amount of cash flowing into mutual funds that invest in stocks continues to slow and has fallen by about 75 percent over  the last two months.    AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., an independent fund-tracking company, reported that investors put $1.9 billion into equity funds in the week ended Wednesday. While that turnaround is encouraging, \"we're still seeing a continuing decline in sentiment toward equity mutual funds,\" said Robert Adler,  president of AMG. **********That confirms anecdotal evidence from interviews this week with executives at several fund companies. They said that investors recently appeared to be favoring money-market funds, which invest in short-term cash instruments, over stock funds, particularly the volatile aggressive growth funds that were wildly  popular earlier this year. **********Investors' uncertain appetite for equity funds comes as the stock market has  gyrated wildly over the last several weeks. After jumping more than 50 points yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week with a gain of 46.24 points, at 5,473.06. Other indexes lost ground, however. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 2.83 points over the five-day span, closing at 635.90. And the Nasdaq composite index lost 18.24 points, or 1.7 percent, to close the week at 1,079.44. **********According to AMG, a moving average of weekly inflows to stock funds fell to $1.06 billion in the most recent period from $4.51 billion in the first week of  June. In January, the industry's biggest month ever for cash inflows to stock funds, the weekly moving average briefly topped $10 billion. **********The fund industry felt a significant shock, therefore, when AMG reported that $4 billion, or about three-tenths of 1 percent of the assets in stock funds, departed in the week ended July 17. That was the first such weekly outflow since October and the largest since AMG started tracking weekly cash flows in January  1992. **********\"Last Monday, everybody was going crazy about that $4 billion,\" said Jessica  Bibliowicz, an executive vice president at Smith Barney and head of its mutual funds group. \"While that number on its face looks scary to investors, as a percentage of assets it's not that significant.\" **********\"What was more scary,\" she continued, \"was the $25 billion that flowed into mutual funds in May, with 37 percent of that going into aggressive growth funds\" -- funds that invest in small, fast-growing companies. Their share prices have been hit hardest in the market decline of the last two months. History has proved that investors who flock to hot-performing funds when the market is overheated tend to stay around for shorter periods than the average mutual fund  investor. **********The Investment Company Institute, a fund industry trade group, said last week that inflows to aggressive-growth stock funds slowed in June. The group took in  $3.6 billion, or about 25 percent, of the $14.5 billion that flowed into equity  funds. **********Inflows to growth funds also fell by about half in June, to $2.6 billion from $5.5 billion in May. Growth and income funds, a more conservative group that buys stocks of companies with growing earnings and rising dividends, took in $4.7 billion in June, off from $5.7 billion in May. **********This month, AMG's data showed, the quickest moves have been made by investors diving in and out of the most aggressive funds. \"That shows that there is still  a speculative sentiment in the market,\" Mr. Adler said. Nearly half the $1.9 billion in net inflows in the week ended Wednesday went to emerging growth and aggressive growth funds, he added. **********Not all fund shareholders are inclined to switch in and out of high-growth funds quickly. For example, at Scudder Funds, net cash flows have remained positive in at least one subgroup of assets: the $13 billion in mutual funds that are marketed through the American Association of Retired Persons. **********\"We've seen very positive cash flows the whole month,\" said Karen Igler, an assistant vice president at Scudder. **********In contrast, at Charles Schwab & Company, investors have pulled about $600 million more from equity funds than they have put in so far in July. Schwab, which operates the largest mutual fund supermarket, where investors can buy funds from dozens of different fund companies through one account, tends to attract customers who are more likely to hold funds for short periods or frequently switch between stock funds, bond funds and cash accounts. **********That type of activity, known as market timing, is generally acknowledged by investment professionals to be one of the most difficult ways to make money, because markets often move upward or downward before an investor can react. **********Some mutual funds are intended to time the market -- specifically, the group  known as flexible funds, which allocate assets among stocks, bonds and cash. But judging from data reported by the Investment Company Institute, even the professionals do not always have their assets in the right place at the right time. **********For example, at the start of 1995, as the market started on an upward tear that lasted nearly 18 months, the average flexible fund had more than 20 percent of its assets in cash. **********That allocation did not fall below 10 percent of assets until April 1996. And in May and June, as stock prices peaked and began to decline -- a perfect time to move a chunk of assets into the safer haven of cash -- flexible-fund managers continued to trim their cash levels, to 7.8 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/13/business/2-big-french-banks-report-strong-earnings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-13", "snippet": "Banque Nationale de Paris SA, France's fourth-largest bank in terms of assets, says profit rose greater-than-expected 80 percent during first-half of 1996, to 1.735 billion francs ($336.7 million); Credit Commercial de France says first-half earni...", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Big French Banks Report Strong Earnings", "print_headline": "2 Big French Banks Report Strong Earnings", "body_text": " **********Two of the biggest banks in France  reported double-digit first-half earnings growth yesterday.

Hanover of Boyes Hot Springs, Calif. He learned the 1991 Jeep Wrangler he bought used was officially a lemon only when he was subpoenaed to testify at a recent hearing by California's Department of Motor Vehicles. That agency is scheduled to hold another hearing in Sacramento today on its threat of a 60-day ban on sales of new cars by Chrysler, which it has accused of lemon-law violations. While other companies have been fined for such violations, none have ever faced a sales ban. **********''This is a scam,'' Mr. Hanover said. ''Between the dealer, the auction and Chrysler, everyone says it's someone else's fault.'' **********Chrysler denies wrongdoing. But complaints about lemons -- problem cars and trucks bought back by manufacturers -- are hardly limited to a single car maker. Consumer advocates say state laws controlling the resale of such vehicles are variable in strength and widely flouted -- objections that for the first time are drawing attention in Washington, where the Federal Trade Commission is deciding whether to impose a national lemon resale standard. **********Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, or CARS -- a group based in Sacramento, which with the National Association of Attorneys General had petitioned the F.T.C. to take up the issue -- estimates that auto makers repurchase 50,000 cars and trucks as lemons each year, or one-third of 1 percent of the 15 million sold annually. **********The big problem, consumer groups say, is interstate transit of faulty vehicles. They accuse auto makers of exploiting ''lemon loopholes'' to move vehicles through states like Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Montana, Illinois and Minnesota that have relatively weak lemon statutes. **********Manufacturers flatly reject the charge. **********''We don't engage in lemon laundering,'' said Lewis H. Goldfarb, Chrysler's general counsel. He called the Garcia-Melvin-Wilson experience with the Dodge Caravan a ''horrible'' exception. **********''Dealers not passing on disclosures are few and far between,'' added Kendall J. Tough, manager of regional compliance for the General Motors Corporation. **********Still, law enforcement officials say each link in the wholesale used-car chain -- manufacturer, auto auction and dealer -- can easily shirk liability for meeting requirements for lemon disclosure because enforcement ends at state lines. **********Since California and Connecticut led the way in 1982, all states have adopted lemon laws. Generally, buyers are allowed to return new vehicles during the warranty period if a defect has not been corrected after four attempts or if the vehicle is out of service for 30 days for any combination of defects. But there are big differences among the states about how much information must be disclosed to subsequent buyers of such vehicles. **********Among the proposals before the F.T.C. is that auto makers be required to re-register the titles of all repurchased vehicles with notations like ''Warranty Return.'' That would include vehicles determined to be lemons by a court or arbitrator, as well as vehicles repurchased voluntarily by an auto maker after a consumer complains -- ''good will'' buybacks, as they are known. The information would be included in a national vehicle title data base accessible to consumers. **********The F.T.C. plans a public forum on the proposals Oct. 3, with a staff recommendation on action to follow. **********Auto makers support a uniform law but object to subjecting good will buybacks to the lemon-law stigma. **********''We're trying to satisfy customers,'' said Mr. Tough of G.M. ''That doesn't mean the vehicle is toxic waste.'' G.M. successfully lobbied in Indiana to change the phrasing on titles from ''Defective Vehicle Buyback'' to ''Manufacturer's Buyback.'' **********Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's Attorney General, argues that the F.T.C. should not exempt goodwill buybacks from a national resale disclosure law. His state found that three times as many vehicles were repurchased voluntarily -- outside the lemon-law program -- as following a formal complaint. **********Similarly, an analysis of 1995 lemons in Washington State by Peter L. Maier, a Seattle lawyer, found that vehicles bought back prior to arbitration had at least as many serious defects as those acquired afterward. **********''We have enormous wealth tied up in vehicles and they are routinely traded with little information,'' Mr. Maier said, adding that auto makers, auction houses and dealers shared ''an economic incentive to not be too careful.'' **********High demand for late-model used vehicles means lemons can easily be resold. If the vehicles can be repaired, auto makers say, they are typically auctioned off to their own dealers. Officials in Connecticut, Florida and Washington say there is little evidence that lemons with safety hazards are being resold. But in California's suit against Chrysler, regulators say the vast majority of vehicles had safety problems. Nationally, Chrysler, with 12 percent of the market, said in its F.T.C. filing that it had repurchased 5,100 of its vehicles last year, while G.M., with 31 percent of the market, said in its F.T.C. filing that it had repurchased 46,000 vehicles. **********In its suit, California accused Chrysler of having resold 119 lemons without adequate disclosure. Keith A. Levy, an administrative law judge, found violations in 116 cases. The hearing that is scheduled for today in Sacramento is to determine if the proposed 60-day ban on new car sales would have ''unintended economic impact on consumers, local governments and dealers,'' according to papers filed by the Department of Motor Vehicles. **********Mr. Goldfarb of Chrysler, who is fighting the suspension, said the violations were the unintentional result of confusion following a 1989 revision in the state's lemon law. **********Mr. Hanover, the Wrangler owner who was subpoenaed to testify in the case, said he had signed a disclosure notice that stated that a brake drum had been replaced on the vehicle. But the notice, he said, did not mention clutch failure, which his Jeep experienced, or that the previous owner had to replace the clutch slave cylinder three times in 9,000 miles. **********''I was so angry,'' he said. ''The only person really hurt is the consumer.'' **********CARS contends that unsuspecting consumers are routinely duped, paying full retail prices for lemons whose repair records are played down or concealed. **********In the case of the Dodge Caravan declared a lemon in Virginia, Ms. Melvin later bought the mini-van from a Chrysler dealer in Minnesota. Its sticker read ''buyback,'' which the salesman told her referred to a minor water leak that had been repaired. She found otherwise when water spilled into her lap after a rain. **********After Chrysler bought the van back from Ms. Melvin, it went to a rebuilder in Minnesota. Mr. Wilson bought it from him. Their saga was featured on ABC's ''Prime Time Live'' program on Feb. 28. Still, it is far from unique. **********''The patchwork of state laws creates an incentive for dealers to move cars to exploit the lack of disclosure in other states,'' Mr. Blumenthal of Connecticut said in a recent interview. The state reported to the F.T.C. that 75 percent of the 200 vehicles repurchased in Connecticut in the last two years were resold out of state. **********Auto makers deny intentionally moving cars to states with less strict  laws. ''It's a lie,'' said Mr. Tough of G.M. Used-car auctions typically draw dealers from several states, he said. **********G.M. intends by early next year to start a follow-up program with customers who buy repurchased vehicles, a first in the industry. By polling customers directly, G.M. will not only make sure they know a vehicle's history, but will also find out if dealers are following the auto maker's disclosure policies. **********Connecticut, California, Utah and Maryland have the nation's most comprehensive lemon laws, broadly defining lemons to include those repurchased by auto makers voluntarily. Fifteen states require auto makers to report buybacks to regulators, but only four states require reports of resales. **********Sixteen states require the titles of lemons be ''branded'' with notations that vary from Utah's ''Nonconforming Vehicle'' to Vermont's ''Defect Substantially Impairs Use, Value or Safety.'' Six states require window or door frame buyback stickers. **********But enforcing requirements is another matter. Florida discovered last year that auto makers had made required reports on only 12 percent of 3,412 vehicles that were repurchased in the state between 1992 and 1994. **********''An inference can be drawn that if the department did not receive the form, consumers likewise were uninformed that vehicles they purchased were resold 'lemons,' '' Robert Butterworth, the state's Attorney General, said in a filing with the F.T.C. **********As a result, Florida began investigating repurchases by 20 auto makers, the most comprehensive attempt so far to delve into industry practices. California and New York have investigated individual auto makers for lemon-law violations, winning settlements since 1988 against Chrysler, G.M., Mercedes- Benz, Mitsubishi and Mazda. **********''We could eliminate the problem with a $1 tax on new cars to set up a data bank,'' said Philip Nowicki, the former director of Florida's lemon-law arbitration program. ''But any tax is politically incorrect.'' **********Consumer advocates argue that lemon laws can have broad benefits for car owners. In Washington State, for example, just 580 vehicles have been declared lemons since the state's arbitration program began in 1988. But since the law can go into effect if a car is in for repairs for a certain number of days, some auto makers are rushing parts to Washington buyers, said Paul Corning, the assistant attorney general who runs the state's lemon arbitration program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/business/worldbusiness/IHT-german-deficit-fight-stymies-government.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1996-11-06", "snippet": "Germany's ability to impose its brand of fiscal discipline on its European partners suffered a setback Tuesday when the country's three-party coalition government reached a stalemate on ways to cut the projected 1997 budget deficit..

Germany is not in a position to lecture others.\" **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl is pushing the nation's budget talks as far as he can without breaking his own 14-year-old coalition, which has shown signs of instability and infighting because of the budget impasse. Mr. Kohl met with leaders of the three coalition members for three hours Tuesday without result. **********The issue is expected to stay at the forefront Wednesday, when the European Monetary Institute publicizes a report on efforts by European Union members to meet the single-currency criteria. The report will offer a country-by-country breakdown of progress toward meeting the economic goals defined in the Maastricht treaty on European unity. **********The EMI report, expected to include projections for this year's debt and deficit rankings for each country, comes a few days after Germany's six most respected economic institutes said the country would overshoot the Maastricht criteria in 1997, the year whose data will be used to determine who qualifies for the single currency. **********Germany began pushing for a stability pact a year ago when its budget prospects looked brighter. But in recent weeks, Mr. Kohl's austerity program has suffered one setback after another, and Bonn began losing ground at home and influence in Europe. **********Most EU members last week ignored German objections to a French plan to trim its deficit by transferring pension funds from France Telecom to the government. Germany scoffs at the French effort as superficial window dressing, not meaningful debt reduction. **********Germany's yearlong push for automatic sanctions against countries that overshoot the Maastricht debt and deficit levels, the heart of Germany's plans for a stability pact, were rejected by the European Commission. Those talks continue, but Germany said it would end its cooperation if the stability pact lacked teeth and would instead forge a separate agreement with those countries that qualify for the first round of monetary union. **********In Bonn, more budget talks are scheduled Wednesday, although some said it would be difficult to find areas to cut without meeting steadfast opposition. The parties **********want some agreement by Friday, when a government panel is to release fresh estimates for next year's projected tax shortfall. **********The Germany economy, meanwhile, is not lending much help to the government's efforts to tame the deficit. On Tuesday, data showed that industrial orders fell 3.6 percent in September from August, the first monthly drop since May. The weak data followed a report Monday that showed a slowdown in industrial output in September. **********Another report Tuesday further tempered optimism. In its autumn survey of 25,000 businesses, the Federation of German Chambers of Commerce said it expected the economy to grow by 1 percent this year and between 1.5 percent and 2 percent next year. **********That would fall short of forecasts made by the government and leading economic institutes of 2.5 percent growth next year. **********The government needs all the economic momentum it can get to generate the tax revenue to meet its budget goals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/22/world/canadians-failure-indians-and-eskimos.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-22", "snippet": "Report indicting Canadian policies towards indigenous peoples noted", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canadians' Failure: Indians and Eskimos", "print_headline": "Canadians' Failure: Indians and Eskimos", "body_text": " **********Canada's policies toward its Indians and Eskimos have been a shameful failure and their plight will only grow worse if these polices are not changed, according to a commission that spent five years and $43.5 million studying the condition of the country's indigenous people. **********One notorious symbol of this failure is the Indian community at Davis Inlet in Newfoundland, which is now the focus of a project that stresses self-government and economic development. **********Articles, page A6."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/15/world/gop-makes-an-issue-of-replacing-un-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.O.P.

But several members of Congress say they will speak publicly about the issue soon in an effort to force the President's hand, and diplomatic pressures are building at the United Nations as foreign diplomats express concern over the lack of any signal from the White House about where it stands. **********Mr. Boutros-Ghali's first five-year term ends in December. **********Mr. Dole, the likely Republican candidate for President, has made the Secretary General a symbol of foreign interference. Expanding on a line that Patrick J. Buchanan used in his failed presidential campaign, he says in almost  every speech that if he were ever to send American soldiers anywhere, \"I will be in charge of making that decision, not Boooutros Boooutros-Ghali.\" Spoofing the  Secretary General's name guarantees a laugh and a cheer. **********Mr. Clinton can hardly defend the Secretary General in the current climate without the risk of some political damage. But he is also said to be reluctant to take on the task of selling another candidate to the world. Either way, the Administration wants to avoid giving Mr. Dole the opportunity \"to hang the Secretary General around our necks,\" in one official's words. **********Administration officials also acknowledge that the United States has almost always obtained what it wants from the Secretary General, despite occasional public spats between Mr. Boutros-Ghali and Madeleine K. Albright, the American envoy here. **********But in Congress, criticism of Mr. Boutros-Ghali is not only almost universal  but also bipartisan. All efforts by the Secretary General and the Administration to demonstrate that the United Nations is reforming and cutting costs seem to have been unconvincing. **********Some of the Congressional critics see the future of the Secretary General not strictly as a partisan issue to be exploited but rather as a symbol of a larger  problem of swiftly deteriorating relations between this country and the world organization, which the United States largely created in 1945. **********In Congress, many of the critics of Mr. Boutros-Ghali -- an Egyptian diplomat and former Government minister who played a role in the negotiations leading to the Camp David accords on the Middle East -- say they respect him personally. **********Even Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina who as chairman  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been dismissive of the United Nations system, is known to like and respect the Secretary General, an intellectual with a wide range of interests. **********Instead, Mr. Helms and others portray Mr. Boutros-Ghali as a leader who has proved incapable of making radical changes in an organization they regard as unwieldy and inefficient. **********\"The United Nations needs new energy, new leadership, new direction,\" said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat and member of the House International Relations Committee, who has urged the White House to move on a replacement before Mr. Boutros-Ghali becomes a political liability. \"This is not a criticism of Boutros Boutros-Ghali. But there is a feeling that the United Nations needs a major shake-up. In these circumstances, institutions benefit from new leadership.\" **********In the Senate today, Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota and a former  Congressional delegate to the United Nations who is seeking a public debate, issued a statement in which he characterized Mr. Boutros-Ghali as one of those career diplomats who \"train for the grand world of treaties and receiving lines, not the grubby world of balance sheets and bottom lines.\" **********\"The United Nations is under the wrong leadership,\" he said in an interview.  \"This thing is a serious problem for the American public.\" **********Opinion polls are mixed on Americans' support for the United Nations. Some show much broader backing for the United Nations than some politicians believe exists, while surveys and focus groups that test opinion for candidates often reveal a negative public attitude toward international organizations, especially the United Nations, if national sovereignty is thought to be at risk. **********In his primary campaign, Mr. Buchanan got applause with regular attacks on not only the United Nations, but also the Council on Foreign Relations, the World Trade Organization and the Trilateral Commission, among others. **********On balance, American voters do not see the United Nations as a campaign issue at this point, says Mark Mellman, a poll-taker and strategist for Democratic candidates. **********\"Politically, it could hardly be a lower priority,\" he said. \"The only reason that any American knows Boutros Boutros-Ghali is because people make fun of his  name. This is an inside-the-beltway issue.\" **********Senator Pressler, who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, describes himself as \"pro-U.N.\" But he warned that \"if Boutros-Ghali is reappointed, we'll have a very hard time budgetarily here in Congress.\" **********The reluctance of Congress to allocate money to pay American dues and assessments to the United Nations has already created problems here for the Administration, as friendly nations join in the accusations that Washington has  pushed the organization into financial crisis. **********Administration officials say they know the situation will become even worse if Mr. Boutros-Ghali wins a second term and Republicans remain in control of Congress, calling for more reductions in the size of United Nations bodies and greater fiscal austerity. The attitude of Congress appears to be the strongest argument against support for Mr. Boutros-Ghali at this point. **********But despite recurrent rumors to the contrary, the Administration -- or at least Mr. Clinton, who has wavered on other international appointments in NATO and the World Trade Organization -- appears not to have made a decision to withdraw support from Mr. Boutros-Ghali. **********Time is running out. Diplomats here say that in the absence of a clear signal from Washington, Mr. Boutros-Ghali has been on the road, building up solid support in Asia and Africa, and has the firm backing of France, which demands a  French-speaker at the head of the United Nations. Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who generally shuns publicity, often appears more comfortable in French than English, which has added to his problems in Congress. **********In Washington, officials and members of Congress remember that Mr. Boutros-Ghali told Americans at the start of his term in 1992 that he was a one-term Secretary General. Some would like to hold him to that pledge. **********In the United Nations, the Secretary General -- a hard taskmaster with a closed and impenetrable inner circle of advisers -- is not popular. Some officials indeed fear that in a second term he would be ruthless with perceived  dissenters or potential rivals for authority. **********The method of choosing a Secretary General by back-room horse trading is considered unsatisfactory by many officials and diplomats in the United Nations system. There is no formal search process or public campaigning. Other potential candidates are loath to challenge a Secretary General openly. **********A Secretary General is formally chosen by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council, where the United States has the strongest voice. Among the four other permanent members, Russia is thought to be leaning toward the incumbent, France backs him, China threatens to veto almost anyone else -- particularly Europeans -- and the British have no strong objections or other candidates. **********The names of at least half a dozen possible candidates have been circulating  here for more than a year. The favorite in Congress seems to be Sadako Ogata, a  Japanese scholar who is now United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. She would be the first woman to hold the job. **********Among the others mentioned most often are Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping; Mary Robinson, President of Ireland; Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway; Maurice Strong, a Canadian who presided over the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, and Jayantha Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan arms control expert who is now Ambassador to Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-051098.html": {"writer_name": "Robyn Meredith", "pub_date": "1996-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;People", "body_text": " **********Anne Melanson, an executive vice president at Bates Worldwide, New York, a unit  of Cordiant P.L.C., was named to the agency's worldwide management board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/25/business/key-rates-491098.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/shot-getting-big-spenders-invest-commercial-potential-internet.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1996-12-16", "snippet": "Advertising column describes concept devised by two advertising industry veterans, John L Mezzina and Jordan Stanley, to get big consumer products companies to begin advertising seriously on Internet; their new loyalty program, called Free Ride, w...", "word_count": 833, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A shot at getting the big spenders to invest in the commercial potential of the Internet.", "print_headline": "A shot at getting the big spenders to invest in the commercial potential of the Internet.", "body_text": " **********THE big question on the collective mind of the on-line advertising community as the year comes to a close is: When are the big consumer products companies going to begin advertising seriously on the Internet? **********John L. Mezzina and Jordan Stanley, two advertising industry veterans, believe they have found a way to lure the big brands onto the Internet's World Wide Web. And if that were not ambitious enough, they also believe that they can get the Internet's famously tight-fisted denizens used to the idea of paying for stuff on the Web, while at the same time helping to transform Internet access into a free commodity. **********The means by which they hope to achieve all this is a new loyalty program they are introducing today called Free Ride. Computer users can earn points by buying brand-name products, or by looking at on-line advertisements. Once 1,000 points are amassed, those computer users earn a free month of Internet access from participating access providers. **********The program tries to allay the suspicions that many large advertisers have about who, if anyone, is paying attention to on-line ads. Rather than fool around with unproved measures, the companies that participate in Free Ride pay only when consumers actually buy their products and send in the bar code from the package in pre-paid envelopes. **********With that pitch, Mr. Mezzina and Mr. Stanley have managed to attract a roster of well-known consumer brands, including Nabisco's Oreo cookies, Duracell batteries, Kodak cameras and I.B.M. computers. **********''This whole program is designed to bring the consumer closer to the brand,'' said Mr. Stanley, who spent 17 years at Young & Rubicam before joining Mr. Mezzina at his company, Mezzina/Brown Inc., three years ago. **********''Everything has been for free on the Web,'' added Mr. Mezzina, who was vice president and group creative director at Young & Rubicam before forming Mezzina/Brown in 1991. ''So this helps get consumers used to the idea of paying,'' even if someone else, namely the consumer product company, is footing the bill. **********Free Ride is by no means the only loyalty program being cooked up for the Web. Cybergold, a start-up in Berkeley, Calif., plans to start offering people the chance to earn cash by reading Internet ads early next year, the same time Free Ride plans to begin awarding its points. **********''We believe that the scarce resource in today's market is attention,'' said Victor Imbimbo, Cybergold's executive vice president of marketing and sales. **********But some analysts have questioned whether Cybergold's offer will attract the type of customers advertisers are looking for since anyone with idle time can simply click through ads and rack up points. **********Free Ride doesn't have that problem, because it gets paid only when consumers actually buy the products featured on its web site (http://www.freeride.com). But its challenge is to see whether consumers are enthusiastic enough about earning free Internet access to bother to clip bar codes and mail them in. **********''That is a recipe that consumers have shown they are not as high on as programs in which the consumer doesn't have to do anything extraordinary to get the benefit,'' like airline frequent-flier programs, Max Goldberg, chairman and president of the Promotion Marketing Association of America, said. **********Another stumbling block may be  that Free Ride has only signed up two relatively unknown Internet service providers -- Earthlink and Infinet -- as initial participants in the program. Those who get their Internet access from one of the dozens of other providers will get no benefit by participating in Free Ride unless they are willing to switch to the participating providers. **********But Mr. Mezzina and Mr. Stanley do not see these as big obstacles. They are confident that they will sign up more access providers because Free Ride will prove to be popular. About 70,000 people signed up for the offer during a three-month test of the concept earlier this year, even though there was no reward.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an 11-page finding, overruled that dismissal and sent Beatrice's motions back to Judge Pollack's court for further hearings. **********In its motions challenging the class action, known as Presidential Life Insurance v. Milken, TLC Beatrice contended that its claims had not been given due process. **********TLC Beatrice, a food and beverage company with 1995 sales of $2.1 billion, also contended that the Presidential Life action was collusive and violated class members' rights to due process; further, it had maintained that it never received legal notice of the suit. It had also contended that the class action was filed for the purpose of giving Mr. Milken and more than 500 other defendants immunity from any future civil liability.

The ad, which is scheduled to begin running today in six newspapers around the country, is believed to mark the first time that the Presidential candidate of a major political party has agreed to allow his image to be used for commercial purposes. **********So it isn't Air Force One. But it is a sale on a round-trip fare for a weekend in Paris, priced from $299 to $449; restrictions, as usual, apply. **********Mr. Dole's $3,000 fee for the ad will be donated, at his request, to a Washington community center for the elderly. A small line of type in the ad notes the donation. **********Mr. Dole ''said he didn't want to gain personally from the ad,'' Doug Wurth, general counsel for the Dole campaign -- the Dole Presidential campaign, that is -- said yesterday in a telephone interview from Washington. Mr. Wurth was the intermediary between Mr. Dole and Blum/ Herbstreith, the small New York agency that created the ad as part of its duties as the American shop for Air France. **********Mr. Dole joins a small but growing caucus of politicians who have been embraced by Madison Avenue after being rejected by voters. **********''The step from running ads to try to get elected President to being in an ad as an erstwhile Presidential candidate is not a big one anymore,'' said Andy Berlin, chairman and chief executive of Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York, who produced a biographical film of Mr. Dole for the Republican National Convention. **********''It's an expected thing in the church of fame,'' Mr. Berlin added. **********The politicians-turned-product-peddler trend may be said to have started in 1975, when William E. Miller, Barry Goldwater's running mate in 1964, asked, ''Do you know me?'' in an American Express spot. **********It has accelerated since, with Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, for example, hawking several products after serving as House Speaker, even popping out of a suitcase in a commercial for Quality Inns. **********Indeed, Pepsico Inc. has taken a particular shine to the genre. In 1985, Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic candidate for Vice President the previous year, was featured in a spot for Diet Pepsi. Dan Quayle, the former Vice President, appeared in a 1994 television commercial for Wavy Lay's potato chips from the company's Frito-Lay division. And early last year, two former Governors, Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Ann Richards of Texas, pitched another Frito-Lay brand, Doritos. **********Mr. Dole ''is going into private life and is entitled to do whatever he wants as long as it's not illegal, immoral or fattening,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who follows political advertising in her role as dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. **********Politicians as celebrity endorsers has become ''such a pervasive cultural tendency,'' she added, ''if anything, you'd be surprised if it didn't happen'' that a Presidential candidate of either the Republican or Democratic Party would someday join their ranks. **********''Our society blurs together politicians, entertainers and athletes as celebrities all in the public eye,'' said Donny Deutsch, chief executive of Deutsch Inc. in New York, who worked on commercials for the Clinton election campaign in 1992. **********''I think you'll see the emergence of Bob Dole, cult hero,'' Mr. Deutsch said, ''with a certain empathy now he could never get as a politician.'' **********The Air France ad is based on a comment Mr. Dole made in his concession speech on Nov. 5. ''Tomorrow will be the first time in my life I didn't have anything to do,'' he said. **********That inspired Alan Blum, president of Blum/Herbstreith. His idea, he said yesterday, was to center a fare-sale ad on a photograph of a smiling, waving Mr. Dole and a headline as laconic as the man himself: ''Not doing anything?'' **********Though ''it was just perfect,'' Mr. Blum said, he and executives of Air France were unsure whether Mr. Dole would allow his likeness to be featured in the ad. **********''So we sent it to him,'' Mr. Blum said, ''and he thought it was very amusing. The fact he was so amused was great; he doesn't take himself too seriously.'' **********Mr. Wurth echoed that sentiment. **********''The Senator is a good-natured, good-humored man,'' Mr. Wurth said. ''He took the ad in good humor.'' **********''The public likes to see political figures when they're a little more unrestrained,'' Mr. Wurth added. ''This and the late-night shows are a great way for Bob Dole to introduce himself in a way that perhaps he wasn't able to on the campaign trail.'' **********That reference was to post-election appearances made by Mr. Dole on ''Late Show With David Letterman'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' On both, as in the Air France ad, a lighter, self-deprecating side of his personality was evident. **********The text of the Air France ad continues the humorous tone of the headline. ''If you have a little time on your hands,'' it asserts, ''there's never been a better reason for a getaway to Paris than our special fare.'' The ad ends by claiming that ''a fare this low might be the best news you've had in a long time.'' **********The newspapers in which the ad will run are The Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle, The Los Angeles Times, The San Francisco Examiner, The Washington Post and the Northeast editions of The New York Times. $(Page B2.$) Plans call for the ad to appear twice more after today, on Sunday and Tuesday. Air France will spend $336,000 to run the ad, Mr. Blum said. **********The community center to which Mr. Dole asked his fee to be donated, Sarah's Circle, provides housing and other programs for the low-income elderly. It is a favorite charity of Mr. Dole and his wife, Elizabeth. **********''Air France, as a gesture of good will, offered the Senator and Mrs. Dole free round-trip tickets to Paris on the Concorde,'' Mr. Wurth said, adding that Mr. Dole asked instead for the donation to Sarah's Circle. **********''He hopes the mention of the donation in the ad will have some spinoff effect,'' Mr. Wurth added, in terms of additional contributions. **********Is the Air France ad the beginning of a second career for Mr. Dole as a product pitchman? **********''I don't think he'll be Lee Iacocca selling mini-vans,'' Mr. Wurth said, referring to the former head of the Chrysler Corporation. **********''You can never rule anything out,'' Mr. Wurth added, ''but there's a delicate balancing act. The Senator doesn't want to demean his efforts by overly commercializing them.'' **********Mr. Dole, along with Mr. Clinton, had appeared in a humorous print ad before the election that encouraged voting, but in that instance neither man had authorized the use of his image.

Yeltsin wandered from pig farms to metal factories today, delivering the same simple, heartfelt message: the past is over, please don't bring it back. **********\"Do you know how important this election is for Russia?\" he asked voters at a town meeting here less that a mile from the site of history's biggest tank battle, where the Red Army broke the Nazi advance. \"Do you remember the lines, the lists, the fact that you had no choices? Only democracy can insure the future of our country.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin spent most of the last two days seemingly wrapped in a cocoon as he moved by helicopter and presidential limousine across the rich, agricultural  Red Belt of Russia, which solidly supported Communists in the parliamentary election in December. He saw few voters, came late to nearly every meeting and met almost exclusively with people who had been assigned to see him. **********But his trip carried huge symbolic freight. The day after he was registered as a candidate for re-election he flew directly to the place where his Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, is most popular. Co-opting much of Mr. Zyuganov's nationalist imagery, Mr. Yeltsin laid a wreath at a war memorial here, where as  many as 300,000 soldiers died fighting in the battle of Kursk during the summer  of 1943. He reminded everyone that he, too remembers that the enormous sacrifices of World War II remain a vivid and important part of Russian life. **********He met with entrepreneurs and priests who would have been imprisoned under the Communists and he visited a stunning new church here where he promised, \"freedom in society and a just regime.\" **********\"They told me there was a giant red cross planted here in this region,\" he said, referring to the large base of Communist support in Belgorod, where he arrived on Thursday. \"I don't see anything to be afraid of.\" **********That may be because there is nothing to be afraid of, and it may be because Mr. Yeltsin was not looking very hard. In a country where wages are often held up for months, Mr. Yeltsin managed to visit three factories where everyone is paid on time -- and handsomely, too, an average of over $350 a month. **********\"I want to see how he acts with us,\" said Lena Chenokovskaya, a 59- year-old  farm woman in Stary Oskol who lives on a pension and said she was not a fan of Mr. Yeltsin's but that she feared a return to power of the Communists. \"I want to see if he is going to act like a man of the people or like a king. We need a  real leader,\" she said. \"But we also need a man who is one of us.\" **********That has always been the 65-year-old President's strong point: if he drinks a little too much, well what Russian does not? If he is brusque, emotional and temperamental, those are well-loved components of the Russian soul. **********But during this campaign Mr. Yeltsin will have to prove anew that he remains  in touch with the struggling common citizen -- even as his principal opponent, Mr. Zyuganov, runs a race that essentially asks the pointed question, \"Are you better off today than you were five years ago?\" **********There was hardly a spontaneous moment on the two-day schedule. New paint dripped from the fences at the pig farm he visited on Thursday. This morning, at the Stoyansky Smelting Plant, in Stary Oskol, where President Yeltsin spoke with only a few of the factory's 6,000 industrial workers, it seemed as though every  piece of machinery was also dripping with a brand new coat of paint. **********\"We lived better under Brezhnev,\" an old woman shouted at him as his helicopter landed near a marketplace in the city of Gubkin. \"We can't eat now.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin rarely heard such criticism, but this time he nodded gravely and  told the woman that more money was on its way. And it is. Mr. Yeltsin told the crowd that broad increases in wages and pensions were coming. **********When the President was asked if he was visiting as a leader or a candidate, he laughed. **********\"I cannot separate those two functions,\" he said. \"As a candidate I can promise and as a President I can deliver.\" **********It was a glib reply but one on which much of the election will be decided. Although Mr. Yeltsin, who once trailed very badly in voter polls, is now closing the gap, most people say they are not happy with what he has delivered since he  became Russia's first democratically elected President in 1991. But the power of incumbency is enormous -- and he clearly using it. This morning, for example, he ordered one director of a private factory to raise all pension contributions. **********Still the President, whose health has suffered badly after two serious heart  ailments in the past year, often seemed to be delivering lines rather than answering questions. **********Asked at a giant metal factory what will happen in the war for the secessionst republic of Chechnya now that he has offered to negotiate with the leader of the rebels, Mr. Yeltsin replied flatly: \"You know the military activity there has stopped. We are still searching for small groups of bandits but a gradual pullout has begun. All will be well again.\" **********Nothing seems further from the truth. The fighting in Chechnya, after a lull  early in the week, has intensified greatly the past two days. Dozens of Russian  soldiers have been killed there this week, according to the military. **********But Presidents can rely on grand gestures and Mr. Yeltsin made a few while he was here. He signed three decrees aimed at pumping more money into the metal combines that dominate the northern part of the region. He told business executives he would cut their taxes, and he told every wage-earner he saw that salaries are growing and backlogs are now cleared. **********\"I think he is great,\" said Aleksandr Thachenko, a 46-year-old teacher who waited to seem him for nearly three hours in a biting wind outside the Peter and Paul Church in Prokhorovka. \"Running this country after what the Communists did  to it is a horrible burden. But he took that burden on his shoulders and he is doing the best that he can. So we have to support him. What other choice do we have?\" **********Mr. Yeltsin has already been successful in one of his most important tasks: making it seem as if there are only two candidates in the June election, himself and Mr. Zyuganov. In fact several other people, including the hard-line  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, are also candidates and could receive millions of votes. Mr. Zhirinovsky was officially registered as a candidate today. **********But the President has decided to run on a platform that consists basically of reminding everyone that he is better than the other choices. So far he has offered no new plans for the economy -- except to slow the move toward a free market -- but this strategy may well work. **********\"We don't see anything to be shy about reminding people of how it was before,\" said Sergei Medvedev, Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary. \"It is human nature to forget the bad and remember only the good. So people need to be reminded.

But he said the more open U.S. approach was a big plus. **********\"In Europe, lawyers are a necessary evil you call in when you want to make sure your contract is solid,\" he said. **********Mr. Koblitz, a U.S. State Department lawyer here in the late 1980s,was a senior American official supporting the German prosecutors office in the 1986 Libyan bombing of the LaBelle nightclub. **********He regularly visited Rudolf Hess in the Spandau prison to check up on the Nazi prisoner's condition and helped oversee spy exchanges.

It was set up by the fascist government in Croatia and administered by the Ustashe, the Croatian equivalent of the Nazi SS. **********The Croatian fascists adopted Nazi racial laws and set out to exterminate Jews, Gypsies and Serbs. Many other Croatian dissidents, including 12 Catholic priests, also died. **********President Tudjman, seeking to defuse criticism of the wartime government, says 28,000 people were killed at Jasenovac. Tito, eager to demonize his fascist rivals, said 700,000 people died. Both figures are dismissed as unrealistic by independent scholars in the United States, who estimate that about 80,000 people were killed here. **********\"The tragedy that took place here has become a dispute about numbers,\" said Dr. Slobodan Lang, whose grandparents died at the camp. \"Because the pain is painted in gray, collective tones, the suffering of individuals is ignored and manipulated. It is shameful.\" **********Many victims were unloaded from freight cars and killed immediately on the banks of the river, their bodies tossed into the water. The rest worked as slave laborers, digging clay out of the swampy banks to make bricks. Thousands died of disease, hunger and beatings. Crematoriums were built late in the war. **********The Communist Government of Yugoslavia kept the camp open until 1947, killing thousands of former Ustashe members and anti-Communist dissidents. **********Serbs use the camp to brand the Croats as unrepentant fascists. Croatian nationalists say the slaughter was about equal to the numbers of Croats killed by Serbian partisans and guerrillas. **********Croatian Jews -- of whom 80 percent of the prewar population of 68,000 died during the war -- are not acknowledged in Jasenovac. Gypsies are also ignored. **********\"If the truth is exposed, then the complexity of what took place can be revealed,\" said Ivan Juric, the city manager of Jasenovac, who had family members who were killed on both sides during World War II. \"But there are too many people who only want easy answers.

Like thousands of other Rwandan Hutu refugees, she shuffled into her home village on Saturday night with her few belongings propped on her head. Her nine hungry children stumbled behind her. **********But instead of finding a haven, she found only more trouble. Her house has been taken over by a Tutsi immigrant from Zaire who says he will not leave for at least two months. **********Mrs. Nyirandeme has no place to stay -- she slept by the side of the road on Saturday night -- and no way to make a living. Her children have not eaten for four days. **********Her husband, who had a job in a nearby town, was killed by Hutu militiamen in 1994 for sympathizing with the Tutsi. Before the civil war, in which a Tutsi-led rebel army overthrew the Hutu-led Government, she sold beer and dry goods. But now she has no money to restart her enterprise. **********''I don't know how to survive,'' she said. ''I wish I had something to sell, so I could start a business.'' **********As thousands of returning Rwandan refugees trickled into villages like this one today, they began to grapple with a host of new problems, trying to recover lives interrupted by two years of war and flight. Most said they lacked the basics: food, jobs and housing. **********The refugees are among hundreds of thousands who began pouring out of Zaire and back into Rwanda on Friday after spending two years in exile. The exodus started when Zairian rebels attacked the refugees' camps. **********The rebels, who have ties to Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government, routed the Hutu guerrillas who had prevented most of the refugees from returning. **********The majority of the refugees are Hutu who fled in 1994 to escape reprisals from an advancing Tutsi army for massacres of at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. But there are a few Tutsi among them as well. **********Many returning Hutu have discovered that their houses are occupied by Tutsi squatters and their lands are being farmed by strangers. Others have found that their houses were looted long ago or have fallen down from neglect. **********Almost all complain of hunger. Most have no prospect of getting a job anytime soon, nor will they be able to grow crops in time to avert starvation. The United Nations plans to distribute emergency food aid in villages later this week, but the program has not started yet. **********The steady stream of returning refugees has also caused some consternation for the Tutsi people who had stayed behind. Hidden in the river of refugees are some members of Hutu militias that carried out the massacres here in 1994. **********On the muddy streets of Rugerero, a village about six miles from the border with Zaire, a steady stream of exhausted and hungry people arrived today with their bundles of belongings. Neighbors came out to greet them. Family members who had not seen each other in two years embraced in the streets. **********The villagers coped the best they could with the influx, sharing food and offering those without homes floors to sleep on. For now there are plenty of bananas and avocados in the lush land around the village. **********But none of the refugees know how they will handle the days to come, how they will find enough to eat or how they will reclaim their property. **********Aseterie Nyiramaraba, 64, whose face bears the marks of years of worry, said that after two days of marching with her three grandchildren she arrived to find someone living in her house. As an older woman in a deeply patriarchal society, she felt she could not make a fuss, she said. Her son, the only man in the family, died of an illness in Zaire. **********''I came to my house and I saw other people there,'' she said, ''and I didn't want to disturb them. I went to my neighbors to stay. I don't want to kick them out of my house. I can stay with my neighbors until these people in my house go away.'' **********The family in Mrs. Nyiramaraba's house are refugees themselves -- Zairian Tutsi who came to Rwanda seven months ago to escape persecution by Hutu militias. **********''The Rwandan soldiers told me to come to this house,'' explained Alliete Vichakuzi, 22. ''If the soldiers come back to remove me, I will go. The Government will have to find a solution.'' **********Other returning refugees were more fortunate. Jean Demaseine Hatumaimana, 36, a former night watchman, skipped with joy around the village, shaking everyone's hand. The man who was squatting in his house moved out immediately, he said. **********''It was very lucky,'' he said. ''I'm very happy to see Rwanda has changed. It is a new Rwanda now. The neighbors are very nice. No one is accusing one another of anything.'' **********But accusations may yet come. Tutsi survivors of the carnage said they knew that some of the killers who carried out massacres in 1994 were drifting back. Most were confident that the Government would arrest them. **********''I'm not afraid,'' said Servonia Nyirademeye, 45, a Tutsi who lost four brothers in the mass killings. ''Everything is going to be all right here.'' **********Vincent Butera, the police chief for the Rubavu district in which this village lies, said the Government would root out the killers once people began to bring charges. **********''There will be no problem for the survivors,'' he said. ''There is a government here now. Nobody is going to touch them.'' **********But some Tutsi refugees say they have much to fear. Katarina Mukarugira, who is a Tutsi, spent the last two years in a refugee camp surrounded by Hutu militiamen. She fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape the same thugs, who killed her husband and her eldest son. She tried to leave the camp in 1995, but the militants threatened to kill her 10-year-old son and tried to cut his Achilles' tendon with a machete, she said. **********Mrs. Mukarugira came home to this village on Saturday, trailing her surviving four children. She found that her house had been razed by the Hutu militiamen who had killed her husband, and their small farm was overgrown. **********Like the Hutu refugees here, she has no way to make a living, and because Rwandan law does not allow women to inherit land, she has no claim to her husband's property. **********Then, this morning, she saw one of her husband's killers arrive in town, she said. His name, she says, is Gahutu. She does not know if she will ask the authorities to press charges. She is afraid of reprisals from her Hutu neighbors. **********''I don't want to yet,'' she said. ''I don't know how this Government works.'' **********In the meantime, she will rely on a cousin for a place to stay and some food. Her children, their bellies swollen from malnutrition, are eating unripe avocados off the trees. Her house is nothing but a pile of sticks overgrown with grass. **********''I have nothing,'' she said, sighing.

A big change in a magazine's total audience size -- which combines  circulation from subscriptions and newsstand sales with whatever other \"pass-along\" readers a publication has -- can have direct consequences on ad sales, so it's perhaps no surprise these numbers can be controversial. **********But the debate over the efficacy and quality of such data, while not exactly new, has intensified recently, in part because of two very public spats, pitting publishers against the leading syndicated research firm, Mediamark Research Inc. They involve Conde Nast, the magazine arm of Advance Publications, and, in another incident, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. **********In each case, the publishers contend that Mediamark's audience data do not do their publications justice. Mediamark concedes its time-honored measurement techniques have room for improvement but says its research is still valid. **********While the disputes are hardly the stuff of summer blockbusters, the technical questions they raise illustrate how contentious the whole process can be. The industry, prompted in part by these arguments, is finally trying to address the  broader issues of audience measurement. **********In early April, Steven Florio, the president and chief executive of Conde Nast, whose magazines include Vogue, Vanity Fair and GQ, publicly dismissed Mediamark, while still agreeing to honor the almost two years remaining on their contract. **********Among other things, Conde Nast says that Mediamark's methodology, which relies on 20,000 in-home interviews in the course of a year, particularly hurts  smaller magazines with specialized audiences, like Allure, which is aimed at young women readers. Stephen M. Blacker, senior vice president of market research for Conde Nast, said that the survey often wound up with minuscule samples of readers for smaller magazines, causing big year-to-year audience swings and wide margins of error in the data. **********The survey is also growing unwieldy, Mr. Blacker said, tiring interview subjects who must review logos of 223 different magazines and answer questions about other media and a growing roster of products. Alain Tessier, Mediamark's chairman and chief executive, said that the survey had expanded to meet client demands but that the company would like to shorten the process where possible. **********Another problem, according to Mr. Blacker, is that the home-survey method tends to underrepresent affluent individuals, who may lack the time or inclination to let an interviewer into their homes or who live in gated communities and doorman-guarded buildings. College-aged readers are also undercounted, he argued, because Mediamark and its smaller competitor, the Simmons Market Research Bureau, do not survey college dormitories. The researchers say that it is difficult to gain entry to such sites. **********Mr. Tessier, loathe to lose a major longtime client, said he wanted to address Conde Nast's concerns, like the size of the samples. **********Meanwhile, controversy brewed anew when Mediamark decided to withdraw new audience-research numbers from its annual spring survey for The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, and the Gannett Corporation's USA Today, instead using old ones. The newspapers placed an ad in Advertising Age to decry the move, and called on the advertising community to join their protest. **********What happened? Mr. Tessier said that Mediamark had, at the papers' request, removed them from the daily newspaper category and included them in the magazine part of the survey, since The Journal and USA Today said that their true rivals  were national magazines. **********But the papers showed enormous audience gains that did not correspond with how many readers traditionally pass around newspapers, Mediamark said. After reviewing the data, Mediamark felt the numbers were \"anomalous.\" Indeed, the rise each paper saw was not even proportionate to each other, suggesting that the survey was not accounting for some undetermined variable. **********In retrospect, Mr. Tessier said, Mediamark erred by not conducting field tests before putting the two dailies in the magazine survey to see how it skewed the data. **********Sam Sotiriou, executive vice president and worldwide media research director  at Ammirati Puris Lintas, said that many agencies continue to value Mediamark's  research, but that the episode showed the \"frailty of the measurement process.\" **********That said, the call to arms by the two dailies has not produced much response from the ad community. \"It can be a big, tough, boring technical issue,\" admitted Paul C. Atkinson, senior vice president of advertising at The Wall Street Journal. **********Dull or not, audience measurement makes the business go 'round. So a task force convened by the Magazine Publishers of America is joining with advertisers and the research companies to find ways to \"increase the sample size, make the data more stable and still have sound research without upping the cost tremendously,\" Kathi Love, the magazine group's research director, said. **********But disagreements persist. Some disgruntled publishers want to dump the Mediamark approach entirely, and support a proposed new mail survey with larger  samples just for magazines. No one knows for sure how well that procedure would  work.

Last week, 26 members of Congress from both parties urged the F.C.C. to look into the distillers' decision, which was also criticized by President Clinton. **********''This is a big testing period,'' Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview this evening. If broadcasters decide to accept liquor ads over the holidays, he suggested, he would seek to muster a commission majority to conduct an inquiry that could produce a Government-imposed ban. **********The focus on underage viewers seemed to reflect a heightened interest within the Administration for regulatory action aimed at protecting young people, a constant theme of Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. **********In another example, the Food and Drug Administration adopted rules in August  that prohibit cigarette advertising and sales to minors. Those regulations take effect within two years. **********Although an F.T.C. spokeswoman said she could not comment directly on a specific investigation, the outlines of which were reported by The Wall Street Journal today, she noted that the agency's mandate was to monitor ads for deception and unfairness. She said the possibility that beer and liquor companies might be trying to focus on underage drinkers was ''a source of concern to the F.T.C.'' **********Another official, who requested anonymity, said the F.T.C. staff had been authorized to use its subpoena power to obtain information from various parties, specifically broadcasters. **********The official said the agency had undertaken the investigation under its authority to police fairness in advertising, rather than its authority to examine cases of deception in ads. **********This suggested that Stroh was being examined for running ads at times when children were likely to be watching. **********Lacey Logan, a spokeswoman for Stroh, the nation's fourth-largest brewer, said the company had not yet received a subpoena and could not comment on the F.T.C. inquiry. But she added, ''Stroh absolutely does not market its beers to people under 21 and our advertising content and placement is clearly targeted to legal-age consumers.'' **********Ms. Logan and outside analysts said they were puzzled that Stroh was singled out by the F.T.C. The company, based in Detroit, has a reputation for cautious marketing and has a tiny advertising budget compared with that of its far-larger rivals, Anheuser-Busch and the Miller Brewing unit of Philip Morris. **********According to Competitive Media Reporting in New York, Stroh spent $4.7 million to advertise its Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, Colt 45, Lone Star and other brands last year, while the G. Heileman Brewing Company, which Stroh acquired this year, spent $5.9 million. By contrast Anheuser-Busch and Miller spent about $275 million each. **********''What's going on here? You've got me,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Paine Webber in San Francisco, who follows the beer industry. He speculated the F.T.C. might be figuring that ''it's easier to go after Stroh'' because it might be financially less able to mount a strenuous defense. **********A spokeswoman for Seagram in New York, Karin Timpone, also said her company had yet to receive a subpoena. But she said she suspected the focus of the investigation was the content of Seagram's liquor commercials. One Seagram spot, for Crown Royal Canadian whisky, features two dogs, while a second, for Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, features a peacock and a duck. Advocates for children have contended that animals and animal characters in such ads are intended to appeal to an underage audience. **********An official at the Beer Institute, Jeff Becker, reacted cautiously to word of the F.T.C. inquiry, calling it premature to comment before the dimensions and the status of the investigation become clearer. But he said, ''Anything that affects our ability to advertise, we are concerned about.'' **********An F.T.C. challenge several years ago to the way brewers promote their product to college students ended with an agreement to bar certain practices, like sales pitches to underage audiences. But the commission in 1985 brushed off a petition by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which sought an industrywide investigation of all alcoholic beverage advertising and enforcement actions against those found deceptive or unfair. **********At that time, the agency found ''no reliable basis on which to conclude that alcohol advertising significantly affects alcohol abuse.'' **********The investigation that was disclosed today was unanimously approved by the commissioners in the last five days, with the Stroh inquiry to focus on ''the time and placement of ads,'' an agency official said. **********Activists who contend that advertising for alcoholic beverages is aimed at encouraging drinking among minors have urged Government scrutiny of commercials for distilled spirits that Seagram has run since last spring on local cable TV systems and broadcast stations. But until today there had been no indication that pitches for other alcoholic beverages might be the focus of regulators' interest. **********''We're not happy to see the F.T.C. launch an investigation into advertising of any legal product,'' said Hal Shoup, executive vice president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and director of that trade group's Washington's office. ''It certainly wasn't on our wish list for the holiday season.'' **********Nevertheless, ''in this product area,'' he added, ''there has been too much said by too many people in high places for the matter to be ignored.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/23/world/world-news-briefs-house-moves-to-prevent-use-of-journalists-as-spies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;House Moves to Prevent Use of Journalists as Spies", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;House Moves to Prevent Use of Journalists as Spies", "body_text": " **********The Central Intelligence Agency would be prohibited from using journalists as spies under a House proposal passed overwhelmingly today.

She was in for a shock. **********Last October, counting on the auspicious history of technology stocks and bold water-cooler tales of success, Mrs. Williams invested 40 percent of the money in her employee retirement plan in two volatile Fidelity funds -- Select Developing Communications and Select Computers -- and waited for a big return. **********''Everyone was in tech stocks and they were doing great, and we just jumped on the bandwagon,'' said Mrs. Williams, 30. Then she received her first quarterly statement. ''You see a negative return,'' she said. ''You wonder if you are doing the right thing.'' **********The realization was a bit unnerving for Mrs. Williams, a meticulous sort who is director of finance and international business for the School of Continuing Studies at Johns Hopkins. ''It made us realize we needed more diversity,'' she said. ''Plus, we were out of debt so we really needed to look at the big picture -- insurance, investing, everything.'' **********Being clear of debt attests to Mrs. Williams's financial discipline. When she and her husband were married almost two years ago, four years after meeting at a party for her swim team, the couple were saddled with about $10,000 in credit-card debt, mostly his. **********''When I was in between jobs, I got into that credit-card crunch,'' said Mr. Williams, 32, a job recruiter since 1992 and a marketing manager before that. ''For about two years I wasn't real smart about how I handled it.'' **********After they married, Mrs. Williams took their finances in hand. They scrimped where possible and reduced debt, paying off the cards with the highest interest rates first, then throwing them away. At the bottom of the real estate market, with the help of Mr. Williams's parents, the couple bought a $143,000 house with a view of a marina in the downtown Baltimore neighborhood of Canton. Cash not devoted to reducing credit-card debt went toward basic home furnishings. **********Now, in just two years, the house is stocked, the credit-card debt gone and the couple's earning power has jumped. Mrs. Williams's salary at Johns Hopkins has leapt from $35,000 to $49,000. And Mr. Williams's salary as a self-employed corporate headhunter -- now under contract to find computer professionals for Lockheed Martin -- climbed from $40,000 to $60,000. ''After we got out of the hole, we realized, man, we should be able to save a lot of money,'' Mr. Williams said. **********And save they did. Mrs. Williams invests primarily through the Johns Hopkins 403(b) plan -- basically, a 401(k) for nonprofit companies -- in which she can contribute up to $9,500 a year, according to the university's human resources representative. To participate in the plan, she must contribute at least 6 percent of the portion of her salary over $30,000. Then the university will contribute an additional 6 percent of her total  salary, which would be $2,940. Currently, Mrs. Williams is investing about $6,500 a year in equity funds through the plan. Mr. Williams has put about $2,600 into a retirement fund, ''mostly for the current tax advantage.'' **********On top of that, the pair has amassed $12,000 in a bank savings account, earning 2.5 percent interest, and $2,000 in checking, and they believed they could save $1,500 to $2,000 a month. **********Mrs. Williams continues to watch expenses and is an inveterate discount shopper. **********''I am very lucky,'' Mr. Williams said. ''You hear these horror stories about wives who buy out the stores, but Pam's spending is very conservative. Except for shoes.'' **********THE couple acknowledges two other weaknesses: One is dining out at the numerous neighborhood restaurants, for which they budget $2,000 yearly, and the other is vacations. ''We are into cheap vacations,'' Mr. Williams said. ''We will probably just drive down to the Outer Banks for a week, and that will cost about $1,000.'' **********Mrs. Williams replied, ''We can do it for $600.'' **********They plan to spend $5,000 a year for vacations and other recreation, which includes membership at a swim club where Mrs. Williams trains for the annual 4.4-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Swim. Mr. Williams, a basketball devotee, has recently taken up swimming with his wife. **********For the big-picture planning, the Williamses visited Horan & Associates, certified financial planners in Glen Arm, Md.  The couple's goals are to start a family in the next two to three years and to lay the groundwork for Mrs. Williams to retire at age 55 and for Mr. Williams to retire at 65. **********Patrick J. Horan and Damian J. Gallina, two financial planners at the firm, started by suggesting that the couple be fully insured. Predictably, the couple's health plan, a Blue Cross-Blue Shield family plan, was through Johns Hopkins, and the planners advised the Williamses to stay with it. But the couple lacked disability insurance. **********''Your ability to save money each month is without question your single greatest asset,'' the planners wrote in their analysis. ''You would have difficulty meeting living expenses in disability on just one income.'' The university will soon offer Mrs. Williams disability insurance of 60 percent of basic income through age 65, but Mr. Williams needed his own policy, so the planners recommended one from the Paul Revere Life Insurance Company. It would provide up to $3,400 a month until Mr. Williams reached 65, at a cost of $1,108.78 a year. **********Horan & Associates also suggested that the couple take out life insurance, but only a term policy for 20 years, by which time they should have saved enough not to need insurance. **********Because Mr. and Mrs. Williams are in their early 30's, they can invest in riskier funds -- much as Mrs. Williams did initially. ''Investors who maintain a long-term investment horizon can be more aggressive and are generally rewarded for their patience,'' said the Horan report, which suggested that the couple take $2,000 from savings to invest in a mutual fund, then make regular monthly investments together. **********The planners suggested that the Williamses choose a risk level they will be comfortable with -- aggressive growth, growth or moderate growth -- and then pick  one or both of the two funds the planners recommended for that level. For aggressive growth, the Horan firm liked the Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund and PBHG Growth. For growth, the planners suggested Mutual Discovery and Oakmark, and for moderate growth, Mutual Qualified and T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth. **********Horan noted that some of the couple's current investments were weak and should be moved into the recommended mutual funds. One of these is Mr. Williams's I.R.A.  of $2,600, invested in two fixed annuities earning 5 percent. The surrender charge for cashing out of the annuity would be offset by the expected higher gains from rolling over the retirement money into stock fund investments. Mrs. Williams has $4,300 in an I.R.A. invested in the CGM Mutual fund, a conservative balanced fund, which Horan said should also go into the more aggressive mutual funds. **********For her 403(b) investment, which allows Mrs. Williams to choose from a number of funds from Fidelity, Vanguard, Twentieth Century and several other groups, the planners recommended that she get out of the two technology funds whose volatility unnerved her, as well as the Fidelity Asset Manager Growth fund that made up the rest of her original 403(b) investment. She should maximize her contribution, they said, and, as with the couple's other investments, stress growth. **********They suggested putting 40 percent in Fidelity Magellan because they like the new management; 40 percent in the Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund because it is a value fund, and 20 percent in Fidelity Overseas, creating a pool of money that would be insulated from a severe decline in the domestic market. If there is such a plunge, cash could be taken from the foreign fund to buy undervalued United States stocks. **********FINALLY, the couple's reserves are  completely in cash, earning 2.5 percent interest. The Williamses want three months' worth of expenses -- $22,000, including their taxes -- for emergencies. But Horan suggested keeping no more than $12,000 in cash because the mutual funds could be sold quickly if needed. The $12,000 cash, for immediate needs like a car down payment or home repair, should be moved from the bank savings account into a money market fund to earn about 4.8 percent, Horan said. **********Although the suggested program leans completely on equities, the Williamses say they will adopt it because it achieves the diversification they want. ''We are in mutuals, not single stocks, so I feel protected,'' Mrs. Williams said. ''And we are young enough that it would be foolish not to be aggressive.'' **********From here, the couple plan to invest and hold, and hope that their investing will, like their courtship, go swimmingly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/17/business/gm-strike-drags-down-industrial-output.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

The shift to the East has meant that only a handful of funds still provide any exposure across the emerging economies of Europe, often described as Europe's periphery. **********Micropal, the London-based fund monitoring group, currently tracks only three emerging Europe funds: the Baring fund; the $16 million BBL Invest Emerging Europe fund run by Banque Bruxelles, and Morgan Grenfell's $4 million EMF European Emerging Markets fund. **********Roy Bracher, the manager of the Invesco East Europe Development Fund, regards Eastern Europe as an economic, rather than geographic, label. He now invests in Kazakstan and the Baltic Republics as well as Russia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. The $185 million fund, which was launched in 1990 and has generated a 10 percent return since the beginning of this year, invests principally in high growth consumer goods companies. **********Stefan Bottcher, manager of the $130 million FFF Fleming Eastern Europe fund, is also becoming active in Russia although his fund still focuses on Central Europe. **********\"The Polish and Hungarian markets have appreciated strongly over the past year although we believe they still offer good value,\" he said. \"But the Russian market has an upside potential of between 50 and 100 percent after the election. **********\"Longer term,\" he added, \"the growth in unquantifiable. So we are not even close to a full long term investment in Russia yet.\" **********Flemings also launched a $80 million Russian fund in August 1994. **********According to Mr. Bottcher, both funds are considering investments in the Ukraine, Kazakstan and the Baltic states. **********\"The best performing funds lately in the region are the Russian and Baltic state funds,\" said Oscar Blanco, a researcher at Micropal. \"Not surprisingly, we have seen a large number of Russian fund launches recently.\" The number has jumped about 80 percent over the last 12 months, he said. **********All told, Micropal tracks 21 funds that concentrate on Russia, and five funds that focus on the Baltic states. That compares with 31 that invest across Eastern Europe. Many more Russian funds are expected to join these ranks next year. That's good news for private investors in what have hitherto been illiquid markets. **********Many fund managers believe that at least parts of emerging Europe now offers enough scope for adequately diversified investments but warn that private investors should only consider funds with wide asset spreads. Although there is some correlation in the markets' performance, they often perform very differently, they said. **********\"There has been a noticeable shift to Central and Eastern Europe because the stock markets have more stability now,\" observed Lesley Chadwick at Fund Research in London. \"Investors who have been previously put off by the volatility are now looking for alternative investments, particularly as the Western European markets converge.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/world/a-familiar-mideast-pattern.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 21, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Familiar Mideast Pattern", "print_headline": "A Familiar Mideast Pattern", "body_text": " **********Israel's offensive against Islamic guerrillas in Southern Lebanon is a dance  whose steps are sadly familiar.

But that has not necessarily made the group  or its director, Dr. Reginald Boulos, popular here. **********On the contrary, when Dr. Boulos escorted Tipper Gore, who was visiting Haiti with her husband, Vice President Al Gore, on a tour of the centers last fall, their caravan was stoned. Now, citing death threats against him and his 1,500 employees, Dr. Boulos has closed his 114-bed hospital and three clinics and offered to hand them over to the Haitian Government -- which has, to the consternation of Cite Soleil's residents, rejected the proposal. **********I believe that 100 percent of the problem is related not to the quality of  the health care we were offering, but to politics,\" Dr. Boulos said in an interview at the headquarters of his organization, known by its French initials, C.D.S. \"Politically, this place is a gold mine: more than 200,000 people living  in less than two square miles.\" **********As Dr. Boulos, an American-educated Haitian of Arab descent, sees it, the hostility toward him stems from a widespread perception that he is not a supporter of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's former President, and the governing Lavalas movement, which Mr. Aristide continues to dominate. The Haitian Government has repeatedly failed to respond to his requests for police protection, he said, \"sending a clear signal to me that they see Cite Soleil as  their turf and want me out of there.\" **********Not so, replied Dr. Rudolphe Mallebranche, Haiti's Minister of Health. \"It was a problem of financing,\" he maintained. \"Dr. Boulos's international funding  was drying up.\" **********Asked for their version of events, aid donors acknowledged plans to channel assistance away from the project beginning in July, but said they were doing so  at the specific request of the Haitian Government. **********Whatever its cause, the dispute has left Cite Soleil's residents, who are among the most destitute people in Haiti, living in squalor without any organized health care. At St. Catherine's Maternity Hospital, for instance, deliveries of babies have ceased altogether and eight Sisters of Charity have been struggling since mid-April to maintain a few basic services for pregnant women and infants, such as vaccines and food. **********\"We simply could not abandon these people, so of course we decided to stay,\"  said one of the harried nuns, a Spaniard who was willing to disclose only her first name, Sister Milagros. \"Too many children were dying. It was terrible.\" **********On one recent morning, the nuns were forced to turn away a young woman who had come with her listless, emaciated infant, its eyes rolling and unfocused, because they did not have the medicine the child needed. Disheartened, the penniless mother sat in the courtyard sobbing, the baby in her arms, until she was given bus fare to get to a municipal infirmary downtown. **********Outside the hospital, graffiti proclaiming that \"Boulos = Health\" have replaced the slogans that once attacked the C.D.S. director as a \"zenglendo,\" or associate of the Tontons Macoute, the paramilitary thugs who flourished under the 30-year Duvalier family dictatorship and its military successors. Patients say they want the group to come back and run the hospital, whose budget is largely underwritten by the United States Agency for International Development,  but they seem unsure of how to do that or where to turn for help in the interim. **********\"Now I've resigned myself to the fact that I'll get skinny and die,\" said Sonia Leres, 23, an unemployed mother of two who suffers from tuberculosis, along with her 3-year-old daughter, Carola. \"If I can't get free X-rays and medicine here anymore, what am I going to do?\" **********Dr. Mallebranche said that while he is sympathetic to the plight of the nuns  and the residents of Cite Soleil, the Haitian Government can do little for them  at the moment. \"You can understand that the Ministry of Health, which does not have much money, is not prepared for this situation,\" he explained. \"We have to plan for this, to evaluate the situation at the center.\" **********The director of one foreign aid organization that has long supported the Cite Soleil project said the main problem is one of competence. \"We're not going to   make fools of this Government and ourselves,\" he said. \"We can't turn over implementation to them because they simply can't do it.\" **********Aid donors here said they sent a joint letter to Dr. Mallebranche recently, warning that $42.5 million in international health assistance was languishing in the Government bureaucracy would be sent elsewhere unless the Ministry began dispensing it. \"While he wants all the money to go through his desk, he has no capacity to administer anything,\" complained one donor in an interview. **********Community groups that support the Lavalas movement have long been hostile to  Dr. Boulos and his organization. During the three brutal years of military dictatorship that preceded Mr. Aristide's restoration to power in October 1994,  they accused him of providing information on his clients to the paramilitary thugs who killed hundreds of people in Cite Soleil as well as of supplying jobs  and food to some of the most notorious gunmen. **********Dr. Boulos admits to trying not to antagonize the military regime and its agents, but said it was \"a conscious decision\" taken to avoid the shutdown of the hospital and a program that fed 29,000 people. \"There were enough human rights groups making noise, and I felt that my duty as a doctor was to provide humanitarian assistance,\" he said. **********After American troops returned Mr. Aristide to power, the level of acrimony diminished somewhat, and Dr. Boulos was even invited to join a government task force on education. But when the episode involving Mrs. Gore was followed by other attacks, he left the country for four months and began to look more favorably on the idea of shifting the focus of his activities to the Haitian countryside. **********\"That was an incident designed to embarrass me, and it did,\" Dr. Boulos said. \"It achieved its purpose, which was to put me in a difficult situation with my funding agencies.\" **********Even if C.D.S. were asked to return to Cite Soleil, Dr. Boulos added, he would not do so. The group is expanding its activities in the northeast of Haiti, he said, where local officials are grateful for any outside help and political rivalries are less of a factor. **********Nevertheless, \"my dream is for the Government to succeed in picking up where  we left off in Cite Soleil,\" Dr. Boulos said. \"If all of this stays closed, then we have failed too.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/31/business/gec-alsthom-in-merger-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-31", "snippet": "GEC Alsthom says it is in talks to take control of Framatome Connectors SA (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GEC Alsthom In Merger Talks", "print_headline": "GEC Alsthom In Merger Talks", "body_text": " **********GEC Alsthom said yesterday that it was in talks to take control of Framatome Connectors S.A., a mostly state-owned French producer of nuclear power plants with annual sales of about 17.9 billion francs ($3.5 billion).

Ashley Davis of the Air Force and his co-pilot, Capt. Tim Schafer, had  good reasons to forget about trying to land in the pouring rain at Dubrovnik, Croatia, on the afternoon of April 3. **********The captains had never seen the Dubrovnik airport, and the lowering rain clouds made it impossible for them to see it now. **********Croatia Airlines will not let its own crews land there if both the pilot and co-pilot have never done it before. The Air Force told pilots based in the United States never to land there in anything but clear weather. **********But the Air Force commanders in Europe -- the captains' superiors -- decided to ignore that. **********And so Captain Davis, 35, and Captain Schafer, 33, pressed on with Flight IFOR 21. Nearly 12 miles out, heading southeast, their military Boeing 737 passed over a navigation beacon. They were right on course. **********But sometime during the next four minutes something went terribly wrong. A startled United Nations military officer in the hills outside the city heard the jet roar overhead and told a colleague, \"That guy's way off course.\" **********The correct flight path to Dubrovnik's single runway was a course of 119 degrees. **********But the pilots, flying on rudimentary instruments, followed a course of 109  degrees -- straight at the highest mountain for miles around. Seconds later the  plane slammed into the peak and exploded, killing all 35 people aboard, including Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. It was 98 feet shy of clearing the summit. **********What went wrong that afternoon may never be known -- in part because the Air  Force never installed data or cockpit voice recorders on the plane. Croatian authorities say the crash was caused by pilot error. The Air Force declines comment on its inquiry. **********But an examination of the crash shows shortcomings in the equipment and procedures of the Air Force units that fly V.I.P.'s around the world. Taken together, they made the landing at Dubrovnik more dangerous. Acknowledging some  of those shortcomings, the Pentagon said on Friday that it would improve the safety and navigation equipment on its passenger airplanes. **********The review discloses these details: ***********The plane that carried Mr. Brown to his death could not have flown commercially in the United States because it would not have met civilian safety standards. The Air force has resisted meeting those standards. So the planes that fly Cabinet secretaries, lawmakers and the President's family to far-flung airports lack safety innovations pioneered by civilian manufacturers and the military itself. Dubrovnik's poorly equipped airport may be typical of the third world, but in many ways so was the 22-year-old plane. ***********The pilots were navigating with a compass and a radio receiver. Air Force generals called that equipment \"primitive\" and \"rudimentary.\" A member of the unit that flies V.I.P.'s compared it to working with a typewriter in the computer age. The pilots of IFOR 21 had limited experience with the outmoded navigational system used to guide planes to the Dubrovnik airport. ***********On Feb. 1, after an inspection, the Air Force's Air Mobility Command forbade all United States-based planes under its control, including V.I.P. flights from  Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, from landing at Dubrovnik except in clear  weather and in daylight. The decision by the Air Force command in Europe to fly  there anyway -- which it is free to do under present procedures -- demonstrates  a \"disconnect\" within the Air Force, said Maj. Gen. Mike McCarthy, director of Air Force staff operations. ***********Rescue efforts were chaotic. An automatic signaling device on the plane that should have immediately sent up the radio equivalent of a flare did not work, Croatian officials said. The American military took two hours to start its search and eight hours to reach the wreckage, while the one known survivor of the crash, Sgt. Shelly Kelly of the Air Force, lay in mortal agony on the hillside. She died soon after she was finally found. **********In addition, colleagues of Captain Davis and Captain Schafer colleagues in the 76th Airlift Squadron, based in Ramstein, Germany, say they must cope with \"get-there-itis,\" which pits prudence against punctuality when carrying distinguished passengers on tight schedules. **********\"It's inherent, because you know they have important meetings,\" said one squadron member. General McCarthy said \"there is some pressure from the V.I.P. to get there,\" but he and other Air Force officers say they are successfully combating the problem. **********Still, a flight instructor and former Air Force officer said he could imagine Captain Davis in the cockpit \"having a conversation with himself, saying, 'What  am I doing here?' but at the same time thinking, 'I've got to get these people there.' \" **********The instructor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: \"The bottom line is the pilot should never have attempted the approach. He's shooting a difficult approach he's not really qualified to do -- he's never been to the airport, it's difficult, the ceilings are down to the minimums.\" **********On Friday, Secretary of Defense William J. Perry ordered the military to equip its 2,800 passenger planes with much more precise navigation gear. But why didn't Flight IFOR 21 already have the best safety and navigation devices available? **********In part, because the Air Force sees its mission as fighting wars, not ferrying passengers, said John L. McLucas, a former Secretary of the Air Force and head of the Federal Aviation Administration. **********\"A Ron Brown, let's say, walking up to an airplane, should be in a position where he can say: This is an airplane that is subject to Government inspection;  therefore I should expect certain things,\" like \"the latest and greatest safety  equipment,\" Mr. McLucas said. \"But the Air Force doesn't look at it that way.\" It sees the work of ferrying distinguished passengers as \"just a thing we do in  our spare time\" -- not a mission, but a job. **********General McCarthy called that characterization \"blatantly unfair.\" Even so, Col. Kerry May, a top Air Force staff safety official, acknowledged that \"safety is not the Air Force's primary mission.\" **********Day of Dark Clouds Conditions Risky, But Not Impossible **********April 3 was a full day for the peripatetic Mr. Brown, his party of aides and  business executives and a New York Times reporter, Nathaniel C. Nash. **********Their pilot was Captain Davis of the 76th Airlift Squadron. His friends called him A. J. He had 2,906 flying hours as an Air Force pilot, but only 141 hours commanding military 737's, the equivalent of four 35-hour working weeks. He flew Hillary Clinton on her trip to Bosnia and Turkey last month. Defense Secretary Perry was a recent and frequent passenger aboard the plane. **********At daybreak, Mr. Brown and his group took off from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, for Tuzla, headquarters of American forces in Bosnia. The pilots flew the empty plane to Split, away from the crowded Tuzla field, and returned to pick up their passengers after lunch. They then left Tuzla for Dubrovnik, flying southwest toward Split before looping southeast down the Adriatic coast. **********The rain, wind and fog were bad for April -- but not as bad as early reports  about the crash suggested. Five planes landed at Dubrovnik shortly before the accident. **********\"We often see that kind of weather,\" said Capt. Mario Sarinic, who landed a Croatian Government Sabreliner with officials on board at Dubrovnik at 1:19 P.M. that day, 99 minutes before the crash. \"Basically the wind was very steady -- not gusty. The crosswind was almost nothing.\" **********Croatian and Air Force officials say there was moderate rain, no lightning, broken clouds at 400 feet, an overcast sky at 2,000 feet, a 12-knot wind and five miles of visibility at the airport at the time of the crash. **********A Canadair Challenger, another executive jet, carrying Prime Minister Zlateko Matesa of Croatia and the American Ambassador, Peter Galbraith, landed safely at 2:10 P.M. Forty minutes later, Capt. Amir Sehic, the Challenger pilot, spoke with Captain Davis and Captain Schafer from his cockpit. Mr. Brown's plane was due in 10 minutes. \"I was sure they would land,\" Captain Sehic said. **********But he warned the pilots that the lowering rain clouds were near the minimum  ceiling allowed by the airport, 2,150 feet above ground level. Those same conditions would have forbidden any attempt to land at Dubrovnik by United States-based Air Force jets transporting V.I.P.'s. **********Captain Sehic said he told the pilots that if they could not land, they should turn back to Split. **********The pilots of Flight IFOR 21 flew on. **********Ill-Equipped Airport **********Air Tower Missing Vital Instruments **********Before war fractured Yugoslavia, the Dubrovnik airport had what is called an  instrument landing system, an electronic navigation aid that guides pilots both  horizontally and vertically. **********Pilots prefer the system -- so much so that the Air Force refused to fly United States troops into Tuzla last year until American technicians installed one. American and Croatian officials say the system would have significantly reduced the chance of a crash at Dubrovnik because it would have warned the pilots they were off course. **********But Dubrovnik lost its instrument landing system in 1991, when advancing Serb forces overran the airport and stole it. The United Nations, NATO and European nations did not respond to Croatia's pleas for $400,000 to buy a new one. Then,  in September 1994, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development offered  a $22 million loan to upgrade all of Croatia's airports. **********The new instrument landing system was to be in place by October 1995. But the Croatian Parliament took six months to approve the contract, and then Croatian attacks on Serb separatists in Croatia held up the loan again. The system was still being shipped by sea from the United States on the day of the crash. **********Anatomy of a Disaster Difficult Approach, And a Slow Drift **********As the rain beat down on the runway, IFOR 21's instruments searched for a radio beacon on the tiny island of Kolocep, 11.8 miles from the Dubrovnik airport. It was one of two beacons along the coast sending signals to set the pilots on the path to the runway. **********The pilots were unable to see through the clouds. They lacked any guidance from an instrument landing system or, better still, data from the military's Global Positioning System, which can pinpoint a plane's location anywhere in the world and which the Pentagon promised on Friday to install on its 2,800 passenger planes. **********Those radio signals from the beacon on Kolocep island were the pilots' strongest link to the world below the clouds. **********A beacon approach is \"difficult, especially in bad weather, and when you don't know the terrain,\" said Fran Gavranovic, a pilot with Croatia Airlines who flies Boeing 737's to Dubrovnik. The beacons are old technology, now rare at major American airports, but still used in Europe, Africa, Central Asia and the  former Soviet Union -- all destinations for the 76th Squadron's V.I.P.'s. **********Instead of the newer, more accurate alternatives, IFOR 21's instrument panel  had a compass and a single radio receiver, called an Automatic Direction Finder, what a member of the 76th Squadron described as the navigational equivalent of a typewriter. **********The A.D.F., as the receiver is called, points at the beacons when tuned in to the proper frequency. As the pilots approached the first beacon, with their receiver set to a frequency of 318 AM, they picked up a constantly repeating Morse code signal: Da dit da, dit da diddit, dit da da dit. K,L,P, or Kilo Lima  Papa. **********Tapes from Croatia's nationwide radar system, which is monitored in Zagreb, were reviewed after the crash and show the plane was on course at the point it crossed over that beacon, according to Croatian investigators. Now the pilots' main task was to keep the plane on track, a course of 119 degrees. **********The second radio beacon stands 1.9 miles from the Dubrovnik runway, broadcasting the Morse code letters Charlie Victor on a different AM frequency.  Pilots typically tune in this signal after they fly over Kilo Lima Papa. If they are on course, the needle on their A.D.F. will point straight toward the runway. **********At the same time, they are supposed to descend from 4,000 feet to a level flight at 2,150 feet. Then they look down. If they still cannot see the runway by the time they are over the second beacon, they must abort their approach, turn right toward the sea and try again -- or land elsewhere. **********IFOR 21 had the most cumbersome possible equipment for navigating an approach with two radio beacons. **********Airliners that frequently make approaches using two beacons are typically equipped with two A.D.F. receivers, each tuned to one beacon. Other planes, such as the 737's flown by Croatia Airlines, have a single A.D.F. that switches between preset frequencies with the flick of a switch. **********IFOR 21 had neither. Its receiver had to be manually -- and quickly -- retuned, with the co-pilot twirling a metallic knob as he strained to hear the Morse code signals through the static. **********Until they tune in the second beacon, pilots must calculate their course from the tail end of the A.D.F. needle as it points backward at the first beacon. **********\"It's one of the most difficult things we teach in flying,\" said Michael Swanigan, vice president of flight operations at Alaska Airlines, which frequently lands at airports with beacons. \"In my own experience in the military, it's one of the most difficult things to grasp and understand,\" said Mr. Swanigan, a 737 captain and a former Air Force instructor. **********Watching their one A.D.F. needle, trying to tune in the second beacon, talking to the control tower, flying through turbulence and gauging the wind, looking out the window for the ground, configuring the airplane for a steep descent and getting ready to decide whether to land, the pilots were busy. Perhaps too busy to see that they had been drifting dangerously off course. **********The Final Minutes The Fatal Mistake Remains a Mystery **********No one knows what happened next. **********The pilots might have been unable to tune in the second beacon, or had trouble navigating away from the first one. A sudden change in the wind might have blown them off course, although the pilots are trained to overcome that. Croatian investigators say there was no lightning, but any electrical storm could have thrown off their compass. **********Were the pilots adequately trained to use the beacons for their approach? **********The question is a \"significant part\" of the official inquiry, said a spokesman for the crash investigation board. Captain Davis had made four beacon  landings since January, and Captain Schafer six, the Air Force said. **********However, a pilot with the 76th Squadron said those landings probably were training sorties at the Saarbrucken airfield in Germany, an approach they knew quite well. **********Flying a beacon approach to a familiar airfield gives a pilot \"a home-court advantage,\" General McCarthy said; a strange airport is \"an away game.\" Col. Robert Rhodes, the 76th's Squadron's commander from 1991 to 1993, said he would  never send a crew to a place they had never been unless they were highly experienced and had done \"intense, intense\" analysis of the approach and the airfield. **********Did the pilots ever tune in the second beacon? Miljenko Radic, an experienced pilot and member of the Croatian investigating team, believes they did not. If they had, they would have seen the arrow on their compass pointing farther and farther off the proper 119 degree course, an unmistakable sign of approaching disaster. **********Were the beacons working properly? Croatian officials say they were. And they were when other planes landed that day. A few days after the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration tested the beacons and found them to be in good  order. **********Three days after the crash, the chief of maintenance at the Dubrovnik Airport, Niko Jerkic, killed himself. In recent interviews, neighbors said he was despondent over a failed romance, and Croatian officials say his suicide had nothing to do with the accident. **********The pilots' final radio transmissions to the tower gave no hint of trouble. In their last communication, they calmly asked for permission to land. The tower responded at 2:56 P.M.: all clear on the runway. **********About two minutes later, the plane hit the top of St. John the Baptist, a mountain 1.6 miles north of the runway, and exploded. **********A Search Delayed Conflicting Signals Let Rescuers Stray **********An American search and rescue team took until the next day to reach the crash site, a delay that may have cost the only known survivor her life. **********The crash site should have been located immediately. But the plane's crash position indicator, a device that emits a signal from a downed plane, did not work, according to Croatian investigators. Boeing, the plane's maker, refused to comment publicly. **********At 3:30 P.M., Croatian authorities concluded the plane had crashed, and they  began a search. Ambassador Galbraith immediately relayed that news to the State  Department in Washington. But the American military did not order a search for another 80 minutes. **********The United States Special Forces command in Brindisi, Italy, says in an official chronology that it received conflicting intelligence reports about the  plane's fate, including one report, more than an hour after the crash, that the  plane was still in the air. French NATO forces based at the Croatian town of Ploce further muddled the picture by reporting that the plane had crashed in the sea, near the island of Kolocep. When the Special Forces helicopters finally took off from Brindisi at 5:30 P.M., they spent hours skimming the Adriatic, looking for wreckage that was not there. **********Where technology failed, a villager succeeded. Ivo Djurkovic of the tiny town of Velji Do, population 45, was taking hay to his cattle when he heard the plane passing overhead. \"I heard something bump in the mountain and explode,\" he said. \"I thought, are they shelling it again or what?\" The village was on the front lines back in 1991, and the surrounding hills had been shelled periodically since. **********Three hours later, the fog lifted a little and Mr. Djurkovic saw the white tail of the plane on the mountainside. There being no phone in his village, he got in his small Fiat, drove five miles down a narrow winding road to a friend's house, and called the police in Cavtat. **********At about 7:20 P.M., two policemen and Mr. Djurkovic arrived at the site, having hiked the last several hundred feet up the steep, rocky slope in the cold rain. Cutting through twisted metal, they found one survivor, in the tail of the plane, crushed by galley equipment. It was Sergeant Kelly, 36, of Zanesville, Ohio. She tried to stand up, and lost consciousness, Croatian investigators said. **********Croatian officials relayed the crash coordinates to Mr. Galbraith within 20 minutes. He passed them to the State Department's operations center. It took 45  minutes for this information to reach American soldiers who had landed at Dubrovnik's airport, according to the military's official chronology. The American rescue teams did not drive immediately to the foothills of the mountain, a 45-minute hike from the crash site, because they were \"unable to obtain vehicles,\" according to the chronology. **********Croatian soldiers had already scaled the peak on their own and were searching for survivors. At 10 P.M. they found Sergeant Kelly alive, but bleeding badly. Fearing she had a spinal injury, they did not move her. **********Special Forces helicopters tried to reach the site, but were defeated by fog  and rain. When the Croatian rescuers realized that the helicopters were not coming, they began taking Sergeant Kelly down the mountain in a stretcher. She died on the way. At 1:36 A.M., Croatian medical authorities told the American military she had been pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, the military's chronology said. **********Fifty-four minutes later, the first American soldiers reached the wreckage of IFOR 21. **********The Crash of Flight IFOR 21: What Went Wrong? **********On April 3, in pouring rain, the plane carrying Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and 34 others began its final approach to the Dubrovink airport. At 2:53 P.M., the plane passed over the first navigation beacon 11.8 miles from the second beacon and the airport. But for undetermined reasons, the pilots followed a course of 109degrees. Some five minutes later the plane crashed into the peak of a mountain killing all aboard. **********THE PLANE The 22-year-old Boeing CT-43, the military version of the 737-200, lacked many safety features found on commercial aircraft. Equipped as it was, the plane would not have been permitted to fly a commercial route in the United  States. **********THE PILOTS Air Force Capt. Ashley Davis and Capt. Tim Schafer had never landed at the Dubrovnik airport. Croatia Airline forbids its own crews to land there if neither the pilot nor co-pilot has done it before. Also, the Air Force pilots had limited experience withe the outmoded navigational system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/05/world/key-kurd-calls-deal-with-iraq-a-stopgap.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1996-09-05", "snippet": "Interview with Tayib Ahmad, leader of Kurdish faction backed by Iraqi Pres Saddam Hussein, who insists alliance with Iraq is tactical and temporary partnership of kind that has sustained beleaguered Kurds for centuries; says short-term necessity h...", "word_count": 971, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Kurd Calls Deal With Iraq A Stopgap", "print_headline": "Key Kurd Calls Deal With Iraq A Stopgap", "body_text": " **********A leader of the Kurdish faction backed by Saddam Hussein insisted today that the alliance was just a tactical and temporary partnership of the kind that have sustained the beleaguered Kurds for centuries. **********In an interview here, a powerful member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party said short-term necessity had driven his group into a military alliance with the Iraqi dictator, who once gassed Kurds with chemical weapons, to seize control of Erbil from a rival Kurdish group. **********The group turned to Mr. Hussein only after Western governments refused to defend the city against rivals cooperating with Iran, said Tayib Ahmad, the Kurd leader. **********''We don't have any alliance with the Iraqi regime,'' he said. ''It is just a temporary arrangement. There is no formal agreement between us and the Iraqi Government. We made an appeal and the Iraqi Government responded. When it is over, they will pull out their troops. Already there are no more Iraqi troops in the center of Erbil.'' **********Mr. Ahmad, a 42-year-old former guerrilla, is a senior member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party's 32-member central committee. He has served as governor of Dohuk province since 1991, when the United States and its allies made the province part of a protected zone for Kurds in northern Iraq. **********There were signs today that the partnership of convenience would not prove of universal benefit to the Kurds living in northern Iraq. Aid workers said that in the hours after Iraqi soldiers stormed into Erbil, security forces systematically rounded up Kurds allied with the party most vehemently opposed to Mr. Hussein. **********In some of the first reports from Erbil since the fall of the city, aid workers who witnessed this weekend's Iraqi assault said Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish guerrillas allied with Mr. Hussein arrested scores, perhaps hundreds of people. Their fate is unknown. **********Five years of protection by the United States has undoubtedly saved the lives of many Kurds in northern Iraq, but it has not made this a pleasant place to live. People here are effectively prisoners in a land of treeless plateaus and rugged mountains, unable to travel to other parts of Iraq and unwelcome in neighboring countries. **********Dohuk is today a forlorn place, and the border town of Zahko is even less appealing. For a brief period after 1991, Zahko enjoyed an economic boom because hundreds of American soldiers were stationed here. It has long since slipped back into sun-baked sleepiness. At midday today the only movement on the dusty streets was from a handful of Kurdish guerrillas driving about in Mercedes-Benz sedans and three youths trying without success to push a cart laden with sacks of Turkish detergent up a steep hill. **********A sign at the border crossing that reads ''Welcome to Kurdistan'' seems a cruel joke. All the Kurds have to show for generations of struggle is a parched parcel of land surrounded by enemies and dependent for survival on the charity of increasingly frustrated Americans and other foreigners. **********In the interview today, Mr. Ahmad brushed aside reminders that Mr. Hussein's regime brutally suppressed Kurds in the past. **********''If someone can help solve our problems, we have no objection,'' he said. **********The United States has refused to be drawn into the increasingly bitter conflict between the Kurdistan Democratic Party and northern Iraq's other Kurdish faction, the Democratic Union of Kurdistan, which has forged ties to Iran. **********Senior American officials said this week that Mr. Ahmad's party had seriously blundered. ''They think they can manipulate the Iraqis and they'll find that they are too powerful and too ruthless to be manipulated,'' Secretary of Defense William Perry said Tuesday in an interview with ''The News Hour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. **********Mr. Ahmad asserted that American forces should have stepped in after the Democratic Union launched a joint operation with Iranian troops inside Iraq earlier this summer. **********''We wanted the United States and other powers to do their job and protect us,'' he said. ''When there was no reaction from the United States, the allies, or the European countries, we asked Iraq to protect us.'' **********A statement issued today by the Kurdistan Democratic Party suggested that it was not simply the Democratic Union's recent cooperation with Iran, but also classic power rivalries that prompted it to turn to Mr. Hussein for help. **********The statement, issued in the name of Massoud Barzani, the top party leader, charged that the Patriotic Union had been using ''violence and terror'' against Democratic Party members in Erbil for more than two years. It accused the Patriotic Union of ''filthy play'' and of launching ''aggressive actions and dangerous plots against us.'' **********''The party made use of its legal right to self-defense and asked for limited legal support from anybody anywhere,'' Mr. Barzani's statement said. ''The Iraqi Government, gracefully, responded.'' **********Aid workers said today that the Iraqi Army's role was anything but graceful. **********''Iraqi forces were going through our neighborhood and taking people away,'' one aid worker said. ''I was watching them. There were people who were against Saddam or his party in one way or another, or people who might have said something negative about the K.D.P. **********''A lot of people were getting dragged out of houses. They went systematically house to house. I know people who said something five years ago, and since then not a single word, not a single action. They got their doors knocked on and were taken away. These people don't forget.'' **********Another aid worker said he doubted that Iraqi soldiers had withdrawn from Erbil. **********''The security forces are still there, some of them undercover,'' he said. ''A lot of local people who work for aid agencies are very, very, very frightened.'' **********Jeremy Anderson, an Australian architect who was working in Erbil for the Wisconsin-based aid group Shelter Now, said he had heard from Kurdish associates in Erbil that his office had been ransacked. **********''Five minutes after we left,'' he said, Iraqi forces ''came rolling through our office door.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/business/shareholders-sue-hasbro-over-mattel-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shareholders Sue Hasbro Over Mattel Bid", "print_headline": "Shareholders Sue Hasbro Over Mattel Bid", "body_text": " **********Four stockholders of Hasbro Inc., the nation's No. 2 toy maker, filed suit against the company for rejecting Mattel Inc.'s merger offer, saying that Hasbro denied them increased profits. **********The suits, filed in Rhode Island Superior Court, said that Hasbro violated its legal obligation to maximize shareholder value.

The Mitsubishi Bank/Schroder Wertheim chain-store index declined 1 percent for the week that ended Saturday. The report underscored continuing economic weakness and low inflation, forcing some speculators to enter the market and buy to cover their bets that bond prices would decline.

Mr. Fine's own estimate is more than 150,000. **********Hamilton Davis, a vice president of government trading at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago, attributed yesterday's buying in part to George Soros, one of Wall Street's most influential investors, who encouraged Japanese money managers to buy United States Treasury securities yesterday.

Such strength undermines the case that the Federal Reserve needs to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The bond and stock markets had been betting on lower interest rates, and the employment report sent them tumbling today. Bond prices fell sharply, driving the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for mortgages and other consumer interest rates -- up to 6.72 percent from 6.46 percent. [Page 38.] **********Despite the sharp reaction of the financial markets, most economists, though acknowledging being surprised by the biggest expansion of payrolls since 1983, insisted that February's clearly unsustainable labor market results overstated the economy's strength. **********\"The numbers aren't as good as they looked,\" said Irwin L. Kellner, a senior  economist at Chemical Bank. He noted, among other things, a longer-than-usual survey period that captured extra jobs anda high concentration of part-time and  temporary employment in addition to the unescapable fact that the Northeast blizzard had severely, albeit artificially, depressed the January results. **********Others noted that factory jobs grew by just 26,000 last month, barely one-third of their January decline. **********Indeed, H. Erich Heinemann, head of the economic research unit at Brimberg &  Company, an institutional broker, called the February report little more than \"statistical catch-up\" and derided the notion that \"some great explosion\" in economic activity had taken place when job growth in the first two months of 1996 was very similar to that in the comparable 1995 period. **********Officials at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the report widely regarded as the most important of monthly economic indicators, said that while the February gains exceeded losses from the blizzard it was impossible to tell by how much. **********Nonetheless, the White House seized on the report to boast of surpassing President Clinton's 1992 campaign pledge that the economy would generate eight million jobs in his first term. Administration officials and some other analysts raised their estimates for economic growth in the quarter ending March 31. **********\"The expected rebound from the January doldrums has come sooner than anticipated,\" said Joseph E. Stiglitz, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. \"We now expect to see solid gross domestic product growth in  the first quarter of 1996 as well as throughout the rest of the year.\" **********While the 705,000 jump in payroll jobs does indeed raise the total number of  jobs created since January 1993, when President Clinton was inaugurated, to 8.4  million, economists generally say that normal growth of the population would produce nearly the same amount. **********Another report today pointed to unexpected strength in the economy. The Commerce Department said construction spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted $537.6 billion. Many economists had expected a decline, assuming severe winter storms delayed many projects. While government spending accounted for much of the increase, it was still the second consecutive monthly advance after a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent in November. **********The decline in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent from 5.8 percent means that the rate has moved from the upper end to near the lower end of the range it has hovered in since late 1994. The rate, which moved up two-tenths of a point in January, was last at 5.5 percent in October. **********Most analysts said that today's report all but ruled out a cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on March 26. But some said a cut was still possible, even necessary. **********Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and a persistent advocate of easier monetary policy, argued that the risk of recession had not disappeared. **********\"Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates again\" this month, he said. **********Geographically, much of February's job market improvement was concentrated in the Midwest, where the already-low unemployment rate dropped to 4.4 percent from 4.7 percent. In the Northeast, where snowstorms took their greatest toll, the jobless rate edged down to 5.7 percent from 5.8. **********Unemployment in the South and West was unchanged at 5.4 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. **********The main growth last month was in services, with 46,000 more health-related jobs, a jump of 79,000 jobs at temporary-help agencies and a gain of 121,000 jobs in construction. Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said the rise in construction jobs \"reflects some real strength\" as  well as a rebound from January's exceptionally harsh weather to unusually good weather in February. **********Retail trade added 166,000 jobs, more than twice the January loss, with much  of the improvement in bars and restaurants, a sector especially hard hit by storms. Job growth in department stores reflected fewer layoffs than expected in the first two months of the year after weak hiring during the holiday season. **********The length of the average workweek jumped 48 minutes, more than recovering from a 36-minute decline in January, while factory hours and overtime performed  similarly. **********The index of aggregate weekly hours, a proxy for industrial production to be  reported by the Federal Reserve next Friday, vaulted to 134.5 -- 4.2 points higher than in January and 1.6 points above the December level. **********Average hourly earnings, meanwhile, edged down a cent, to $11.65, reflecting  the return of many low-paid and part-time workers who lost jobs to the blizzard, either because their workplace closed or because they could not reach it. Hourly earnings had risen 5 cents in January. **********Still, the Leading Inflation Index compiled by Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle posted its first increase in 15 months, the biggest factor being a rise in the proportion of the population with jobs in February. **********The Government's survey of households, which counts the number of people with at least one job, posted a 437,000 increase last month, after a gain of 245,000  in January. **********Since the labor force expanded by only 115,000, the ranks of the unemployed dropped by 322,000, pulling down the unemployment rate. **********The jobless rate for adult women, which had risen four-tenths of a point in January, eased three-tenths of a point last month, to 4.8 percent, the report also showed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/world/troubled-south-african-area-votes-peacefully-and-little-changes.html": {"writer_name": "Suzanne Daley", "pub_date": "1996-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Troubled South African Area Votes Peacefully, and Little Changes", "print_headline": "Troubled South African Area Votes Peacefully, and Little Changes", "body_text": " **********After years of deadly political conflict, South Africa's KwaZulu/Natal Province held its first free local elections last week, and now that the votes have finally been counted, it appears that the province's archrivals have neither gained nor lost much ground. **********As in the first post-apartheid general election in 1994, the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi swept the province's vast rural areas, while President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress triumphed in the cities and suburbs. **********Inkatha won 562 of the seats at stake, compared with the Congress's 514. Voting percentages were more lopsided, with Inkatha taking 44.5 percent and the  Congress 33.2 percent. **********The Mandela party's share was about the same as it won in the province in 1994, but Inkatha fell short of its 1994 showing of 50.3 percent, according to the nearly completed tally. Trudy Vlok, an official of the election authority, said Inkatha seemed to have lost ground among urban white and Indian voters, to  independent candidates and to the National Party, which had 187 seats and 12.7 percent of the vote, up from 11.2 percent two years ago. **********Voter turnout was only 44 percent, well below the 81 percent turnout two years ago. The decline was attributed to the reduced interest that hinders local elections everywhere. Turnout was particularly low among the poorest and least educated, tending to cut deeper into support for Inkatha. **********The National Party, led by former President F. W. de Klerk, was jubilant over the result. Mr. de Klerk said the vote set the stage \"for a major realignment in South Africa's politics.\" He recently quit his post as Vice President in a coalition Government to try remaking the National Party, which imposed apartheid and then began the process of dismantling it, into a new non-racial party stressing \"family values,\" opposing abortion and favoring the death penalty. **********But the real battle in the province was between the Congress and Inkatha. While most of South Africa has settled easily into democracy, KwaZulu/Natal has  been torn by bitter feuding between the country's major black parties. Inkatha is politically strong only in this province, and there were once serious worries that a frustrated Mr. Buthelezi would lead an effort to secede from South Africa. An estimated 14,000 people have been killed during the last decade, and  local elections, already conducted in the other eight provinces, were repeatedly postponed because of the violence. **********Human-rights groups estimate that 60 to 80 people a month have died during the last year. Recently, however, a truce was declared, and admitted warlords from both sides agreed to escort each other into \"no-go\" areas to campaign. Previously, anyone putting up posters in areas controlled by the opposing party  could expect to be stoned or shot. **********The voting last week was surprisingly peaceful, even considering the truce and 30,000 extra police officers and soldiers on hand, and has been declared \"reasonably free and fair\" by the provincial election committee."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/company-reports-delta-reports-record-operating-profit-but-has-net-loss-after.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Delta Reports Record Operating Profit, but Has Net Loss After Charges", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Delta Reports Record Operating Profit, but Has Net Loss After Charges", "body_text": " **********Delta Air Lines reported a fourfold increase in operating profits yesterday for the quarter ended in March, and announced new programs to share with employees both stock options and seats in boardroom meetings. **********In addition, the credit rating of the Atlanta-based carrier was raised yesterday by Standard & Poor's to one notch below investment grade. It was the first time since 1993 that Standard & Poor's had lifted ratings for one of the parent companies of the biggest three airlines, Delta, American and United. **********Although the results posted by Delta were lower than expected by industry analysts, it has benefited, like other major airlines reporting earnings in recent days, from a lapsed 10 percent tax on air fares, which the airlines have  not been required to collect since the beginning of the year. In addition, Delta has made progress in lowering its costs and resolving some differences with its  labor groups. **********In the March quarter -- the third quarter of Delta's fiscal year -- the nation's third-largest airline said its operating profit was $169 million, a record, compared with an operating profit a year earlier of $40 million. **********Delta, however, also took $556 million in one-time charges related to replacing aircraft and laying off employees, among other things. **********Although the airline was hampered by bad weather and higher fuel prices in the most recent quarter, Delta said its cost to fly each seat one mile -- a standard industry yardstick for measuring costs -- decreased to 8.84 cents in the quarter from 9.07 cents a year earlier.

A similar sign of feverish sentiment was observed before last week's Miss World beauty pageant in the southern city of Bangalore. **********A newspaper canvassed a few dozen contestants to discover their hopes, aspirations, ambitions, height and weight. The careers the women dreamed of were as revealing as their swimsuits. Perennial favorites, like social worker and actress-model, were mentioned by only a few. In the ascendancy were such choices as \"financial adviser\" and \"Wall Street market analyst.\" **********This might make a few Wall Street analysts fear for the market's future. If a global sample of 19-year-olds thinks it is more glamorous to plot candle graphs and forecast earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization than to be in the movies, can the top be far away? **********None of the women surveyed expressed a desire to analyze the Indian stock market. With so few buyers, who would they do the analyses for? After peaking in 1994 at 4,600 and struggling back up to 4,000 earlier this year, the Sensitive index, the benchmark for shares traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange, sank below 3,000 last week. It closed Friday at 2,894.68. **********The problems are several and are deeply rooted in the Indian economy and political system. Travelers in the country will easily reach the conclusion that capital investment is pointless. With nearly a billion Indians and not nearly enough jobs to put them in, it is much cheaper to hire labor to do work routinely done by machinery almost everywhere else. It is common for an office to have someone, or several someones, to run documents down to the neighborhood copying machine, for instance, than to buy one of its own. **********Foreign investment has been pitifully scarce in India for this reason, and, businessmen say, because bureaucracy and corruption at all levels of the Byzantine system of government have persuaded them of the value of yanking profits out of the country as soon as they are made, rather than plowing the money back in to expand. **********\"Things at the federal level change faster,\" Vivek Sekhar, manager of the Fleming Flagship India Fund, said of the government's attempts at economic reform. \"The main problem has been delays in implementation, mainly because of procedural delays in clearing paper work. Forty years of a controlled economy created a class of bureaucrats and politicians who will not give up power easily.\" **********Yearning to be upbeat, he added: \"It's getting better, but slowly. Medium to long term, I'm optimistic about the place. It's a mammoth country with a huge variety of problems; it's difficult and frustrating, but a transition to a market economy is taking place. **********\"Two things are needed to help sentiment in the market,\" he concluded. \"Interest rates must come down and whatever the government is doing in terms of reform, they have to act in a firm and cohesive manner.\" **********IF INVESTING in India is difficult, so is financing consumption. The credit-card companies are eager to sign up customers in the developing world and tout the fact that Western clients can use their cards in out-of-the-way places. They are less forthcoming in informing users that they may have to pay a stiff penalty to do this. **********One Western visitor, in a hurry to settle a hotel bill in the middle of nowhere before catching a bus to a place well on the outskirts of nowhere, was informed that there would be a 7 percent service charge to pay with Visa because the hotel had to pay its bank to process the transaction. The cardholder's argument \u2014 that the bank charges were part of the hotel's cost of doing business and this place is a dump where no one would want to stay and pay in cash \u2014 was not persuasive. The 7 percent was extorted. **********That was the steepest, but not the only, service charge the visitor had to pay to use his card. Several establishments tacked on 3 percent. **********\"They were breaking the policy Visa has with its merchants,\" a representative of the card company declared. **********Inquiries have been made, complaints lodged, outrage expressed. A refund will most likely be granted, the representative said, although \"it's not something that's going to happen in five minutes.\" **********Paying in cash is the favored option in India, a country where extremely large cash transactions apparently are not out of the ordinary, even though the smallest banknote, one rupee, is worth a mere three American cents, and the largest note works out to about $14 **********A newspaper article cited a sharp operator in Kochi, a southern coastal city, who was trying to peddle an American \"one million dollar note.\" It carried a picture of the Statue of Liberty in the middle and signatures from the \"Director of Treasury\" and \"International Treasurer.\" **********To assuage skepticism, there is a \"certificate of authenticity\" accompanying the bill, pledging it to be an \"authentic, original and genuine million dollar bill designed and printed by the American Bank Note Company in 1988 for the International Association of Millionaires.\" **********The paper said it had not determined whether the note was real, although 15 seconds of painstaking journalistic inquiry would have revealed that it was not. The largest bill in circulation is $100. **********Whoever buys the bill could have difficulty spending it, even if it were real.

Police and insurance agents met in Warsaw on Monday for a two-day conference to discuss the problem. **********Partly because new cars in the West are better protected by electronic engine immobilizers and other devices, Polish and Russian thieves have turned to pickings closer to home, police in Warsaw say. **********Although precise statistics do not exist, car thefts in Poland are believed to have risen by 20 percent last year. **********The true figure could be still higher, as many of the cars stolen in Poland had already been stolen in the West \u2014 and the new Polish owners, when robbed in turn of the illicit vehicles, are reluctant to go to the police. Instead they turn to private detective agencies, which charge 20 percent of the value of the car to get it back. These agencies include some dubious outfits that police believe to have links with the Polish criminal underworld. **********The Polish-government sponsored conference on \"theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles\" highlighted the lack of resources in Eastern Europe for dealing with what insurance industry experts call one of Europe's most lucrative crimes. **********Polish police complain that they are underequipped to deal with the problem: Their ancient Polonez squad cars are no match for stolen Mercedes and BMWs, and they have no access to Western data banks. **********A European insurers' organization, the Comite Europeen des Assurances, recently issued new figures for 1995 indicating that car thefts in the four principal European markets declined in 1995 \u2014 by eight percent to 129,652 thefts in Germany, by 5.4 percent to 287,052 in France, by 1 percent to 305,438 in Italy and by 4 percent to 509,100 in Britain. **********Of these stolen cars, 83,351 were recovered in Germany, 215,766 in France, an estimated 153,000 in Italy and 271,518 in Britain, the committee said on the basis of statistics supplied by national police forces. **********A spokesman said that although it was too soon to provide a full analysis, it appeared that the decline was due to the increasing installation of engine immobilizers and other anti-theft devices on auto assembly lines. **********Under EU rules, immobilizers will have to be introduced on all new cars from January 1998, and on newly designed cars from next month. **********A spokesman at Renault SA said there was no doubt that the devices were reducing thefts of new cars, which means that older models that are not equipped with immobilizers are more likely to be stolen. **********Yet the immobilizers are not foolproof against determined thieves, the British magazine \"What Car?\" discovered. It recently tested 70 different vehicles, all fitted with immobilizers, and found that more than 40 percent could be broken into and driven away within five minutes \u2014 some within seconds. **********Anti-theft devices are \"at best dissuasive,\" said Gilbert Grenouille, president of the ICA group, a French company that has developed a method of tracking and immobilizing stolen vehicles at a distance by telephoning a coded message. **********\"The gangs have specialists to open the cars, and they do not want to risk losing them,\" he said. \"So if they have the choice of two identical cars, they will go for the one without the alarm.\" **********Once the specialist has broken into the car and started the engine, someone else will drive it away and typically park it nearby, police say. Later a courier will pick up the vehicle and take it to its destination. **********Interpol has finally established a stolen-vehicles data base but does not make it available to the insurance industry. Insurers in several countries, including Germany, France and Britain, have set up their own organizations to track down and if possible recover stolen cars. HUK-Verband in Germany has a network of agents in Eastern Europe, and Argos, the French equivalent, concentrates much of its effort on cars being smuggled through Spain to North Africa. **********The first thing thieves do with a stolen car they want to export is to strip off and replace the chassis and engine numbers, making it difficult to trace the vehicle. **********The chances of getting caught are minimal. Sentences are minimal. And professional car thieves can probably make more money from their trade with less risk than drug traffickers, according to insurers. **********If thieves seriously want a car, neither immobilizers nor alarms will stop them. If necessary, they will load the vehicle onto a truck and take it away. **********\"No matter how clever the new devices are, you will always find thieves who are even more clever,\" said James Rosenstein of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. **********Lisa Ferri, who demonstrated car alarm systems at the Paris auto show this year, said, \"The trouble with devices fitted on the assembly line is that they are all the same. The thieves have only to discover how one works to discover them all.\" **********Often, she said, the gangs rent a new model for a few days, strip it down to find out how the immobilizer and alarm system work, and then apply that knowledge generally."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/08/business/company-news-layoffs-and-other-cuts-planned-by-georgia-pacific.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;LAYOFFS AND OTHER CUTS PLANNED BY GEORGIA-PACIFIC", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;LAYOFFS AND OTHER CUTS PLANNED BY GEORGIA-PACIFIC", "body_text": " **********The Georgia-Pacific Corporation announced a major cost-cutting program yesterday that was intended to increase profits by $400 million over three years.

Family;Hope and Frustration From Sweden", "body_text": " **********Five years ago, it took Saab Automobile A.B. more than four days to make a car. **********Today, a sleek Saab rolls off the line less than 40 hours after a sheet of metal is pressed into the shape of a car. Not impressive by the manufacturing standards of the efficient Japanese, but a big saving in time and money nonetheless. **********Speedier production is just one result of the relationship between Saab and  General Motors, which six years ago baffled almost everyone in the car business  by paying $500 million for a half-interest in one of the world's smallest and quirkiest auto makers. **********By using G.M.'s expertise and buying power, Saab has lowered its costs by roughly a third. It has concentrated virtually all its manufacturing here in a new, more efficient plant; sliced its work force in half; turned to more suppliers and shared development and marketing costs with G.M. The result was a  1994 profit, its first in six years, but earnings skidded 99 percent last year. **********What has G.M. got in return? Basically, a souped-up version of the company it bought five years ago -- and a tab of $1 billion and running. **********Both G.M. and its partner, the investment group of one of Sweden's leading corporate families, say they expect to invest additional funds to carry Saab through a critical phase but they will not say how much. They await Saab's request. **********\"We haven't invested a billion dollars to close Saab; we have invested a billion dollars to grow Saab,\" said Louis Hughes, the president of G.M.'s international operations and the chairman of Saab. **********The strategy calls for building Saab sales to about 150,000 cars by the year  2000 and adding a new, larger and more profitable car line next year.  The plan  also calls for wringing out more cost cuts and building greater awareness of the Saab name, which is the first to come to mind for only a small group of car buyers. All this, it is hoped, will finally give Saab a sufficient sales base to support itself as a modern auto maker. **********But all this has to be done even as new-car sales are showing little or no growth either in Europe or the United States. **********That's a tall order for a little Swedish company that has never sold more than 98,713 cars in a year, the equivalent of what G.M. builds in a week in the  United States. \"Nobody would like to see Saab disappear, but their strategy for  taking it considerably beyond where it is now is hard for anyone to see,\" said Daniel T. Jones, an auto industry expert at the University of Cardiff Business School in Wales. \"In private moments, I would think G.M. is rather unhappy with  this investment.\" **********G.M.'s partner is none too pleased either. Claes Dahlback, president of Investor A.B., controlled by the Wallenberg family, chose his words carefully. \"G.M. has been a terrific partner,\" he said, \"really brought a lot to the table  that has gotten Saab into much better shape.\" But he added, \"We don't like the financial performance of the company, which is primarily due to the low sales volume.\" **********Keith O. Butler-Wheelhouse, Saab's chief executive, said he was confident that Investor was committed for the next five years and that G.M. was in for the long haul. After all, he pointed out, it is too late to turn back now. **********\"To abort the company or think about closing it when we've just gone through  five and a half difficult years; when we have a new product coming out; when we've been profitable for the first time in several years; when sales are increasing; it would be an incredibly stupid thing to do,\" he said. **********Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse, a South African who spent more than 20 years working for the Ford Motor Company, said the investment had benefited G.M., too. Saab has given G.M. access to a market that car makers crave -- affluent, well educated, young and professional -- a market G.M. has failed to entice with Cadillac. **********G.M. has also gained from the reputation of Saab for technical expertise, grounded in its origins as an offshoot of a military aircraft maker. G.M. now uses Saab climate- and emissions-control systems as well as the company's engine turbocharging technology. \"We're small, but we have a great level of technical skill,\" Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse said. **********That skill was recently shown in a demonstration of a new system that reduces a car's emissions after a cold start of the engine to well below the strict standards scheduled to take effect in California in several years. **********Also, G.M. and Saab have collaborated on a new headrest that reduces the risk of whiplash in an accident. A mechanical system, which is activated by any sudden burst of pressure, moves the head restraint forward to cradle the head before it snaps back. **********But the most anticipated new product is the car that Saab intends to introduce next year for its 50th anniversary. \"There's a lot riding on that new  car,\" Professor Jones said. \"It's a bad cliche and a pun, but in this case it's  true.\" **********The car is a big secret, but executives do drop a few hints. It will have sedan and station wagon versions, but, contrary to trade reports, Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse said it would not replace Saab's 12-year-old hatchback sedan. **********Robert J. H. McEniry, a Saab vice president of marketing, suggested that the  new car would aim at a buyer willing to spend more than the $32,000 required today for a basic Saab 9000, someone, perhaps, who would consider buying a 5-series BMW or a Mercedes E-class. **********At a recent auto show in Geneva,Saab displayed two \"concept\" cars, high-performance permutations of the 900 coupe and convertible. They offered a tantalizing taste of what is likely to come. Painted in bright, bold colors wrapped around a sleeker, more solid silhouette and featuring more power, higher torque and an improved chassis, the cars made their cousins, parked discreetly off to one side of the exhibit, look like sparrows. **********But marketing such a car will present several challenges. First, understatement is a quality admired by typical Saab buyers, so too much hype and flash may alienate the customer base. **********Also, Saab means different things in different markets. In Europe, it is linked to its aircraft heritage. But in the United States, Saab evokes visions of an absent-minded professor sporting a tweed jacket and pipe and tooling around in an orange 900 made in 1968. **********\"We started working two years ago to bring greater consistency to the brand worldwide, to McDonald-ize it, if you will,\" Mr. McEniry said. \"We have to give  customers security that what they're buying in the brand is the same no matter where they bought the car.\" **********To that end, the company is using some sales techniques akin to those of G.M.'s Saturn division. It recently started offering free one-hour at-home test  drives in some American cities, featuring delivery of a car by a Saab technician who will answer questions but will not make a sale. In Geneva, it is testing a new dealership design whose stark white walls warmed by cherry wood accents and  tile floors evoke an Italian boutique. After viewing the cars, buyers are ushered behind a \"confidentiality screen\" to discuss a purchase. Salespeople are called hosts, and the nearby service center is undergoing a metamorphosis intended to make the repair experience more personal. **********Saab dealerships are getting more than a face lift, however. In the United States, which accounted for more than a quarter of Saab's sales last year, the company lacks strong dealers in 5 of the 11 markets that account for 85 percent  of the nation's sales of imported luxury cars, a fact that infuriates Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse. \"We're weak in Los Angeles, which is car country,\" he said. \"If we had the same penetration there that we have in the Northeast, we'd be well on our way to achieving our sales goals.\" **********The effort to reach out to the heights of the market runs counter to the prevailing trends in auto manufacturing. Mercedes and BMW have both focused their sights lower, increasing their offerings of smaller, less expensive models in a bid to pump up sales. **********But industry experts say Saab may have no choice other than to aim high, since the small-car market is overwhelmed now with bigger European and Asian competitors. \"Right now, they're caught in the middle,\" said Robert Spano, who follows the industry for Ludvigsen Associates in London. \"On the one side, there's Mercedes and BMW, and on the other, G.M., Ford, Volkswagen and the rest. They need to decide which camp they're going to be in and get out of the middle.\" **********Saab has clearly elected to take the high road of Mercedes and BMW. But that  creates a conundrum because the market for premium-priced cars is minuscule, the very opposite of what is needed by a company in search of a 50 percent sales increase. **********But Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse reckons on more opportunity there than elsewhere. People do not want to drive just any car, he says. \"You don't want your newspaperman delivering your paper in the same brand of car you drive,\" he said. \"I don't like to criticize my competitors, but I think BMW is starting to have that problem by reaching too far down to get volume.\" **********As confident as he is in Saab's strategy, Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse is well aware of how high the hurdle is for Saab. Last year, it missed its sales goal of 100,000 cars. Mr. Spano, the analyst, says European car makers will be lucky to  increase their sales by 2 to 3 percent this year. **********If the strategy falters, Saab may face the unpleasant prospect of being taken off the G.M. life-support system. \"There may be a window when we start thinking about the next new car, when they will pause to reconsider what they're doing with this company,\" Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse said. \"We have to make sure they don't have a reason for doing so.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/17/business/worldbusiness/IHT-having-trailed-wall-street-up-less-room-to-fall.html": {"writer_name": "Kevin Murphy", "pub_date": "1996-07-17", "snippet": "Following a nervous Wall Street down, most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday, but hearteningly, without taking their typical roller coaster ride after a bad bump in New York..

A session is scheduled for late in the week. **********While the threat of American sanctions has been directed at Beijing, the Administration's sanctions list raises the question of whether China bears sole  responsibility for the theft of the American-made goods, which range from recordings of Michael Jackson's music to copies of Windows 95 and other popular  American software. **********And although China is the site of the pirating operations -- which are often  partly owned by the Chinese military or by other Government agencies -- the foreign investors in those operations come largely from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Two of the factories appear to be part-owned by interests from Singapore or Japan. **********The acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said on Friday that her office was working with Hong Kong and Taiwan to bar the shipment to any factory in China of key equipment that enables the copying of disks. The  participation of outsiders, she argued, did not relieve Beijing of responsibility to stop the pirating. **********\"One cannot excuse Chinese inaction simply because there are foreign investors,\" Ms. Barshefsky said. \"They should be closed down because the Chinese committed to closing them down, and because they are in violation of Chinese laws.\" **********None of the United States' allies has agreed to join the sanctions against China, even though the piracy also costs Japanese and German companies millions  of dollars. A few, including Japan, have made it clear that they consider the American threats of sanctions against China unwise. Canada and Mexico have expressed similar views on the tightened American embargo of Cuba. **********The detailed list of the 31 factories and scores of companies said to be involved in piracy was prepared by the United States trade representative's office, Administration officials say, to try to give China a road map of what it must do in the next two weeks to avoid the imposition of sanctions. **********\"We didn't want to hear the excuse that they couldn't find the offenders,\" a  senior official said. \"By handing them the list, we are doing everything but picking their officials up and taking them to the factory door.\" **********In recent days Chinese authorities have announced another crackdown on the plants that illegally copy tens of thousands of disks each day, but they have closed only a handful. **********Under a commonly discussed scenario for a settlement, China will close 13 or  so of the most egregious violators in the next two weeks and agree to a schedule for closing the rest. It would also step up enforcement and inspections at the border to stop export of illegal goods. **********American officials say they assume that China wants to avoid a confrontation  at a time Congress is considering the annual renewal of China's broader trading  benefits, known as most-favored-nation status. President Clinton has notified Congress that he wants to renew the preferential trading status, which the United States extends to virtually all its other trade partners. Congress has 60 days to reject that request. **********An unknown factor is who in the Chinese leadership is making the decisions. Some Chinese officials have said that it is time to stand up to American economic muscle, meeting sanctions with counter-sanctions against American goods or companies operating in China. **********While sanctions could lead to a further deterioration of United States relations with Beijing, signing a partial deal to get the plants closed could prove politically tricky for Mr. Clinton. He has entered into an agreement with  China that called for the closing of all the plants by last July, and that deadline was ignored. **********If a new deal produces little result, the Administration will be open to further criticism from Senator Bob Dole, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, along the lines that Mr. Clinton has been a paper tiger with the Chinese, threatening harsh action but failing to follow through. **********Recent charges that state-owned Chinese companies have exported nuclear material to Pakistan and tried to smuggle automatic weapons to the United States \"puts more pressure on us to show that any deal we reach is really airtight,\" an Administration official said recently. **********The American list of pirate factories includes the names, locations, and phone and fax numbers of each of 31 plants -- most of them in Guangdong province in south China -- that Washington says are the sources of the majority of counterfeit compact disks and CD-ROM software. Frequently, the high-capacity CD-ROM's are stuffed with many different programs worth thousands of dollars; such compilation disks are often sold on the streets of Shanghai or Hong Kong for $5 to $20. China has recently begun exporting the disks aggressively, chiefly through Southeast Asia. **********Among the names of foreign companies on the list are some that sound as if they have a link to the United States -- the \"U.S.-Sino Foreign Development Company,\" an investor in a large factory in the Shenzhen special economic zone near Hong Kong, or the \"American Yinyun Company\" But officials say that so far,  they have found no connections to owners in the United States. The Government list does not include any of the underground factories that are not registered with the Chinese Government, but that also appear to be active in copying American products. **********Some corporate executives who have reviewed the list say that many of the names are familiar, and involve Chinese companies that are fronts for Beijing Government agencies or the military. Some of the foreign investors, they assert, have been involved in other piracy activities. **********\"We've seen cases where factories had been operating in Taiwan, stealing our  video games,\" said Lynn Hvalsoe, general counsel of Nintendo of America, the United States subsidiary of the Japanese game manufacturer. \"When things got too hot, they disassembled the factory and rebuilt it in China.\" **********Ms. Hvalsoe said in a recent interview that a few weeks ago Nintendo persuaded the Chinese authorities to raid a factory that was illegally reproducing video games, saturating the Chinese market with fake Game Boy machines. Soon after the raid started, she said, a factory manager informed the  investigators that the factory was partly owned by the Chinese military. The factory is still operating."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/19/business/business-digest-364878.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 502, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Dow Industrials Slip 1.12 As Profit Taking Halts Rally **********The Dow industrials fell 1.12 to 6,346.91, ending a string of 10 winning sessions and falling just shy of a ninth straight record. **********Broader measures also slipped, as investors secured profits made in the the stunning post-election rally that lifted the Dow 325 points, or 5.4 percent.

Investors who are longing for the hot new-issue market of last summer, when initial public offerings like Netscape Communications shot up during their first day of trading, should learn to enjoy the cooler weather. The decidedly tepid temperature of the current market offers buyers greater opportunity to snatch up stock in solid companies at reasonable prices. **********The change in climate comes after Wall Street spent the last several months plying investors with countless Internet or technology outfits -- many of which were long on promise and short on actual experience, but were met enthusiastically by those eager to take part in a raging I.P.O. market. The average initial offering in May gained a blistering 25 percent in its first day of trading, according to the Securities Data Company. **********But the subsequent chill in small-company stocks is forcing underwriters to serve up more enticing fare. Investors are turning up their noses at companies with short histories as too risky and instead considering more mature types. **********''The companies that are more established and have revenues and earnings and a level of predictability are still of interest to the market,'' said Paul Grangaard, director of corporate finance at Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis investment firm. **********All of which is good news for portfolio managers who aren't looking to make a quick buck flipping I.P.O.'s and for individual investors who never get the opportunity. While the average initial offering gained only 8 percent in July, buying select I.P.O.'s is proving profitable, according to John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket publication. Of the 90 stocks that went public in the six weeks ending on Aug. 9, 70 are trading above their initial offering price. The I.P.O.'s have gained an average of 10.2 percent, compared with a 4 percent decline in the Nasdaq composite index in the same period. **********''The aftermarket for I.P.O.'s is grinding right along and outperforming anything in sight,'' Mr. Fitzgibbon said. **********The new environment favors companies with much less sizzle, to be sure. Consider the American Pad and Paper Company of Dallas. The company, which claims to have invented the legal pad in 1888, makes and markets nothing more exciting than envelopes and writing pads, but is profitable, before a one-time charge. When American Pad and Paper went public on July 2, its shares were priced at $15 -- at the bottom of its estimated price range -- and the stock closed the day less than 13 cents higher. The stock traded as high as $17.125 last week before closing at $15.75 yesterday. **********''It tells you what people like after the tech wreck,'' said Elizabeth Dater, portfolio manager of the Warburg Pincus Post-Venture Capital Fund. **********Another appealingly low-tech offering, despite its name, was Teletech Holdings Inc., a Denver-based company that operates telephone banks to handle customer calls for major corporations. The stock went public on Aug. 1 at $14.50, less than its underwriters had originally hoped. But the shares, which climbed as high as $18 during the first day of trading, closed that day at $16.875. They closed yesterday at $18.375, a 27 percent gain. **********''It has worked out well and is good quality,'' said John Ballen, portfolio manager of the MFS Emerging Growth Fund. **********Some I.P.O.'s are successful even when investors cannot count on profit. Although its underwriters had to slice its offering price, the Einstein/ Noah Bagel Corporation -- whose majority owner is Boston Chicken, the hugely popular I.P.O. -- is up 38 percent since its opening on Aug. 2 at $19.50. Those who seemed to be hoping that history would repeat itself bit on the deal, even though the company was not making money. **********And hope continues. The stock of Hambrecht & Quist, the San Francisco investment firm that has profited handsomely from underwriting hot new issues, went public last Friday at $16. After opening at $18, the stock traded as high as $19.125 during its first day. It settled back down yesterday at $18.25. **********But as long as the market remains relatively cool, investors should continue to get their choice of some good buys in the weeks ahead, according to Robert Natale, director of equity research for Standard & Poor's. He suggested that prospective buyers concentrate in areas that have been out of favor like energy, health care and technology. **********Investors should still proceed cautiously, however, warned Michael Schonberg, who runs the Dreyfus Aggressive Growth Fund. ''This I.P.O. cycle has gone on for a long while,'' he said. ''In many areas, the best of the new leading companies have already come out.'' **********Although Mr. Schonberg said he had found some I.P.O.'s to his liking, they have been fewer and farther between."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/business/business-digest-065978.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Jobless Rate Falls To 5.3%, a Six-Year Low The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent last month -- its lowest point in six years -- as 239,000 new jobs were added to the nation's payrolls in June.

Mr. Hill began in December 1993 a few days after Fox outbid CBS and agreed to pay $5.8 billion for the rights to National Football League's National Football  Conference games for four years.

He later created Sky Sports, a satellite service, and Eurosport, a pan-European cable sports service much like ESPN. **********After moving to Fox in 1993, Mr. Hill had nine months to build a sports division capable of televising N.F.L. games, which Fox partly did by hiring some of CBS's top announcers and most talented producers. **********Fox began covering N.H.L. games in April, 1994, and last season added technology that makes the hockey puck glow as it moves across the TV screen.

The series was a comic profile of the extremes to which some parents will go to ensure their offspring a place at a prestigious school in a country known for rigorous entrance exams. The woman referred to the places some schools reserve for students returning from overseas, who are sometimes allowed to bypass the exams. **********The idea that there might be some advantages to spending time outside the Japanese educational system is a relatively new one. For decades, so-called returnees were stigmatized as misfits who stood out in a society that generally values its homogeneity. Even those students who were able to keep up with Japanese-language school work while abroad were sometimes unprepared for the rigid classroom environment, especially if they had returned from a school that stressed individualism and creativity over group harmony and rote memorization. **********\"There was so much written on the problems they faced, going back to a rigid system. Today's kids are not victimized in the same way,\" said David McConnell, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Wooster in Ohio, who has studied internationalization in the Japanese school system. **********\"There's been a real shift in the way these returning kids are perceived, to a more ambiguous position, particularly as some are taking posts in elite sectors of society,\" he said. **********The sheer number of returnee students has forced open new doors into the Japanese educational system. The Japanese Ministry of Education counted only 500 returnees in 1964, but over the subsequent three decades the number soared past 13,000. Since the 1980s, more and more public and private universities began to offer modified entrance requirements to returnees, with over 380 schools doing so last year. Some elementary and secondary schools even offer special classes for returnees, to re-acclimate them to Japanese language and society. **********Schools were not always so accommodating, and returnee status was anything but desirable for ambitious parents and students themselves. **********\"I remember asking my mother, 'When are we going to go back home?' meaning California,\" said Yuko Enomoto, whose father worked in the film industry. **********Her father's job brought the family to southern California in the late 1960's. They returned to Japan in 1972, when Ms. Enomoto was seven. **********\"My parents wanted to send me to Japanese schools, but I failed all the entrance exams for the private elementary schools. I just didn't understand what any of the teachers were saying,\" she said. **********Public schools proved to be equally bewildering, and Ms. Enomoto was educated primarily in English at international schools. **********The image of returnees is changing not just in big cities like Tokyo, but in more rural areas as well. **********\"I wouldn't go so far as to say it's an advantage to be a returnee, but certainly it is good to speak another language fluently,\" said Masayoshi Yamada, a professor of English in the education department of Shimane University. **********The Ministry of Education does not provide specific guidelines on which students should be considered returnees. Mere physical presence in a foreign country is not always a true test. **********Both the definition of a returnee and the requirements for admission vary not only from school to school, but sometimes among different departments within the same university. **********Makoto Obara moved to Seattle in 1992 and entered an English as a second language program at the University of Washington. He then transferred to Seattle Central Community College and completed his two-year associate degree at the end of 1994. **********When he decided to go back to Japan to complete his four-year degree, he said he looked into applying to universities as a returnee. He found that he did not qualify for this at the schools of his choice. **********\"I didn't go to high school overseas. I didn't live overseas for more than six years,\" he said. Nor was he abroad because of a parent's job assignment. **********Mr. Obara was able to enter the night school of Waseda University in Tokyo by passing the school's special exam for transfer students. He took the same exam as those transferring from a Japanese institution. **********Many schools require returnee applicants to provide documentation that they were overseas because of a parent's job transfer. This is to prevent students from going abroad on their own, with the sole intent of bypassing the entrance exams. **********A Japan Business Association survey last year of 121 Japanese companies with offices in southern California showed that four out of 10 had employees who left their families behind when they returned to Japan, primarily so that children could continue their schooling in the United States. About 20 percent said they wanted to stay long enough to have their children qualify as returnees. **********Most students are probably staying just to complete a few months of a semester or school year rather than specifically to become returnees, said Saburo Iwasa, spokesman for the Japan Overseas Educational Services in Tokyo. **********Still, with both the image and future job prospects of returnees improving, returnee status may be as sought as it once was shunned. **********- **********LISA TWARONITE is a journalist based in Los Angeles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/04/business/international-business-mexican-stocks-gain-as-do-bonds-and-peso.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 255, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Mexican Stocks Gain, as Do Bonds and Peso", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Mexican Stocks Gain, as Do Bonds and Peso", "body_text": " **********Mexican stocks rose sharply today for a second day, as benchmark one-month interest rates fell and the peso strengthened. **********Led by shares of construction companies, retailers and Telefonos de Mexico, the main Mexico City stock index closed up 75.35 points, or 2.57 percent, at 3,004.78, another record.

It was the harshest response by the Palestinian leader to the positions of the new Israeli Government since Mr. Netanyahu took office in June. **********The P.L.O. leader's remarks reflected mounting frustration among Palestinian officials at what they perceive to be Mr. Netanyahu's deliberate attempts to back out of signed agreements and put off talks on a final peace settlement. **********Despite a meeting last month between Mr. Arafat and the new Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, that seemed to smooth over some differences, formal negotiations have not resumed on carrying out the self-rule accords or on a permanent agreement.

''Settlement is a flagrant violation of the agreement. This is a conspiracy not only against us, but also against peace. It means destruction of the peace process; it means tearing up agreements we have signed, and it means disregard of the Palestinian track'' in Middle East peace talks. **********Mr. Arafat said Palestinians should use ''all means'' at their disposal to resist settlement.

It adds, ''neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations.'' **********Israeli Government officials assert that expanding settlements does not change the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and that policy declarations of the previous Labor Party administration are not a legally binding commitment. **********But Palestinian leaders insist that the thrust of Mr. Netanyhau's policies is to thwart peace efforts.

''It is mere nice words which are baseless. The issue is not the resumption of the negotiations but the essence of what the negotiations would deal with. **********Mr. Netanyahu, who held talks in Jordan with King Hussein on Monday, said that his Government had submitted a peace proposal for Syria via the United States and was awaiting an answer. His adviser said the proposal spelled out Israel's terms for withdrawing its troops from Lebanon, in what he has said would be a first step to peace with Syria. **********The Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Shara, reportedly told the Cabinet's weekly session today that Israel was still refusing to conduct  peace discussions on the basis of the land-for-peace principle, which had been the premise of the talks, and United Nations resolutions. **********''If Israel is serious about reviving the peace process it is required to affirm its commitments and respect its pledges without any disguise,'' an official quoted Mr. Shara as saying. **********Tishrin reiterated that Damascus was committed to peace talks, but it urged Mr. Netanyahu to declare his readiness to pull Israeli troops back from occupied lands. **********While King Hussein and Mr. Netanyahu met in Jordan on Monday, President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon held talks in Damascus with the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad. Syrian officials said the two men discussed the Israeli proposal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/world/riot-police-beat-and-arrest-albania-election-protesters.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Riot Police Beat and Arrest Albania Election Protesters", "print_headline": "Riot Police Beat and Arrest Albania Election Protesters", "body_text": " **********Stepping up the repressive tactics that marked parliamentary elections on Sunday, Government riot policemen beat and arrested opposition party supporters  in the main square here today. **********Even though President Sali Berisha claimed victory in the elections, which many international observers said were marred by serious voting violations, he banned an opposition rally today. **********Many of those who defied the ban, including elderly men and women who were near the square, were beaten with truncheons by riot policemen as horrified election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe looked on from a nearby hotel balcony.

The rally today  was to call for new elections. **********The actions by Mr. Berisha, who critics fear is assuming the dictatorial mantle of the former Communist leader Enver Hoxha, take on a special significance because the United States and Western Europe have embraced him as their man in a pivotal region of the Balkans. **********Washington has supported Mr. Berisha, a former Communist, with economic and military aid. In return, Mr. Berisha has discouraged the Albanian majority in the neighboring Kosovo region from demanding autonomy from Yugoslavia. **********Similarly, Western European governments have looked kindly on him because of  his efforts to halt illegal emigration of impoverished Albanians to Italy and Germany. **********The unwillingness of Washington and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe officially to criticize the widespread election fraud annoyed many of the international election observers sent here by Western governments. **********\"I'm quite disgusted that this was an attempt to openly rig an election, and  I am frustrated there is no official statement,\" said Paul Keetch, an observer and member of the British Liberal Party. \"I certainly don't think the international community should give any credence to this election.\" **********Mr. Atabaki said he was angered that the Organization for Security and Cooperation and the European governments had not criticized the fraud. As a result, he said, election monitors like himself were being used as \"rubber stamps\" in elections that were not free and fair. **********About 40 of 53 observers sent by the O.S.C.E. said they had witnessed basic electoral abuses at the polls. **********More than a dozen of the observers signed a statement saying the election did not meet international standards for free and fair elections. In many cases, they said, the number of ballots cast exceeded the number of signatures on the voter lists. Many ballots were altered and invalidated so as to favor Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party. **********They said the presence of armed policemen and what were thought to be plainclothes secret policemen at polling stations changed the tense pre-election atmosphere into one of intimidation and coercion on election day. **********\"The general pattern of intimidation had a significant impact on the election process,\" the statement said. **********Several monitors said they were particularly concerned because the election fraud by Mr. Berisha's party was probably not necessary for his party to win. Mr. Atabaki said it appeared that the Democratic Party would have won without the rigging and that there had been a blatant attempt to squash the opposition. **********Opposition leaders also lambasted Western governments for preaching democracy to Albania but then standing by while pre-election intimidation and election-day violations took place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/15/business/dividend-meetings-070998.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings this week: **********TUESDAY Citicorp First Intst Bancorp Hawaiian Elec Inds Inc Omega Hlthcr Invs Inc Southwest Gas Corp **********The New Yok Times, January 15, 1996 **********WEDNESDAY Briggs & Stratton Corp Cavalier Homes Inc Dow Jones Co Gallagher (Art.

She prepared little triangles of pastry filled with meat, cucumbers  in yogurt, rice -- an extended feast to fill the gaggle of 20 children, cousins, aunts, uncles and grandparents coming along. **********He kept talking about going up to Ramallah to get a job, and I told him he  had to finish his studies first,\" Mrs. Abu Warda said, turning the day over and  over in her mind, seeking some elusive hint of what was to come. **********Majdi skipped the Friday picnic. Mrs. Abu Warda never saw her 18-year-old son again. The next Sunday, Feb. 25, he climbed aboard a No. 18 bus to carry out the first of four bombings that sent the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords reeling toward an uncertain future. **********\"He seemed normal,\" Mrs. Abu Warda said. \"There was just nothing, and we never sensed he had such feelings. But from a religious point of view we have to accept he is a martyr and thank God.\" **********The dozen women encircling her murmured their approval. \"Thanks be to God,\" they echoed. **********Though they are praised at home as God's most devout servants, and pigeonholed by outsiders as madmen, suicide bombers are made, not born. They are nurtured through a training system that grafts the ecstasy of absolute religious devotion onto the despondency common among teen-agers raised under occupation, say experts who study the phenomenon. **********Their stunted horizons create a volatile mix of hopelessness and anger. The humiliations of Israeli-controlled checkpoints, work permits and curfews give focus to their frustration. Then politicized Islamic militants step in and offer an out: die for the cause and enter the fast lane to Paradise. In the process you get revenge, you get glory and your family gets a stipend. **********\"They have all the tools,\" said Dr. Mustapha al-Masri, a Gaza Strip psychiatrist. \"They have the history of the occupation during which the Israelis were dehumanized, seen only as repressing people. They have the history of Islam as a glorious, victorious faith and the promise of Paradise after death. All they need is a young man ready to make the idea central to his own life.\" **********There is no shortage of recruits, even though Palestinian public approval of  the holy war against Israel seems to be waning. Aim Ayalon, the head of Israel's internal security agency, warned recently that hundreds more Palestinians were willing to become suicide bombers. Should too many more fulfill their wish, they could destroy the attempt by Israel and the Palestinians to reach a settlement. **********The Profile Young, Bitter And Out of Luck **********Psychiatrists, political scientists and army intelligence officers who have studied the phenomenon are hesitant to say they know the mind of the suicide bomber, but a crude psychological portrait has emerged from the 20 or so attacks in the last two years. And from interviews with thwarted bombers, contrite recruiters and family members, they have learned a fair amount about the process of indoctrination and training. **********It often starts with members of the military cells of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, or the even more militant Islamic Holy War, who circulate among the organizations' schools and mosques during religious instruction. The recruiter will drop the idea of dying for God into the conversation and gauge the students' reactions, one expert said. The trainers zoom in on those who discuss the idea seriously. **********Almost invariably, potential bombers have a relative who was killed, wounded  or jailed during the occupation. Majdi Abu Warda had watched his younger brother hauled out of bed by Israeli soldiers last year; the boy served 10 months in jail for throwing stones, and was released a month before Majdi blew up the bus  in Jerusalem. **********Bombers are also likely to have some longstanding personal frustration. Some  have reportedly had trouble finding a bride; others have been shamed by friends  for fearing to throw stones at Israeli jeeps. **********Most of those who have carried out attacks have been between 18 and 24, unmarried, childless and unemployed. **********\"They are young, very enthusiastic, reliable enough not to go tell everyone on the street,\" said a senior Israeli Army officer, speaking on condition that his name not be used. \"These groups don't want some lunatic who will not know how to pull the trigger at the very last moment.\" **********In Al Fawwar, Majdi's family and teachers said he had tremendous self-discipline. One of 11 children, his father an elementary school teacher, Majdi would spend hours in the hills sitting stock-still next to a special net, waiting for a nightingale to land. Eventually he captured three of them in  cages, and would erupt in a rage if anyone tampered with them. **********\"He cared more for the birds than for any member of the family,\" said a sister, Ghada Abu Warda. **********The entire Abu Warda family read the Koran with devotion, and relatives said  Majdi was pious, but hardly a zealot. He would sometimes skip the first prayer of the day, which requires arising before dawn. **********But he focused mostly on religion, going to bed by 8 every night and never watching television. If he was interested in politics, family members say, he kept it to himself. **********It was the same story at the Vocational Training Center in downtown Hebron, where Majdi enrolled last November in a tile-laying class. His teachers said he  was polite, quiet and punctual and seemed uninterested in joining political discussions. **********The Theology Garden of God Awaits the Martyr **********Islam forbids suicide and inveighs against killing civilians. But in lengthy  study sessions, bomber recruits focus on all the verses referring to the glory of dying for God in the Koran and the Hadith, the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed that form the basis of Islamic law. **********The Koranic verse that is perhaps the most popular with them reads: \"Think not of those who are slain in God's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord.\" **********The religion emphasizes that life on earth is a transition. The next life is  the real one. Scriptures and sermons idealize the afterlife as a carefree garden replete with gold palaces, scrumptious food and scores of even-tempered women. **********A suicide bomber's death is described by Muslim militants as \"the martyr's wedding,\" an occasion of joy and celebration. **********Aside from religion, the indoctrination includes a heavy dose of anti-Israel  diatribes. Students are assigned various tasks, like delivering a gun, to test their commitment. Some have said they were buried in mock graves to see if the idea of death spooked them. It is at this stage that the recruits, organized in  groups of 5 to 10, start resembling cult members, mentally isolated from family and friends. **********\"Islam is an appealing new identity because Arab nationalism has been defeated,\" said Dr. Eyad Sarraj, program director for Gaza's community mental health program. \"Islam gives you a sense of hope and moral victory, especially when you come from an environment of despair and defeat.\" **********The attackers leave for their missions right from their mosques, having spent two or three days chanting the relevant scriptures aloud with a cleric. The chanting is said to create an unshakable and even pleasurable conviction that they are about to sit next to God. **********The conviction is strong enough that the bombers move in crowded places among Israelis without exhibiting any anxiety that might expose them, experts say. **********\"At the last moment he is thinking only of heaven,\" said a Palestinian religious scholar in Hebron. **********The generally poor recruits know their families will be helped for life. The  Israeli Army officer said the stipends handed out by Hamas included $800 a month to the families of activists, plus things like scholarships for their siblings and subsidized rice. **********Bombers are also promised that if the family house gets knocked down by the Israeli Army in retribution, the organization will pay for a replacement. **********Mousa Ziadah, 15, a trainee, was arrested last year in Gaza. His father said  he was initially oblivious to the indoctrination, happy with his son's blossoming faith. Mousa told reporters that his brainwashing had started when he was about 10 and sweeping the mosque floors. **********\"They taught me about the heroes of Islam who were killed as saints and how they are now in heaven beside God,\" said Mousa, adding that the lessons emphasized the number of Palestinians killed and jailed during the occupation. \"I also learned that the Jews have no right to exist on this land, which belongs to Muslims,\" he said. **********In Al Fawwar, such politics pervade the Abu Warda household. **********An open sewage gutter bisects the five-foot-wide alleyway where the family's  four-room, concrete bunker of a dwelling sits jammed between similar houses. **********Just 18 miles west lies the farmland their grandparents fled during the 1948  Arab-Israeli war. In those days it was called Irak al Manshiyeh. Today it is Qiryat Gat, an Israeli town. **********\"On cold winter days we would gather around the brazier to hear grandmother tell us stories about how half the land in Irak al Manshiyeh belonged to our family,\" said Fatima Abu Warda, a cousin. \"We always regretted that loss. She would tell us about the oranges, about the cows, how no butter ever tasted as sweet, and about the grapes.\" **********The Fame Like Movie Stars To Their Peers **********No one is sure where the ultimate orders for a bombing come from. But the bombers are given explosives training only in the days before the attack, the specialists say. **********The Israeli police have said there are two types of bombs. In the latest series of attacks, most were made of old Egyptian land mines smuggled into Gaza  through border tunnels. **********Carried in duffle bags along with bags of nails, they weigh about 60 pounds.  Wires extend up from the mines through two batteries and then to something like  a light switch. The wiring is passed through a hole in the bag and up into the bomber's pants leg, so he can press the switch with his hands in his pockets. **********The other form of bomb is more complicated. It consists of six to eight bars  of TNT dropped into slots on a specially designed eight-inch-wide belt. Shoulder straps help support the weight of the belt. **********This type requires a detonator and is therefore more prone to go off accidentally, but again the control switch is fed into a pants leg. **********When the attacks began, Hamas and Islamic Holy War released wills, some even  videotaped. **********\"The life of this world is just a game and an accumulation of possessions and children,\" wrote Hisham Hamad, a bomber from Islamic Holy War who killed three Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip in November 1994. \"What God has is better for me than all this.\" **********The wills stopped, because they gave the security services a handle to track  down the others involved. Now sometimes not even the name of the bomber is announced. **********But the fame of those already dead plays a role in finding new recruits. Eight-year-olds skip down Gaza alleyways shouting the names of the bombers. Their posters hang on barbershop walls among the Western or Egyptian movie stars. Their pictures adorn key chains and the equivalent of baseball cards. \"The Martyrs,\" a teenage doo-wop group in fatigues and slicked-back hair, is just one of dozens of bands praising bombers in song. **********To youngsters whose main outdoor activity from an early age consisted of stoning Israeli Army jeeps, bombers are the ultimate heroes. \"For just one day they make us feel strong,\" said a 26-year-old in Hebron. **********After Majdi and another young man from Al Fawwar blew themselves up on the same day, Hamas organized a mandatory celebration featuring candy and high praise. There was none of the bitter dark coffee of a normal wake. **********Then Israeli troops arrested the immediate male relatives of the bombers and  imposed a strict curfew. **********Majdi's relatives said that even before the crackdown, they had had trouble stomaching the fevered congratulations of their neighbors. **********Majdi's grandfather, the only close male relative not jailed, bellowed his pain at the boy's gruesome exploit: \"If we had known, we would have cut off his  legs.\" And his mother acknowledged a deep ambivalence about accepting his death  as a festive occasion for the faithful. **********\"Even if they gave me back all of Palestine, I would not want him to become such a martyr,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/04/business/ryder-sets-stock-buyback.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-10-04", "snippet": "Ryder System Inc to buy back up to six million of its common shares after sale of its consumer truck rental business (S)", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ryder Sets Stock Buyback", "print_headline": "Ryder Sets Stock Buyback", "body_text": " **********Ryder System Inc. is planning to buy back up to six million of its common shares after the sale of its consumer truck rental business.

Another A310 is expected to be delivered next week, and the carrier hopes to have six A310's flying by June. **********Formerly an overstaffed, unprofitable carrier, Air Jamaica was privatized in  November 1994, except for a 25 percent interest still retained by the Jamaican Government. Soon after the streamlined carrier leased the A310's last fall the F.A.A. banned them from United States airports, ruling that Jamaica's Civil Aviation Department had not met international safety standards. (Air Jamaica itself had met F.A.A. standards.) With the carrier losing tens of thousands of dollars a day, the Jamaican Government recently promised to upgrade its aviation department, and authorized a 125 percent increase in its 1996-97 budget. The F.A.A. promptly authorized the flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/02/business/media-business-advertising-music-retailer-whistles-new-marketing-tune-get-heard.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;A music retailer whistles a new marketing tune to get heard above the cacophony  of competitors.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;A music retailer whistles a new marketing tune to get heard above the cacophony  of competitors.", "body_text": " **********IF the premise of advertising is to raise share of mind or share of voice with consumers, then HMV Record Stores is gambling that an ambitious campaign can help gain share of ear in an increasingly clangorous and crowded market. **********Executives at HMV are hoping that their campaign, which features everything from discount coupons to a pink shuttle bus, will counter intensifying efforts by rival chains to draw shoppers seeking compact disks, cassette tapes and other music products. **********The goal is to build a brand identity for HMV as the chain that is continuously \"serving music\" -- a play on the slogan, \"His master's voice,\" from which the company derived its name. **********\"What I felt was needed was a creative direction for HMV in all our U.S. markets,\" said Alan McDonald, vice president for marketing at HMV U.S.A. in Stamford, Conn. His reference was to the 13 stores that HMV U.S.A., a unit of the British company Thorn EMI P.L.C., operates in cities that include Atlanta, Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington as well as a shop in the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland. **********HMV, which has more than 240 stores worldwide, came to America in 1990 by opening 2 the same day in Manhattan. **********Now it owns five stores in metropolitan New York, a market that has become one of the country's most competitive. Music fans can also find the Fugees, Ella Fitzgerald, \"Funny Girl\" or the Philadelphia Orchestra at outlets of chains like Coconuts Music, a unit of the Trans World Entertainment Corporation; Sam Goody, owned by the Musicland Stores Corporation; J&R Music World; Nobody Beats  the Wiz, and Tower Records, a unit of MTS Inc. **********And the Virgin Megastore, which the Virgin Group opened in Times Square in April, is drawing crowds large enough for that retailer to have extended its hours. **********\"We'd been saying very little other than running ads with HMV logos,\" Mr. McDonald said, \"and even the logos differed from one ad to the other.\" **********So a decision was made that the HMV U.S.A. account, previously divided among  various agencies, should be consolidated. In late February, a selection was made: GRW Advertising, a creatively focused shop in New York that specializes in both arts and entertainment marketing. **********HMV U.S.A. has given GRW a budget of $1 million, up about 25 percent from 1995. Along with \"co-op advertising\" -- funds that record companies give HMV U.S.A. for campaigns centering on specific artists and albums -- the retailer's  total annual budget is $4 million. **********But before spending anything, Mr. McDonald wanted data on the retail music market, particularly on the frequent buyers of compact disks, which are now the  dominant music format. Ed Ronk, strategic services director at GRW, estimated that such consumers accounted for almost 75 percent of all CD sales. **********GRW came up with an innovative idea: plotting perceptions of the various competitors -- on attributes like selection, prices, service, familiarity, professionalism and hipness -- on an imaginary street map. For instance, Tower was placed at the spot where Selection Street runs past Hip Highway and the High Awareness Interstate, while small independent stores were located at the point where Local Taste Alley goes past Hip Highway and Customer Service Court. **********HMV, according to the research, was recognized for strengths in service, selection and prices, said Tim Watson, marketing services director at GRW. **********And, Mr. McDonald said, because store managers have the flexibility to order  stock separate from chainwide orders, local taste was also ranked highly. **********Those attributes became the focus of the HMV campaign, along with a concept that \"although you'll find video at our stores,\" Mr. McDonald said, \"music is what we're about, as against CD-ROM's, video games, books, fragrances or clothing\" -- items that HMV's rivals sell. **********That's why the words \"Serving music\" have begun appearing in HMV print ads, said Alane Gahagan, creative services director at GRW, as a shorthand way of saying \"Music is our master.\" The theme is particularly important for those ads  \"in which HMV is doing advertising about itself,\" she added, \"without the co-op  advertising dollars.\" **********The print ads are appearing in newspapers and magazines like the Boston Phoenix, Time Out New York and The Village Voice; ads aimed at homosexuals, carrying the theme \"Be proud, play it loud,\" ran in June in publications like HX and the Philadelphia Gay News. **********Other elements of the campaign include bus shelter posters, fliers with discount coupons and sponsorships of events like the Central Park Summer Stage concert series in Manhattan. **********And to \"hit the tourist market,\" Mr. Watson said, \"which we recognize Virgin  has a toehold in,\" HMV is sponsoring a free shuttle bus that runs between hotels in midtown Manhattan and the airline building opposite Grand Central Terminal. The bus is painted pink and festooned with large HMV logos; riders can obtain discount coupons. **********Ken Kesey's words, it seems, are as appropriate to music retailing as they are to so many other endeavors: \"Now, you're either on the bus or off the bus.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-029009.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Acer Inc., Taipei, Taiwan, to Hal Riney & Partners, San Francisco, to handle the branding assignment for the personal computer marketer, previously handled by Lai Venuti & Lai, Santa Clara, Calif.

Over all, car and truck sales dropped 2.3 percent from the comparable period a year ago. **********The Ford Motor Company reported today that its August sales slipped 6.3 percent from their strong performance a year earlier, which was in line with the weak sales reported by other auto makers earlier this week. General Motors announced on Wednesday that its sales slid 7.9 percent, and the Honda Motor Company said its sales dropped 13.7 percent. Among American auto makers, only the Chrysler Corporation bucked the trend -- its sales rising 9.2 percent in August, though less than analysts had expected. **********Ford's chairman, Alexander Trotman, said today, ''It is clear to us that the market has really slowed down in the last three months compared with the first five months'' of the year. **********The dwindling car and truck sales mean that a large segment of the United States economy has slowed. Because auto sales are one of the first indicators available of monthly economic activity, economists watch them closely as a signal from consumers, and the Federal Reserve considers them as it decides whether to change interest rates. **********Auto makers fear any rate increase because higher interest rates make it harder for people to afford new cars and trucks, the payments commonly financed over several years. Mr. Trotman pointed to the industry sales figures as evidence that the Fed should leave rates untouched. ''There is very clearly a slowdown,'' he said, ''and I hope that that's observed by the Fed.'' **********Some analysts have speculated that Federal Reserve policy makers may push rates up later this month -- perhaps even on Friday, depending on the strength of the Labor Department's report then on unemployment and payroll levels. **********At Ford, sales of cars were weaker than sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, following a pattern throughout the industry. Ford's car sales slid 8.4 percent in August, while the sales of light trucks dropped 4.4 percent. **********Sales of the company's family sedans, the Ford Taurus and the Mercury Sable, rose 1.9 percent in August. But sales of the Ford Explorer, the popular sport utility vehicle, dropped 10.7 percent. Sales of the F-series pickup trucks was up 1.7 percent, but were hampered by short supplies. Ford said that would improve later this year because it has doubled the number of factories building the trucks. **********John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company, said that Ford's slower-than-expected sales suggested that the company had broken its practice of slapping costly rebates on slow-selling cars and trucks to keep its share of the overall market high. The August figures show that ''there is a limit to how much money Ford will spend to keep its share,'' Mr. Casesa said. **********While sales across the industry were still relatively strong, they were lower than had been expected. Economists and Wall Street analysts agreed that the sharply slower sales figures for July, coupled with August's disappointing sales, represented the beginning of a trend and that they showed that the brisk sales pace set earlier this year was unsustainable. Most predict that for the year, the industry will sell around 15 million light vehicles. **********This month, sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.8 million, up from 14.2 million in July. But analysts and economists cautioned that both numbers were misleading because of blips in the seasonal factors used by the Commerce Department in calculating the rates. Indeed, most analysts were disregarding the annual-rate figures because, they said, vagaries in the seasonal factors caused the July rates to understate the pace of sales but caused the August rates to overstate the sales pace. **********''The Fed well understands the quirks in the numbers, and will read July and August combined as saying at least one sector of the economy is showing slight weakness, but that is just one sector of the economy,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. **********''There is no question that sales in the second half will trail not only the second half of last year, but also the first half of this year,'' Mr. Glantz said. **********''Part of what you are seeing today is the payback for earlier gains,'' said Diane C. Swonk, an economist at First Chicago NBD Bank in Chicago. ''It still will be a decent year, even with a slowdown in the second half.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/22/business/high-technology-not-huddled-masses-us-brokers-help-cutting-edge-foreign.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1996-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High Technology, Not Huddled Masses;U.S. Brokers Help Cutting-Edge Foreign Companies Come to Wall Street", "print_headline": "High Technology, Not Huddled Masses;U.S. Brokers Help Cutting-Edge Foreign Companies Come to Wall Street", "body_text": " **********Jo A. Lernout and his partner, Pol Hauspie, found new ways to allow computers to recognize speech and turn written text into the spoken word a few years ago.  After starting a company in Belgium in 1987 to research and develop these products, they found customers ranging from AT&T to Samsung. By the middle of last year, they had decided to go public so that investors could discover them. **********But the local stock exchange was not an appealing prospect. Even by the standards of Europe's small stock markets, the stodgy Brussels bourse is a minnow. Turnover rarely approaches five million shares a day, compared with hundreds of millions in the United States, and Belgians prefer to invest in established local companies like Petrofina, the big Belgian energy company. **********Mr. Lernout had opened offices of his company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products N.V., in Woburn, Mass., in 1991. This had given him a firsthand look at the ability of high-technology companies to raise money on the Nasdaq stock market even before showing a profit. **********With two brokerage houses, Cowen & Company in New York and Hambrecht & Quist  in San Francisco, providing the necessary services, the company went public in December at $11 a share, raising $42 million. Its stock price has more than tripled; on Friday it closed at $34. **********The company was one of dozens of initial offerings by foreign high-technology companies on Nasdaq since 1990, according to the Securities Data Company. Six years ago, two foreign offerings sold for a total of $45 million. In 1995, 16 such issues raised $834 million -- more than 10 percent of the $7.9 billion worth of new high-technology issues that year. **********This year, the pace has remained fast. Eight foreign companies had gone public on Nasdaq through Friday, raising more than $183 million. (The Nasdaq, with its less stringent listing requirements and its established list of high-technology companies, has proved more attractive to new high-technology companies than the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange.) **********The chance to inject American capital into foreign business is the icing on the cake for high-technology brokerage firms, which have seen their business grow rapidly recently. Cowen has perhaps grown the fastest: its revenues have doubled over the last three years, and the return on its capital is now about 50 percent, said Joseph M. Cohen, Cowen's chairman and chief executive, in an interview last week. **********With return business, as well as a wave of new foreign and American companies, calling daily, the specialized American brokerage firms that concentrate on financing and researching high-technology and health care companies are riding high. Alex. Brown Inc. of Baltimore, which recently announced net earnings of $40.7 million for the first quarter, up 148 percent from a year earlier; Robertson, Stephens & Company of San Francisco, and the high-technology and health-care divisions of Wall Street giants like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley are enjoying a surge in their profits, which tend to be cyclical. **********And while they all know that the boom is likely to be followed by a decline in this business, the tide has not yet turned. Lernout & Hauspie used a portion  of the $42 million of its initial offering to pay off its debts while funneling  $26 million into expansion. The company plans to go back to Nasdaq with a secondary offering soon, said Mr. Lernout, who worked for Wang Laboratories before setting up the company. **********Analysts often speak highly of Cowen, Hambrecht and their high-technology brethren in the American brokerage business. \"They have excellent follow-up in the market after an offering, particularly with research,\" said John E. Fitzgibbon Jr. of I.P.O. After Market, a unit of Securities Data Publishing. **********Mr. Fitzgibbon said Cowen had managed seven new public offerings for foreign  high-technology and health care companies in the last 12 months. **********As a result, Cowen has climbed up the list of firms that manage initial public offerings. It ranks 13th as a manager of initial public offerings this year, up from 18th last year, 34th in 1994 and 42d in 1993, according to Securities Data. That still leaves it behind high-technology backers like Robertson, Stephens, which led the pack in 1995; Morgan Stanley was second. **********Among the other European companies that Cowen has helped bring to Nasdaq are  Nera A.S., a Norwegian company that develops and makes wireless telecommunications equipment, in an offering that was managed with Lehman Brothers; Xeikon N.V., a Belgian company that develops and markets digital color printing technology, and a Dutch software developer, the Baan Company, which Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Cowen and UBS Securities, a unit of the Union Bank of Switzerland, took public. **********Robertson, Stephens last year took Firefox Communications Inc. and Insignia Solutions Inc., two British high-technology companies, as well as Tower Semiconductor Ltd., an Israeli company, to Nasdaq. **********The high-technology brokerage firms attribute much of their success with United States and foreign clients to their research analysts who, they say, can  quickly add value in industries where technologies and companies are changing rapidly. **********\"We started with research and we have stayed with our distinctive competence,\" said Terrence R. Connelly, Cowen's head of investment banking. Those areas, he said, are information technology, high technology and health care. **********Michael G. McCaffrey, Robertson's president, boasted of his firm's \"seven senior software analysts and five senior semiconductor analysts.\" **********Cowen's capital now totals about $148 million, including $21 million of debt. Mr. Cohen attributed Cowen's success to \"a well-thought-out strategy\" and to perseverance. But he also sounded a note of caution: \"Right now,\" he said, \"the  climate is a technology-driven climate; there's always an event that can change  that.\" **********Mr. Connelly, who directs Cowen's investment banking division, contended that his firm's in-depth research was particularly useful for a client like Xeikon. \"Xeikon is covered for us by Stephen Weber, a managing director and an experienced and highly rated analyst who also covers Xerox as well as I.B.M.,\" he said. \"This all adds to Xeikon's credibility.\" **********There are risks, of course, for the investor in all the enthusiasm for high-technology offerings. Even in the favorable climate there have been some duds. **********\"Some of them have performed badly. This is the age of selectivity,\" said Mr. Fitzgibbon, recalling a recent week in which the best high-technology initial public offering rose 30 to 40 percent in the week in which it went public, while others were down as much as 25 percent. **********And some analysts are cautious about the type of companies going public under the aegis of these firms. \"I'm a bit skeptical about the quality and staying power of some of these companies that Cowen, Hambrecht, Robertson, Stephens and  others are taking public,\" said Perrin H. Long Jr., an independent analyst covering the securities industry. **********The bankers are also trying to position themselves for the inevitable downturn. Consolidation will follow, Mr. Connelly said. \"That's why we are now building our merger-and-acquisition capability,\" he said. \"You have to anticipate cycles and have to build a balanced business.\" **********Ambitious European bankers, meanwhile are catching on to the prospects for this type of investment banking business. Earlier this month, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank of Deutsche Bank A.G. of Frankfurt, hired, at huge expense, Frank Quattrone, the head of Morgan Stanley's high-technology banking team, and more than a dozen other Morgan Stanley executives in an attempt to build a global high-technology franchise based in the United States. **********Many European business leaders who have gone to the United States stock markets seem satisfied. \"We thought that on the U.S. market, we would have a better and more appropriate valuation of the company and therefore would be able to raise more money,\" said Marc Blanpain, the chief financial officer of Xeikon. \"For high-tech and new companies, Europe is not that aggressive.\" **********Sensing that, American brokerage houses are actively prospecting abroad. Robertson, Stephens, which specializes in health care, high-technology and retailing companies, opened an office in London this month, according to its chairman, Sanford R. Robertson. **********The firm will conduct a conference in London on June 4 and 5 for current and  prospective European clients, according to Mr. McCaffery of Robertson, Stephens. \"We'll go anywhere where our core franchise is,\" he said. **********Cowen is also trying to raise its profile overseas. Last month it played host to a conference on emerging technologies in Cannes on the French Riviera, where  60 client companies made presentations to investors. Of 400 executives attending, 150 were European portfolio managers. **********And Cowen says the trend will continue, with more European high-technology companies following the lead of Xeikon, Nera and others. **********\"The market wants quality companies, and the research base for understanding  these companies is much stronger here than it is in Europe,\" said Adele M. Morrissette, a director in Cowen's investment banking department."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/29/business/company-news-c-tec-to-sell-some-telecommunications-assets.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;C-TEC TO SELL SOME TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSETS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;C-TEC TO SELL SOME TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSETS", "body_text": " **********The C-Tec Corporation, a telecommunications concern, agreed yesterday to sell some assets to a major shareholder, the RCN Corporation, for about $123 million.

Microsoft said it had chosen MCI as the primary distributor of its commercial on-line service, the Microsoft  Network. And MCI said it would promote Microsoft's Internet software and browser throughout its network. **********MCI is already developing an on-line service with News Corporation. But Bert C.

But he said Microsoft would take in some revenue as MCI used its software and Internet browser. **********Analysts said the deal would benefit MCI by relieving the long-distance carrier of the expense of designing its own on-line service. Since Microsoft will also promote MCI's regular telephone services, MCI will have access to the  80 million customers who use Windows software. **********\"If the name of the game is everybody competing with everybody else,\" said Jack Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, \"then the more stuff you can sell  to your customers, the better.\" **********MCI's deal is a setback for the company's other venture with the News Corporation. MCI had originally promoted on-line services as the centerpiece of  its $2 billion alliance with the News Corporation, which owned the struggling Delphi on-line service. Both companies planned to use Delphi as the base for a much larger service. **********\"It seems clear that MCI has been frustrated by the slow pace of development  there,\" said Emily Green, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. **********Delphi still has fewer than 100,000 subscribers, and the company has said little about new marketing or technology initiatives. **********Scott Kurnit, chief executive of the MCI/News venture, said MCI's priorities  had changed since it struck an alliance with the News Corporation in May. He added, \"We are pursuing several other companies about becoming partners with us.\" **********Executives familiar with the venture said that tomorrow it would announce that the Oracle Corporation, the software developer, was taking a 40 percent equity stake in the venture. News Corporation will also own 40 percent, while MCI's interest will drop to 20 percent. **********For his part, Mr. Roberts noted that the MCI/News Corporation partnership was expanding in other ways. The companies plan to collaborate in delivering satellite television, using a high-powered orbital slot that MCI won in a Government auction last week for $472 million. **********Analysts said the News Corporation would provide entertainment programs to the satellite venture through its Fox television network. **********In a sign of just how Byzantine the deal-making has become, MCI has a deal with the News Corporation and Microsoft, while Microsoft has a separate deal with another television network, NBC. Microsoft and NBC plan to start a 24-hour news network and on-line service, MSNBC. **********Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC Cable, said that Microsoft's deal with MCI did not pose a conflict with NBC's partnership. \"NBC News is distributed on the  Microsoft Network,\" he said, \"so anything that expands the distribution of the Microsoft Network is good for us.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/business/executive-changes-074209.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********AMERICAN COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INC., Annapolis Junction, Md., appointed Harry  D'Andrea chief financial officer, succeeding Ronald Kaiser, who resigned. **********CONVERSE INC., North Reading, Mass., said Gib Ford would retire as chairman and  chief executive next year after more than three decades with the company. **********HOME DEPOT, Atlanta, named Annette M.

But during testimony, he said he did not know exactly how many people he had shot. He put the number of Muslim men killed that day in a field near Srebrenica at 1,200. **********In reaching today's verdict, Judge Claude Jorda of France, who headed the three-judge panel, said the tribunal had taken into account the accused's age at the time -- 23 -- his low military rank and the remorse  he had expressed. But the judges did not admit his plea for clemency, which he based on the fact that he had acted ''under superior orders''; they said they lacked evidence to back up his claim. **********The judges said they had also noted his ''full and unconditional'' cooperation with prosecutors. **********Mr. Erdemovic's accounts, for instance, helped lead United Nations investigators to the site of mass graves at a farm at Pilica, 40 miles north of Srebrenica. The investigators found scores of bodies, and evidence that the burial ground had been tampered with and other bodies removed. **********At least 1,700 Muslims are believed to have been killed in Pilica; more than 6,000 boys and men from the Srebenica area are still missing. Srebrenica was set aside as a United Nations safe area for Bosnian Muslims, who took refuge there until they were overrun by Bosnian Serb forces. Some Muslims fled the advancing Serbs, who separated out men of military age and took them away, presumably to kill them. **********Prosecutors said they also valued Mr. Erdemovic's testimony because the unit he belonged to, the 10th Sabotage Unit of the Bosnian Serb army, reported directly to the Bosnian Serb high command. The prosecutors used his accounts of the large-scale execution of civilians at Srebenica in the arguments they made to issue an international arrest warrant against General Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander. **********While NATO has extended the  presence of its troops in the region, it is not showing any signs of expanding its mandate to arrest leaders who have been indicated as war criminals. **********Court officials said that no decision had been made as to where Mr. Erdemovic would serve his prison term but that it was likely to be in  Scandinavia. **********Eleven nations have volunteered to take prisoners sentenced by the tribunal; the United States is not among them. Mr. Erdemovic must serve the full 10 years, minus the time since March 31 that he has been in the tribunal's custody. The prosecution had recommended a sentence of no more than 10 years. **********As soon as the sentence was handed down, Jovan Babic, the lawyer for Mr. Erdemovic, went over to the defendant, apparently to console him. Afterward, Mr. Babic told reporters that he would appeal. **********Mr. Erdemovic remained calm today, although he has broken down sobbing on previous appearances in court, as when he testified last summer against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic and again at last week's pre-sentencing hearings. This summer, his pre-sentencing hearings were postponed because psychiatrists told the court that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress. **********His story has provided some astonishing glimpses into the life of a young man who served in all three armies in the war. **********He grew up on a farm near Tuzla, dropped out of high school and when the war began, joined the army of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. But when he found it to be short of food, he changed sides and joined the Croatian forces. There he earned handsome profits by helping Serbs escape across front lines. **********Arrested in 1993 on unspecified criminal charges, he fled to Bosnian Serb territory and joined the Bosnian Serb forces. His wife said he had done that because he felt he had no choice; he needed money and housing for his wife and new baby. His new unit did give him housing, that of a Muslim who had been driven out. **********The atrocities that have most haunted Mr. Erdemovic are the scenes from Srebenica, he said. Men ranging from teen-agers to 50-year-olds had their hands tied behind their backs, then were lined up in groups of 10. He and a group of eight soldiers then shot them in the back, he said. **********Mr. Erdemovic said the commander of the execution squad, identified as Brano Gojkovic, ''told me if I was sorry for those people, then I should line up with them.'' He told the court that he was forced to choose between ''my life and the life of those people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/09/business/nintendo-postpones-new-game-machine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nintendo Postpones New Game Machine", "print_headline": "Nintendo Postpones New Game Machine", "body_text": " **********The Nintendo Company said today that it would postpone the introduction of its new 64-bit game machine in Japan until June 23. **********The company had previously set April 21 as the introduction date for the machine, the Nintendo 64.

Today we laugh at the Luddites who smashed machines in the early 19th century and the candlemakers who sought to ban the light bulb some decades later. **********Yet \"globalization\" is increasingly being denounced as if it were some kind of sinister capitalist plot against the workers, instigated chiefly by the United States, that could somehow be thwarted if only enough people saw the light. **********The word itself is atrociously misused \u2014 sometimes as a virtual synonym for \"downsizing\" and other supposedly objectionable practices by multinational corporations; sometimes, equally erroneously, to denote an ideological belief in unfettered free markets. **********The problem with this is it suggests the whole process could be halted if only companies were more compassionate, chief executives less greedy and the United States less committed to free trade. That is putting the cart before the horse. The behavior of international companies is a response to globalization and the stiff competition it brings, not one of its primary causes. **********The forces driving globalization are the technological advances that have shrunk the cost of international transport and communications and ushered in the information revolution \u2014 together with the now virtually unanimous realization around the world that trade and open markets provide the best route to prosperity. **********One of the most dramatic features of globalization has been the scramble by developing and formerly Communist countries to liberalize their economies. **********That is what makes today's globalization so radically different from the open world economy that existed before World War I. This time, almost everyone stands to gain. Globalization is the best thing ever to hit most developing nations. Yet the strange thing is that many of the same people who used to lament the poverty of Third World countries are now attacking the process that is finally making them rich. **********The reason, of course, is that globalization's opponents only see the pain of economic adjustment in the industrial countries, not the growing hope and prosperity that is spreading through much of the rest of the world. **********Even if they cannot feel altruistic about it, the industrial nations should welcome the vastly improved well-being of the developing countries. **********As Zia Qureshi, a World Bank economist, points out in the latest issue of Finance and Development magazine, the developing countries are now capable of pulling the rich countries out of recession and by the end of the next decade will probably buy more than one-third of the rich countries' exports. **********If labor markets are allowed to function properly, Mr. Qureshi says, the industrial countries will press ahead with technological innovation in a wide range of sectors, rewarding themselves with well-paid, high-quality jobs. **********Developing countries will get the low-skilled, labor-intensive industries and, increasingly, the less-sophisticated service jobs such as data-processing. There should be plenty of work for everyone, he says. **********The rich countries still have a lot to learn in managing this difficult transition.

Nyberg, the chairman of the NCR Corporation, is sunk deep into a plush red chair in the ornate music room of Moraine Farm, the luxurious 1920's mansion once owned by Col. Edward A. Deeds, a long-ago chairman of the company that was then known as National Cash Register. **********It is an oddly luxurious setting in which to discuss Mr. Nyberg's recent cost-cutting. **********Since being swallowed by the AT&T Corporation in a $7.4 billion hostile takeover in 1991, NCR has lost staggering amounts of money -- nearly $4 billion since 1993. And since joining NCR 16 months ago, Mr. Nyberg has cut more than 8,000 jobs in his effort to trim $600 million in annual expenses. **********Why, then, hang onto this sprawling mansion with a 3,000-pipe organ, basement shooting gallery and rotating observatory? **********''It is very easy to come in here with a new broom and throw everything out,'' said Mr. Nyberg, a 45-year-old Swede who joined NCR in June 1995 after 20 years at Philips Electronics N.V. in Europe. ''But selling this place would have taken away some of the heritage of the NCR company.'' **********As he tries to return NCR to financial health before its corporate divorce from AT&T later this year, the tall, plain-speaking Mr. Nyberg knows that NCR's 112-year tradition -- dating to the world's first cash register -- is one of his strongest assets. **********It is for the same reason that in January, not long after AT&T said it would spin off the computer division,  Mr. Nyberg decided to restore its birth name, NCR, and abandon the ponderous ''AT&T Global Information Solutions'' that, to many employees, had come to symbolize the company's decline. **********Beyond such symbolism, Mr. Nyberg has further raised morale by leading a financial turnaround. On Oct. 17, NCR said it had an operating profit of $29 million in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $196 million a year earlier. The operating profit brought NCR to the break-even point for the year -- a goal Mr. Nyberg had not expected to achieve until December. **********It is a feat that may also put cash in the pockets of NCR employees,  who have each been promised stock options worth $3,000 for a break-even year, and as much as $4,500 each if the company achieves profitability. **********Still, even if the new NCR manages to turn a profit this year, its future as an independent company is by no means assured. Five years of drift and strategic flights of fancy under AT&T have eroded the company's traditional strengths in automatic teller machines, electronic cash registers and large-scale computers. Now, as Mr. Nyberg refocuses the company on these areas, NCR faces stiff competition. **********''It's not like they are going to go out of business,'' said Gilbert P. Williamson, a longtime NCR executive who served as chairman and chief executive for two years after the AT&T takeover. ''But when you are competing against companies like Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Microsoft you are in the big leagues. And NCR barely has its nose above water.'' **********Mr. Nyberg, who is the fifth chairman and chief executive at NCR in the last five years, is well aware of the challenge that awaits him, once the company's shares begin trading next January. ''A zero result makes nobody happy,'' he said. ''Shareholders want a dividend; they want the share price to go up.'' **********AT&T shareholders have reason to be impatient. When AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, decided to buy NCR in 1991 over the strenuous objections of NCR's management, he was convinced that there was synergy between the computer and communications businesses. But after dragging NCR into the AT&T fold, Mr. Allen and his team were never able to prove that hypothesis. **********''I would say that the fundamental mistake -- and I was someone who was pretty optimistic about the merger at the time -- was never to really articulate how we were going to fit in and what we were expected to contribute in the overall scheme of things,'' said Daniel J. Enneking, a senior vice president who joined NCR in 1975. **********Though NCR had focused mostly on selling corporate computing systems to business customers, in 1993 AT&T set its sights on becoming one of the top five personal-computer suppliers in the world. **********It was a disastrous move, coming at a time when even more established brands like I.B.M. and Compaq were embroiled in a price war of attrition. **********By the time Mr. Nyberg arrived last year, NCR was losing $2 million a day and its employees were despondent. Taking a hard look at NCR's operations, he decided to exit the PC business. **********It was a bold step because it slashed NCR's annual revenues by more than a billion dollars to about $7 billion. But it immediately improved the company's overall profit margin, which reached 29 percent in the third quarter -- up from 19.5 percent a year earlier. **********Mr. Nyberg's plan went on to shrink NCR's staff and expenses and refocus the company on its pre-AT&T strengths. AT&T itself has paid dearly for its blunders. The long-distance giant has had to inject more than $2.8 billion in cash into NCR since 1993 and has promised to hand over another $487 million before the spinoff. That will leave NCR with about $1.3 billion in equity and $1 billion in cash. **********''Bob Allen promised me that I would have a strong balance sheet,'' Mr. Nyberg said. **********Though a price for NCR's stock has not been set yet, most analysts predict that the new company will have a market capitalization of about $4 billion -- about half what AT&T paid for NCR in 1991. **********Mr. Nyberg is convinced that NCR's long-standing relationship with banks like Chase Manhattan and Bank of America, and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, as well as its global presence -- the company gets more than half its revenues from outside the United States -- will enable it to grow. **********Several customers said that they were rooting for NCR and that its service and products had improved greatly in the last year. **********But the years of turmoil have cost the computer maker valuable time. Both its financial and retail businesses did not grow last year and the financial-services unit saw its sales shrink 7 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1995. Professional services, which include designing and setting up NCR systems and are another high-growth area Mr. Nyberg is aiming for, also had flat revenues for the first six months of this year compared with last. **********In addition, NCR's largest customer by far has been AT&T itself, which accounted for 8 percent of the company's revenues in the first half of this year. Both AT&T and its equipment manufacturing arm that was spun off last month, Lucent Technologies, have contracted to keep buying from NCR after it is on its own, but they are not obligated to spend as much as they have previously. **********One bright spot for NCR has been its large-scale computer division. The Teradata Corporation, which NCR bought in 1992, was an early seller of powerful computers and software that help businesses sift through vast stores of customer data to discern trends. The industry term for this practice is data warehousing, and it is expected to grow into a $15 billion market by the end of the decade, up from $3 billion today. **********NCR has built data warehouses for many of the world's largest retailers and many of the biggest banks as well. The largest commercial warehouse anywhere was built by NCR for Wal-Mart Stores, which maintains a record of every item sold in each of its 2,268 stores for the past 65 weeks. The data base, which holds 7.5 trillion bytes of information, or the equivalent of about 2 billion pages of text, enables Wal-Mart to track which items -- down to individual tubes of toothpaste -- are selling best in which stores. **********But critics claim that NCR is losing ground as rivals like the Oracle Corporation, I.B.M. and Informix move into the data warehousing market. ''The other vendors are moving very quickly to catch up,'' said Kevin Strange, a research director at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm that advises businesses how to invest their information-technology dollars. ''Unfortunately, NCR has not moved the bar up.'' **********Mr. Strange contended that much of the growth that NCR is now reporting comes from existing customers upgrading their systems from Teradata's old, proprietary data base software to the new version, which runs on NCR's variety of the Unix operating system. **********Not so, countered Mr. Nyberg, who said that two-thirds of the computer group's sales were to either new clients or existing customers buying entirely new applications. **********Randy Mott, the chief information officer at Wal-Mart, said that the retailer compared NCR against its competitors in December, when it was deciding how to upgrade its data warehouse. NCR won hands down. **********Several Wal-Mart stores are testing a new electronic price label being developed by NCR and AT&T's Bell Labs that would allow the prices of items on store shelves to be changed remotely using radio signals. **********''We think this thing is really going to take off,'' said Anthony Fano, NCR's senior vice president in charge of retail systems. **********But when it comes to the Internet, which most experts say will transform the retail and financial-services industry, NCR is not even a player. Wal-Mart, for instance, has teamed with the Microsoft Corporation to develop Web software for an on-line ''virtual'' store, which Microsoft plans to sell to other retailers. **********Such is the problem for the new NCR. Unlike wealthier rivals, it cannot afford to lay too many bets on the table. ''I have to put money where I get the biggest bang,'' Mr. Fano said. ''I'm not going to get into the same position as I did before.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/14/business/inside-075019.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSIDE", "print_headline": "INSIDE", "body_text": " **********INVESTING IT /Page 6/ Some new, and some old, ways for investors to play foreign countries.

He was 70 and had been suffering for years from a disabling neurological disorder. **********Dr. Salam shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with two Americans, Dr. Steven Weinberg (now a professor at the University of Texas in Austin) and Dr. Sheldon Glashow of Harvard University, for research all three conducted independently of one another. Their theory on the fundamental forces is regarded by physicists as one of the landmarks of 20th-century science. **********Besides his trailblazing research in theoretical physics, Dr. Salam was a leader in international efforts to make physics accessible to students from developing countries. He was a founder of the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, which has supported the studies of third-world physicists since its founding in 1964. **********Research by Dr. Salam, Dr. Weinberg and Dr. Glashow culminated in equations demonstrating a fundamental relationship -- or ''symmetry'' -- between the electromagnetic force (which is transmitted by light and other forms of radiation) and the weak nuclear force, which operates within atomic nuclei and is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay. The four known forces of nature are the electromagnetic force, the weak and strong nuclear forces, and gravity. **********For the first instant after the universe was created by the Big Bang fireball some 15 billion years ago, physicists believe, the underlying symmetry of nature unified all the forces as one, But as conditions cooled, the symmetry was broken and the forces went their separate ways. **********Dr. Salam, remembered for his kindly manners and luxuriant black beard and mustache, used to explain the concept of symmetry breaking by analogy with a dinner party, at which the guests are seated around a circular table and a salad dish is placed between each pair of neighbors. The table setting is symmetrical until someone takes a salad dish either from his right or left side, after which the salad-dish symmetry is broken, and the other guests can no longer choose between left or right dishes. The broken symmetry of the weak force results in interactions that have a left-handed bias. **********But the three physicists were able to show that although the weak and electromagnetic forces seem completely unlike one another, they nevertheless share a hidden symmetry that can be demonstrated by an extremely difficult set of equations. Complicating matters, most of the solutions of these equations produce infinite values rendering the equations useless. A solution was found by developing mathematical tools to make the equations ''renormalizable,'' that is, free of uselessly infinite solutions. **********This was no easy task. **********In an interview yesterday, Dr. Glashow recalled that in 1960 he presented a paper in Copenhagen that he believed would lead to a ''standard model'' of particle physics that would be renormalizable. **********''This caused a dispute,'' Dr. Glashow said, ''and about a month later, Abdus Salam showed that I was all wet.'' **********But by the end of the 1960's all three scientists had reached generally similar conclusions. One was a prediction that the weak force must be transmitted by particles undiscovered up to then, known as weak vector bosons. These hypothesized particles -- the W-plus, W-minus and Z-zero particles, analogous to the photon particle, which transmits the electromagnetic force -- became the objects of a sometimes bitter race between accelerator physicists. **********In 1983, a group headed by Dr. Carlo Rubbia at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, found the W particles, and the next year they detected Z-zero particles, which transmit what is called weak neutral current within atomic nuclei. **********Acting with unusual speed, the Nobel committee awarded a physics prize to Dr. Rubbia and his collaborator, Dr. Simon van der Meer, in  1984, and the ''electroweak theory'' forged by Dr. Salam, Dr. Weinberg and Dr. Glashow was confirmed. **********Dr. Salam was born on Jan. 29, 1926, at Jhang, a rural community in what is now Pakistan. His father was a schoolteacher who encouraged his education, and his prodigious intellect won him first-class educational opportunities even as a child. At the age of 14 he entered Government College in Lahore, having achieved the highest grade ever recorded for an entrance examination to the college. **********He completed his undergraduate education at Punjab University and then moved to Cambridge University in England, which awarded him a doctorate in 1952. From 1951 to 1954 he also served as a professor of mathematics at Government College and Punjab University in Lahore. He then moved back to England, where in 1957, he became a professor of theoretical physics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, where he remained for most of his life. It was there that he developed the mathematics of the electroweak theory. **********Awarded an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth as well as many scientific prizes, Dr. Salam spent much of his later life trying to promote scientific education in developing countries, including Pakistan. In 1966 he recalled that while he worked in Lahore, he had felt ''terribly isolated'' by lack of communication with scientific peers, and that above all, third-world scientists need contact with counterparts in developed countries. He dreamed of founding a ''World University'' to that end. **********Dr. Salam, the first Muslim scientist to win a Nobel Prize, observed Muslim customs, including multiple marriages. His two wives attended his award ceremony in Stockholm in 1979, but Swedish officials felt obliged to seat them in different parts of the auditorium while the King decorated their husband. **********Dr. Salam, unable to speak or move without a wheelchair in his last years, is survived by his wife, Dr. Louise Johnson, and their child, as well as four children by his Muslim wife."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/09/business/surprise-job-report-ambushes-bond-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1996-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 737, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Surprise Job Report Ambushes Bond Investors", "print_headline": "Surprise Job Report Ambushes Bond Investors", "body_text": " **********Bond investors were swept up in a wild scramble to sell off holdings yesterday after the Government reported a much stronger labor market than investors had imagined. Months of pricing in the climate of a weak economy and cuts in interest rates evaporated in a flash. **********Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said the day was \"pandemonium.\" Bond prices plunged and their yields registered their biggest one-day jump since 1987. **********Fears of a strengthening economy and the rising inflation that it could bring convinced investors that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates  at its next policy meeting on March 26. The next probable chance would not come  until the next meeting in May. **********Tom Seay of the Lexington Management Corporation told Bloomberg Business News, \"For anybody who had visions the Fed was still going to cut interest rates at the end of this month, that's history.\" **********By the close of the New York cash market, the price of the Treasury's 30-year benchmark bond was down 33/32 points, to a price of 9026/32 . The yield on the long bond, a measuring stick by which consumer, corporate and municipal borrowing is calculated, soared to its highest level since last August. The yield rose to 6.72 percent, from 6.46 percent on Thursday. **********That was the largest one-day surge since June 2, 1987, when the yield soared  32 basis points, to 8.93 percent. That jump came on the day Paul A. Volcker said he would not seek a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. **********The yield is now at the highest level since last Aug. 24, when it was 6.81 percent. **********Traders said the the number of jobs added to the economy in February was twice what they had expected. The magnitude of the rise left many economists befuddled since only a week ago many were predicting that the Fed would cut rates this month, in reaction to a weak economy. **********Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said that while the jump in payrolls eliminates  any thoughts of an impending recession, it was unclear just how briskly the economy was moving. That is because broad sectors within the jobs report showed  a mixed performance. \"The service sector is displaying consistent growth, which  is likely a true assessment of the current situation,\" he said. But \"the construction sector showed strong growth, which is questionable as to its magnitude, and manufacturing appears to be going nowhere.\" **********These statistics, he said, shift the Fed into a neutral position. Not only is the Fed unlikely to change its policy at the March 26 meeting, but it may also well decide to maintain its 5.25 percent Federal funds target rate through the May meeting. **********Mr. Fine said that a two-year Treasury note yielding roughly 5.75 percent appeared to be consistent with a neutral Fed. Yesterday, at the close of the New York market, the two-year note was down 21/32 of a point, to a price of 9828/32  to yield 5.74 percent, up from 5.38 percent on Thursday. **********\"The numbers today may have overstated the pace of economic activity,\" Mr. Fine said, considering the weak signs that are apparent, \"with our trading partners in Europe and Japan still in an economic funk, corporate mergers and downsizing activity still widespread and the baby-boomer generation still concerned about their future economic security.\" **********\"If so, inflation is unlikely to accelerate on a trend basis,\" he said, \"and  coupled with a neutral Fed that will not be stimulating the economy anytime soon, that implies the potential for lower bond yields from today's somewhat panic levels.\" **********Like Mr. Fine other analysts suspected that the economy was not as strong as  depicted in the jobs report. **********Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist for Technical Data, Boston, said: \"Spikes  in nonfarm payrolls like the 705,000 surge reported for February 1996 are not unusual. The important thing to remember is that spikes do not say anything about the underlying trend in employment. They do speak to the imperfect nature  of surveys and statistics.\" **********She said the bond market overreacted, in keeping with a herd mentality. After the market crash in 1987, she said, \"everyone was saying the sky had fallen, and it didn't.\" **********\"And,\" she said, \"it's not falling this time either.\" **********Ms. Kimelman said she would not be surprised if excess selling pushed the yield on the long bond up to 7 percent.

Komansky, its president and chief operating officer, would succeed Daniel P. Tully as chief executive at the end of the year. **********The move, which was expected, was announced after Merrill's board approved the changes at a meeting yesterday afternoon. Mr. Tully, who has been chief executive since May 1992, will turn 65 next year, retirement age at Merrill. Mr. Komansky will replace Mr. Tully as chief executive on Dec. 28 and will replace him as chairman on April 15. **********Analysts expect the succession to have little effect on Merrill, giving both men high marks for the management skills that have helped to raise Merrill's returns to among the best for the larger Wall Street firms. ''I think it'll be a seamless transition, the two have worked together very closely,'' said Raphael Soipher, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman, an investment bank. **********The Tully-Komansky partnership has succeeded in part because Merrill has managed to play down the star system that is often a hallmark of big Wall Street firms. ''Merrill doesn't have the same cult of personality that surrounds many top investment bankers,'' Mr. Soipher said. ''It's a firm mainly without a star system, and that's a large reason for its success.'' One way that Merrill has achieved this is by making its succession plans well in advance. **********Mr. Komansky, 57, who began working for Merrill Lynch in 1968 as a financial consultant in its Forest Hills, Queens, office, has run several major businesses during his career at Merrill, the largest American brokerage business. In the early 1990's, he ran the firm's equity markets group, then its debt business, before becoming president and chief operating officer in January 1995. In the late 1980's, Mr. Komansky oversaw the sale of Merrill Lynch Realty/ Fine Homes International. **********In an interview yesterday, Mr. Komansky said that he expected to continue Merrill's current strategy, particularly pursuing an expansion into institutional fund management business and helping the overseas businesses to grow. **********Listing the challenges facing the firm, he cited the inroads that commercial banks were making into the stock-brokerage business with the apparent blessing of regulators. ''We need regulatory relief in the form of changes in Glass-Steagall,'' he said referring to the law that still, at least in theory, separates the banking and securities businesses.

The customer will be able to set up the service so that calls can be automatically forwarded to a number where the person is -- a pager, car phone, restaurant or friend's house, for example. **********The basic MCI One package, starting at $4.95 a month, includes 30 minutes of  calling, five free hours of Internet access and electronic mail, a personal \"800\" number with routing features and a calling card. After 30 minutes, each additional minute of telephone time will cost 15 cents, MCI executives said yesterday. After the five hours on the Internet, each additional hour will cost  $2.50 an hour, though a flat monthly fee of $19.95 for unlimited use is an option. **********The Internet-access feature is intended to appeal mainly to people who may subscribe to an on-line service like America Online, but are not yet tapping directly into the Internet, said Chris Mannella, a vice president of brand marketing at MCI. To make going on line easier, the MCI offer includes the Microsoft Corporation's Explorer browsing program free. **********The cost of the wireless communications MCI One package, including cellular phone and paging services, begins at $37.95 a month. **********While the MCI offering currently lacks the crucial link of local phone service, the company is aggressively filing with state regulators to begin local service in many markets by the end of the year. **********\"MCI One will be our brand for local service,\" said John Donoghue, senior vice president of marketing. **********In its current package of services, MCI is also teaming with a subsidiary of  the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to offer security systems.

But some analysts noted that even in a bundled product, there may well  be a confusing collection of services and pricing options. What will be simple,  they say, is the single bill, which means paying MCI for several services instead of just long-distance calls. **********\"With all the new competition coming in the long-distance business, MCI wants to build an electronic moat around itself and its customers instead of getting into a pure price competition for long-distance service,\" said Howard Anderson,  managing director of the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/02/your-money/IHT-bright-returns-help-junk-bonds-overcome-their-shadowy-past.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Rehak", "pub_date": "1996-03-02", "snippet": "THE term \"junk\" was once synonymous with high income, high risk and high living.

Then came the scandals and collapses of the 1980s, and investors began to associate the name with, at best, financial hubris, at worst, corruption. **********But investing in high-yielding corporate debt, or junk bonds, will just not go away, and for a very simple reason: The investment returns are just too tempting. **********U.S. junk-bond funds had a bang-up year in 1995, rising a hefty 16.92 percent on average, according to Lipper Analytical Services, the New Jersey fund data group. Normally that would have won them a top-performer's spot, but junk got beat by competitors which typically trail behind. In an unusually strong year for the primary bond markets, the average highest-quality, A-rated bond fund soared 19.91 percent, while General Treasuries returned 20.89 percent. **********But now the tables have turned. In the first two months of this year, the average high-yield fund has outperformed A-rated funds and Treasury funds by 4 and 5 points respectively. **********Junk's revived prospects are being driven by a jittery U.S. bond market, buffeted by conflicting economic reports, and worries that interest rates have bottomed and could start up again, pushing bond prices down. That could be positive news for below-investment-grade debt, which is more affected by the creditworthiness of issuing companies than by interest rates. **********Moreover, \"high yield bond funds are one of the groups that still has a yield, and there is a drive among investors for yield,\" said Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. **********That is not to say those richer returns don't carry plenty of risk. Junk bond managers can reach for higher yields from less creditworthy companies that might fail to pay off their debt, or they can settle for lower yields from higher-rated issuers. But in general, the more highly rated a company, the more sensitive its bond prices are to interest-rate movements. **********Then there's the issue of defaults, which currently are running at about 3.2 percent, well below the 11 percent of the junk bond market collapse in 1990. But some analysts fear that the slowing U.S. economy could cut into the cash flow companies need to pay off debt, causing an upswing in defaults. **********So while junk fund managers contend they expect to outperform other income investments in 1995, they are building a variety of defenses for a far rockier market. **********\"We're targeting companies that are growing on their own merits, opposed to what the market is doing,\" said Dan Charleston, whose Seligman High Yield fund returned 20.72 percent last year. **********He thinks prospects remain bright for the high-yield debt of rural cellular phone operators like Price Cellular and Comnet Cellular: \"They're growing rapidly, adding new subscribers and getting into higher margin businesses,\" he said. **********He also likes Comcast Cable, which is issuing high-yield debt to finance its move into the wireless telephone business. A seasoned issuer, Comcast's bonds are currently yielding about 9.25 percent, roughly 3 percentage points over a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. **********To shield his portfolio from the effects of a slower economy, Mr. Charleston, like many of his counterparts, is bailing out of cyclical industries like auto and steel makers whose ability to keep up with debt payments is closely linked to the economy's ups and downs. \"They've had their day in the sun,\" he said. **********At the $850 million Northeast Investors Trust, up 17.27 percent last year, however, the strategy for precarious times could hardly be more different. Bruce Monrad, co-manager of the fund, is bottom-fishing \u2014 selectively \u2014 in bonds rated below single-B, the lowest speculative grade, and unrated bonds. **********Most money managers only dabble in these echelons, or avoid them altogether, but Mr. Monrad has a hefty 40 percent of his assets in this arena. The tradeoff for taking more credit risk? These bonds are relatively insensitive to interest rate volatility. **********Among Mr. Monrad's favorites are unrated bonds yielding 11 percent from Darling International, the country's largest renderer of animal fat. \"They have $50 million in cash flow and that's five times what they have to pay out in debt service,\" he said. **********Making calculated bets on out-of-favor industries is another typical Northeast play. Junk bonds issued by supermarkets were wiped off the buy lists of many funds last year after the Grand Union chain filed for bankruptcy, but Mr. Monrad recently picked up senior bonds of another supermarket chain, Penn Traffic Co., for 85 cents on the dollar. \"Our feeling is that no matter what happens we'll get 100, and a 15 percent return is just fine,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/20/business/exxon-gets-china-rights.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exxon Gets China Rights", "print_headline": "Exxon Gets China Rights", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Corporation said today that it had been granted exploration rights  to two large blocks in northwestern China.

Ramos has guests to dinner, he sometimes likes to hand out autographed golf balls as souvenirs. For Mr. Ramos, an enthusiastic golfer, the sport is a symbol of the good life he wants to achieve for Filipinos. But in 1996, golf has come to symbolize more than good living in the Philippines. Environmentalists have elected the golf course as the latest battlefield in their struggle to save what remains of the country's sites of pristine natural beauty. **********The fighting centers on Boracay, a small jewel in the Philippine archipelago of 7,107 islands. Boracay's stretch of fine, white sand \u2014 \"like sugar,\" Filipinos say \u2014 was once reputed to be the world's most perfect beach. No more. The turquoise waters around the butterfly-shaped islet are cloudy, and green algae lap at the shore. Islanders say this is due to seepage of used water and solid waste from the 30,000 tourists a day who visit during peak season. **********Boracay, which has no sewage system, is also suffering from a water shortage. When a real-estate giant announced this spring that it was building an 18-hole golf course and 600-room condominium hotel on the island, the news sparked an outcry. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources warned that the golf course would further deplete water resources, endangering the island's fragile ecology. The national press, sensitized by a string of environmental calamities, seized on the affair as yet another example of misuse of a stunningly beautiful land. **********The Philippines, blessed with one of the richest ecosystems on earth, today faces daunting ecological challenges. As disaster succeeds disaster, the headlines grow more frightening: \"Nine Firms Closed for Toxic Waste,\" \"Six More Rivers Dying,\" \"Breathing Is Dangerous to Health.\" This spring, a mining disaster on the island of Marinduque killed the Boac River. The country's summer capital, Baguio, is so short of water that tourists were warned not to go there during the Easter season. Pedestrians in Manila cover their faces against the dense black fumes belched out by jeepneys and buses, and a nationwide drop in children's IQs is blamed on lead in the air. **********As problems rain down like ash from Mount Pinatubo, the press, spurred by a strong Green movement, is raising public awareness \u2014 and not just among urban intellectuals. **********Members of the Bugkalot ethnic minority in northern Luzon threatened recently to resume head-hunting to oppose a dam project they denounced as environmentally unsound. Other indigenous peoples have warned that they would wage tribal war against ecologically risky mining ventures. **********The government, too, is seeking to reverse decades of ecological abuse. President Ramos has drafted a policy of \"sustainable development\" that would protect the country's forests and give greater powers to local communities to manage their environments. **********\"The natural resources given us by the good Lord must be protected, enhanced and utilized for the enjoyment of future generations of Filipinos,\" Mr. Ramos says. \"We see this as stewardship, not ownership or exploitation.\" **********This attitude translates into environmental friendly strategies that should make a difference. But glitches occur in a country just 10 years beyond the rapacious Marcos era, and with a history of colonial plunder. Regulations are circumvented or simply ignored. **********- **********IN THE CASE of Boracay, Fil-Estate Land Inc. began building the golf course without obtaining the necessary environmental clearance. The government reacted, but the remedy was like using a slingshot against an elephant. Fil-Estate \u2014 which reported 1995 net income of 784 million pesos (about $30 million), up more than 1,000 percent from the previous year \u2014 was fined $2,000 **********Later, Environment Secretary Victor O. Ramos ordered Fil-Estate to construct a central sewage system and to have its water delivered from a larger neighboring island. But the project is going ahead, and other Boracay developers are also planning big condominiums. **********Not just in Boracay, but across this land, economic progress is fighting with ecology as the Philippines struggles to raise living standards for its population and catch up with booming Asian neighbors. Some areas are faring better on the environmental front than others. **********\"The biggest problem I have is balancing environmental protection and development,\" admits Edward S. Hagedorn, the Green mayor of Puerto Princesa, the capital of Palawan, and a partner in a what environmentalists see as one of their success stories in the Philippines. **********Mayor Hagedorn and Palawan's governor, Salvador P. Socrates, have headed a drive to protect their island, known as the Philippines' ecological \"last frontier,\" by keeping polluting industries out, developing Green tourism \u2014 and replanting the forests. **********In the 1980s, unchecked logging was stripping Palawan of its virgin hardwood forest at a rapid rate. In 1986, forest cover was about 60 percent; by 1992, it was down to 50 percent. **********The rate has declined a bit, Governor Socrates says, citing a total ban on commercial logging and a tree-planting campaign. In addition, local officials are seeking alternative means of livelihood for islanders who endanger the forest through slash-and-burn farming -\u2014 a recent initiative, for example, in which a seaweed buyer from another province would supply materials and arrange bank loans for Palawan farmers who agree to grow seaweed. **********\"The reforms are fragile, and it is too early to tell if the new trends will be sustained,\" says Yasmin D. Arquiza, a Palawan environmentalist. \"But new laws that give local officials more power to manage resources help spell a promising future.\" **********Environmental progress is distinctly slower in other parts of the country, where mountains shorn of lush tropical forests bare crew-cut peaks to the sky. Forest cover across the Philippines is down to 18 percent and reforestation is sporadic at best, according to the country's top environmental reporter, Howie Severino of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. **********\"In comparison, a country like Japan, that is also an archipelago and consumes a lot of wood, has 72 percent,\" Mr. Severino says. **********The Loss of forest cover has caused soil erosion, which in turn leads to flooding and pollutes rivers and the sea. And the disappearing forests are endangering the country's exceptionally rich wildlife. **********Conservation International, an environmental organization in Washington, ranks the Philippines first in the world in terms of biodiversity \u2014 and also the most threatened. **********\"Some biologists say we are on the verge of biodiversity collapse,\" Mr. Severino says. **********Many of the country's tens of thousands of species of flora and fauna are endemic; just how many is not known, he said, because their habitat is disappearing too fast for them to be catalogued. **********- **********THE PROBLEM is aggravated by the Philippines' galloping population growth. With a population of 68 million growing by about 2.2 percent a year \u2014 and the Roman Catholic Church's adamant stand against the government's timid efforts at family planning \u2014 environmental pressures are bound to intensify. **********In Manila, a traffic-choked metropolis of 10 million people, the worst way the problem manifests itself is in the air. **********Levels of air pollution in the capital are two to three times higher than internationally accepted standards, according to a 1992 study by the Asian Development Bank. And the problem is worsening. There are now a million motor vehicles on the city's jammed streets. That number is expected to double by 2002. **********\"What is really poisoning the air of Metro Manila is misguided government policies,\" says Ricardo B. Ramos, an environmentalist and expert on air pollution. **********\"The Philippines has not upgraded its pollution controls on emissions of motor vehicles since 1981,\" he said, adding that although low-lead fuel was introduced in 1993, lead concentration in Manila is still about double that of Bangkok. Diesel-fueled jeepneys and buses that spew sulfur and noxious particles into the air are increasing in numbers. **********This is affecting health in a dramatic way, according to a draft environmental health assessment prepared by the Department of Health. Early deaths from bronchitis and heart disease due to dust are responsible for the loss of 10 million years of healthy life each year in the Philippines, the report says. It blames lead exposure for an average drop of five IQ points among the country's children. **********Less deadly but still unpleasant are the fetid fumes rising off the dead Pasig River, which snakes through Manila and runs alongside the presidential Malacanang Palace. **********Perhaps with this in mind, the president's dynamic wife, Amelita M. Ramos, is leading a drive to clean up the Pasig. Ten Italian-built anti-pollution vessels are due to begin dredging the river this autumn and to convert its garbage into fertilizer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/08/business/stake-in-mcdonald-s-may-be-buffett-boon.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stake in McDonald's May Be Buffett Boon", "print_headline": "Stake in McDonald's May Be Buffett Boon", "body_text": " **********The multibillionaire investor Warren E.

As usual, Italy's fashion industry has found a way to make money out of the change. **********For most of the last 20 years, consumers of fashion and fashion accessories have taken the signature of a famous designer as the ultimate guarantee. Names like Armani, Dior, Saint Laurent and Gucci convinced anxious customers they were making wise buying decisions. **********\"Today, the power of the 'griffe' is weakening in all of our markets,\" said Maurizio Castelli of SITA, a Rome-based textile industries consultancy belonging to the Nielsen market research group. **********In much of the west, the designer label of the roaring 80s is rapidly giving way to a \"private label\" belonging to the retailer selling the fashion product, and buyers for the big retail chains are coming in at the ground floor, specifying every detail of what they want even before the yarn reaches the looms. **********\"They come to us with color samples, designs and models and then we find a way to manufacture the product they want, in the volumes they want and for the delivery date they require,\" said Cosetta Innocenti at Quadro, a knitwear firm in Tuscany that works heavily in the private label sector, especially for North America. **********In 1995, Quadro manufactured more that 600,000 pieces of knitwear for stores in the United States. Of these, about a third were twin sets for The Limited chain. Part of the rest were classic merino wool sweaters for the May Co. **********Innocenti, who is responsible for private-label production at Quadro, said private-label work for North America has \"exploded\" over the last three years, but that it does pose some special problems. \"These customers want very short delivery times,\" she said, \"but we're equipped to handle that. Last year The Limited stores ordered 120,000 twin sets in September and had them in November.\" **********Aside from the traditional reputation for quality, factors like this sort of rapid turnaround are making Italian production attractive to retailers in spite of the country's relatively high costs. **********\"Asian knitwear is cheaper,\" said a buyer for an Italian department store chain, \"but you have to order a season ahead, so it's essential to guess exactly right about future tastes in colors and styles. And then, if the product sells well, there's no time to reorder.\" **********\"We had to become very, very good to survive during the long years when the lira was substantially overvalued,\" said Alfredo Ciampini, director of Federtessile, the Federation of Italian Textile Industries. \"That made our products too costly to compete on price, so we had to learn about service as well.\" **********Ciampini said the process of learning to be \"toughened\" the Italian textiles industry. \"The recent devaluation of the lira has freed us,\" he said. **********Bianca Jogna, an executive of the Vestebene division of the Miroglio Textiles Group, agrees. \"We're able to meet the demand coming from retail chains for ever more personalized products,\" she said. \"About 15 percent of our overall revenues are now coming from private-label production, and this area is expanding strongly.\" **********Though Jogna declined to name specific customers, industry sources said Vestebene works closely with France's Galeries Lafayette and Harrod's in England as well as several Scandinavian retail chains. **********\"There's no doubt we're seeing a swing from the stylists' trademark to that of house brands,\" said Enza Omodeo, of the studies unit of Moda Industria, a clothing-industry trade association. \"There is an attempt by retailers to recover margins, and power is shifting in the direction of big chains who purchase in large volumes.\" **********By themselves, house brands or private labels are nothing new in fashion retailing. What is new is that products identified with the retailer rather than the designer are now being positioned at the high end of the market. Most retailers in the past used house brands to fill the middle of their line, the so-called \"bridge\" market. **********Because of the high degree of specialization involved, the process is most advanced in the accessories field. High-end men's silk ties are a typical example. **********According to Luciano Donatelli, managing director of Orsini, the tie-making subsidiary of Italy's Zegna textiles group, \"One way or the other, luxury ties are an Italian business. Even when we don't make them directly, we supply the fabric. In this sense, Italy has 80 percent of the world market.\" **********Men's suits are another area in which the private label is strong. Italy's two biggest textiles groups, GFT and Marzotto, are both very active in private-label men's clothing \u2014 and both equally uneasy about actually naming specific clients. \"The truth is, they work for anyone you've ever heard of,\" an industry source said, \"It would probably be easier to make a list of chains that are not their clients.\" **********This reticence is typical of the private-label field. Manufacturers who have made major investments in their own trademarks and licenses are slow to admit that their products are also available under different names. **********Retailers, too, incline to silence on the subject. They want clients to focus their attention on the store and on its label, and are not anxious to direct customer attention to the original manufacturer. **********All in all, the shift to private labels should be good news for fashion consumers. If retailers want to assume direct responsibility for consumer brand loyalty, they are also going to have to take more responsibility for quality and, ultimately, value. **********- **********JAMES HANSEN is a journalist based in Italy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/30/business/funeral-chain-settles-avoiding-a-big-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Nina Bernstein", "pub_date": "1996-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Funeral Chain Settles, Avoiding a Big Bill", "print_headline": "Funeral Chain Settles, Avoiding a Big Bill", "body_text": " **********The Loewen Group said yesterday that it had agreed to settle a Mississippi lawsuit that it said would have pushed the company toward bankruptcy. The suit was settled for cash and stock valued at $175 million. **********Shares of Loewen, a Canadian funeral home chain, surged after the settlement  was announced. In Nasdaq trading, the stock rose $8.50, or 41 percent yesterday, to $29. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Loewen shares rose $12.25 (Canadian), to $40 (Canadian.) **********The agreement, reached in an Atlanta hotel room early Sunday morning, was substantially less than the $500 million in damages that Loewen was assessed by  a jury in Jackson, Miss., in November. Loewen executives said the settlement would cost the company $85 million (United States) after taxes. **********\"After analyzing the financial and other impacts of the various alternatives  we determined that at this time a settlement is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,\" Raymond Loewen, Loewen's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. **********The settlement includes a $50 million cash payment to be made to the plaintiffs, annual payments of $4 million a year for 20 years and 1.5 million shares of Loewen common stock to be issued by Feb. 15. If the stock price is below $30 a year later, Loewen is to make up the difference. **********While investors hailed the settlement, Steven Saltzman, a leading analyst of  the funeral-home industry with the Chicago Corporation, cautioned that Loewen was not out of the woods yet, noting that a breach-of-contract lawsuit similar to the Mississippi case was pending against Loewen in Philadelphia. **********\"Loewen may have won a battle, but the war is not over,\" Mr. Saltzman said. \"From the beginning I believe that Ray Loewen meaningfully underestimated the company's potential risk in Mississippi.\" **********The Philadelphia case is still in the deposition stage, according to a spokesman for the plaintiff, the Provident American Corporation. The case is not expected to reach trial until the spring. A Federal district court denied Loewen's request for a summary dismissal last March, according to court records. **********Provident American, an insurance company, is seeking $59.6 million in damages -- more than twice the $25 million originally sought by the plaintiff in the Mississippi case, Jeremiah O'Keefe 3d, a fifth-generation Mississippi funeral home owner. Mr. O'Keefe had contended that Loewen, which is based in Burnaby, British Columbia, maliciously breached a contract with him in an effort to put him out of business and keep him out of the regional funeral home markets the chain sought to dominate. **********Analysts are watching to see whether, in light of yesterday's settlement, Loewen's lenders will continue to provide the financing necessary to maintain the aggressive growth by acquisition that had made Wall Street so bullish on its stock until the courtroom debacle. **********\"It should not affect our ability to continue to grow,\" said Lawrence Miller, head of Loewen's cemetary division, based in Philadelphia who led the 20-hour marathon settlement negotiations in the Mississippi case. \"We certainly think it's outrageously high, but it's a settlement that had to be made.\" **********American shares of Loewen, which traded 's high as $41.75 in September, had been sliding since the November jury award, trading as low as $18.625 on Thursday. **********Last week, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that to stay the jury award during appeal, Loewen would have to post a bond worth 125 percent of the award,  or $625 million, by Jan. 31.

(Buzz) Hargrove, the union's president, said in an interview today that when negotiations with the company opened on Tuesday, he planned to demand  limits on G.M.'s ability to buy more parts from independent suppliers. G.M.'s top executives have vowed not to accept limits on these purchases, known as outsourcing, and as recently as last March endured a crippling 17-day strike at  two brake factories in the United States rather than accept such restrictions. **********The Canadian Automobile Workers split from the Detroit-based United Automobile Workers a decade ago. The two unions negotiate separate labor contracts, typically for three years. Both unions' contracts with G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation expire on Sept. 14. **********Mr. Hargrove said that he had not yet chosen his first target for negotiations, and would choose a different target from the U.A.W. If the U.A.W.  chooses G.M., the Canadian union will choose another auto maker and confront G.M. later in the fall, if necessary going on strike against G.M. while still striking another auto maker, he said. **********Mr. Hargrove said today that a lengthy strike against G.M. was so likely that he planned to seek a special assessment on all of the union's 195,000 working members in a dozen industries, so as to build up the union's strike fund. **********The fund currently has close to $50 million (Canadian), or about $36 million  (United States), enough to pay strike benefits for eight weeks to the 29,000 G.M. workers represented by the Canadian union. Mr. Hargrove said that he was also considering a doubling of the strike fund by mortgaging some of the buildings, which he said are currently debt-free. **********D. Stewart Low, a G.M. spokesman, played down the risk of a strike. \"We're not that pessimistic,\" he said. \"I think if both parties come to the table with  creative solutions, common ground can be found.\" **********Mr. Hargrove initially had said a strike could not be avoided but later toned down his words, saying that \"it's going to be tough to avoid a strike,\" which he characterized as \"very likely.\" **********Canadian labor leaders have been more outspokenly militant than their United  States counterparts in the past, only to reach last-minute deals. But Mr. Hargrove pointed out that when he last negotiated national auto industry labor contracts in 1993, he predicted that a strike was unlikely and there was not one. **********The union is demanding that any part now made by the union's workers may never be manufactured elsewhere, although it may be redesigned, he said. \"This is a significant challenge to management rights which we have never attempted before,\" Mr. Hargrove said. \"What we're going to try to establish is the principle of work ownership.\" **********He said that the union had relatively few differences with Ford and Chrysler. **********G.M. announced in April that it would sell two auto parts factories in Canada that the company described as uncompetitive. Mr. Hargrove said 3,600 jobs at these factories were at risk, along with 750 jobs at a parts factory that G.M. has already sold to one of its suppliers and that may be closed soon. With other jobs at various factories being turned over to outside contractors, a total of 5,500 jobs are in danger, Mr. Hargrove contended. **********The strike in March by 3,000 workers in Dayton, Ohio, forced G.M. to close all but two of its North American assembly operations and temporarily lay off 176,000 workers across the continent, including many of the company's Canadian workers. **********But while G.M. depended on Dayton for almost all of its brakes, it depends less on parts factories in Canada, said Craig J. Cather, the president of the CSM Corporation, an automobile parts consultant. **********As a result, a Canadian strike would take awhile to affect assembly factories in the United States, and some factories might not be affected at all. \"Most of  the component production coming out of Canada goes into vehicle production in Canada,\" Mr. Cather said. **********But a Canadian strike could have an effect on Americans shopping for new cars and trucks. G.M. dealerships in the United States rely on Canadian factories for a sixth of their cars and trucks. **********Three Canadian assembly plants make all of the popular Chevrolet Lumina sedans and the less popular Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird and Buick Regal models. When the new Buick Century goes into production late this autumn, G.M. Canada will make it too, Mr. Low said. **********Another Canadian factory is one of three in North America producingpopular full-size pickups, which are selling well this summer and are in very short supply."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/05/world/bombing-is-israel-the-crackdown-israeli-troops-raid-camp-where-2-bombers-lived.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1996-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 741, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOMBING IS ISRAEL: THE CRACKDOWN;Israeli Troops Raid Camp Where 2 Bombers Lived", "print_headline": "BOMBING IS ISRAEL: THE CRACKDOWN;Israeli Troops Raid Camp Where 2 Bombers Lived", "body_text": " **********Struggling against a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings, the Israeli Government mounted its declared war on terrorism today, sending troops on a punitive raid on this refugee camp, home to two attackers who struck last week. **********Employing the tactics of collective punishment that are likely to be used more often in coming weeks, scores of soldiers descended on this camp near Hebron overnight, confining its 7,000 residents to their homes, arresting suspects and preparing to seal up and possibly demolish the family houses of the bombers. **********But hours after the sweep here, another suicide attack in Tel Aviv underscored anew the difficulty of stopping militants who are prepared to die for their cause. **********Although the Tel Aviv attack brought announcements of more stringent measures aimed at confining Palestinians to their West Bank towns and villages, Israelis  acknowledged that it would be difficult to prevent the infiltration of human bombs. **********Complicating the problem is a difficulty in identifying the source of the attacks. Contradictory leaflets issued by armed factions of the militant Islamic group Hamas in recent days indicate the emergence of at least one renegade splinter group, possibly guided by radical Hamas leaders in Syria. **********The idea behind the crackdown here in Al Fawwar was clear: to make potential  attackers think twice before setting out on their missions by demonstrating that their friends and families will pay a heavy price. **********Soldiers streamed into the warren of cinder-block and stucco dwellings on a hillside about two miles south of Hebron and first rounded up groups of the men. **********Blindfolded and assembled in a lot, the men were questioned and several were  arrested. The others were sent home, and a round-the-clock curfew was declared. **********Then the soldiers surrounded the homes of the two bombers and prepared to brick up the doors and windows. Officers said the homes might be demolished, although the families have the right to contest that plan in court. **********Neighbors watched from windows and rooftops as soldiers took up their places  around the home of one attacker, Ibrahim Sarahne. The house had been vacated --  appliances were strewn outside, and the family was taking shelter in a crude cinder-block structure next door. **********[At Nablus in the northern West Bank, Israeli forces on Tuesday sealed the family home of Yahya Ayyash, the Hamas bomb-maker who was killed in Gaza in January, Reuters reported.] **********Palestinians, many of whom depend on jobs in Israel, have been forbidden since last week's bombing to leave the West Bank, an isolation that promises to  continue for months. **********After today's attack, Israel added a new condition, saying Palestinians would now be prohibited from working in nearby Israeli settlements, or traveling between towns and villages in the West Bank. **********he tactics used in the camp are not new, and their deterrent effect remains unclear, especially on someone ready to commit suicide. **********The chief of Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, reportedly told  a parliamentary committee today that there were hundreds of young Palestinian volunteers for more suicide missions. **********Other security methods used by the Government have also had a questionable effect. **********A closing of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that prevents Palestinians from entering Israel has proved penetrable, with suicide bombers infiltrating Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in two attacks this week. **********Such a closing is particularly difficult to enforce in Jerusalem, where there is no barrier between the Jewish and Arab sections. The Israeli police chief, Assaf Hefetz, conceded today in a radio interview that the bombers who had attacked buses in Jerusalem on the last two Sundays might have left from hiding  places in the Arab part of the city. **********To confront the danger and comfort commuters, soldiers were posted today at bus stations throughout Jerusalem, and security guards inspected the vehicles. But many buses were emptier than usual. **********Sitting at one downtown stop guarded by three soldiers, Lilian Sananess said  the added protection had done little to bolster her confidence. \"If someone wants to come and blow himself up, these soldiers won't stop him,\" she said. \"I  really don't know what should be done. The fear is always there.\" **********The head of the opposition Likud party, Benjamin Netanyahu, urged the Government tonight to take the offensive against Hamas \"without any limits,\" denying it sanctuary anywhere.

Instead, it found itself saddled with a company with plunging profit and stalled sales. **********In the first nine months of 1995, for example, NCR had revenue of $5.89 billion and operating losses of $501 million, compared with revenue of $4.3 billion and earnings of $63 million in the first nine months of 1991, the takeover year. **********This past September, AT&T announced that it would spin off the company, which it had renamed AT&T Global Information Solutions, as part of a broader plan to split itself into three separately owned companies. AT&T took a $1.6 billion charge against earnings to cover the cost of abandoning NCR's personal computer  business and reducing the payroll by 8,500. **********In returning to the name NCR -- initials that for decades stood for National  Cash Register -- the Dayton, Ohio, company is signaling an intention to return to its roots as a maker of computer systems for retailers, banks and large companies. **********It remains the world's largest manufacturer of automated teller machines for  banks, and it is one of the largest manufacturers of modern cash registers for retailers and the huge computer networks that link those registers. **********Executives, faced with the need to change the company's name because of the impending spinoff from AT&T, said that the old NCR name still had far more recognition than the alternatives. \"The NCR brand has a lot of equity out there  in the world,\" said Lars Nyberg, NCR's chairman and chief executive, who was recruited seven months ago from Philips Electronics N.V. **********Born in Sweden, Mr. Nyberg spent most of his career with Philips in the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain. He is now pruning NCR's range of products as part of the turnaround effort. **********\"We are not going back to the old NCR,\" Mr. Nyberg emphasized today, saying the company would focus on \"lesser ambitions\" and \"ambitions where we play to our strength.\" **********At least a few analysts think that both AT&T and NCR would have been much better off if the acquisition had never occurred. In the late 1980's, NCR embarked on a strategic shift, moving away from systems built around mainframe computers and toward networks built entirely around networks of computers run by off-the-shelf Intel microprocessors and using open technical standards based on  the Unix programming language. **********By the time AT&T bought the company, NCR had a family of machines from laptops to supercomputers that ran on microprocessors and were intended to capitalize on the trend toward client-server computing networks. **********NCR soon began to stall, undermined by sluggishness in overseas markets and an inability to generate innovative products. Its push to make and sell personal computers came at the wrong time, putting the company in a brutally competitive  market dominated by cutthroat pricing and high-volume direct distribution. Beyond that, NCR conceded, its cost structure was too high."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/business/developments-rental-apartments-are-being-planned-old-factory-site-hoboken.html": {"writer_name": "Rachelle Garbarine", "pub_date": "1996-09-20", "snippet": "Huddle of manufacturing buildings is being torn down to make way for what its to become first new rental complex in a decade in Hoboken, NJ; $40 million complex, to be built over next 15 months, will have 240 apartments of one to three bedrooms; c...", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Developments of rental apartments are being planned at an old factory site in Hoboken.", "print_headline": "Developments of rental apartments are being planned at an old factory site in Hoboken.", "body_text": " **********A HUDDLE of manufacturing buildings is being torn down to make way for what is to become the first new rental complex in a decade in the northwestern sector of this Hudson County city. **********The $40 million development, to be built over the next 15 months, will have 240 apartments of one to three bedrooms. They will be in four red brick buildings of five stories on one and half blocks along Grand Street between 11th and 12th Streets. The rental complex will replace the Ferguson Propeller Works, which manufactured propellers for ships. **********Called the Curling Club, the complex will be built by the Bellemead Development Corporation of Roseland, N.J., a subsidiary of the Chubb  Corporation, the insurer that is among the state's larger office developers. Bellemead has contracted to buy the site, which is undergoing an environmental cleanup, for less than $4 million. It will close the deal once state approval for the cleanup is obtained, which is expected by the end of this month, said Edward Oliu, a company vice president. **********The site is in a 26-block area of Hoboken that like its prized Hudson River waterfront once was a thriving industrial hub. But since the 1960's companies shut down or moved away, leaving the area to languish. Ferguson, which survived even after the city's piers closed and shipping companies left in the 1980's, ceased operations last year. **********The site also borders a residential neighborhood that began to see new life during the mid-80's building boom, when some 200 rental and condominium apartments were created, all of them in what had formerly been manufacturing buildings. **********The new site is being redeveloped now, Mr. Oliu said, because ''by all indications the rental market in Hoboken is strong today and will be a year from now.'' With this project, he added, ''we can push the edge of the residential neighborhood so people wouldn't object going into this area.'' **********That concept squares with the vision of city officials, who are considering changing the area's zoning from industrial to mostly residential, as well as retail and light industrial uses, said Robert K. Drasheff, director of Hoboken's Department of Human Resources, which oversees community and waterfront development. ''We can't bring back industry, but by extending the residential neighborhood we can bring those properties back onto the tax rolls,''  Mr. Drasheff said. He said the City Council was to vote on the rezoning before the end of the year. **********Bellemead's project can move ahead now because it was granted a zoning variance. It is part of the continued renaissance of Hoboken, across the river from Manhattan,  from an old port to a contemporary urban address. Indeed, the redevelopment of the city-owned piers at the southern end of the waterfront from First to Fifth Street may finally begin after long planning and debate. Mr. Drasheff said a developer would be named ''any day'' for the site's southernmost corner, which is closest to the city's mass transit. **********That area is to have 1.1 million square feet of offices and 45,000 square feet of ground level retail space. He said the city would also break ground in November for a 5.1-acre park on a pier. And it will ask proposals for redevelopment of the rest of the site for 400 to 500 residences and a hotel. **********On the waterfront's northern end, the Applied Companies of Hoboken has proposed a mixed-use development of residences and retail space on 45 derelict acres. But it has been stalled by local opponents. Bellemead, which bought the mortgage on an 800,000-square-foot factory and surrounding lots, has also begun discussions with the city for a residential and retail complex. **********Citywide, the rental market ''is very tight,'' said Maureen Singleton, of the Singleton Galmann Real Estate Agency. She put the vacancy rate at under 5 percent. **********Monthly rents at the Curling Club have not yet been set, but they are expected to range from $1,400 to $2,200, with the two-bedroom apartments costing $1,800. Ms. Singleton said that on average two-bedroom apartments rent for $1,400, depending on size and location, with those closest to the PATH station costing more. **********To draw tenants to what Mr. Oliu said was ''a fringe location,'' the project will offer some extras. The apartments will have 900 to 1,400 square feet of space, and most of them will have two bedrooms and two baths, so two people can share the rent, Mr. Oliu said. They will also have balconies with electric grills, as well as washers and dryers. The sole industrial building to be saved, a brick structure at Grand and 12th Streets, will be reborn as a 4,500-square-foot health club. Tenants will not pay extra for the health club but will pay for parking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/20/world/cuba-and-us-trade-expulsions-of-diplomats.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-20", "snippet": "Cuba expels American diplomat Robin Meyer for activities incompatible with diplomatic status; US will expel member of Cuban mission in retaliation (S)", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cuba and U.S. Trade Expulsions of Diplomats", "print_headline": "Cuba and U.S. Trade Expulsions of Diplomats", "body_text": " **********Cuba is expelling a United States diplomat, charging her with activities ''incompatible with her diplomatic status,'' the State Department said this evening.

They want to Rolls or Bentley or, if they are inclined to be sportier, Ferrari alone. They find that owning such cars provides them with singular joys and comforts, even if they must also endure a few singular tribulations. **********A joy for one Bentley owner, a broker in London's financial district, is being \"cosseted in leather and walnut veneer,\" which helps put distance between him and the rabble he must share the road with. **********\"When you're in such opulent surroundings, stress levels are low, so while all around you are losing their heads, you'll keep yours,\" he said. **********He bought his 1995 Turbo, when it was a year old, \"with my heart, not with my head,\" for \u00a3110,000, or $170,000.The features include chrome knobs for the ventilation ducts, lamb's wool floor mats and a compartment under the center arm rest holding a couple of liquor flasks and a set of crystal. These can be set on the walnut picnic tables that fold down from behind the front seats. **********\"It's always been a car I wanted; it has fantastic presence,\" he said of his Bentley, the third he has owned in three years, each more expensive than the last. While such cars are thought of as stodgy, he noted that it handles well, and with its massive 6.7-liter, 400-horsepower V-8 engine, he has bombed down the highway at 130 miles an hour (about 210 kilometers per hour). **********Bentley owners are more likely to do that than Rolls-Royce owners. **********\"Bentley is a car for drivers, a Rolls tends to be a car for people who are driven,\" said a spokeswoman for Vickers PLC, the company that has made both since 1980. Vickers bought the automotive division of Rolls-Royce Ltd. from the government, which had nationalized it after it went under in 1971. **********The first Rolls-Royce was produced in 1904. Royce designed the cars; Rolls handled the marketing side of things and ended up with top billing. In the 1930s Rolls-Royce bought Bentley, which was founded by a builder of racing cars. **********Rolls-Royce Motor Cars made 1,556 cars last year in a ratio of 60 Bentleys for 40 Rolls-Royces, said Janette Green, a spokeswoman for the division. The price range is \u00a3106,000 for a Brooklands to \u00a3222,500 for a Bentley Azure. Rolls-Royce's various models fall in the middle, fetching between \u00a3118,000 and \u00a3135,000. **********Each car has a number of handmade parts, and prices can vary greatly depending on the options. **********\"Every customer has the ability to personalize the motorcar to his own specifications,\" Mrs. Green said. \"The world is their oyster in terms of what they want \u2014 satellite navigation systems, entertainment packages, video recorders, fax machines \u2014 absolutely anything you want. I don't think there's really a lot we couldn't do.\" **********Exceptto make the cars cheaper. **********\"There isn't the room to maneuver, but people are not buying these because of the price,\" said Andrew Shaw, general manager of TWR Northampton, a dealer in several brands of upper-end cars, including Rolls-Royce and Bentley. \"They're looking for a car that suits their requirements.\" **********The bespoke way the cars are made allows a buyer \"to have a car that he knows no one has to those specifications anywhere in the world,\" Mr. Shaw said. **********When it comes time to sell, such cars will do their owners no favors, either. Resale values can be quite low. **********\"No one should think of buying a Bentley or Rolls-Royce as an investment or store of value, because depreciation is quite high until 40,000 to 50,000 miles,\" the London broker said. The curve then becomes much less steep because there are fewer older models in circulation and demand is steady enough to keep prices up. **********In between buying and selling, there is little letup in expense. The broker estimated his annual costs at \u00a31,200 to \u00a31,600 for maintenance and \u00a32,000 for insurance. Then there is \u00a310 every week or so for a wash. As for fuel, that costs a lot, too, as the car only gets about eight miles to the gallon in town, about twice that on highways (or about 30 liters per 100 kilometers in town, 15 liters on the highway). **********The broker also spends \u00a31,800 a year for parking, although a good solution for evenings out, he said, is to park in front of a hotel reeking of class and hand the doorman \"the keys and a fiver\" and it's safe for the duration. **********The sort of people who buy luxury cars do not have to choose between changing the oil and buying coal for the furnace, of course. A survey of Bentley and Rolls-Royce owners visiting the factory in Cheshire found that the average owner has close to half a dozen other cars, Mrs. Green noted; 70 percent have a high-end Mercedes or BMW, and 27 percent own a Ferrari or a Porsche. More than half have an art collection, one-third own a yacht, and the same percentage own a second home abroad. **********They are sort of people, in other words, whom others might envy. The broker said his car had never been vandalized, but he realizes that for this to remain true he must not park on the street. Of fellow drivers he encounters, the angriest seem to be those who are older, \"who have reached that age where they feel they should be driving this car,\" and London taxi drivers of any age. **********One day, he said, he allowed several cars to pass him on a narrow street, then came grill-to-grill with a taxi. Neither driver would back down and back up. **********Unprintable words were exchanged, then the broker told his nemesis that the experience of sitting in his car and listening to music was so pleasurable that he was content to wait.

The unlucky ones simply forfeit their vacations. **********But an obscure ruling last month by the Internal Revenue Service has drawn attention to an intriguing option for unused vacation time: adding its value to tax-deferred profit-sharing plans. The I.R.S. ruling seems to allow such a transfer, even when an employee has already reached the $9,500 annual limit for tax-deferred contributions into 401(k) retirement plans. **********''I think there's a whole series of possible ramifications,'' said Harry Conaway, the head of the legal group at the national office, in Washington, of the benefits consultant William M. Mercer Inc. The I.R.S., he said, ''may be startled about how broadly this is applied.'' **********But employees should not count on their companies offering this benefit any time soon. Companies at which vacation is forfeited will most likely ignore the possibility. And there are enough caveats that tax experts say companies that otherwise might be interested will tend to steer clear of the benefit and its complications. **********Companies that try to institute such plans will have to proceed carefully so they do not run afoul of the law. **********The ruling, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, was a piece of technical advice to an I.R.S. auditor who asked headquarters for help. It said essentially that an employer did not have to pay Social Security tax on money it paid into a worker's 401(k) plan in lieu of vacation because the employee in this case had no choice other than to lose the days. **********The I.R.S. response to the Social Security question, specialists said, was neither novel nor crucial. But the ruling inspired much  creative thinking among tax and benefits experts about what could be done with unused vacation days. **********Although the I.R.S. said the ruling, which involved only one company, should not be read as a precedent, some tax experts, including Mr. Conaway, said they saw considerable potential for reconfiguring benefit packages to capture the value of vacation time. But others saw mostly obstacles. **********Mary B. Hevener, a benefits expert in the Washington office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a law firm, seems pretty much in the middle. ''It's a nifty idea that offers a lot of advantages,'' she said. ''But the bottom line is, I don't know whether it's going to go anywhere.'' **********There is broad agreement, however, that the prospects for extending this idea to another area, unused sick days, are dim. Most employers are adamant about not paying for such time. **********Indeed, extra cost is one of the main obstacles to employers' agreeing to contribute the value of unused vacation to 401(k)'s. For companies with a use-it-or-lose-it vacation policy, ''they would have to pay, say, 54 weeks of salary for 52 weeks' work,'' said Elizabeth Buchbinder, a former Treasury official who is a compensation and benefits partner in Washington for the accounting firm Ernst & Young. **********Another major, perhaps crippling, obstacle may be provisions of the tax law that are intended to prevent executives from setting up benefits plans that are more favorable to them than to the rank and file. **********''You have a virtually insurmountable nondiscrimination problem,'' Ms. Buchbinder said. For example, workers typically have sharply differing amounts of leftover vacation, making it difficult to treat them equally. And lower-paid employees are more likely than executives to prefer the cash, if the option is available, to a 401(k) contribution. **********Companies can comply with the nondiscrimination rules through a process known as ''cross-testing,'' which analyzes current contributions in terms of the benefits they will produce for the employee at age 65. The main problem in this complicated process is that companies cannot budget for an unpredictable amount of unused vacation time, and the nondiscrimination hurdle is especially high if young, highly paid employees with much leftover vacation are lumped together with older, lower-paid workers. **********Most likely, Ms. Buchbinder said, putting vacation days into retirement plans will be limited to a relatively small number of companies with union contracts where all workers have about the same pay, and to companies that agree to bear the cost of contributions while excluding their highly paid employees. **********(The definition of highly paid, incidentally, becomes simpler on Jan. 1 because of a change in the law. Essentially, this category will consist of people earning more than $80,000 a year or those owning more than 5 percent of their companies.) **********Ms. Hevener contends that these problems can often be overcome if management has an incentive to do so. Unfortunately, she said, ''it's always the executives who think it's a great idea, but who then decide, 'Oh, if I can't do it, then the company can't do it.' '' **********Still, companies in states like California that forbid the forfeiture of vacation time may have some extra incentive to set up the 401(k) program. And some companies may figure that the costs of the program and the difficulties in overcoming the hurdles pale beside the loss of productivity when, say, a large number of employees at a use-it-or-lose-it company suddenly need to take off the second half of December."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/07/business/mutual-funds-quarterly-report-a-comeback-year-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Middleton", "pub_date": "1996-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;A Comeback Year in Japan?", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;A Comeback Year in Japan?", "body_text": " **********LONG-SUFFERING investors in Japanese markets finally got a break just as 1995 was ending: the depressed Nikkei 225 index broke above its 1994 close a few days before Christmas.

This was seen as a crucial admission by  the Government that it, and not just the private sector, must act to end deflation in the securities and property markets. **********This and other recent signs -- including a recent increase in department-store sales, the first in nearly four years, and October's rise in an index of leading economic indicators, the first in six months -- have convinced  some investment advisers that Japan's six-year bear market in stocks is finally  ending. **********\"The Japanese economy has hit bottom,\" said E. Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. \"The nation has a lot of excess money not needed for real business activity, which creates the capacity for a financial stimulus for stock and bond markets.\" **********Although the rally has pushed the Nikkei up 8 percent, to 20,669.03, it is still down about 50 percent from its peak in 1989, and plenty of investment advisers remain skittish. Still, some big investment houses are beginning to see opportunities in Japan. **********Barton M. Biggs, global strategist for the Morgan Stanley Group, is forecasting 18 percent returns, in yen, for Japanese equities in 1996. Richard Farrell, director of the Far East equity team at the London investment firm of Guinness Flight, said 45 percent of the assets of its $35 million Japan and Pacific Fund were invested in Japan, up from less than 30 percent 18 months ago. And Merrill Lynch & Company advised its clients twice last year to slightly increase their Japanese holdings, then did it again on Friday. **********\"It seems the Japanese monetary authorities and the Government are starting to come to grips with the fact that they really have to solve their financial crisis,\" said Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. **********The average mutual fund investing only in Japan rose 1 percent in value in the last week of 1995, to finish the year down 1.91 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services. But the average fund still remained 17.49 percent below the level of mid-July 1990. **********Despite this dismal performance, American investors began to return to Japan  mutual funds last summer, as the dollar strengthened against the yen, easing the profit squeeze on the export-oriented Japanese economy. Total assets of Japan-only funds, which peaked at $1.94 billion in July 1994, bottomed at $981.1 million in June, but finished 1995 at $1.68 billion, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. **********Many other investors in Asia remain doubtful that a rally in Japan will be sustained. The T. Rowe Price International Fund has only 23 percent of its $6.39 billion in assets invested in Japan. If its asset allocation was based on market capitalization, 41 percent would be in Japan. **********\"That weighting speaks to the fact that other, smaller markets look more attractive,\" said David Warren, a London-based executive vice president of Rowe  Price-Fleming, adviser to Price's foreign funds. He is more partial to other markets in Asia, and in Europe, than he is to Japan. **********Mr. Warren said he expects share prices in most foreign markets to advance 15 to 20 percent this year, with Japan rising in \"the low double-digits.\" He said the United States stock market would rise no more than 10 percent. **********Peter Donovan, president of Wright Investors Services, said, \"Japan is never  going to go back to the heights it occupied six years ago.\" Although his company offers the Wright Equifund Japan, he said the Japanese market remained overpriced. \"I don't think it's anything to invest a lot of money in,\" he said. **********David Herro, manager of the $800 million Oakmark International Fund, is even  more skeptical. He has avoided Japan since the fund was introduced in September  1992. \"Japanese companies do not utilize free cash flow in a way that enhances value for their owners,\" he said. \"So the stocks might be cheap, but they'll stay cheap.\" **********The other dimension to investing in Japan is currency risk. When the value of the yen soared to less than 85 yen to the dollar, returns to investors in the United States were diminished. The yen has since weakened to more than 100 to the dollar, and some advisers expect the yen to stay near that level for the year. **********Mr. Warren, whose fund can hedge the yen against the dollar, currently is not doing so. **********\"We believe that over the next 12 months the yen-dollar relationship will be  steady around current levels,\" he said. **********Mr. Farrell said that the Guinness Flight fund was 10 percent hedged and that \"we might be tempted to go a little higher.\" Although the Japanese balance-of-trade surplus is falling, it remains positive and thus bolsters the currency. **********\"It's not that the atmosphere in Japan is perfect -- far from it,\" he said, \"but relative to the rest of Asia, its attractions are growing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/06/business/anchor-gaming-is-considering-a-sale-or-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-12-06", "snippet": "Shares of Anchor Gaming rise 12 percent after company says it is considering sale or merger (S)", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANCHOR GAMING IS CONSIDERING A SALE OR MERGER", "print_headline": "ANCHOR GAMING IS CONSIDERING A SALE OR MERGER", "body_text": " **********The shares of Anchor Gaming rose 12 percent yesterday after the company said it was considering a sale or merger and had hired Morgan Stanley & Company as a financial adviser.

They also made clear that European governments would adopt some of those measures rapidly if new U.S. sanctions come into force. **********\"There will certainly be a strong reaction,\" said Herve\u0301 de Charette, the French foreign minister. **********But Washington continued to send strong signals Monday that Mr. Clinton would not waive the new sanctions. Asked about the threat of retaliation by the European allies, the White House spokesman, Michael McCurry said, \"We would say to our allies: Join us now in the effort to confine Cuban communism to the trash bin of history where it belongs.\" **********The unanimous view of European governments is that the extraterritorial reach of the U.S. sanctions contained in the Helms-Burton law \"directly contradicts international trade rules,\" according to Mr. de Charette. **********But if the ministers believed a tit-for-tat trade war over Cuba was all but inevitable, they also went out of their way to play down any suggestion of a broader crisis in relations between Europe and the United States. **********\"Those relations are too deep, too long-standing and too important,\" said Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner. \"We have not sought confrontation and don't do so. We are merely defending ourselves.\" **********Malcolm Rifkind, the British foreign minister, said the dispute was a \"rift\" and not a crisis. \"Like previous rifts, it will be resolved,\" he added. **********One element of the Helms-Burton law \u2014 Title IV \u2014 allows the United States to bar from entering the country the executives of foreign companies whose Cuban subsidiaries use properties expropriated from Cuban emigre\u0301s. Washington so far has issued orders barring executives of the Italian telecommunications firm STET and the Canadian mining company Sherritt Inc., which include two British nationals. **********Title III of the law allows emigre\u0301s to sue such foreign companies in U.S. courts for compensation. Europeans regard this provision as the most pernicious, and have lobbied Mr. Clinton vigorously to use his authority to suspend it. He will announce Tuesday whether he will allow the measure to take effect or suspend it for six months on national security grounds. **********The Clinton administration initially opposed the legislation in Congress, but modified its dissent after the downing of two unarmed aircraft piloted by Cuban emigre\u0301s in Cuban airspace in April. **********Europe's rare, unified response in turn reflects the deep opposition that EU governments share toward Washington's penchant for unilateral trade action, whether it takes the form of a walkout on talks to liberalize global trade in telecommunications or the imposition of sanctions on foreign companies that do business with unfriendly regimes. **********While many Europeans agree with Washington's opposition to the Castro government, \"the best way to get change in Cuba is not to clobber your ally,\" Sir Leon said. **********Foreign Minister Abel Matutes of Spain said Helms-Burton merely continued more than 30 years of ineffective American attempts to alter Cuba with economic weapons. \"It doesn't contribute to what we all want \u2014 that Cuba evolves peacefully toward democracy,\" he said. **********The potential EU countermeasures include: **********Adopting laws to prevent European companies from complying with Helms-Burton. Britain's 1980 Protection of Trading Interests Act is the model, forbidding British companies from providing information to U.S. courts in extraterritorial actions and authorizing those companies to file countersuits in British courts to claw back any punitive damages awarded by U.S. courts. **********Establishing a list to watch of U.S. companies that file suits against EU companies under Helms-Burton. \"If it keeps them guessing, that's a good thing,\" Sir Leon said. **********Calling for a dispute settlement panel at the World Trade Organization. **********Withdrawing visas or work permits for executives of U.S. corporations. **********EU officials acknowledged several problems with the latter two measures. **********The United States has indicated it would invoke the World Trade Organization's national security clause to bar any action at the Geneva-based trade regulator, and EU officials said they were leery of establishing such a precedent. **********As for visas, Mr. Rifkind and Mr. de Charette said action was unlikely.

Rising economic growth generally pushes up bond yields as investors begin to factor in increased inflation. **********In spite of the bleak state of the German economy at present, many economists are predicting a strong rebound in the second half of the year. Holger Schmeiding, senior strategist in Frankfurt for Merrill Lynch & Co., forecasts that the German economy will grow at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the second half. But he agrees with the consensus forecast that sees the Bundesbank stimulating the German economy with at least one more interest-rate cut. **********British monetary authorities shaved interest rates for the third time this year on Friday. While forecasters anticipate a stronger second half in Britain as well as in Germany, hard evidence of strength has been hard to find. **********Analysts worry that their bullish outlooks for European stocks and bonds could yet founder, as they did so disastrously in 1994, if U.S. interest rates begin to rise. **********Two years ago European interest rates, in spite of relatively weak growth in the region, rose in lockstep with American rates. **********\"I can see no sign of a decoupling between European and American interest rates,\" said Richard Davidson of Morgan Stanley International. Many American-based economists say the rise in U.S. bond yields that began in February still has a lot of room to run. That could ultimately spell trouble for Europe. The best many analysts now hope for is that any rise in long-term interest rates in Europe will be more modest than in America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/27/business/company-briefs-000809.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********CARMIKE CINEMAS INC., Columbus, Ga., which owns a chain of theaters, agreed to acquire 12 movie theaters from Fox Theaters Corp. of Wyomissing, Pa., for undisclosed terms. **********MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING CO., St. Paul, known as 3M, said it planned to close a plant in Baltimore, Ohio, with 115 employees that makes car and truck trim. **********NOKIA OY A.B., Helsinki, Finland, a telecomunications company, won a contract valued at $22 million to supply its Guestlink hotel communications system to Thorn EMI of London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/21/your-money/IHT-rush-to-small-caps-a-bluechip-blunder.html": {"writer_name": "Aline Sullivan", "pub_date": "1996-09-21", "snippet": "AS WALL STREET'S bull run surges on, many investors have started switching to small-capitalization stocks in the expectation that they will soon catch up with their blue-chip cousins..Figures from Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York show t...", "word_count": 4279, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rush to Small Caps: A Blue-Chip Blunder?", "print_headline": "Rush to Small Caps: A Blue-Chip Blunder?", "body_text": " **********AS WALL STREET'S bull run surges on, many investors have started switching to small-capitalization stocks in the expectation that they will soon catch up with their blue-chip cousins. **********Figures from Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York show that inflows to small-company funds soared in August to $1.6 billion, compared with a net intake of $150 million in July.Over the same period, inflows to funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500 index of the biggest U.S. companies held steady at $1.1 billion **********But blue-chip holders might be better advised to sit tight.Since the spring, the record gains in the Dow Jones industrial average have been largely fueled by blue chips.The S&P 500 reached new highs again this week as investors scrambled for a relatively safe exposure to any further gains. **********In contrast, the Russell 2,000 index of small-cap stocks lags 7 percent below the record set on May 22 of 36.41 points.The Nasdaq composite index remains about 3 percent below the record of 1,249.15 set June 5, despite a substantial rise over the past two weeks. **********This gap should narrow in the coming months, many investors reason.They agree with John Ballen, manager of the $5.1 billion MFS Emerging Growth Fund, that small-cap service and technology companies are the most likely to benefit from an expected wave of corporate restructuring. **********This year \"may end with smaller companies substantially outperforming larger companies,\" he said.\"Smaller companies are the ones providing the technology and the resources to drive productivity to the bottom line and to the stock market.\" **********Another argument proffered by the small-cap bulls is that a continued rise in the value of the dollar will eat into the export-led earnings of the blue chips but leave the smaller, more domestic-oriented companies relatively unscathed.The dollar has climbed more than 8 percent this year against an average of 19 other currencies, according to J.P.

That decline held a perverse attraction for Cressida Granger and David Mulley, who have helped make lava lamps the epitome of retro-hip today, joiningthe resurgent Beatles, inflatable furniture and flare-bottom jeans. **********You can catch the lamps while nightclubbing at the Lava Lounge in London (in the Float Upstream Room) or when out shopping for clothes, jewelry or even snowboards. **********Inside a glass bottle held by an aluminum stand, colorful wax blobs rise as they are heated by a bulb below, only to sink lazily to the bottom for more of the same once they cool at the top. **********The appeal of the lamp is simple: \"It's like a goldfish or open fire \u2014 mesmerizing,\" said Ms. Granger in Mathmos's new showroom in London's theater district. The shop, which doubles as an office is an expensive step up from the antique stalls of Camden market, where the pair began selling the lamps six years ago. **********The original lava lamp was adapted from an unreliable egg timer invented in 1963 by Edward Craven-Walker.When the wax rose to the top of the container, your egg was ready. **********While he may not have been much of an egg-timer inventor, Mr. Craven-Walker does seem to have had a lock on lava-lamp manufacturing technology. Ms. Granger andMr. Mulley found the lamps hard to make, so they wrote to Mr. Craven-Walker, who invited them to hisfactory in Poole.The English factory was intact but unprofitable, with a staff of three making about 1,200 lamps a year at the end of the 1980s. **********Ms. Granger and Mr. Mulley set about marketing and selling the product to retailers across Britain, and within five years they had bought the business, hired 45 more employees and increased production to 10,000 lamps a month. **********In its first year, 1990, Mathmos sold 20,000 lamps in Britain. Now the company sells 50,000 lamps a year in Britain and another 50,000 in Germany. Mathmos expects sales for 1995 to be pounds 5 million (dollars 7.6 million), up from pounds 3 millionin 1994. **********\"Most people were laughing in the aisles when we did our first trade fair in 1990,\" Ms. Granger said. **********But a few customers ignored the prejudice. One early buyer was the Gadget Shop, aretailer that has grown with the success of the lamps. From its initial order of 12, Gadget has become Mathmos's biggest client. **********\"The lamps are one of our evergreen products \u2014 meaning they keep on selling,\" said Boxer Singh, a Gadget regional manager. \"But we can't get enough of them.\" **********Ms. Granger acknowledged that Mathmos has struggled at times to meet demand. The company hired 15 people in the past year to either hand-spin the aluminum that holds the glass containers or assemble the electronic components. **********A principal complaint from customers is that after a year's use the liquid in the lamp becomes cloudy and the effect is lessened.Ms. Granger's response is that nothing lasts forever andanother liquid container can be purchased for half the price of a complete lamp. **********But Jim McLaughlin, a business-development analyst, said that small, niche businesses like Mathmos often fail after seven years, because to lack of vision. **********\"This is very imaginative of them,\" he said of Mathmos's resurrection of the lava lamp, \"but anything unusual has a limited life cycle.I would suggest that they modulate their vision. Are there any lava tables? Kids toys?\" **********But Ms. Granger argues that the lava lamp has moved from being a cult item to being a classic item. **********\"Each year I have waited for our U.K. market to bottom out as most fads do,\" she said. \"But all we do is double sales year on year.' **********Mathmos is counting on that popularity and the diversification of the lava lamp to carry it into the next decade. **********The company has modulated the original lava lamp, with a waist in the tube and priced at pounds 39.95, into such forms as the rocket-shaped Telstar, the jumbo-rocket-shaped Lunar and the plain-cylinder Jet. **********Mathmos has also developed a new range of lamps, including such technically advanced light displays as the Faze 2 interactive color-changing lamp, which is controlled by a microchip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/news/yeltsins-visit-to-china-asians-cast-a-wary-eye.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1996-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin's Visit to China: Asians Cast a Wary Eye", "print_headline": "Yeltsin's Visit to China: Asians Cast a Wary Eye", "body_text": " **********SINGAPORE\u2014                     While Asian countries regard reconciliation between China and Russia as an immediate plus for regional stability, they also worry that Russian arms and friendship might embolden Beijing to use force to pursue its territorial claims to Taiwan and other parts of Asia. **********As President Boris N.

Adding new subscribers has proven a tough challenge. **********But that was before the rise of satellite television. Direct-broadcast satellite services, which have often lured their first customers in areas where  no cable services are available, now have more than two million subscribers, according to Larry Gerbrandt, who follows cable programming for Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., consulting firm that specializes in media. **********As a result, Mr. Gerbrandt said, \"pay TV has gotten a real shot in the arm.\" **********Part of the influx of new business is the product of a simple dynamic: Each time a satellite broadcasting service gets a new customer, pay services like HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc.; Showtime, owned by Viacom Inc., and the Disney Channel, owned by the Walt Disney Company are likely to acquire a new customer as well. **********Many customers signing up for service from the United States Satellite Broadcasting Corporation or Primestar, a consortium of six cable companies, had  no access to the growing ranks of subscription channels before they put the pizza-size satellite dishes outside their windows. **********Mr. Gerbrandt expects the number of households with those small satellite dishes to rise to 11 million by the turn of the century. **********Other observers differ; the Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston, puts the figure at seven million. But all agree the number will rise. **********Even though the growth in these services will have relatively little impact on the profit margins of such giant companies like Time Warner or Viacom, the new subscriptions are breathing life into what had become an increasingly tough  business. **********Matthew Blank, president and chief executive of Showtime Networks Inc., said  one advantage of the direct-satellite television industry is its willingness to  spend heavily on national marketing campaigns. \"When we did the Michael Tyson pay-per-view fight a few weeks ago, Mr. Blank said, \"we saw a full-page color advertisment run by U.S.S.B. In 20 years I have never seen a full-page national  ad from a cable operator. For us, that creates more exposure and more competition.\" **********David Londoner, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, says direct-broadcast satellite is already giving services like HBO and Showtime a real financial lift. \"It is a business that has been growing at about 10 to 11 percent cash flow, and it looks like it will be closer to 15 percent in the next few years,\"  Mr. Londoner said. **********Indeed, last year, the cash flow from HBO and other Time Warner programming businesses rose 14 percent, to $293 milion. In 1994, it increased 11.7 percent,  to $257 million, and a year earlier, rose just 6.9 percent, to $230 million, the company reported. **********Part of the increase comes from new subscribers and part from increased rates. In both cases, experts believe that direct-broadcast television has played a major role in the rise. **********Though he would not give details, Showtime's Mr. Blank acknowledged that his  company was getting more per-household revenue from subscribers who buy the service as part of their package of programming from satellite companies, than it does from subscribers who get the programming from conventional cable-television providers. **********One reason is simply leverage. Industry experts say that the large cable operators, like the Comcast Corporation and the Cablevision Systems Corporation, can negotiate better deals than satellite companies. **********Jeffrey Bewkes, HBO's chairman, chief executive and president, maintains that the company gets more money each year from other cable providers but does not dispute the issue of volume discounts. \"It is true that companies get all kinds  of incentives for growth,\" Mr. Bewkes said. He compared it to marketing Coca-Cola. The company might be able to motivate stores to move more Coke by using volumne discounts. **********As a result, the major pay-TV companies might earn more money per subscriber  from direct-broadcast services, if only because the satellite industry is still  relatively young and does not have the influence of its major cable rivals. **********Mr. Gerbrandt sees another advantage in direct-broadcast services, which generally provide more diverse offerings. For example, a satellite subscriber can get five different versions of HBO for the same price he or she would pay for a single channel on cable. The additional four channels mean fewer disconnects by viewers, or what the industry refers to as \"churn,\" Mr. Gerbrandt said. **********Direct-broadcast services are not expected to dominate the industry. **********But industry experts believe that cable will one day reach about 88 million United States homes, which could mean that 13 percent of all homes with television will get cable via direct-broadcast satellite. **********As a percentage of new subscribers last year, the number of homes with direct-broadcast services outweighed the number of homes with cable for HBO, Mr. Bewkes said. He added that in 1994, cable and direct-broadcast subscribers each  accounted for about half of the 2.3 million new subscribers and that last year,  the figure was slightly more than half for direct-broadcast services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/20/business/patents-four-kodak-engineers-are-honored-for-development-new-consumer-camera.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1996-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;Four Kodak engineers are honored for the development of a new consumer camera system.", "print_headline": "Patents;Four Kodak engineers are honored for the development of a new consumer camera system.", "body_text": " **********A CAMERA that can send instructions to printing equipment about a photograph's size, the conditions under which it was taken, and dates, titles and details of its subjects has won two patents and an invention award for its designers. **********The patents were developed by four engineers at the Eastman Kodak Company in  Rochester after Kodak and four Japanese camera manufacturers asked 22,000 people in 11 countries what features they wanted in the next camera they bought. The four engineers were named Inventors of the Year by the Intellectual Property Owners Association, a nonprofit group that represents business, academic and independent inventors. **********People wanted better pictures and more creativity at the time of picture taking,\" said Bill Atkinson, the systems integration manager of Kodak's Advanced Photo Systems business. He and Robert Cloutier, Michael Wash and Arthur Whitfield received the patents and the honors. **********\"It became clear that we needed to develop a camera that could communicate to the film and in turn to the print-making equipment,\" Mr. Atkinson said. Consumers wanted the printer to know what they knew at the time a picture was taken -- what kind of lighting was used, how far away the subject was, what size print would be best, and details like the fact that the picture was taken at Billy's 5th birthday party in 1996. **********\"The camera has a magnetic head that can write\" on the coating on the back of a roll of film, Mr. Atkinson said, adding, \"All kinds of scene data can now be communicated to the print-making device. **********\"Essentially, the patents relate to the communication protocols between the system components, the camera, the film and the photofinishing equipment,\" he added. \"In order to work, the camera has to write on a specific track and the photofinishing equipment has to know where to look to read that track.\" **********So now photographers can push a button to mark on the film their choice from  among three formats -- a classic print (a 4-by-6-inch photo with one central subject), an H-print (a 4-by-7-inch print modeled on the shape of a high-definition television screen for group shots) or a P-print (a 4-by-12-inch  print for panoramic shots). Information about picture quality like lighting can  also be embedded on the film. **********Shooters can also press a button to embed a date and time stamp, as well as a title -- like Christmas, Vacation or Birthday -- on the film. Some cameras have  little keyboards so photographers can create their own titles. The print-making  machine is instructed to print this information on the back of each picture. **********If someone wants to change film in mid-roll, the camera can also mark the spot of the last picture taken and rewind the roll. When the photographer is ready to use the rest of that film, the camera fast-forwards to the mark on the  film. In the future, Kodak hopes to permit consumers to encode their name, address or phone number on the film. **********Kodak's technology has been licensed to about 50 companies worldwide, Mr. Atkinson said. He and his three co-inventors received patents 5,130,745 and 5,229,810. **********Two inventors of a bicycle gearshift won the association's Entrepreneurship Award for a mechanism that allowed their small American company to wrest 50 percent of the bike gear-shifter market away from the Japanese company that had  dominated sales for years. **********At the time, the Japanese manufacturer Shimano dominated the bicycle drive-train industry, making the shifters, derailleurs and crank arms that were  used worldwide. **********Then the American company, SRAM, persuaded mountain bicycle manufacturers to  try its shifter, named Grip Shift and based on three patents issued to John Cheever and Sam Patterson. It used a different shift design called \"indexing.\" **********\"Indexing means the clicking or discreet amount of movement that causes the shift,\" Mr. Cheever said. \"It's simpler for the rider because it's more intuitive than having several gears on the bike. The mechanism has only three moving parts, while the competition has maybe 80 parts.\" **********The patents actually apply to \"the cable pulling rates necessary to actuate derailleur bikes in an indexing mode,\" he said. **********For a rider that means gears can be shifted with a simple twist of the handlebar grips. The right grip controls the rear derailleurs and the left grip  controls the front derailleurs. Most mountain bikes have 21 gears, though Mr. Cheever said Grip Shift can control 24-gear bikes, too. **********SRAM has captured \"more than half of the shifter portion of the market\" from  the Japanese manufacturer. As a result, sales to more than 100 bicycle makers including Trek and Schwinn jumped from $4 million in 1992 to about $50 million in 1995. **********Mr. Cheever and Mr. Patterson received patents 5,102,372; 5,197,927 and 5,476,019."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/21/business/short-interest-rises-again-on-big-board.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Short Interest Rises Again on Big Board", "print_headline": "Short Interest Rises Again on Big Board", "body_text": " **********With stocks continuing to surge, open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange have set their fifth consecutive monthly record in the most  recent period. **********The Big Board said short interest represented 2.35 billion shares for trades  made in the month ending June 11 and settled by June 15, up 1.6 percent from the month earlier. **********On the smaller American Stock Exchange, short interest was 127 million shares, a rise of 1 percent. **********In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit.

Nor are trade specialists in Geneva the best people to define national security. **********At the root of the disagreement are fundamental and legitimate political differences in the way Americans and Europeans see the world and over how best to assert Western interests. **********Those differences must be tackled at the highest political level, much more seriously than they have been so far. Meanwhile, the Europeans can fight the U.S. sanctions through their own legislative countermeasures. **********Even if the Europeans won in the WTO, as some Washington lawyers think they might, they could still not force Congress to repeal Helms-Burton.

But these days he has few admirers. **********Argentine prosecutors say Mr. Soriani was the mastermind of a complex scheme to defraud the Government last year, while the International Business Machines Corporation says it dismissed him and two other top officials because they exercised ''poor business judgment'' in paying a subcontractor for work that was never performed. **********To many Argentines, Mr. Soriani epitomizes the greed and corruption that is said to permeate the highest levels of Argentine society. Prosecutors have suggested that the subcontractor has ties to senior Government officials. **********To hear Mr. Soriani tell it, though, he is a scapegoat -- set up by top I.B.M. managers, who, he contends, initially approved the subcontractor payments but later said they knew nothing of them. ''I.B.M. totally distorted my role,'' Mr. Soriani, 50, said in a recent interview. ''They unfairly singled me out as the villain in this case and ruined my name. But I refuse to keep quiet any longer.'' **********Mr. Soriani said that overnight I.B.M. stripped him of a $500,000 annual salary, $3.2 million in stock options, health benefits and a car. **********Mr. Soriani has been indicted on fraud charges along with about 30 other I.B.M. and Government officials, but until now he has not commented on the case. **********In an effort to salvage his reputation, Mr. Soriani, who in his 26 years with I.B.M. rose from sales trainee to the Argentine company's second- highest position, has written a book called ''The Corporation.'' **********Mr. Soriani maintains in the book that I.B.M. made him a ''sacrificial lamb'' because it was concerned that it could be found in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a United States law that forbids payments of bribes by American companies to obtain contracts abroad. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are investigating I.B.M. for possible violations of that law, which carries stiff criminal and civil penalties. **********At issue is whether I.B.M. paid bribes to obtain a $250 million contract to install a computer system in the state-owned Banco de la Nacion. **********As part of the contract, which Mr. Soriani engineered, I.B.M. hired Hogan Systems Inc., based in Dallas, to develop a software program to connect the bank's 500 branches to a computer network. (Hogan has not been accused of any wrongdoing.) **********But I.B.M. also took the unusual step of contracting with an Argentine company, Capacitacion y Computacion Rural S.A., or C.C.R., to provide  backup software, for $37 million. **********I.B.M. paid that company $21 million before auditors from Argentina's tax agency began asking questions. What concerned the auditors was that I.B.M. received nothing in return and that C.C.R. paid out most of the $21 million to phantom subcontractors, some of which deposited the money in Swiss bank accounts. **********Federal prosecutors here said I.B.M.'s deal was a clear case of fraud because the Government was charged for work that was not performed and, further, that some of I.B.M.'s money ended up in the pockets of Government officials. **********A former Finance Minister, Domingo Cavallo, bolstered that theory when he testified recently before a federal judge investigating the case that the President's chief of staff, Alberto Kohan, had pushed hard for the $250 million contract to go to I.B.M. because Mr. Kohan's associates held interests in C.C.R. **********Mr. Kohan's response was that Mr. Cavallo was ''mentally ill.'' **********Fred McNeese, a spokesman at I.B.M.'s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., said that while no I.B.M. employee broke any laws, paying the subcontractor $21 million for work it never completed was a violation of I.B.M.'s practices. ''A lot of money went out, and not a lot of value came back,'' Mr. McNeese said. **********Mr. Soriani defended the payments for a backup software system, which he called ''an insurance policy'' in case I.B.M. and Hogan ran into difficulties installing the new system. ''As it turns out, nothing went wrong and we didn't need the backup system,'' Mr. Soriani said, ''but we had to be prepared.'' **********Mr. Soriani said the backup system should not have come as a surprise to I.B.M. because it was clearly noted in the original contract, which was approved by Steve Lew, manager for systems integration at IBM Latin America, who reviews the technical details of all contracts. **********''We have done a thorough review of this case,'' Mr. McNeese said, ''and we are satisfied that no one in I.B.M.'s Latin America headquarters was informed orally or by written document that money would be paid to C.C.R.''. **********Mr. Soriani said I.B.M. was not telling the truth and that its strategy of blaming a few individuals -- in an effort to avoid prosecution under the foreign corrupt practices law -- would cost it business in Argentina. **********''It's very Anglo-Saxon to believe that the problem will be resolved if you say that no laws were broken but internal business practices were not followed,'' Mr. Soriani said. ''To Latins, that statement means: Yes, we broke the law but we are going to find a way to hide it.'' **********Government officials close to IBM Argentina said that the company's business had suffered greatly because of the scandal. Revenues, which were about $900 million last year, were hit hard when the central bank canceled the I.B.M. contract because of the scandal. **********Mr. McNeese said that I.B.M. did not provide revenue figures for individual countries, but that IBM Argentina's public-sector business had been hurt while its private-sector business continued to grow. **********Ricardo Martorana, who was forced to resign as president of IBM Argentina, said he too was angry at the way I.B.M. had handled the case. **********''I was the one who alerted corporate that we had a potential problem down here and that we needed someone to come and investigate,'' Mr. Martorana said.

S. Inc. yesterday by withdrawing its $1.8 billion offer, bowing to stern Government resistance. **********The decision by Rite-Aid, the operator of the nation's largest drugstore chain, came less than a week before the offer for Revco, the second-largest chain, was scheduled to expire. **********It was not a complete surprise. The offer, which was made on Nov. 30, had been under review by the Federal Trade Commission for some time. **********Last week the commissioners, by unanimous vote, said they would seek a Federal court injunction barring the merger, citing antitrust concerns. And the  commission reiterated that intention on Tuesday, even after a proposal by Rite Aid to sell 340 stores in an effort to meet the F.T.C.'s concerns. **********Without the proposed divestitures, the merged chain would have had 4,500 stores in 22 states in the Midwest and on the East Coast, more than twice as many as its closest competitor. **********\"One would have thought the offer to settle was a significant one,\" said Kevin Arquit, a partner at the law firm of Rogers & Wells and a former general counsel and director of the bureau of competition at the F.T.C. \"But when the Government rejected it and said it would still go to court, that sent a very strong message.\" **********For the most part, though, analysts said they were not surprised that the deal had collapsed, but investors registered their disappointment by pushing down the stock prices of both companies. Rite Aid shares lost $1.75, closing at $29.875, and Revco stock was down $1.875, at $24.125, both on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Rite Aid, which has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy and has had previous deals reviewed by the F.T.C., characterized its negotiations with the agency about the Revco deal in an almost hostile manner. **********Rite Aid, which is based in Camp Hill, Pa., announced its decision in a sharply worded three-page statement yesterday morning by Martin L. Grass, the company's chairman and chief executive. That statement was followed in the afternoon by a highly unusual conference call with reporters that was initiated  by Rite Aid. **********During that call, Mr. Grass echoed and amplified many of the points raised in his statement. Among other things, he accused the F.T.C. of bargaining in bad faith and said the Clinton Administration was bowing to the interests of some of the large makers of prescription drugs. **********\"In our conversations with the F.T.C., it was clear they were in the camp of  the pharmacy benefit managers, the three largest of which are owned by drug companies,\" he said. **********\"We have to conclude there are people in the Clinton Administration who did not want this transaction to go through.\" **********Mr. Grass said the company had made its offer to sell 340 stores in response  to an F.T.C. demand that the combined company hold no more than 35 percent of the market in any given area. **********After the proposal was made to meet that requirement, \"they changed the rules of the game again,\" Mr. Grass said, demanding that Rite Aid sell all Revco stores in Ohio, West Virginia and South Carolina. In all, he said, the agency was requiring that the combined company divest itself of 650 to 700 stores. He characterized that demand as \"extortion.\" **********\"In the future, if we run up against this type of analysis from the F.T.C., we would certainly try and challenge that in court,\" he said. **********He said Rite Aid would continue its expansion by developing new stores and increasing the size of existing ones. Asked whether Rite Aid might make a revised offer for a smaller piece of Revco, he said: \"That is not possible. You  would have to buy the entire company.\" **********George S. Cary, deputy director of the bureau of competition at the F.T.C., said, \"I can understand Mr. Grass's frustration, and I take his comments in that light. **********\"But it is clear the F.T.C. reviews each situation on its merits. Rite Aid has been allowed to make significant acquisitions in recent years, but this transaction, which would have combined thousands of stores in the same areas, is a transaction on a different order of magnitude and outranks the others we have  seen.\" **********Revco, which is based in Twinsburg, Ohio, had a similarly restrained response to Rite Aid's decision. **********\"We respect the opinion of the Federal Trade Commission on this matter,\" D. Dwayne Hoven, Revco's president and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. \"I believe, however, that the F.T.C.'s ruling in this case does not preclude further consolidation in the retail drugstore business.\" **********Analysts said they were not sure that that view was correct. **********Because of the F.T.C.'s scrutiny of the Rite Aid proposal, \"the idea that mergers will be the leading edge of consolidation needs to be reassessed,\" said  Gary Vineberg, a retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********\"Companies who have the ability to gain share through means other than acquisitions will have an enormous advantage,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/business/knudsen-sees-loss-for-95.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Knudsen Sees Loss for '95", "print_headline": "Knudsen Sees Loss for '95", "body_text": " **********The Morrison Knudsen Corporation said today that it expected to report a net  loss of about $260 million for 1995.

They worked with village leaders to promote girls education and reinforced their effort with a public information campaign using community meetings, radio, comic books and T-shirts. **********Their efforts paid off. For the first time ever, the dropout rate for girls in the district of Machinga is now lower than that of boys, and 25 female dropouts from the village of Chimkwezule have now returned to school. This monththe project will be expandedto the national level. **********The Malawi project, formally known as Girls Attainment in Basic Literacy and Education, or GABLE, was funded bythe U.S. Agency for International Development. It is an example of the growing investment that international aid organizations, working with leaders of underdeveloped countries, are making in the education of girls. **********More effective education of girls, said James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, constitutes \"the single most effective investment that a developing country can make.\" **********The existence of a global \"gender gap\" in schooling is well documented. According to Unicef, in 1990two thirds of the estimated 300 million children worldwide who lack access to primary or secondary schooling are girls. Gender discrepancies increase during the secondary school years, and by age 18 girls have received on average 4.4 fewer years of education than boys. Nearly two thirds of the estimated 900 adult illiterates in the world are females. **********In part because of growing concern about the issue, female enrollment has been climbing throughout the 1990s. Still, among children aged fiveto 11 in underdeveloped countries, nearly three girls out of 10 are still not in school, compared to one out of 10 boys. **********Reasons for the gender gap vary from country to country, butproblems include the need for girls to work in the home, judgments by families that investing in a boy's education has a greater economic payoff, and cultural and religious attitudes that place less value on women's education. When girls do enroll in formal schooling, they are often faced with teaching that is inappropriate to their needs. **********Although the gender gap is pervasive in developing countries, there is also abundant evidence that attacking it pays off, primarily because the educational gains of girls are passed on to their children. As Ruby Manikan, an Indian church leader, stated in an oft-quoted remark, \"If you educate a man, you educate a person. But if you educate a woman, you educate a family.\" **********Over the last two decades, researchers have shown that women with even a few years of schooling are better agricultural producers and generate more income for their families. Educated mothers provide their families with more nutritious meals and provide better health care, including vaccinations. The children of educated mothers survive infancy and childhood at a higher rate and are more likely to succeed in school. **********Educated women also marry later, have fewer babies and are more likely to breast feed those that they do bear. A recent USAID study estimated the benefits of increasing primary school enrollment of girls from 20 percent to 70 percent, accompanied by proportional growth in female secondary enrollment rate and moderate levels of government support for family planning. The results 20 years down the road, the study estimated, would include a reduction in fertility by 0.5 births per woman, a six-year increase in the life expectancy of children born 20 years later and a 38 percent reduction in the infant mortality rate for such children. **********The accumulation of such data has begun to have an impact on the foreign aid community. The World Bank recently announced plans to increase lending for education by 20 percent, to $2.5 billion annually, over the next five years, with 60 percent of that increase going toward enhancing girls' enrollment. **********In July, at a conference in Amman, Jordan, the bank and four United Nations agencies, including Unicef, agreed to work together on a concerted effort to enhance girls' education. In an interview, Maris O'Rourke, head of the Education Sector at the World Bank, said that collaborative efforts are necessary because \"all of our major successes in development, such as immunization, have occurred when the various agencies got together around a common goal.\" **********Women ministers of education and university presidents in Africa have formed an international Forum for African Women Educationalists to engage in networking and to coordinate the resources of the various countries, donors, nongovernmental organizations and individuals. **********Unicef has announced a program entitled \"Girls Education: A Framework for Action\" for the period 1996-2001. In Mozambique, for example, projects include a three-year, $2 million program that will involve building 24 schools closer to the communities where girls reside, reducing the household workload for girls by providing access to water, promoting nonformal educational alternatives for female adolescents and establishing school funds for textbooks. **********Individual countries have also made girls' education a priority. The Canadian International Development Agency will spend $100 million on such projects in Africaover the next five years, including a scholarship program in Guinea. The U.S. Agency for International Development began to focus on basic education for girls in 1988 and launched its first intensive program in Pakistan in 1989. **********Last year USAID announced a Girls' and Women's Initiative aimed at \"mobilizing a country's public- and private-sector decisionmakers in support of cost-effective and sustainable girls' education actions.\" The program will function in 11 countries of Asia, Africa, the Near East and Latin America. **********Development agencies attribute the intensification of interest in girls' education to a variety of forces, including growing research demonstratingits effectiveness and theinterest in gender-related issues that surrounded last year's Fourth UN Conference on Women in Beijing. **********Ms. O'Rourkesuggested that countries are coming to understand national progress requires mobilizing their entire population. \"They are learning that no matter what direction you go \u2014 economic growth, nutrition, population control, the environment \u2014you end up with women. If you are looking for ways to pass benefits from generation to generation, that's what women do.\" **********- **********EDWARD B.

G. of Germany. **********Through industry associations in Washington, the companies have lobbied the Administration heavily to take a tough line against China on behalf of their American subsidiaries. **********But in Japan and Germany, the same companies and their Governments have stayed on the sidelines. **********European nations, along with Canada and Mexico, have their own complaints about the Administration's mix of trade and politics. In recent months the European Union has expressed outrage over Mr. Clinton's decision to impose sanctions on companies around the world who do business with Cuba. Last week the State Department sent letters to the top executives of companies doing business in Havana warning that they may be barred from entering the United States. **********Europe has also objected to legislation now making its way through Congress that would penalize companies, particularly in France and Germany, that are striking billions of dollars in oil deals with Iran. On Wednesday, Jacques Santer, the new president of the European Commission, is scheduled to meet President Clinton, amid suggestions from Europe that American companies will be subject to retaliation if their business in the United States is hurt. **********In his testimony today, which focused on the Administration's efforts to renew China's ''most favored nation'' trade status, Mr. Lord was trying to make the case that the best way to deal with China was to remain fully engaged with Beijing, but to threaten specific sanctions for specific offenses -- from trade violations to the shipping of nuclear weapons to rogue states. **********He quickly acknowledged, however, that the sanctions are only truly effective when China's other major trading partners join in. ''One of our biggest problems in China is that our friends in Europe and Japan hold our coats while we take on the Chinese, and they gobble up the contracts,'' he said. **********''And I've said it directly to our friends,'' he added. ''If we could get more European and Japanese support of intellectual property rights, for example -- where they have a clear interest -- on nonproliferation, on human rights, whatever we did, targeted or not, would be much more effective. It's one of our biggest problems. We're working on it, but we need more help from our friends around the world.'' **********After his testimony, Mr. Lord said in an interview that he did not believe that Europe and Japan were always seeking to profit from differences between China and the United States. ''Sometimes there are real policy differences over China, and we have to respect that,'' he said. ''There are times when they genuinely disagree on the most effective approach or tactics.'' **********But he was clearly disturbed by Mr. Li's comments on Monday, the baldest statement by China yet that American companies will be punished for the pressure placed upon Beijing by Washington. **********In April, China gave a $1.2 billion aircraft order to Airbus Industrie that had been expected to go to the Boeing Company, and Japanese auto makers have used the recent tensions between Washington and Beijing to win approval for new plants in China. A number of American companies with large or potential investments in China have urged Washington to calm the waters, declaring that they are being held hostage. **********European business executives are unapologetic for their efforts to get into the Chinese market at America's expense. **********''Don't ask too much from the Europeans,'' Klaus Friedrich, the chief economist of Dresdner Bank Group, Germany's second-largest commercial bank, said today. ''It's too early. We can't play world cop.'' If the United States was unhappy with Europe's failure to back the threats of unilateral sanctions, he advised, ''then don't do what you're doing.'' **********By explicitly raising the possibility of sending more business to Europe, Mr. Li and other Chinese leaders appear to be betting that they can further fracture the United States business community about the wisdom of confronting China. **********Whether that tactic pays off may become clearer by Monday, the Administration's deadline for imposing roughly $2 billion in sanctions unless Beijing agrees to enforce a 15-month-old agreement to protect foreign-produced compact disks and programs contained on CD-ROM's. **********In the last several days China has begun a last-minute crackdown on the plants, raiding several of them and closing their doors. ''There's action under way,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States Trade Representative, said today. **********But while their body language suggests a deal is in the works to avert sanctions, Administration officials say China has yet to do enough to get the United States to drop its threats. That could be a negotiating ploy, or it could be a reflection of the odd set of negotiations now under way -- talks in which the American side is uncertain who in the Chinese leadership is actually making the decisions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/09/business/the-media-business-disney-clears-fcc-review-of-its-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Disney Clears F.C.C.

Yeltsin's early lead, the young ones laughed giddily and traded jokes built on oft-repeated campaign slogans. In the hall, an older campaign worker drew heavily on a cigarette and searched for historical closure. \"This was the Communists' last chance,\" Maksharip M.

They have steadfastly denied that Mr. Yeltsin's current illness is linked to his heart condition. **********\"They can say whatever stupid thing they want,\" Sergei Filatov, one of Mr. Yeltsin's top camapign advisers, said tonight. \"If a person has a heart problem  he doesn't sit in his dacha, he lies in the hospital.\" **********But CNN stood by its intepretation of the word angina. \"We're not wrong on this, we've confirmed it with several people,\" said one CNN producer. \"They're just trying to muddy the waters. We're not saying he's dying, but it's more than a sore throat.\" **********As they filed into polling stations today, ordinary voters in Moscow seemed mostly unaware of Mr. Yeltsin's illness -- or unalarmed. \"I've heard gossip, rumors that it's his heart,\" said a 55-year-old retired nurse who voted for Mr.  Yeltsin and who gave her name only as Ludmilla. \"But they say he's fine, and I have no doubts. Look,\" she added. \"I or any of us could drop dead tomorrow.\" **********Other Yeltsin supporters seemed to believe that Mr. Yeltsin's illness could be serious, and shrugged even that off. \"Is he sick? It's not evident,\" Andrei Petrov, 33, said with a smile. The owner of an advertising agency, Mr. Petrov said he would vote for anybody rather than the Communists. \"Life now could get ten times worse,\" he said grimly, \"and it still would be better than under the Communists.\" **********He said he was not perturbed at the thought that the President could be more  seriously ill than is publicly acknowledged. He smiled. \"So what? They say it's  the court that makes the king.\" **********The Yeltsin team's greatest fear all along was a poor turn-out; they worried  that their supporters, less disciplined than Communists, would go to their weekend houses instead of the polls. **********But Valentina D. Goncharuk, 40, a teacher and mother of two, traveled all the way back from her dacha today to vote for \"none of the above.\" **********\"They are two equal evils,\" she said. \"In 1991 our whole family was for Yeltsin. But after Chechnya -- I have two 22-year-old nephews -- how can I vote  for this man now? But I don't want Communism either, even though my family and I live in conditions close to poverty. **********\"It's my protest,\" she added. \"Perhaps it's not such a smart thing to do, but I just cannot support either one.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/28/world/workers-bitter-at-pay-and-privatization-tie-up-bolivian-capital.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1996-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 538, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Workers Bitter at Pay and Privatization Tie Up Bolivian Capital", "print_headline": "Workers Bitter at Pay and Privatization Tie Up Bolivian Capital", "body_text": " **********Tens of thousands of state workers took to the streets of La Paz again today, chanting anti-Government slogans, hurling rocks at the police and blocking traffic.

In a show of solidarity, public health workers, state-employed miners and some employees of the state petroleum company have joined the strike. **********The Government's plan to privatize the oil company, despite growing opposition by labor unions and politicians, is at the heart of this year's protests. Fearing that the strike could interrupt petroleum operations, the Government sent soldiers and police officers to guard refineries and pipelines. **********Opinion polls have shown that people in this economically depressed nation of seven million people are generally opposed to privatizations, which they equate  with the loss of national independence and with corruption. **********To address these concerns, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada devised a \"capitalization\" program in which investors agree to invest a specified sum.

But he cautioned that members of the public, already worried about the possibility of becoming ill from eating infected beef, should not overreact. **********It is not known whether these cases represent a significant local cluster of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which remains a very rare condition,\" said Dr. Colchester, a consultant at Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital in London. **********Citing the cases of 10 people under the age of 42 who had fallen ill with a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, the Government said in March that the disease  might be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, which has infected some 160,000 cows in Britain. Creutzfeldt-Jakob usually strikes people in their 50's and 60's. **********Although Dr. Colchester said that one of his male patients showed the classic symptoms of the new variant and that the disease was diagnosed in the other after a brain biopsy, a spokesman for the British Department of Health said the  doctor's conclusions were premature. **********The spokesman said it was insignificant that the three victims all come from  the same area, a farming community. \"There has never been any evidence of clustering of Creutzfeldt-Jakob,\" he said. \"It is not a communicable disease and cannot be transferred between humans.\" **********But Richard Lacey, a microbiologist at Chapel Allerton Hospital in Leeds, who has argued that the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob could become an epidemic, called the reported cases \"very bad news.\" **********\"This is the first instance of the disease's relationship to the early cases  of mad cow disease,\" he said. \"The significance of these cases in Ashford is that they were almost certainly acquired around the time of the first case of mad cow disease, or a year or two before that.\" **********In France, researchers said the death of a Frenchman from a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may cast doubt on the link between the fatal brain disease and a similar illness in cattle. **********The 26-year-old victim appeared to have the same strain of the disease as in  10 cases in Britain that scientists think may be related to so-called mad cow disease. Yet only 16 cases of mad cow disease have been reported in France, compared with about 160,000 in Britain, since the disease was identified in 1986. **********\"The case questions the possible causal relationship\" between the two diseases, they said. **********The researchers made their claims in a letter published in the current issue  of the medical journal The Lancet, which was released on Friday. **********The French victim, a mechanic, had no particular contacts with cattle and had traveled abroad only once, in 1990, to southern Spain, the French researchers said. **********Scientists in Britain said the 10 cases there involved a previously unknown strain of the disease."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/business/spending-it-should-you-invest-kick-the-tires-first.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPENDING IT;Should You Invest?

Dealer sales of new cars and used cars were virtually even in 1990, but last year, used-car sales, at 18.5 million, exceeded new-car sales, at 14.8 million, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. **********But for any dealer trying to garner a bigger share of the business, one big obstacle remains -- getting a steady supply of good cars. That basic fact has some car industry experts wary about the investment potential of the new stores. **********One big chain is up and running: Car Max, a unit of Circuit City Stores Inc., has four locations and ambitious expansion plans. Coming soon are stores from Auto Nation USA, whose investors include H. Wayne Huizenga, the former chairman  of Blockbuster, and Driver's Mart Worldwide Inc., formed last month by nine big  car dealers. Other small outfits already operating include Car Choice, based in  Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and HPR Automotive Superstore of Springfield, Ill. **********The only company with publicly traded stock is Circuit City. Its four Car Max stores are dwarfed by its 412 electronics stores, so the stock price barely reflects its car sales. Circuit City has no plans to spin off the car subsidiary and expects to finance further expansion with the cash from its electronics stores, said Richard L. Sharp, the chairman and chief executive of Circuit City. \"If we reach the point in time where it seems appropriate to do that, to sell some or all of Carmax to the public, we will evaluate that -- it's clearly too early,\" Mr. Sharp said. \"One criterion might be when it starts making money.\" **********Thomas W. Eggleston, a former Amway official who is chief executive of Driver's Mart, said his chain might issue stock in as soon as three years. \"We don't see it as a near-term step,\" he said. \"We do recognize in establishing our own finance company, as that grows, we will have to look for sources of capital.\" **********Auto Nation, which has the backing not only of Mr. Huizenga, but also of James Moran, a wealthy car distributor in Deerfield Beach, Fla., plans to open its first store this summer. While company officials say they have no plans to go public this year, they have not ruled out doing so next year. **********Because a steady supply of good used cars is essential for the new superstores to succeed, the ones affiliated with new-car dealers are expected to have an edge. The dealers take many trade-in cars and have exclusive access to auto makers' used-car auctions. **********The track record of used-car chains has been mediocre. One unsuccessful experiment was Urcarco Inc., which catered to low-income consumers, many with poor credit histories. A corny name did not save the company during the recession of the early 1990's. It left the used-car business, changed its name to Americredit and switched to making loans to used-car dealers. **********Urcarco primarily sold older cars with substantial markups at small dealerships. The new superstores intend to sell late-model cars to fairly affluent buyers and to rely on high turnover rather than steep markups for profits. **********Besides Urcarco, the Ford Motor Company jumped briefly into the used-car business in 1991, setting up four dealerships to sell its own cars. Ford closed  the unit within a year, after receiving complaints from its new-car dealers and  after having trouble finding enough cars. Since then, the popularity of car leasing has made more late-model vehicles available to the auto makers. **********But some auto industry experts still say a shortage of low-mileage, late-model used cars will prove to be the Achilles' heel of the superstores. For cars, the superstores depend heavily on individuals, dealers and finance companies not tied to the car makers. **********As more and more companies and new-car dealers jump into the used-car business, and as car leases grow longer, competition will soon be fierce for a limited number of low-mileage, late-model used cars. For a prospective investor  in these businesses, that is cause for concern. **********\"I would be extremely cautious unless it's going to be a very short-term investment,\" said Art Spinella, the general manager of CNW Marketing Research Inc. in Bandon, Ore. \"It's going to be incredibly volatile after 1997.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/no-markets-chart.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Markets Chart", "print_headline": "No Markets Chart", "body_text": " **********The Tracking the Markets chart summarizing last week's stock and bond activity does not appear today.

Sullivan, the G.M. vice president who oversees the company's Asian and Pacific region operations. **********Earlier this spring, the Chrysler Corporation canceled its plans to assemble its small Neon cars from kits in Indonesia. Chrysler officials attribute that decision to the Indonesian Government's strong backing of its \"pioneer auto project,\" which is intended to develop a locally owned auto company. The Ford Motor Company was on the verge of building a small assembly plant in Indonesia last winter before the country announced the pioneer auto project, Ford officials said in recent interviews. Thomas G. Mattia, a spokesman, said today that the Government-backed project had prompted Ford officials \"to rethink our options in Indonesia and that's what we're doing; we're not moving forward with any plans at this date.\" The local auto maker benefiting from the pioneer auto project is a joint venture controlled by a son of President Suharto. The Kia Motors Corporation of South Korea is a minority partner in the joint venture. Tungki Ariwibowo, Indonesia's Minister of Industry and Trade, has been in negotiations this week in Washington with top American trade officials who are upset over the auto issue. A senior American official characterized the problem  today as a very serious one, while refusing to respond to speculation that the United States might soon join other countries in bringing a case against Indonesia at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. The Indonesian Embassy said that Mr. Ariwibowo had declined to comment. American auto producers are jumping into the fast-growing south and east Asian market, which is dominated by Japanese manufacturers. Governments in Southeast Asia have been uneasy about the strong Japanese influence. Thailand, for instance, has tried to bring new competition into the market, persuading G.M. late last month to commit itself to a $750 million assembly plant there. But Indonesia has traveled a separate route, trying to foster a domestic industry owned by Indonesians. The Government in Jakarta has levied stiff taxes on cars, which add as much as 35 percent to the price of a vehicle. But it decided last week to grant a one-year exemption from tariffs and certain taxes for the pioneer car project, which would allow a car produced under it to be built initially at Kia's factories in South Korea. Seeking to allay criticism, Indonesia also moved last week to lower taxes on other small cars. But that helped Japanese manufacturers while doing little for  American producers of larger vehicles. Japan, the European Commission and the United States have all criticized Indonesia's national car program. Under a principle of international trade law known as national treatment, members of the World Trade Organization must not enact tax laws and other legislation that favor domestic companies at the expense of foreign companies in such a way as to impede trade. Indonesia is a member of the World Trade Organization and a signer of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Many developing countries that have signed the world trade agreement have long pursued policies that favor domestic producers, and some have longstanding waivers from GATT rules. But new rules from the World Trade Organization are gradually phasing out the waivers. And Indonesia does not even have a waiver, having just started the pioneer auto project. Mr. Sullivan spoke about Indonesia in response to a question at a news conference today in Bangkok, where he also discussed G.M.'s new assembly plant in Thailand. G.M. has already invested $110 million in a small Indonesian assembly plant, where it began producing Opel Vectra and Astra sedans in 1994."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/18/world/500000-strike-in-israel-to-protest-netanyahu-s-economic-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1996-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "500,000 Strike in Israel to Protest Netanyahu's Economic Plans", "print_headline": "500,000 Strike in Israel to Protest Netanyahu's Economic Plans", "body_text": " **********Opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans for Israel's economy today closed factories, banks and Government offices across the country with a general strike, which also crippled hospitals, public utilities and the national airport. **********The strike was called by the umbrella labor federation, the Histadrut, which  accuses the Government of approving budget cuts that will hurt middle-class wage-earners and the poor.

It was the company's 10th consecutive quarter of earnings growth in the double digits or better. **********As if confirming the Wall Street adage that speculators buy on anticipation and sell on the news, shares of Philip Morris fell $1 yesterday, closing at $92.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in a market in which the Dow Jones industrial average declined 29.07 points. The company's shares had risen $1.50 on Monday in expectation of strong on-target earnings. **********''It's as if the market is complacent, it's so accustomed to seeing completely outstanding results from this company,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst at Smith Barney who ventured that investors had expected the company to beat its earnings target. ''Nevertheless, it was an unbelievable quarter. Philip Morris operates as if it had no competition.'' **********Philip Morris shares had plunged $5.375 last Friday on the announcement of new research studies linking cigarettes to lung cancer. Analysts said that despite its strong earnings performance, the shares would continue to be vulnerable to shifting perceptions of the company's vulnerability to legal and regulatory liabilities. **********Over all, the company sold 238 billion cigarettes in the third quarter, up 9.3 percent from a year earlier. Operating income from the company's Philip Morris U.S.A. tobacco business grew at a surprisingly strong 13 percent, as a result of ''some distortion in the quarter,'' said Roy D. Burry, a securities analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. In 1995, the third quarter had one less shipping day, wholesalers had depleted inventories and some tobacco shipments had been made in the second quarter before an extended July 4th holiday weekend, he said. In addition, there was a price increase in April. **********Nevertheless ''the domestic business was very strong,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst for Paine Webber. ''Forgetting the distortion, Marlboro's domestic market share at retail was 33.7 percent, up from 30.6 percent in the same quarter last year.'' In other words, one out of every three cigarettes sold in the United States was a Marlboro. **********In addition, premium cigarettes like Marlboro and Virginia Slims accounted for 84.6 percent of the tobacco unit's domestic business, up 2.2 percent since the 1995 third quarter. **********Internationally, tobacco profit margins, which were down in the first quarter, ''exploded in the third quarter,'' Mr. Burry said. Operating profit was up 18.9 percent, to $1.1 billion. **********Although unit shipments were down in Brazil and Mexico, cigarette volumes grew 36 percent in Western Europe and 22 percent in Eastern Europe and the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. ''Philip Morris is the strongest international player in that region,'' Mr. Feldman said, ''and that's a market that sells 660 billion cigarettes, in comparison to 480 billion in the United States.'' **********In the company's Kraft food business, operating profits continued to grow domestically despite a weakness in cheese volume because of price increases that passed along the higher cost of dairy products. **********But the company's Miller Beer unit was weak in the third quarter with operating earnings declining 1.7 percent, to $117 million, because of competition with Anheuser-Busch, analysts said. The company eliminated 500 jobs at Miller during the quarter, in addition to 221 dismissals in Milwaukee earlier in the year. ''Philip Morris is trying to restore the profitability of Miller and it can afford to take the long-term view,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''Miller contributes only 3 percent of the operating income of the company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/world/aide-to-yeltsin-calls-for-delay-in-june-election.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Specter", "pub_date": "1996-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 988, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aide to Yeltsin Calls for Delay In June Election", "print_headline": "Aide to Yeltsin Calls for Delay In June Election", "body_text": " **********Lending disturbing credence to the darkest suspicions of many Russians, President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest confidant called today for a postponement of the presidential election scheduled for June 16. **********\"People must be given time to calmly think about everything and reach a mature conclusion,\" said Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, Mr. Yeltsin's security chief, in a rare interview with the Interfax news agency. \"For this, more time is needed than we have until June 16. There are entire regions of Russia where the civilized expression of people's will is not yet possible.\" **********In saying that the country was not yet ready for the election, General Korzhakov said he was speaking as a private citizen, \"as is my right.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin has so far shown no indication that he agrees with his closest associate. But as a barometer of the tense state of Russia's democracy and because General Korzhakov has unrivaled access to the President, the comments sent shudders through the country. **********\"The party of power is afraid of losing the election because it is not coping with the situation,\" said the Communist candidate for President, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, who has been running ahead of Mr. Yeltsin in most polls and has more than once predicted that Mr. Yeltsin will call the elections off. **********\"I am for the law,\" Mr. Zyuganov added. \"This country must stick to the law.  And the law calls for elections.\" **********A postponement would cause serious trouble for Mr. Yeltsin in his relationships with Western leaders. The oft-stated policy of the United States is that Russia's second presidential election must go forward to prove that the  country is a mature democracy that respects the rights of its citizens to decide their future. **********But with less than six weeks before the vote, some Yeltsin supporters express the firm conviction that if democracy means bringing back Communist rule then maybe Russia is not ready for such freedom. **********It has been an open secret for months that a faction in the Kremlin led by General Korzhakov sees the election as a bad idea -- in part because Mr. Yeltsin may lose and in part because, even if he wins, his health may not be up to carrying out a full, new four-year term. But General Korzhakov rarely speaks in  public and he called for the postponement not only in an interview with Interfax, but also in one with the British newspaper The Observer. **********General Korzhakov has an eerie, almost Rasputin-like power over the President, many people say. He has openly opposed Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and, according to most analysts, he has kept Mr. Yeltsin at war with the secessionist republic of Chechnya long after other advisers have begged the President to bring it to an end. Mr. Yeltsin listens to him more faithfully than he listens to anyone other than his wife, Kremlin insiders say. **********\"He is the scariest guy in the Russian Government,\" a senior Western diplomatic official said tonight, speaking on condition of anonymity.  \"I still  don't think he could stop these elections. But if anyone can, it's Korzhakov.\" **********In a recent interview, Igor B. Malashenko, the head of Russia's Independent Television Network and a leading media adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, suggested that many of the President's supporters wanted the elections stopped. **********\"There are two types of people who want Boris Yeltsin to remain as President,\" Mr. Malashenko said in an interview that he arranged in an attempt to explain why he is now advising a candidate he had often clashed with in the past. \"There are people like me who want him to run and to win. And there are others who want these elections stopped at all cost. Mr. Yeltsin wants the elections because he wants to prove that he can finally defeat Communism. But that doesn't mean the force for the other side is not very, very strong.\" **********The Russian Constitution, which Mr. Yeltsin campaigned for with great vigor in 1993, stipulates that there must be elections by this summer. To postpone them would mean to subvert the Constitution or change it. And with Parliament largely in Communist hands, Mr. Yeltsin could not hope to amend the Constitution to his advantage. So postponing the vote would almost certainly bring about a new governmental crisis. **********Mr. Yeltsin's most liberal opponent, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, met with the President for nearly two hours today and afterward spoke calmly about General Korzhakov's statements. **********\"He said it was his personal point of view and he is entitled to it,\" Mr. Yavlinsky said. \"Of course it is easier and more secure not to have elections. I was not surprised. Mr. Yeltsin is under a great deal of pressure from many different forces. At least I can say that today we discussed not the postponement or cancellation of the election but how each of us can win.\" **********Ironically, General Korzhakov has gone public with his opposition to elections just as Mr. Yeltsin appears more likely to win re-election. Three months ago the Russian President was virtually written off. But as the campaign  has clarified into a battle between Mr. Yeltsin, who, however flawed, is seen as at least something of a reformer, and Mr. Zyuganov, who would bring back Communism, Mr. Yeltsin has improved steadily in the polls. Today he is often seen as running even with Mr. Zyuganov. **********But General Korzhakov is very powerful and all his power comes from Mr. Yeltsin. He knows there would be no place for him in any new Government. **********\"The conclusion that elections must be postponed is not only based on precise data,\" he said in his interview with Interfax, \"but it has been made by me after a great deal of suffering.\" **********He said he was hoping that a \"compromise\" could be reached because \"all sane  people do not want new bloodshed for Russia.\" **********\"The society is splitting,\" he added, \"even families are splitting. Some are  for Yeltsin, some are for Zyuganov. Such division of souls is dangerous.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/business/chief-leaving-ben-jerry-s-as-its-sales-are-lagging.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1996-09-28", "snippet": "Robert Holland, professional manager whom Ben & Jerry's Homemade chose to be its chief executive after unusual and widely publicized search, is leaving abruptly after less than two years in job; he says he had taken company about as far he could; ...", "word_count": 872, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Leaving Ben & Jerry's as Its Sales Are Lagging", "print_headline": "Chief Leaving Ben & Jerry's as Its Sales Are Lagging", "body_text": " **********Following one of the most unusual and widely publicized searches in business history, the professional manager whom Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. chose to be its chief executive is leaving abruptly after less than two years in the job. **********Robert Holland, the former McKinsey & Company management consultant who had been involved in a manufacturing turnaround, said yesterday that he had taken the company about as far as he could. What is needed now is a manager with expertise in consumer products, he said. Mr. Holland's resignation is effective Oct. 31. He will remain a director through next June. **********Mr. Holland is leaving at a time when the  premium ice cream maker, based in South Burlington, Vt., is facing competitive and marketing problems. Sales of its premium, high-fat ice cream have lagged, and it is unclear whether its new line of sorbets will be big enough to bolster profits. He recently forecast that third-quarter earnings would be ''materially below'' the levels of a year earlier because of lower sales and higher dairy costs. In the 1995 third quarter, the company earned $2.5 million, or 35 cents a share, on sales of $45.4 million. **********Yesterday, the company's class A shares closed at $12.75, down 50 cents in Nasdaq trading. The stock was downgraded by analysts recently as Ben & Jerry's woes have continued. In the last year, the stock has traded as high as $20 a share. **********Mr. Holland said in an interview yesterday that while the company now requires expertise that he lacks, he was the right person when he joined the company in February 1995. **********''I think I brought a level of professionalism and an inclination for making fact-based decisions as opposed to entrepreneurial decisions and a discipline in management processes,'' he said, noting that his lack of food industry experience was an asset at first. ''I don't think those were the needs at the time. If we didn't get the operations fixed there wouldn't be anything to sell. They are fixed.'' **********Mr. Holland also said in a joint statement announcing his departure that it was not easy to follow the company's founders. ''When you couple the marketplace challenges with the predictably tough demands associated with succeeding founders, the need for accelerated succession is clear,'' he said. **********When Mr. Holland took over, the company's new plant in St. Albans, Vt., suffered from computer glitches that he fixed by boldly writing off the high-tech equipment and replacing it with reliable gear. ''We went from a situation of selling more than we had capacity to produce and losing money, to where we were making money and we have more capacity than we do sales. I think that is a heck of a lot better.'' **********Mr. Holland also gets credit for speeding production of the sorbet line. He realized when he arrived that the company was trailing competitors and forced the introduction of the sorbets to market ahead of schedule. In addition, the company expanded into Europe under Mr. Holland. **********''Bob arrived just when we needed him to help straighten our our operations, get our new plant up and running, start our international business and launch our new sorbet line,'' Ben Cohen, chairman and co-founder, said in a statement. **********The 56-year-old Mr. Holland had been chairman of Gilreath Manufacturing Inc. in Howell, Mich., and was involved in the turnaround of the company, which makes plastic injection molds. At the time he was chosen for the Ben & Jerry's job, he was running an investment company from his home in White Plains. **********He was tapped to head Ben & Jerry's after more than 20,000 people entered the company's ''Yo! I'm your C.E.O. contest'' in which anyone could submit a 100-word essay explaining why they should get the job. Mr. Holland, however, was recommended by an executive search firm and came on board after the company's first annual loss, which was $1.8 million in 1994. **********''Bob was perfectly in his element on the turnaround side; he knew exactly what to do to get a plant in shape and bring cost down to get the operations running more effectively, which the company sorely needed at the time,'' said Jean-Michael Valette, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. ''At the same time, I think there was a second challenge, which was to invigorate the brand and jump-starting sales growth. I think in that respect that wasn't Bob's strength. If anything he himself probably felt some frustration in not being able to be more effective.'' **********Edward Froelich, a food stock analyst with Pershing Research, a division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette,  added, ''My take on it is that he wasn't the right person for the job, from what the company says it wants, and they came to an agreement that he did what he could do and now it is time to get somebody else in there.'' **********With sales slowing and other marketing problems mutual fund companies including Putnam Management and T. Rowe Price have unloaded shares in the company. **********Wall Street's reaction to the company's performance seems to be a sore spot with Mr. Holland. ''Based on one quarter's performance, analysts downgraded the stock, which I don't understand,'' he said, noting that he thought the reaction was premature. ''I may not have been performing at the speed the market had been expecting.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/news/a-clamor-to-return-nazi-booty-to-holocaust-victims.html": {"writer_name": "Barry James", "pub_date": "1996-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Clamor to Return Nazi Booty to Holocaust Victims", "print_headline": "A Clamor to Return Nazi Booty to Holocaust Victims", "body_text": " **********The revelation in Britain that Switzerland may have held onto billions of dollars worth of German gold after World War II provided fresh ammunition Wednesday for organizations still seeking compensation for victims of the Nazi Holocaust and their heirs. **********The victors received only about one-eighth of the Nazi gold stashed in Swiss banks after the war, according to a new report by the British Foreign Office. **********When the Allies sought the German gold, a Swiss official let slip the amount of the Nazi deposits: $500 million, or more than $6 billion in modern terms, the report said. **********But the Swiss refused to hand over the booty, and the Allies had to be content with a settlement of only 250 million Swiss francs, or less than $60 million at the time.

The union will try to resolve the industry's toughest problems with Ford and then demand that the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation accept the same terms almost immediately, they said. **********This strategy represents an abrupt change from the union's approach in talks during the last several decades. Since the early 1950's, the union has recessed talks with two of the auto makers as soon as it has picked a lead company. Only after reaching a deal with the first company has it then tried to persuade the other auto makers to accept the same terms. **********The decision to concentrate on Ford reduces the likelihood that a national strike will disrupt the economy or the Presidential campaign this autumn. The auto workers' union has excellent relations with Ford, and Ford executives have a history of devising innovative solutions to intractable labor disputes. **********The toughest issue this year is whether the union can win any new restrictions on the auto makers' ability to buy more parts from low-cost outside vendors that are seldom unionized. **********Ford already buys much more than half its parts from outside suppliers and needs few concessions from the union on this issue. G.M. has particularly opposed any such restrictions, because it produces the highest proportion of parts in-house. G.M. is also trying to sell auto-parts factories and lower its costs by purchasing more of these parts elsewhere. **********G.M. or Chrysler could resist any deal struck by Ford, which Ford is likely to structure to suit its own needs. But G.M. and Chrysler have very low inventories of unsold cars and trucks, and their executives have said in recent weeks that they do not want a strike. **********Ford was also the lead company in the last set of negotiations in 1993, drafting a deal that lengthened to three years the period during which newly hired workers can be paid on a lower scale. **********That arrangement has helped both Ford and Chrysler, which have been actively hiring workers since 1993, but not G.M., which has only just hired several thousand workers earlier this year and none for many years before that. **********The union declined to comment on its moves today. A spokesman for Ford, Jon F. Harmon, said, ''Our team is working on the assumption that Ford will continue to be involved actively in whatever transpires over the next two weeks, and that has been our preference all along.'' He declined to elaborate. **********Like Ford, G.M. and Chrysler had sought to be chosen as the lead company in negotiations, the better to control the scope of the contract. **********At G.M., Charles C. Licari, a spokesman, was terse when asked about the status of the talks. ''Bargaining is continuing here at General Motors, he said. ''We had subcommittee meetings today.'' Chrysler officials also said they looked forward to further negotiations. **********Stephen P. Yokich, the U.A.W. president, announced his decision at a meeting this afternoon of the top negotiators from both Ford and the union, people close to the talks said. Mr. Yokich went to Ford after giving a pep talk to union negotiators at Chrysler's headquarters in which he encouraged the bargainers to keep trying to settle outstanding issues even though Chrysler was not the focus of negotiations. **********For reasons that are unclear, Mr. Yokich did not make a similar visit to G.M., people close to the union said. The headquarters of G.M. and the union are several miles apart in the city of Detroit, while Chrysler's headquarters are in Auburn Hills, Mich., a remote suburb about 30 miles to the north. **********The union's board decided on Aug. 26 that Chrysler would not be the lead company, but that talks should continue at G.M. and Ford. That decision was made partly in the hope that G.M. would make a more generous contract offer, something that appears not to have happened, people close to the union said. **********Before the union's decision was known, Scott F. Merlis, an independent analyst in Westport, Conn., said it was hard for G.M. to meet the U.A.W. demands. ''They can only make so many concessions because they have a surplus of labor,'' he said. **********Ernest Lofton, the union vice president in charge of negotiations with Ford, said on Monday that the union needed to go to Ford because it was more likely than G.M. to figure out a way to preserve jobs.

Getting rid of the hapless investments isn't as much of a losing proposition as it used to be. **********Of course, many limited partnerships are still worth much less than what investors paid for them in the days before scandal put them in the headlines and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 shrank their tax advantages. But recently, the booming stock market has driven up the value of these partnerships. Add in the rebounding real-estate sector -- more than half of these partnerships are in real estate -- and resale values are better than anything seen in the last few years. **********In December, the partnership-resale market got another kick when the Internal Revenue Service decided to delay for 10 years a plan that would have subjected limited partnerships bought before that month to new taxes. That decision \"did clear the air that's been hanging over\" partnerships, said James Frith, president of the Chicago Partnership Board, one of the 18 firms nationwide that trade limited partnerships on the secondary market. **********A result of all this is that over the last few years, resale prices of some limited partnerships have doubled or tripled. **********Consider the recent prices for Balcor Equity Pensions Investors II, a real-estate limited partnership. Ross Bowler, president of Second Market Capital Services in Madison, Wis., one of the 18 specialty firms, said the tax-free units of the partnership were selling for $68 each at the end of 1993. By the end of 1994, the price had risen to $73 and, at the end of last year, they were  $89. **********Because of the partnerships' illiquidity and other characteristics, aggregate price levels for the resale market are difficult to calculate. But there are many stories like Mr. Bowler's, as well as plenty of other evidence of reviving  prices. **********At the Chicago Partnership Board, more and more partnership sellers today are getting the limit price -- the minimum acceptable -- they place on their orders, Mr. Frith said. He also estimated that sellers now received in excess of their limit price for more than 60 percent of executed partnership transactions, and that some investors were getting as much as 15 percent more. **********Tender offers for limited partnerships, which were rare two years ago, greatly increased in 1995. They often come from the general partners of a partnership or other professional investors. **********But higher prices are not necessarily a reason to sell right now, even for long-suffering investors in the partnerships. Waiting may mean even better prices. Many experts are still bullish on real estate, for example; that bodes well for the future of these investments. Also, the growth in tender offers means the smart money expects prices to continue to rise. **********Investors in older partnerships, those near liquidation, may have an added reason not to sell too quickly. Because of relative risk and other factors, said Dav Mosby, a managing director at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg,  Fla., secondary-market prices will always be less than those for a liquidation. **********But banking on a further run-up is risky, and some investors may need to sell now. Financial experts have some tips. **********First, the thinness of the partnership-resale market -- 1995 sales were $198  million -- means prevailing prices can vary widely from place to place. And, like other tender offers, partnerships offers can carry a big premium. Recently, these deals have been offering prices that are on average more than twice those  the partnership units carry in the secondary market, said Keith Allaire, senior  partner at Robert A. Stanger & Company in Shrewsbury, N.J., which tracks limited partnerships. **********These variations make comparison shopping a must. Investors should seek and compare prices from as many sources as possible: the partnership's general partner, some of the 18 specialty partnership firms and general brokerage firms  that maintain partnership-resale desks. **********With the help of their broker or financial adviser, some investors can also use rules of thumb to figure what a reasonable price might be for their partnership units. Consider a real-estate partnership, said Laura Lacey, president of the Nationwide Partnership Marketplace, a specialty firm in Bel Marin Keys, Calif. Investors should compare the partnership's distribution rate  -- a periodic payout roughly comparable to a bond's yield -- and figure a price  for which that rate would represent a payment comparable to that of similar partnerships.  Real-estate partnerships have payouts of about 10 to 15 percent,  Ms. Lacey said. Thus, a price that would put the distribution rate in that ball  park seems reasonable. **********More generally, investors can get an idea of what a good price is from firms  like the Chicago Partnership, whose data base carries information on 2,500 partnerships (800 272-6272). The data include current bids, 52-week highs and lows and valuations.  For $5 a minute, investors can call Stanger at (900) 786-9600 to obtain pricing data as well as information about firms that recently traded a particular partnership. **********Investors can also go on line to find partnership information. Last week, the Chicago Partnership Board unveiled a World Wide Web site that carries price and  other data for roughly 1,000 of the largest partnerships (http://www.cpboard.com). **********What about investors who want to buy these investments? The rising prices can be tempting. And the distribution rates can be fairly high even though they have fallen off recently. Besides the 10 to 15 percent payouts of real-estate partnerships, oil-and-gas partnerships pay 15 to 30 percent, and partnerships that lease equipment disburse 25 to 50 percent. **********But investors must also understand exactly what they're getting in these complex investments. Moreover, they must be willing to take on investments whose risks became all too plain recently, and realize that the thin secondary market  may make resale difficult. Given all these risks, many experts recommend that investors put no more than 10 percent of their assets in limited partnerships."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/30/business/international-business-samsung-tells-of-auto-plans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Samsung Tells Of Auto Plans", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Samsung Tells Of Auto Plans", "body_text": " **********Samsung Group announced a $13 billion plan today to turn its fledgling automobile subsidiary into one of the world's top 10 car makers by 2010. **********Samsung Motors Inc. said it planned to introduce its first model in Korea and other markets by 1998.

And in the dormitories, the talk among students was of revolution and of radical plots to shake off colonial and imperial masters. **********''We were idealists,'' said Valery A. Belov, a Russian law professor who graduated from the university in 1973. ''We thought we could change the world.'' **********Created by the Soviet Communist Party in 1960, Patrice Lumumba University had as its main mission to recruit and train students from developing countries. It was hoped that those young men and women, who studied free of charge, might ultimately carry the Communist revolution across the third world. The school was renamed for Mr. Lumumba, the first Prime Minister of Zaire, after he was killed during a coup backed by the United States in 1961. **********But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so did much of the university's funding. Scholarships dried up, and poor foreign students stopped coming. **********Today the university, which once educated Nicaraguan guerrillas, Sri Lankan revolutionaries and the terrorist known as Carlos, now courts those who can pay their own way. Many are the wealthy sons and daughters of the very third-world capitalists the Soviets once dreamed of overthrowing. **********''Yeah, they all used to be Communists here and some of the teachers still are,'' said Olawale Bewaji, a 21-year-old engineering student from Lagos, Nigeria, who listens to American rap music in his spare time. **********Mr. Bewaji, the son of a Nigerian doctor, says he is more interested in democracy than Communism. ''I just tell them, 'You're old-fashioned,' '' he said. **********Five years after the collapse of the Communist ideology that created it, Patrice Lumumba University -- now renamed the Russian People's Friendship University -- is still struggling to establish a new identity in a democratic Russia. **********Foreigners, who once dominated the university with 65 percent of the enrollment of 7,000, now make up only 30 percent of the student body. Most of its students are Russian now, many of them young people who could not gain entrance into more prestigious universities. **********The third-world students who do walk the campus these days carry beepers, wear Levis and rent movies for VCR's they brought from home. Most dream about making money, not revolution. **********Confronted with the new reality, the administration added business courses, tossed out Communist texts and dropped classes like Marxist Philosophy. **********It is only natural then that business administration is one of the university's most popular courses. The once-required staple, ''History of the Communist Party,'' is now history itself. **********Even the remaining Communist students here arrive with capitalist sensibilities. **********''When I got to the dormitory there was nothing but a bed in the room -- and an uncomfortable bed at that,'' complained Xuan Yizeng, 23, an economics major from Beijing. ''I had to buy a television and a radio myself. Can you believe that?'' **********The university still attracts foreign students because its diplomas still carry prestige in parts of the third world and because its tuition is only $2,000 a year -- a bargain when compared with some Western institutions. **********But the changes sadden some old timers, who miss the heated political discussions at the university. **********''Now there are just a few dances, that's it,'' said Professor Belov, who  heads the university's graduate association. **********''The students study business and they think about making money,'' he said. ''In the old days, we thought about the struggle. Now, they study capitalist ideas and forget they're in the birth place of socialism.'' **********The welcome that the young foreigners once received from Russians, who viewed the students as allies in the battle against capitalism, is also strained. **********''The Soviet hope was that these students would go back and become spokesmen for the Russian view of the world,'' said Elizabeth K. Valkenier, an American who is a resident scholar at Columbia University's Harriman Institute of Russian Studies. ''Together, they were going to strangle the West.'' **********Now, foreign students say, they encounter hostility and racism on the streets from police officers and average citizens. Several years ago, an African student was killed by the police during a confrontation here with black students who complained that the police harassed them. **********And students say they are still tormented by police officers, who stop them, demand to see their visas and then insist on a bribe before letting them go. **********''The first Russian word I learned was 'fine,' ' said Mr. Xuan, which he said was the polite word that the police often use when demanding money. **********''On the metro, the people, they yell, 'Go home!' '' he said. **********Such hostility surprised Osahon Egho, an 18-year-old law student from Nigeria. Her father, now an engineer, attended the university as a young man. He still raves about the hearty welcome he received here. **********''Foreigners, we were like kings, that's what my father tells me,'' Ms. Egho said. ''But now we're second-class citizens.'' **********She says that she and her friends would have preferred to study in the West. But since Nigerian gangs have been linked to the heroin trade, Nigerians often find it difficult to get student visas, she said. **********''America wouldn't let us in,'' Ms. Egho said. ''London wouldn't let us in. So we came here. I think I regret it.'' **********But even students who complain about crumbling dormitories and Communist professors still commend the university's academic rigor. **********And the school still takes pride in its history, despite the changed environment. In a glass case, in the Patrice Lumumba Museum, for instance, hangs a metal etching bestowed by Mr. Arafat that depicts a wished-for Palestine. **********It is surrounded by gifts from students and politicians from around the world: elephant tusks from Sudan, a glittering dagger from Yemen, an Aztec calendar from Mexico. **********For while few of the university's students set off Communist revolutions, many have become respected political and scientific leaders in their countries. They include doctors in Japan, economists in Chile, politicians in Mexico and engineers in Nigeria. **********And this year, for the first time since 1992, the Government is once again offering scholarships to foreign students. **********Even without the ideological glue that once brought people together, the school still hopes to unite foreign students and to produce well-trained professionals who will play significant roles in their countries, Professor Belov said. **********''Everything has changed,'' he said, ''but what remains is the idea of the friendship among peoples.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/24/business/company-news-horizon-mental-health-buys-day-treatment-centers.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;HORIZON MENTAL HEALTH BUYS DAY TREATMENT CENTERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;HORIZON MENTAL HEALTH BUYS DAY TREATMENT CENTERS", "body_text": " **********Horizon Mental Health Management Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy American Day Treatment Centers Inc. for $16.5 million in a stock swap.

In just the first five years of the 1990's, they lost $13 billion, more than all the profits accumulated since the Wright Brothers made their historic flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903. **********The explanation can be summarized in one word: overexpansion. From the 1950's on, airlines repeatedly responded to rapid traffic growth by ordering fleets of new aircraft. Like steroids, the planes were intended to make them bigger and stronger. But also like steroids, they weakened the airlines' long-term health; by the time the aircraft were delivered, traffic growth had typically trailed off, leaving too many planes chasing too few passengers. **********The industry didn't seem able to learn from its mistakes, in part because it was dominated by such big egos. Perhaps no executive embodied the freewheeling style of the 1980's like Frank Lorenzo. After starting with the small Texas International Airlines, he swallowed Continental, Eastern, People Express and Frontier, at one point presiding over the world's largest airline company. But even after his empire ran into trouble, with Eastern in bankruptcy, Mr. Lorenzo plowed ahead with a $2.8 billion order for 100 planes. **********Now, however, the big airlines seem to be mending their ways. Stung by their recent disastrous run and taken over in many cases by a new crop of chief executives more in tune with the sober-minded 1990's, they are turning the old strategy practically on its head. By slashing the huge debt burdens and reining in the urge to expand, these executives are trying to smooth out the wild swings of the industry's boom-and-bust cycles. **********''It's not a testosterone-driven industry any longer,'' said Gordon Bethune, chairman of Continental Airlines. ''Success is making money, not in the size of the airline.'' **********And the airlines are making some money. Analysts are projecting a profit margin for the entire industry of about 4 percent for 1996 -- paltry by the standards of most consumer businesses, perhaps, but the industry's best performance since it registered a record 5.2 percent margin in 1978. And in a sign of success in controlling their capacity, airlines are expected to fill an average of 70 percent of their seats this year, the fullest their planes have been since World War II. **********All this, of course, does not necessarily mean that investors should rush out and load up on airline stocks. The industry is volatile, after all, and has defied predictability time and again. Airline stocks have also historically underperformed the broad market averages. And even as the industry returns to profitability, most airline stocks are slumping, depressed by a surge in the cost of jet fuel and disappointment that the growth in earnings is leveling off. **********Some investors may also wonder whether the new-found humility of airline executives will last, and whether the mistakes of the past will be repeated. More seats are being added, although far more slowly than during previous periods when the economy was healthy. **********''The discipline is there,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline industry analyst at Paine Webber. ''But it's being tested.'' **********For now, though, the changes in the industry are real, and Mr. Bethune of Continental says they are likely to endure. ''If five guys ahead of you burned their finger in the candle, why would you put your finger in there?'' he asked. **********In a broad sense, the airlines have lagged behind many other industries that years ago set out to reinvent themselves -- autos and steel to cope with foreign competitors, telephone companies to deal with deregulation, or banks to overcome their lending excesses. But the airlines have learned more slowly, in part because they staked so much on a strategy that seemed to make sense at the time. **********In years past, the nation's skies were viewed as a battleground, and bigger airlines operated on the premise that it was possible to drive their weaker rivals out of business and dominate the industry. Investors, buying into the theory, applauded aggressive moves to build up arsenals of new aircraft. **********In 1989, after Robert L. Crandall, chairman of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, placed a huge $7 billion order for new aircraft, AMR's stock price jumped sharply. Mr. Crandall also won flattering press coverage for this and other moves, with headlines like, ''American Takes On the World'' on the cover of Fortune in 1990. **********Many others followed his lead, but met with the same mixed results as Mr. Crandall, whose payoff for spending $20 billion to expand in the 1980's was a modest gain in domestic market share and underwhelming profits. **********Today, however, airlines have realized that the best offense is a good defense. Airline executives, trying to shake off comparisons to lemmings and kamikaze pilots, have also surprised many industry analysts with their commitment to repairing their battered balance sheets by paying down billions of dollars of debt rather than buying new aircraft to expand their route networks. **********Since the end of 1994, for example, AMR has slashed its debt by $3.5 billion; Northwest Airlines by $1.9 billion and Delta by about $1.4 billion. **********''It's fairly impressive how consistent they've been on that goal,'' said Philip Baggaley, an airline industry analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency. ''Five or 10 years ago, that wasn't on their radar screen of what's important.'' **********As a result, projections for aircraft deliveries over the next several years are sharply lower than in the early 1990's. The Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group, said that at the end of 1990, United States airlines had orders or options to buy 2,748 aircraft. At the end of June 1996, that figure stood at 1,111. And American Airlines, the big spender of the 1980's, currently has no orders or options. **********Although some airlines like United and Continental have placed orders since June, they are stressing that those planes are to replace older models and those that do not meet tougher Federal noise standards that go into effect in 2000. **********IN another manifestation of their new-found conservatism, many airlines have retreated to their so-called fortress hubs, where they can dominate the local market. By controlling most flights in and out of a big city, they can charge a premium for fares and fight any incursions from competitors by flooding contested routes with frequent flights. **********Several years ago, Northwest decided to drop National Airport outside Washington as one of its hubs after the airline determined that it was losing $25 million a year there. It shifted some of those resources to strengthen its hubs in Detroit, where its share of the local traffic has risen to more than 78 percent, and in Minneapolis, where its market share has grown to more than 84 percent. American dropped Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; San Jose, Calif., and Nashville in recent years from its network of hub airports, but built up service in Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth. **********And Continental decided it could no longer compete with United for the Denver market and pulled out after prolonged losses that reached millions of dollars a month. Continental also killed its Continental Lite operation in 1995 after the experiment to introduce no-frills service to a number of Eastern cities racked up losses of more than $300 million. **********As airlines have pulled back from their secondary hubs, they have turned increasingly to other airlines for marketing alliances as a way to expand their route networks, rather than trying to do it all themselves. Just this week, Continental and Delta announced that they would form such a partnership with Air France. American has also proposed a close collaboration with British Airways. **********To hear airline executives tell it, traditional thinking about airline strategy is going the way of full meals in coach class. **********''In our daily, weekly and monthly meetings, we don't talk about market share,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman of United Airlines' parent, the UAL Corporation, and one of several top executives who joined the airlines in recent years from other industries. ''We first want to be sure that we are not losing money on the routes we fly, and only after meeting that test will we look at possibly buying planes.'' **********And John H. Dasburg, chief executive of Northwest Airlines, who joined the airline in 1990 after working for a decade at the Marriott Corporation, said that if Northwest ended up with excess cash, ''it would be returned to the shareholders rather than used to fund unprofitable growth.'' **********Investors, too, have helped drive home the message that tight capacity and a stable industry are laudable goals. When United and American said a year ago that they were each in talks about possibly acquiring USAir, both their stocks sagged. While overall industry capacity might have remained the same, many industry analysts said that such an acquisition would have hurt their credit ratings and balance sheets. **********And when United Airlines ordered more than $3 billion of new aircraft in August, the stock of its parent dropped on the news, even though United stressed at every opportunity that it intended to use the new aircraft to replace old planes, not to add new routes. **********It isn't just the industry's new approach that is driving up profits, of course. The economy has pumped up demand for air travel. In addition, the Federal Government let the 10 percent excise tax on fares lapse for almost eight months this year, enabling the airlines to cut prices, thereby increasing demand and revenue. **********The airlines have also cut costs. They ended their flat 10 percent commissions to travel agents, capping the payments at $50 for round-trip domestic tickets. (The industry recently paid $87 million to settle a lawsuit brought by travel agents, but managed to keep the ceiling.) Airlines are also heavily marketing electronic ticketing, which gives travelers a confirmation number rather than a ticket and saves processing costs. **********Moreover, all big airlines now have computer software to help them maximize revenues. On each flight, there are typically a dozen categories of fares, including those for leisure and business travelers, as well as frequent fliers, and software has been available for years to help airlines analyze historical travel patterns on individual routes and determine how many seats to sell at each fare level. In recent years, Trans World Airlines, USAir, Continental and America West installed such software, thereby leveling the playing field with American and other airlines that already had the technology. **********T.W.A. said it bought such a system last December so it could analyze better the 3.6 million fares it sets for its 300,000 flights a year. During the winter months from February to April, the airline said, the software helped to raise revenues by more than $1.5 million on just one route between its St. Louis hub and a warmer destination. **********''The technology lets you squeeze a little more juice from the orange,'' said Marilyn Hoppe, senior vice president of marketing for T.W.A. **********Passengers are getting squeezed in the process, and in more ways than one. American Express, for example, said the price of the average domestic one-way ticket sold by its travel agents rose 27 percent -- from $216 to $274 -- from December 1994 to last month. **********And as any frequent flier knows, more planes have been packed. **********''It's sardined in there,'' says Douglas T. Pearce, a businessman in Raleigh, N.C. Mr. Pearce says his last 20 flights were all more than 90 percent full. To cope with the crowding, he has learned to always lean in from aisle seats to avoid getting hit with all the large bags travelers lug on board. **********''If the airlines are not making money now,'' he said, ''they're never going to make it.'' **********Low fares have not disappeared, however. Southwest Airlines continues to expand, sharply reducing fares in popular travel markets like Florida. Airlines like American, Northwest, Continental and USAir are also routinely offering deep discounts through the Internet for weekend travel. Traditional fare sales still make regular appearances. **********BUT some of the lower-cost airlines -- whose growth has been cheered in recent years by travelers and the Transportation Department -- are having difficulty, in part because the Valujet crash on May 11 in the Florida Everglades made many travelers wary of flying on them. That was the main reason Nations Air cited for halting scheduled service a few weeks after the crash. And Kiwi International Air Lines suspended service on Tuesday, collapsing under the weight of a number of problems. **********Investors in new airlines also appear to have grown skittish. The Transportation Department said that it received seven applications in the first five months of the year to start scheduled jet airlines. Since the Valujet crash, it has received only one. **********Of course, the woes of smaller competitors can only help the bottom line of the big established carriers. And, given some other recent market trends, it is help they can use. The most disturbing development is the fuel-cost increase of more than $400 million in the third quarter, from the comparable period last year. That huge expense, combined with other factors including seasonal buying patterns, has depressed airline stocks in recent months. The Standard & Poor's index of airline stocks has fallen 21 percent since late May, for example, while the S.& P. 500 index has gone up about 5 percent. **********Politicians also regularly single out the industry for additional taxes. When President Clinton proposed tax credits for college aid in June, for example, he said one way to help finance the program would be to raise the international airline departure tax by $10, to $16 a passenger. And security improvements at airports after the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 in July have added to the industry's costs. **********The industry remains vulnerable to disruptive consolidations. USAir may go searching for a buyer again, possibly setting off a round of consolidation, which history suggests would create more problems than it would solve. **********ALSO, as airlines grow more profitable, unions typically want to be rewarded. Unions at United and Northwest that own large blocks of company stock are now negotiating for raises. ''We definitely think we deserve a piece of the pie,'' said Paul Omodt, a spokesman for the division of the Air Line Pilots Association that represents Northwest pilots. ''And we think Northwest can afford to pay us more.'' **********Moreover, some analysts wonder whether the industry's new ways will last. They fear that as airline companies' cash hoards grow, the temptation to rush out and buy more planes will be too great, and the industry will binge again on steroids. **********''Over the span of human events, people haven't learned very much,'' said James S.

The U.S. Healthcare network -- it is both far larger and more successful, with about four times as many managed care patients  as Aetna in New York State, for example -- is expected to provide the imprint for how the two companies march forward together. **********\"It makes U.S. Healthcare even more of what they were -- a strong competitor  in the market,\" said Jim Tallon, president of United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit  philanthropic and medical research organization based in New York City. **********In general, physicians and people who now get their medical coverage from Aetna are the two groups who will feel the most change from the combined entity, according to health care providers, hospital officials and benefits consultants. **********Many physicians, in particular, have bridled under U.S. Healthcare, which tightly controls costs and monitors the medical decision-making among the providers participating in its network, and will probably not applaud the company's vastly strengthened position. Patients covered by Aetna's traditional  health insurance plans are expected, for better or worse, to feel new pressures  to join health maintenance organizations. **********\"From a customer point of view, you'd be hard pressed to say who will lose -- there will be more stable costs, and quality should be the same or better,\" said Bob Eicher, a principal at Foster Higgins, a New York-based benefits consulting  firm. \"For physicians it's going to get a little tougher. A lot of physicians have just refused to deal with U.S. Healthcare, and now there will be one less choice.\" **********But the New York region will also present vast new markets into which Aetna,  as big as it is, has barely entered in the past. **********In New York City, for example, Aetna has almost no presence among managed care patients covered under Medicaid, with only 1,519 patients last month, according to figures from the New York State Department of Health. By contrast,  U.S. Healthcare had 31,327 Medicaid patients in New York City last month. **********A spokesman for Aetna, Walter J. Cherniak, said that expanding into the vast  New York metropolitan region, and on the East Coast in general, was in fact a key issue in the merger. \"We see New York and in general the Northeast as a real growth market,\" Mr. Cherniak said. \"One of the reasons we made this move is to grow into those areas.\" **********Hospitals that have been trying to establish independent managed care networks to compete with companies like U.S. Healthcare will face a competitor with vast resources. **********\"You have a fairly large and aggressive managed care company being bought up  by an extremely well-financed insurance company,\" said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. Mr. Raske said that his goal of seeing managed care networks run through the region's hospital systems would be vastly more difficult now, facing off against a deep-pocketed company like Aetna. **********Mr. Cherniak said that Aetna would continue to sell regular health insurance  plans, but that the future belonged to managed care, and in New York, the name-brand associations built by U.S. Healthcare with its aggressive marketing were invaluable. Even though Aetna will own the new entity, the Aetna Health Plans name under which the company has done business will be retired and the U.S. Healthcare name will live on, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/14/business/hemophiliacs-with-hiv-reject-an-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hemophiliacs With H.I.V.

Its original estimate last month had been 2.2 percent. Citing subsequent reports about the economy's performance at the end of the quarter -- particularly a larger-than-expected trade deficit in September -- many economists had expected the revised growth figure to be as low as 1.7 percent. **********The Commerce Department also reported today that orders for durable goods rose one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Most analysts had been expecting a decline after September's robust increase in orders of 4.6 percent. The slight rise provided tentative evidence that the economy remained on solid footing early in the fourth quarter. **********''Orders are still exhibiting enough forward momentum to keep the manufacturing sector gainfully employed at least into early 1997,'' said Kenneth Mayland, the chief economist at Keycorp in Cleveland. **********Other indicators issued today showed no signs of any pressures that could push the economy either to stall or overheat. **********The number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment last week held steady, compared with the previous week, at 342,000. The Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising fell 2 points, to 82, suggesting a slight easing of demand for workers at a time when unemployment, at 5.2 percent, remains near a seven-year low. **********A survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area found a slight acceleration in business activity this month in that region, while a similar survey in the New York area found a somewhat stronger pickup. **********''The data is consistent with a slowdown in the third quarter, but it doesn't look like there's any sign of cumulative weakness or a process that's headed toward a recession,'' said John E. Silvia, the chief economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago. **********Since it became apparent late in the summer that the economy was slowing substantially from its 4.7 percent growth rate in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve and the financial markets have become considerably less worried about an outbreak of inflation, despite the continued low unemployment rate. **********Analysts said the balance enjoyed by the economy should allow the Federal Reserve to keep short-term interest rates unchanged well into next year. The Fed, which next meets to consider monetary policy on Dec. 17, has held rates steady since January, betting successfully that a brief surge in growth last spring would give way to the current stable environment. **********The Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product contained further evidence that inflation remained contained. The two main price indexes used by the Government to adjust for inflation remained unchanged from last month's initial estimate and in both cases were below the second-quarter rate.

The implicit price deflator for the third quarter stood at 1.6 percent, down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter. **********The downward revision in the growth estimate was largely a result of a decline from the previously projected level of exports and a drop of $6.8 billion from the previous estimate of business inventories, the department said. **********The slight increase in durable goods orders was driven by a 17.3 percent surge in orders for electronics and other electrical equipment. That rise more than offset an expected drop of 7.9 percent in orders for transportation equipment, including aircraft. Aircraft orders, which tend to bounce sharply up and down on a month-to-month basis, had been particularly strong in September. **********The Commerce Department also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell 2.6 percent in the third quarter, the weakest showing since a 5.8 percent drop in the first quarter of 1994.

Walter Thompson Europe unit of the J. Walter Thompson Company, one of the two worldwide agency networks owned by WPP, has been named the lead Mazda agency in Europe. Thompson Europe, based in London, will oversee marketing communications for Mazda Motor Europe with a goal of creating what the agency described as ''a single and unified brand image'' throughout the Continent. **********In addition to those new responsibilities, scheduled to begin with a pan-European campaign in the spring, Thompson Europe has been awarded the Mazda account in Germany, effective immediately. That account had been handled for a year by Rempen & Partner in Dusseldorf, part of the Campus agency network owned by Havas Advertising. Mazda billings in Germany, the auto maker's largest European market, were estimated at $32 million to $36 million; total billings in Europe were estimated at more than $100 million. **********The assignments, announced Friday, underscore just how small the world is becoming for giant marketers and agencies alike as both continue to expand internationally. **********WPP has been laboring mightily to land Mazda accounts since April, when a big client, the Ford Motor Company, took effective control of Mazda by raising its ownership stake and later installing a former Ford executive as president. Ford's moves were prompted by two years of heavy losses at Mazda as the Japanese auto maker suffered sales slumps in markets that included the United States. **********The estimated $600 million that Mazda spends annually on advertising around the world has been divided among various agencies. That has prompted WPP to focus efforts on wooing Mazda to work with Thompson and its other agency network, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. Both handle Ford car and truck accounts; Ogilvy also creates campaigns for Jaguar Cars, which Ford owns. **********The Mazda assignments for Thompson are the first tangible sign that Mazda is interested in having Ford's worldwide agencies handle its advertising, too. **********''We are really thrilled about this new relationship,'' Michael Madel, president and chief executive at Thompson Europe, said in a telephone interview, ''because to work with a renowned car company has been very much one of our goals.'' **********While Ford and Mazda compete in segments of the automotive market, Ogilvy handles Ford in most European markets. That would free Thompson to handle Mazda there. **********Conversely, in markets like North America where Thompson handles Ford, Ogilvy could work for Mazda. The American Mazda account, with billings estimated at $240 million, has been handled since 1970 by Foote, Cone & Belding, a unit of True North Communications that also works for Mazda in Canada. **********For the time being, Mazda's European accounts outside Germany will remain at agencies like Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury in Britain and Young & Rubicam Inc. in the Netherlands. That is because Mazda's advertising decisions in those markets are made by independent distributors; in Germany, Mazda owns 100 percent of its distributor. **********''We'll see how the local distributors ultimately decide on agency relationships,'' said Mr. Madel, who was promoted last month to his post at Thompson Europe from a similar post at Thompson Germany. **********Asked about the implications of the Mazda Motor Europe decision for North America, he replied that ''it shouldn't cause any doubts whatsoever'' about the relationship between Mazda and Foote, Cone. **********The trade publication Advertising Age reported last week that Ford had hired Thompson USA in New York to study Mazda's American marketing. Calls to Thompson USA were referred to Dan Bedore, a spokesman for Ford in Dearborn, Mich., who said, ''We don't have any comment on internal matters.'' **********Victor Pytko, a spokesman for Mazda Motor of America, which is based in Irvine, Calif., said Friday: ''Mazda is not going to switch its ad agency in the United States. It's still Foote, Cone & Belding and that's not going to change.'' **********Foote, Cone handles the American Mazda account from an office in Santa Ana, Calif. The agency introduced Mazda models in this country with advertising that initially promoted the marque's rotary engines. **********Foote, Cone barely avoided a review on the Mazda account last year after sustained sales declines.

There I am with a buzz cut, back in 1968, toying with the notion of becoming a geologist -- or a professional wrestler. **********Outside work versus inside work, rocks versus jocks. Even today, choosing a career is no easy chore. Maybe I should have listened to Ma and enrolled in law school. Plenty of my friends have swapped vocations over the last several years, prodding me to ponder if I made the right move becoming a journalist. **********How to be sure? Apparently, plenty of Americans are stumped by the question. Out to determine their true mission in life, millions of people will take aptitude tests -- tests that measure work interests and skills -- this year. **********Companies are contributing to the growth. With downsizing a fact of corporate life, aptitude testing is increasingly becoming part of employee severance packages. When Reid Bechtle, the chief executive of Computer Learning Centers, a  chain of computer schools based in Fairfax, Va., dismissed several employees three years ago, he suggested that they go to the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation, a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that is a national leader in aptitude testing and research. **********''When we looked at people who weren't working out in the company, it turned out that they were just not good at what they were doing,'' Mr. Bechtle said. ''We send them through the program to find out what career they will find rewarding instead of struggling at one that will do nothing but frustrate them. They won't make the same mistake twice.'' **********To the career-baffled, aptitude testing may seem a godsend. In theory, executives show up at a center, spend a few days taking tests and then walk away with a list of professions most likely to make them happy. The only downsides are the costs -- Johnson O'Connor's three-day battery of tests goes for $480 -- and the potential disappointment over the results. Who wants to spend three days assembling wooden blocks, air-kicking a football and exposing a weak vocabulary just to be told that you're best suited to selling bricks? **********Who indeed? At the suggestion of an editor -- (a not-so-subtle hint, perhaps) -- I enrolled last week at Johnson O'Connor's center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan; the site is among 11 it operates across the country.  The test administrators were aware that I was a reporter and that my experiences would become fodder for an article. The New York Times paid the $480 tuition, as is the newspaper's policy, leaving me to explore the testing experience without obligation. **********My goals were relatively simple: to assess the validity of Johnson O'Connor's method and, maybe, to stumble upon my ideal profession. **********The assignment was not without its risks. My big fear was that I would choke on the vocabulary test. (Should I lie or admit I didn't know the meaning of the word ''tyro''?) **********Plus, while I am a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of South Carolina, I am a habitual test tanker. As a teen-ager, by the time I passed my driving test -- on the eighth try -- the driver's examiner knew both my parents by their first names. On standardized tests, I usually score in the single-digit percentiles, a feat that once prompted a test administrator to call the home office to see if there had been a mistake in the scoring. **********My anxiety lifted a bit on Monday morning, when I arrived at Johnson O'Connor's town house. I had expected an austere room packed with pencils, tables and the burned-rubber aroma of freshly scraped erasers. What I saw instead was a house similar to the Von Trapp family's digs in ''The Sound of Music.'' Every floor was an ornate mixture of stone and polished wood. The dining and music rooms could pass as museum halls. **********The offices, it turned out, had been the home of Edith Shepard Fabbri, the granddaughter of the railroad tycoon William H. Vanderbilt. And between every vocabulary and coordination test over the next two days, I dreamed about owning this house. I wanted nothing more than to usher my journalism school classmates up and down those pristine stairs, pointing out my fireplaces, chandeliers and bathrooms. **********Shallow and competitive I may be, but I still needed to discover the aptitudes that would bring me the wealth and privilege to which I aspire. Rob Panasik, the foundation's director, fetched me from the waiting room for the first assignment of a four-hour day that would include 12 tests measuring everything from short-term memory to motor dexterity. **********We walked up two flights to a small office with dingy carpet (maid's room). Mr. Panasik, a studious-looking man with a degree in management science, sat behind a teacher's wooden desk, a set of flashcards in hand. On each was a picture of a ball with a colored number drawn inside. The task was to identify the numbers, and it turned out to be a breeze: I got all 14 right. But that was a joyless achievement. The test primarily is a requirement for electricians who need to distinguish the color of wires, and in the end it played no part in identifying my ideal profession. **********THE next two tests were a little more interesting. Standing with my back to the wall, I had to use a plate with a hole in the center to find the cross marks of two lines on a board that Mr. Panasik was holding across the room. Once I had the cross marks within the circle, I was supposed to bring the plate close to my face, noting which eye it was in front of. **********It was my right eye -- a common response, according to Mr. Panasik, who offered no immediate rationale for this exercise. **********He scribbled something on a sheet of paper, then asked me to stand in the middle of the room. He would tell me something to do, and I was to mimic the task as fast as I could, sort of like charades: ''Comb your hair. Kick a football. Shoot a rifle. Hit a tennis ball. Pick up a dime. Play Ping-Pong.'' **********Of the 12 activities, I did 11 with my right hand. ''Most athletes can use both sides of their bodies,'' Mr. Panasik said. ''Major League Baseball players, for example, will be able to use their left eyes and the right sides of their bodies. I don't mean to dim your hopes for the major leagues.'' **********My wrestling career bashed, it was time to measure my short-term memory. Mr. Panasik showed me a picture of several household items on a board. I'd have one minute to study it. Then he'd show me the same picture, but with the items rearranged. The more differences I spotted in something like 12 seconds, the higher my score. **********The items -- they ranged in size from a pair of eyeglasses to a small pin -- were often moved or removed from the picture. Once a safety pin was made smaller; on another board, a brown money case was lightened in color. **********''No one gets that one,'' Mr. Panasik said. **********He scribbled some notes to total my score, and I knew that this had been a complete ruin for me. A notorious slob, I never notice how things look. My apartment -- a mix of dirty dishes, soiled clothes and ripped-up magazines -- was so filthy a year ago that a date refused to pass through the front door. **********Mr. Panasik, however, looked oddly pleased. ''You scored exceptionally well on that test, in the top 75th percentile,'' he said. ''It was originally designed to hire good factory inspectors, but other vocations need it, like detectives, claims investigation or scientific research.'' **********And so it went. I used checkers to match the patterns of holes punched in paper. (Fifth percentile, though doctors and architects usually receive high scores here.) I spent several minutes using a small pair of tweezers to fill tiny holes with headless nails. (More landed on the table than in the holes, and I wound up in the 10th percentile.) **********I ended the day with William Sherer, another test administrator. For five minutes, Mr. Sherer said a word, and I blurted out the first thing that came into my mind. Most of these associations were easy -- man, woman -- but a few left me momentarily speechless. **********Fearing that my gaffes had revealed myself as a clown, I waited anxiously for Mr. Sherer to render his verdict. ''You're a social person who likes to work in teams,'' he said, leaving me to muse overnight about how my boss would feel about spending $480 for such conclusions. **********SOMEHOW, I knew my final morning of testing would be decisive. The first hurdle: a 100-word vocabulary test in which I had to select among five possible meanings for a word. Even through the administrators, who generally come from liberal-arts backgrounds, stress that vocabulary is not an aptitude -- and therefore can be improved with study -- it is nonetheless stressed as crucial for success. **********Now you'd think that a reporter for The New York Times would have no trouble with words like rancor, obtuse, acrid and indigent. And you'd be right -- for the most part. But when I encountered gems like tyro, salubrious and effrontery, I waffled. **********This was not going to turn out as I expected. **********Three tests that measured musical pitch, rhythm and memory were so boring that I almost caught a brief snooze. I scored low on each -- no surprise, because I have little interest in music. **********I was nervous about the math tests. On the first, which involved arranging numbers, written on plastic circles, to form mathematical equations, I knew I wasn't fairing particularly well when Mr. Sherer advised me to use both hands. And I was right; my score was in the 30th percentile. **********The second math exercise brought back memories of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a horror in which I tanked twice. On a worksheet was a series of related numbers that stopped short of the final sequence. All I had to do was provide the next number. **********Think this was easy? Try your hand at it: 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, ?. The correct answer is obviously 42 (16 plus 26), but I confess that under the time constraints, I choked. I still finished in the 52d percentile, my third highest score of the day. **********I had no clue at this stage of the testing if a pattern was forming. Was I the lone soul who would pass through these elaborate halls and exit without an ideal profession? **********I figured, though, that one of the final tests  could be my ace in the hole. The test administrator called it ''Ideaphoria,'' and described it as a quiz that measured the ability to toss out ideas quickly. I had six minutes to write as much as possible about a single topic. The more words I wrote, the higher the score. **********I'm a journalist. This is what I do. So no problem, right? **********Wrong. This was the question: ''You've just found out that everyone in the world will soon become speechless. What should you do, and what should everyone else do?'' **********All I could think of was to tape my friends'  voices and head out to the music store to snap up every CD in sight. That explanation took about three paragraphs. The clock was still ticking. I jotted down something about the rest of the world doing sort of the same thing. Finally, the time ran out, as, I feared, had my chance to demonstrate any aptitudes whatsoever. **********With any luck, I had talents at something. Maybe even as a test administrator. Several members of the Johnson O'Connor staff landed their jobs by answering newspaper ads, coming in to take the tests, and scoring well on the vocabulary and clerical portions, Mr. Panasik said. Afterward, they received several months' training on how to give a test and properly summarize the results. **********I returned to the foundation on Tuesday afternoon to learn how I had done. Should I have been a lawyer, or had $480 merely reaffirmed my present career? **********People who have taken similar tests have come away with varying results. **********Anne Lawrence, a manufacturing consultant in Pawley's Island, S.C., took the Johnson O'Connor test several years ago and decided to resign from her position at a drug company to go out on her own. The test, she said, identified her talents as an entrepreneur and gave her courage to try a new venture. Today she owns A&B Associates, a consulting firm. **********Others, however, haven't made any changes in their lives. An ad sales representative for a national magazine who spoke on condition of anonymity took the Johnson O'Connor test several years ago and wound up with some unusual advice. After three days of evaluations, the test administrators advised her to scrap sales and become a minister. She stayed in sales. **********SO how should my days have been spent? Apparently, not working around words. My 10th percentile score on Ideaphoria was one of the worst during my two days of testing. But it was just one of many disappointments, including a lackluster 25th percentile performance on the vocabulary test. One administrator asked me if I routinely used a dictionary. **********Johnson O'Connor's recommendation was that I should work as a manager, either a business executive or an educational administrator -- say, a college dean or high school principal. These careers depend more on management skills than writing. Journalism was definitely out, as was a career in law. (Sorry, Ma.)

The parties will divide the seats in proportion to the votes they receive. **********The purpose of the primaries is to make up the lists from which candidates will be given seats. In principle, the highest vote-getter has the best chance of getting into Parliament. In fact, about a third of the slots in each party's  list are set aside for specific constituencies, whether they be women, Arabs, new immigrants or coalition partners. **********Each party produced some surprises, though each broadly confirmed its ideological profile. **********In Mr. Peres's liberal Labor Party, the surprise was the election of the Tourism Minister, Uzi Baram, 59, a party veteran with markedly dovish views, to  head the list. Mr. Baram outpolled younger and more ambitious Labor leaders jostling to become heirs apparent to Mr. Peres, who is 72. **********The selection of Mr. Baram was seen as an affirmation by party members of a representative of traditional Labor, since his father was a prominent Labor politician before him, and he himself has been in Parliament since 1977. **********Mr. Baram evidently benefited from the reluctance among many party members to get involved in the struggle between Foreign Minister Ehud Barak and Interior Minister Haim Ramon, the leading contenders for the succession. **********Mr. Barak, a former army Chief of Staff and decorated commando, came in second, behind Mr. Baram. Mr. Ramon, who broke away from the Labor Party to win  leadership of the Histadrut labor federation and returned to the party fold only after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin last November, ran with the open opposition of old party and Histadrut leaders. **********Though the vote for Mr. Baram was an apparent endorsement of the party's peace policies, the Labor slate also included four generals in prominent positions, most notably Mr. Barak. **********Security has always been a major issue in Israeli campaigns, and it has become especially important in this one, both because of the recent spate of Palestinian suicide bombings and because a loss by the Labor Government could freeze the drive toward a comprehensive Middle Eastern peace that Mr. Peres has  promised. **********The assassination of Mr. Rabin created a wave of support for Labor, but the bombings in late February and early March largely nullified it, leaving Mr. Peres and Mr. Netanyahu almost tied in opinion polls. **********On balance, Mr. Peres was said to be satisfied with the result of the primary, because the failure of either Mr. Barak or Mr. Ramon to gain a decisive endorsement left him unchallenged as the Labor leader -- and therefore free, if  he wins, to have a Cabinet of his choosing. **********Setting out the basic strategy of his campaign, which is to toughen his security image while pledging to continue with the peace policy, Mr. Peres declared: \"We must mobilize all our forces and begin a march that will last for  four years until the year 2000. By then we will overcome Hamas, we will overcome Jihad, we will overcome terror. By then we will bring a comprehensive peace to the Middle East.\" **********In the Likud, the message on security was far tougher. The top vote-getter in the primaries proved to be a retired general, Yitzhak Mordechai, whose last command included the Golan Heights. **********The greater surprise was second place, which was won by Ariel Sharon, a former army chief and Defense Minister who led Israel in the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and has remained a staunch advocate of force in dealing with Arabs. **********Next were Benjamin Begin and Dan Meridor. Mr. Begin, son of the late Likud Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, opposes any peace with the Palestine Liberation  Organization. Mr. Meridor is a Likud veteran often held up as a potential successor to Mr. Netanyahu. **********But under a coalition agreement that Mr. Netanyahu struck earlier with two small parties, the top positions on the Likud list will be filled by their leaders. The first is another former Army Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, and the  second is David Levy, a former Foreign Minister. **********The slate suggests that if Mr. Netanyahu wins, his government will have hard-liners in top posts. **********\"It is an excellent team,\" Mr. Netanyahu declared. \"I think what we have here is a combination of stability and freshness.\" Mr. Netanyahu's line on peace negotiations is that he will continue to talk to the Palestinians, \"but in a way that will take back our security.\" **********Neither party realistically expected to get more than 45 members into Parliament, so much of the list was an attempt to balance a wide variety of interests. They did not always succeed. **********In Labor, one big surprise was the success of an Ethiopian immigrant, Adisu Massala, in winning the seat reserved for new immigrants. Mr. Massala capitalized on sympathy for the Ethiopian Jews after recent disclosures that blood they donated was being discarded for fear that it was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. **********The problem was that Mr. Massala displaced a Russian immigrant, leaving the large bloc of Russian Jews, about 600,000 strong, without any representation on  the Labor list. Party leaders hurriedly began looking for a slot to give a Russian. **********Likud did not do much better, with a Russian immigrant only in the 45th slot. The beneficiary is likely to be Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is leading his own new immigrants' party in the race. **********Another Labor surprise was the success of Nadia Hilo, an Arab Christian woman from Jaffa who beat out Jewish candidates for one of the slots reserved for women. In all, Labor had five women in its slate, compared with two on Likud's list. **********Israel's Arab population, which has traditionally sided with Labor, will be running its own united slate this year, which will include the Islamic movement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/business/international-briefs-net-down-at-foster-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Net Down at Foster's", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Net Down at Foster's", "body_text": " **********Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. of Australia said yesterday that its after-tax profit fell 18.7 percent, to $165.5 million (Australian), or $125.38 million (United States), in the six months that ended on Dec. 31.

In France, unemployment is also rising from record-high levels. **********The economic grass on the western side of the English Channel has never looked greener. But it may not last long. **********The problem, says Nigel Gault, chief European economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, is that Britain's prospects look \"a bit too good.\" Against what he and most others say is a noninflationary, core rate of economic growth of 2.25 percent, most expect Britain to grow by close to 4 percent in 1997. **********On the eve of the great set-piece economic event of year, the unveiling of the government's budget Tuesday, the big fear among British economists is that this sort of pre-election prosperity looks all too powerful, and all too familiar. **********The last time consumers were spending with such confidence, home prices were rising with such strength and the government was this self-congratulatory came less than a decade ago. It is a period now remembered with rancor, most of all by the official guardian of a sound currency, the Bank of England. **********Earlier this month, in discussing the central bank's economic outlook, its chief economist, Mervyn King, admonished policymakers to avoid the mistakes of the late 1980s, when inflation spiraled and interest rates doubled to 15 percent in less than a year and a half \u2014 throwing Britain into one of the deepest recessions of the postwar era. **********The chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, also remembers the late 1980s. His recent decision to lift interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point caught most observers by surprise, sending a clear signal that even with an election looming by May, London would slow the economy if it had to in order to maintain some grip on inflation. **********But with the retail price inflation rate having jumped last month to 3.3 percent from 2.9 percent and with the broad measure of money supply expanding at 10 percent \u2014 double the rate of two years ago \u2014 few believe one tiny adjustment in interest rates will suffice. **********\"The acid test of the government's commitment to low inflation comes now,\" said Ian Amstad of Bankers Trust Co. **********Most observers say Mr. Clarke will successfully fight calls from his party to include massive vote-winning tax cuts in the budget and will instead balance what tax trimming he does offer with planned reductions in government spending. **********The problem is that mere budgetary restraint will likely prove insufficient. **********\"The best thing to do would be to tighten fiscal policy, since that would directly hit the booming consumer sector,\" said David Mackie of J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. But since consumers are also voters, he concedes that there is little likelihood of the government's following his advice. **********What worries economists, though, is that even interest rate increases they now expect will prove politically difficult."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/19/business/japan-inc-so-resilient-in-the-past-can-t-find-its-footing.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1996-09-19", "snippet": "Peter Passell (Economic Scene) column explores why Japan has been unable to shrug off its current economic problems (M)", "word_count": 789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Inc., so resilient in the past, can't find its footing.", "print_headline": "Japan Inc., so resilient in the past, can't find its footing.", "body_text": " **********REMEMBER Japan Inc., the unstoppable juggernaut? The juggernaut stalled in the early 1990's with the near-collapse of the Japanese real estate and stock markets. Now it appears that the Government's sputtering effort to rekindle growth is once more failing: after a big first quarter, the economy actually shrank at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. **********Standard antirecessionary tools are not working in the face of falling prices. And the Government seems trapped by politics and myopia into staying the course, which -- perversely -- includes a big rise in the national sales tax next April. ''Japan's macroeconomic policy is the worst anywhere since the Great Depression,'' said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. **********Not surprisingly, economic growth in Japan has slowed over the last two decades as it narrowed the productivity gap with America and Europe. What is surprising is that an economy that responded so resiliently to the oil shocks of the 1970's has been unable to shrug off its current problems. **********In part, that may be because the problems are serious. When speculative bubbles in real estate and stocks burst, the shuffling of wealth traumatized a financial system ill suited to rapid change. ''While the Government won't let them go under, everybody knows the big Japanese banks are virtually insolvent,'' said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan. **********In part, it is because exporters did not ride to the rescue. In earlier recessions, a weakening exchange rate made Japanese goods irresistible in world markets. This time around, though, the yen actually strengthened -- a circumstance Ronald McKinnon, an economist at Stanford University, attributes to pressure from Washington to contain the Japanese trade surplus. **********But in part, too, failure has begot failure in ways eerily reminiscent of the Depression. The Bank of Japan has cut interest rates as far as they can be cut: bank depositors now earn just a quarter of 1 percent on their money. But falling prices that breed expectations of further falls have made business reluctant to borrow, even at very low rates, because loans must be repaid in yen that will be worth more. Putting it another way, deflation has left Japan with a real interest rate considerably higher than the nominal rate. **********By the same token, fiscal stimulus has been far less effective than most economists predicted. Big spending on public works -- Japan is running out of roads to repave -- has apparently has created little ''multiplier effect'' because much of the income is going into bank accounts rather than private demand. Consumers are reluctant to spend when, as Mr. Makin puts it, ''the toaster you buy next year will be cheaper than the one you buy this year.'' **********Adding to this misery, there is considerable opposition to further fiscal stimulus because it would increase the (already substantial) budget deficit. Just as Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to balance the Federal budget in 1937 and set off a slide back into depression, this Japanese Government seems determined to raise taxes on consumer spending next year in order to curb its deficit. **********That leaves Japan's old standby, export-led growth, which ought to be possible if all those good cars and computers could be sold abroad at competitive prices. ''There's nothing wrong here that an exchange rate of 130 yen to the dollar couldn't fix,'' Mr. Saxonhouse said. (The current rate is 110.) **********It is hard to imagine, though, that the Clinton Administration would cooperate with coordinated actions that reduce the exchange value of the yen and make American products less competitive. While the White House did stop its drum roll of protectionist threats in 1994 after the Japanese economy's problems became too severe to ignore, Detroit's fate still matters a lot more to President Clinton than Toyota City's. **********Mr. Saxonhouse holds out hope of a slow fix. The yen-dollar exchange rate, he notes, has already depreciated by one-third since its high point a year ago, and the full effect has yet to be felt on exports. Higher interest rates in America -- rates not matched by the Bank of Japan -- should further weaken the yen. Most important, Mr. Saxonhouse suggests, when push comes to shove, Japan has a history of accommodating reality. ''I don't see Tokyo stepping knowingly into another recession'' by raising taxes, he says. **********Still, it is not clear the economy has reached a point where the Ministry of Finance, Japan's coterie of conservative bureaucrats who make policy as if the nation were perpetually on the brink of hyperinflation, will lose its grip. Bankruptcies remain uncommon, the banks are limping along and there is no army of homeless sleeping on the grounds of the Emperor's palace. If Germany can live with 10 percent unemployment, perhaps Japan will grow accustomed to 4 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/business/minding-your-business-500-pages-of-merchandise-but-should-i-invest.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1996-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;500 Pages of Merchandise, but Should I Invest?", "print_headline": "MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;500 Pages of Merchandise, but Should I Invest?", "body_text": " **********Q. Will the current mail-order catalogue boom last, and if so, whose stock should I consider buying?    IRENE SHTINO    Kew Gardens, Queens **********A. In 1899, when the social critic Thorstein Veblen coined the term \"conspicuous consumption,\" he had no inkling that American children in Pocahontas pajamas would now be asking, \"Mommy, read me a bedtime catalogue.\" **********Or that an industry with $63 billion in annual sales would be dedicated to the proposition that everything can be sold by mail. Simply by calling or faxing a toll-free number, you can order custom-trimmed cars, fully loaded desktop PC's, life insurance, build-it-yourself homes, Key lime pies from the Gulf Coast, or high-Gothic tchotchkes from Cher's \"Sanctuary\" catalogue -- a kind of  Hammacher Schlemmer for Addams Family wannabes. **********It is not true, however, that Sears, Roebuck once sold brides by mail. According to legend, a Montana rancher ordered one at the turn of the century. The clerk wrote back, saying the company had just run out of brides, then immediately quit her job and headed west to marry the rancher herself. Sears was always good at customer relations. It's a pity that it got out of the catalogue  business. **********Will the boom continue? Most likely. More than half the adult population -- 98.5 million Americans -- order by mail, according to the Direct Marketing Association. Sales are expected to hit $85.7 billion by 2000, up from $62.6 billion in 1995. In the last decade, the Simmons Market Research Bureau reports, the number of catalogue shoppers has quintupled while the population has increased just 11.9 percent. **********Last year, the industry mailed a mind-boggling 12.8 billion catalogues -- many of them so slick, or in the case of Victoria's Secret, so sexy, that they have become collectors' items. **********The biggest mail-order category, however, isn't high fashion. It's high technology. **********For every 15 people buying computers at retail prices, at least one scours the catalogues. They are mainly buyers who do not require hand-holding. Gateway  2000 and Dell Computer, the world's leading mail-order computer vendors, both traded on Nasdaq, account for up to 20 percent of the PC market, which has $50 billion in annual sales. **********And as that market is growing 15 percent annually, mail-order sales are growing twice as fast. The figures recently prompted Compaq, I.B.M., NEC, Digital and Hewlett-Packard to follow suit and sell through the mail.    ANOTHER factor in the growth of the industry is the ease with which merchandisers expand globally. In Japan, the strong yen, the excellent reputation of American sportswear and a shipping system that can get packages to Tokyo as fast as across this country all contribute to a catalogue boom. Last winter, when the Commerce Department's Osaka office offered 125 different catalogues at $2 to $3 each, lines formed around the block. **********Which explains why Lands' End, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has a complete Japanese-language catalogue that depicts tanned, happy American models  astride red Yamaha scooters, and tote bags embossed with names like Tomoko and Emi. **********There are many reasons why people are turning to catalogues. Saving time is only one, says Faith Popcorn, the trend spotter and author of \"Clicking\" who, years back, accurately predicted the stay-at-home trend of \"cocooning\" -- hunkering down, ordering in and turning on favorite TV shows. Anything that can  ease the strain of being overscheduled and overcommitted, she says, will find a  market. **********Let there be no mistake about the high level of intensity at mail-order companies. They cannot, and will not, all succeed. The best bets are those that constantly retool or reinvent product lines, expand and update mailing lists and maintain top-notch customer service. **********Geerlings & Wade of Canton, Mass., for example, is the nation's largest mail-order wine marketer. Not content to rest on its laurels, though, it recently added an impressive array of wine paraphernalia to its catalogue. One of the nation's largest catalogue marketers of consumer products, the Fingerhut  Companies, stays competitive by using a data base to constantly cultivate its mailing lists. **********Beware of companies that cannot seem to renew themselves. The specialty retailer Lillian Vernon, for example, has had disappointing earnings lately and  may conjure up an image of the catalogue pile beneath your grandmother's knitting basket. The Sharper Image, whose stock price has fallen over 20 percent in a year, may need a few more movies like \"Mission: Impossible\" to keep consumers from seeing the pricey gadgetry as remnants of the high-flying 80's. **********For some well-established companies, only time will tell. With a colossal mailing list of 480 million, Spiegel Inc., which also owns the Newport News catalogue business and Eddie Bauer, has had two years of poor earnings. But if its current turnaround effort succeeds, it may turn out that today's stock price is a bargain. **********Speaking of bargains, not all retailers are convinced that mail order is the  trend for everything. **********\"It's true that most women are just too busy to shop,\" said Beverly LaBadia,  manager of a women's specialty clothing store in Flemington, N.J., \"but I don't  believe catalogue or computer shopping will ever replace the personal visit when it comes to clothing.\" Her reasoning: Fabrics and colors often look better on the glossy page than in front of a full-length mirror. **********She adds: \"There's no standard sizing. Women come into my store and take a size 8 blouse, a 10 jacket and a 12 in a skirt.\" **********And few mail-order companies will eat the shipping costs of returned goods. \"A couple of exchanges can really add up,\" she said. **********For investors, catalogues have these other drawbacks: *********** The higher cost of paper. Recycled or not, high-priced paper has clearly hurt the earnings of Lands' End and Lillian Vernon, among other companies. *********** The higher cost of mailing. Last year's postal increase was only the latest skirmish in a long-running battle between the Postal Service and users of third-class mail. *********** A sluggish retail market. Mail-order companies are no less susceptible to market gyrations than stores are. A balmy winter, for example, can wreak havoc on all merchandisers of clothing for snowy weather. **********WHILE many Americans still refer to catalogues as \"junk mail,\" various public opinion polls -- many, admittedly, paid for by the industry -- show that if given a choice, most consumers elect to maintain their catalogue flow. **********Maybe they can't wait to see what will be offered next. Mail-order grooms, perhaps? Alaska Men magazine, with its monthly roster of eligible bachelors, is  certainly doing its part to repopulate the 49th state while leveling the playing field in Manhattan. Ladies! This male-order service doesn't deliver, so bring lots of catalogues; the Bloomingdale's nearest to Fairbanks, Alaska, is at the Mall of America in Minneapolis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/11/world/franco-s-foes-return-with-wheelchairs-and-memories.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1996-11-11", "snippet": "Veterans of International Brigades from 29 countries gather in Madrid for a reunion two decades after death of Gen Francisco Franco, fascist dictator against whom they fought; are made honorary Spanish citizens by Spanish Parliament; some reflect ...", "word_count": 1163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Franco's Foes Return, With Wheelchairs and Memories", "print_headline": "Franco's Foes Return, With Wheelchairs and Memories", "body_text": " **********Irving Gold came in a wheelchair.

Before long, the old men cried and saluted, raising clenched fists. Some of those fists trembled with age, but they went up anyway before a roaring audience estimated at 10,000. **********It is 60 years since the Spanish Civil War began and young men came here from all over Europe and North America to fight fascism. Veterans of those International Brigades returned to Spain over the last few days for what may be their last big reunion.

''We came to fight fascism and Nazism and I'm still proud of it.'' **********More than 40,000 youthful foreigners with little or no fighting experience came to Spain, recruited by Communist groups and trade unions. Most were workers and students, among them Communists, Socialists and liberals. A few were women, who worked as nurses. Almost 3,000 were Americans, grouped in what became known as the Lincoln Brigade, of whom some 900 died in action. **********Charles Hall, one of the 68 American veterans here this week, heard about the war in Spain on his factory floor in Chicago. ''The slogan was,'' he recalled, ''in Spain we are defending all of Europe against fascism.'' **********Fascism was on the rise in Germany and Italy, and the right-wing Spanish general Francisco Franco had rebelled and set out to overthrow Spain's democratically elected leftist government. **********''We were convinced that unless we defeated Franco, the rest of the democratic world would go down,'' Mr. Hall said. **********The conflict in Spain became a prelude to World War II, involving Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Hitler and Mussolini helped Franco with troops and aircraft, testing their war machines. Stalin sent military advisers and sold weapons to the besieged and fractured Spanish left, in exchange for Spain's gold reserves. Some 500,000 people died. **********Today, long after the Franco victory, followed by a 36-year dictatorship, the ''two Spains'' of the civil war still exist. As the veterans were received with honors in Parliament, its conservative leaders pointedly refused to attend. **********For the veterans and their families, though, the snub did not spoil the festivities. Rather, they were often moved to tears as Spaniards young and old burst into loud applause when the visiting veterans appeared at monuments, cemeteries, labor union halls and receptions in Madrid, Barcelona and Guernica. During the concert in their honor in the Madrid Sports Palace, many cried openly. **********As old comrades recog nized each other there were embraces, backslaps and laughter, and delight that friends were still alive. **********Sava Ciprovac, 83, who had come from Novi Sad in Serbia, was looking for French comrades with whom he had spent time in a prison camp. He proudly showed a yellowed document issued in 1937 by the office of Josip Broz, then recruiting volunteers for Spain and later to become Marshal Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia. **********Carmen Parga, 82, came from Mexico City. A reporter at the front, she spoke with emotion of Mexico's generous aid to the Spanish left at a time when other Western countries, including the United States, had imposed an arms embargo. **********Irving Gold, from Brooklyn, recalled how he and 30 other Americans left New York in early 1937 on the Ile de France, took trains through France and then secretly crossed the Pyrenees mountains on foot with Spanish guides. **********''It was night,'' he recalled. ''The guides told us all to wear white socks so you could see the fellow in front of you.'' **********They and thousands of other English-speaking men -- the brigades were divided in language groups --  went to Albacete, a base for the International Brigades. In the bullring there, Mr. Rappoport recalled, he got his first rifle. **********''We stopped somewhere to march in a field and we fired five bullets each,'' he said. ''That was our training.'' **********Many Americans spent almost four months in trench warfare along the Jarama River at Arganda to hold the vital bridge to Madrid. Some survivors visited that bridge this week. The bridge was never lost, but many men died there. Among the olive trees near the trenches, one mass grave is said to hold 127 Americans. **********Volunteers recall suffering extreme cold and heat. They always felt outgunned and to this day they blame the arms embargo placed on Spain by Washington, London and Paris. But they also remember good times, like the camaraderie and the day they heard Paul Robeson sing. **********''He sang 'Ol' Man River,' very impressive,'' said Peter O'Connor, 84, an Irish veteran. **********Louis Bortz, from Hartford, Conn., is one of several old-timers who recalled talking with Ernest Hemingway and everyone here, it seemed, had read ''For Whom the Bell Tolls.'' **********The International Brigades were sent home in late 1938, a fruitless effort to get Hitler and Mussolini to withdraw their military units. Back home, many veterans suffered political or professional discrimination. **********''After Spain, many veterans had a great deal of trouble with the F.B.I.,'' said Mr. Hall, from Chicago. ''Some couldn't hold jobs because the F.B.I. went to people's employers.'' **********Spanish and French veterans were interned in camps in France, once Paris made its pact with Hitler. A Dutch veteran, Frans Oord, said that on return, he and others were stripped of their Dutch citizenship because they had served in a foreign army. Swiss volunteers were jailed for six months for that same reason. A number of Soviet and East European veterans from Spain were killed in Stalinist purges because they were distrusted as Trotskyites. **********One portentous question was much in the air this week: Would history have taken a different course if the West had not remained neutral and instead helped defeat Franco and fascism in Spain? **********''Hitler played poker with Spain and the democracies let him,'' said Roman Sislovsky, a Jewish veteran from Poland. ''If the big democracies had intervened and stopped Franco, it would have stopped Hitler and we wouldn't have had the Holocaust.'' **********Mr. Hall was not so sure. ''If we had won in Spain, it wouldn't have stopped Hitler,'' he said, ''but Hitler got a lot of confidence in Spain and his Air Force got a lot of training and practice on live targets. We saw that ourselves.'' **********Mr. Hall was now listening to Spanish music and tears welled in his eyes. ''That's the past,'' he said. ''This is now.

But that gap has grown suddenly wider, according to a new survey that finds the percentage of people under the age of 30 who say they regularly watch network television news has dropped by more than one-third in the last 12 months. **********The survey, to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, found that 42 percent of all Americans say they regularly watch one of the three traditional nightly news broadcasts, on ABC, CBS or NBC, down from 47 percent a year ago. But among those under 30, only 22 percent said they  watch network nightly news, down from 36 percent last year. **********Local news broadcasts attract more viewers over all, but the declines in their audiences were comparably steep. Among all adults, 65 percent said they regularly watched local news (it was 72 percent last year); among those under 30, 51 percent said they watched local news, off from 64 percent a year ago. **********\"The networks are facing a serious problem, with increased competition within their industry and with a decreased appetite for news, especially among younger  people,\" said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, which until this year was the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press. **********The percentage of adults who said they watched the Cable News Network regularly has dropped to 26 percent from 30 percent a year ago, according to the survey. That falloff might have been expected: the trial of O. J. Simpson was being carried live by CNN a year ago. **********Network news executives say that the networks' share of the total audience has been declining steadily as cable channels have taken more and more viewers away, and that news is merely following the pattern. As viewers grow older, these executives say, viewers will watch more news, just as present-day older viewers watch more news than young people do. **********Perhaps so, Mr. Kohut said, but he is convinced that they will still be far fewer in number. \"They will grow up and watch less news than the previous younger generation that is now middle-aged,\" he said. \"I really think it's not a life-cyclical pattern, it's generational.\" **********One of the best-known spokeswomen for that under-30 generation, Tabitha Soren of MTV News, thinks she knows why. **********\"Who wants to watch a half-hour news show with no issues that affect you?\" she said. \"When mainstream news talks about education, it's in terms of tax breaks for baby-boomer parents who are sending their kids to college, not about  kids who are graduating with all this debt and can't even find jobs or are terribly underemployed.\" **********Ms. Soren said that MTV surveys had found education and jobs to be the top issues of concern to the under-30 age group. **********\"Bill Clinton talks about all the jobs he created, and networks report it,\" she said. \"But do you hear them report that the unemployment rate for 18-to-29-year-olds is double the national average? About the 11 percent of young people who are unemployed? Or the 30 percent who don't have any health care coverage? **********\"It's a Catch-22,\" she said of the major networks' treatment of the under-30  group. \"Why cover them if they don't watch you? But why should they watch you if you don't cover them?\" **********The Pew survey also found that people who use personal computers at home more than three days a week said they watched television news less often than did those not using computers, indicating that some computer users may be tracking down news on the Internet or through on-line services. **********Also, the survey found the number of people who listen to radio news to be relatively constant. **********It did not specifically address the time slot of the network evening news programs, which in recent years has been moved earlier, to 6:30 P.M. from 7 P.M. (to 5:30 P.M. from 6 P.M. in the Midwest). The changes were made because local stations could make more money using the hour before prime time for game shows or gossipy tabloid shows like \"Hard Copy\" and \"Entertainment Tonight.\" **********When asked why they watched less news than they used to, respondents to the survey most often answered \"no time/too busy.\" The second-most-frequent reply was \"don't have TV/not readily available.\" Since 99 percent of American homes have at least one television set, that answer may reflect those people who are not home at 5:30 or 6:30 P.M. to watch news. **********\"It's an interesting question, whether we're doing network news at a time when it's available to folks who want to see it,\" said Richard Wald, senior vice president at ABC News, who had read an advance copy of the Pew study. \"But early-morning news programs are going up in viewership, and I'm guessing that's  because more people are home in the morning and want news.\" **********David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for planning and research at CBS, said the Pew survey confirmed a trend that has been going on for a decade, and is tied to overall TV-viewing trends. There is more competition for the networks over all, and there are more outlets for news, with expanded local news programs, CNN and other cable channels. Indeed, ABC, Fox and a partnership of NBC and the Microsoft Corporation are all developing 24-hour cable news channels. **********\"You're still talking about more than 40 percent of people watching the network news,\" he said. \"And when there is a major news event happening, the number jumps dramatically. I think most people now know generally whether there  has been a significant news event. On days there is, they tune in the network news. On days there isn't, they may decide to come home and watch 'Seinfeld.' \" **********The Pew survey was based on telephone interviews in April with two nationwide samples of adults 18 and older.

Catholics and Protestants are afraid that the city, the capital of the predominantly Protestant British province of Northern Ireland, is again edging onto a wartime footing. **********In part, the show of security is to warn the population that a return to guerrilla violence is possible, and to motivate people to press the politicians  and paramilitaries to negotiate. **********On Thursday the Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Annesley, head of the 28,000-member security force, including 17,500 army troops, said a resumption of violence here by the I.R.A. was possible. **********Referring to the overwhelmingly Catholic guerrilla organization, he added, \"If the Provisionals were to attack in Northern Ireland there is no doubt whatsoever that there would be an immediate and without warning retaliatory attack by Loyalist terrorists both within Northern Ireland and within the Republic of Ireland.\" **********His words, and the enlarged street presence of the security force, which has  still not reached the level existing before the cease-fire, has heightened the tension in Northern Ireland, where the I.R.A. has not exploded any bombs or tried to shoot any police officers or soldiers of Protestant paramilitaries since they declared a cease-fire on Aug. 31, 1994. **********The security buildup followed the I.R.A. bombing last Saturday of a shopping  center in Manchester, England, in which more than 200 people were wounded. **********The I.R.A. admitted the bombing on Wednesday night, saying \"we sincerely regret the injuries to civilians,\" and adding, \"We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process.\" But it gave no indication that it was preparing to restore its cease-fire, which it first broke in February with a series of bomb attacks in London. **********A restoration of the cease-fire is demanded by the British and Irish Governments if Sinn Fein is to gain a place at the new broad-based peace talks that began in Belfast last week. **********The situation has caused some Catholics to re-examine their votes in the special election on May 30 for places at the negotiating table. Sinn Fein won 15.5 percent of the votes, its highest total ever.

Zyuganov struggled today to patch together a coalition that could defeat President Boris N. Yeltsin. **********With limited resources and little time, many of Mr. Zyuganov's closest advisers are urging him to soften his image with touchy-feely television commercials, hone his issues and shed the Communist ideology that still seeps into his speeches and that voters seem to deeply mistrust. **********Incidentally, we did not offer to build Communism,\" Mr. Zyuganov said somewhat defensively at a news conference today. \"We suggested a nationally oriented policy that would insure the development of the state, that would insure the safety of every citizen, and allow the possibility to bring talent into fruition.\" **********After the first round of voting showed that Mr. Zyuganov had not captured more than the 32 percent of the vote that his party won in the December parliamentary elections, he turned his attention to forging alliances with other opponents of Mr. Yeltsin. But his hopes, for the most part, were quickly dashed. **********Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the volatile ultra-nationalist whose backers Mr. Zyuganov hopes to attract, refused to reach out. **********\"Our supporters will vote as I tell them,\" Mr. Zhirinovsky snapped today. \"All this stupidity that my electorate will go to the Communists is ruled out. My voters are not Communists; we do not accept Communists or democrats.\" **********Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the liberal economist, democrat and ardent critic of Mr. Yeltsin, told his own supporters not to vote for the Communists. So did another candidate, Svyateslav Fyorodov. **********Of the well known candidates, only the former Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, refused to take sides. The endorsement of Mr. Gorbachev, who won about one half of 1 percent of the vote, was not sought by either candidate. **********Mr. Zyuganov and his team went into retreat on Tuesday to lick their wounds and reconsider their strategy for the second round. **********But some of his top aides are already musing aloud about the future of their  party in the event that Mr. Yeltsin wins the runoff. Calling himself a \"realist,\" Aleksandr Shabanov, ideologist of the Communist party and Mr. Zyuganov's top media adviser, said he was an \"optimist\" about the party's long-term prospects. \"Inevitably, from a historical point of view, this regime will not survive,\" he said quietly. \"Mr. Zyuganov will be the leader of the biggest and most powerful political party in Russia.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin has been moving with remarkable speed, first to recruit Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, the popular nationalist who came in a strong third, and appoint him top national security adviser in exchange for his support. **********Trying to maintain his momentum, Mr. Yeltsin today canceled his plans to attend the meeting of the Group of Seven advanced industrial nations in Lyons, France, later this month in order to concentrate on campaigning. **********And in a strategy to set the runoff as early as possible, Mr. Yeltsin today withdrew his request to Parliament to make Wednesday, July 3, a holiday and instead instructed Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to simply decree the holiday. **********When Mr. Yeltsin suggested a July 3 holiday, the Communists countered with a  proposal for a July 5 holiday, which would give Russians a three-day weekend. But Mr. Zyuganov said he had no objections to July 3. **********\"I understand why they are in a hurry,\" he said. \"They know that as soon as July 1 comes along, about a million and a half people will have bought their bottles and will go on holiday.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin's chances depend on a high turnout, and his campaign team wants to avoid an election on a summer Sunday, when his supporters might go to the country instead of the polls. **********Mr. Zyuganov, who met with Mr. Lebed today, tried to latch on to some of the  issues that propelled the maverick general into third place. \"We discussed questions of national security, economic, military, personal, social and family  security,\" Mr. Zyuganov said. He added that those were all important issues in his own campaign. **********Mr. Lebed, whose success struck a raw nerve among Mr. Zyuganov's aides, is a  low-key nationalist who campaigned on a \"law and order\" and anti-corruption platform, attracting centrist voters who are deeply displeased with Mr. Yeltsin's tenure but unwilling to return to the Soviet era. **********Mr. Lebed's broad appeal only magnified Mr. Zyuganov's biggest problem. No matter how hard he tried in the first round to cast himself as the unideological leader of a nationalist-patriotic bloc, voters saw him as an old-fashioned Communist. **********And while Mr. Zyuganov and his supporters complain, not without cause, that the Yeltsin campaign used its virtual control over broadcasting to paint him that way, a few of Mr. Zyuganov's advisers concede that their candidate did not  do himself any favors. **********\"People are concerned about bread-and-butter issues, the economy, crime,\" said one Zyuganov adviser who insisted on anonymity. He said that Mr. Zyuganov's apocalyptic language about the horrors of economic reform was scaring voters. \"Ideology, calls for the restoration of Soviet power, aren't working. Zyuganov has to shed all that and sound strong, pragmatic and reasonable; he has to convince people that he believes there are some elements of reform that are good, and worth preserving. That is what worked for Lebed.\" **********Mr. Shabanov argued that Mr. Lebed had drawn Zyuganov voters with \"his firmness, laconic style and decisiveness,\" and hinted that Mr. Zyuganov would soon do the same. \"You saw Zyuganov today,\" he said, referring to the Communist  leader's news conference. \"He has become firmer, more resolute, laconic.\" **********But even Mr. Shabanov did not seem very optimistic about the candidate's chances of turning his image around so quickly. \"We have to try to open the eyes of those who did not vote and those who were frightened by Communists,\" he said. He added that his party would try to buy some commercial advertising time  on the networks, but noted that its finances are limited. **********He said the campaign had already produced a political ad aimed at humanizing  Mr. Zyuganov that could be broadcast before the runoff. The ad, he said, features Mr. Zyuganov introducing his mother, his children and an old schoolteacher to viewers. Mr. Zyuganov, who is uncomfortable discussing personal matters and has until now shielded his family from the press, drew the line at filming his wife, Nadezhda, an engineer at a clock factory who has stayed resolutely out of the public eye. **********And there are limits to the Zyuganov campaign's tolerance for Western-style media campaigning. Mr. Shabanov, sifting through his papers, pulled out proposals from his staff to film Mr. Zyuganov chatting with ordinary people in more \"humane\" surroundings -- a summer camp, an old-age home, a train station. But he expressed some discomfort with personality profiles and glitzy 30-second  spots. **********\"Our voters, any Russian voter within the bloc of national patriots, will not accept this kind of brief message,\" he said. Pulling out a black-and- white chart, he said, \"we need to show our voters charts like this.\" **********The grainy computer-generated visual aid depicted per-capita grain and bread  production figures from 1900 to the present. \"This shows that we are now reaching the point where rationing was introduced, which we only had under Czar  Nicholas II and in 1940,\" he explained. He pointed to a zigzagging line. \"And we are getting close to the critical line which is called famine, which we also had in 1924 and during the war.\" **********Holding up the graphic, he smiled softly: \"This is our secret weapon.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/17/world/afghans-at-un-offer-a-cease-fire-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-10-17", "snippet": "Afghan Government driven from Kabul by forces of Taliban Islamic fundamentalists calls for cease-fire, formation of coalition government and demilitarization of capital under UN protection; photo (M)", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Afghans, at U.N., Offer a Cease-Fire Plan", "print_headline": "Afghans, at U.N., Offer a Cease-Fire Plan", "body_text": " **********The Afghan Government that was driven out of Kabul last month by the strict Islamic movement known as the Taliban called today for a cease-fire, the formation of a coalition government and the demilitarization of the country's capital under United Nations protection. **********The alternative is an attack on Kabul, the Afghan representative, Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai, told the Security Council today.

Negotiators from both sides then held long talks on Sunday. **********There was no immediate indication whether Mr. Ross had succeeded in breaking the distrust that has delayed a deal now for almost three months since President Clinton drew an agreement from Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat at a Washington summit meeting to try to resolve the Hebron issue and move on in their political negotiations. **********Officials said Mr. Ross intended to leave on Monday in any case. **********''The important thing that I am trying to do is to re-energize the peace process and then be in a position to go back in a couple of days to report back to the President,'' Mr. Ross said today. **********The withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of Hebron has evolved into a major test of Mr. Netanyahu's intentions on the political process with the Palestinians. The West Bank city has always figured as an especially difficult issue in the peace effort. **********As the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarch Abraham, the site is contested by Jews and Muslims, and some 450 Jewish religious nationalists maintain zealously guarded enclaves in the center of the city. **********The withdrawal was originally to have been completed in March as part of the Israeli pullout from West Bank cities envisioned under the accord signed in September 1995. But the withdrawal was delayed by the Labor Government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres after a series of suicide bombings carried out by Palestinians in Israel. **********The election of a conservative Government under Mr. Netanyahu in May further delayed the process, since he was expected at least to toughen security arrangements for the Jewish enclaves. It was only after a new eruption of Palestinian violence in September and the summit meeting in Washington in early October that negotiations resumed in earnest. **********At that time, agreement seemed to be a matter of days. But the talks soon bogged down. First, the Israelis demanded the right for their troops to re-enter Hebron whenever they deemed it necessary. Then, Mr. Arafat demanded some guarantees that Mr. Netanyahu was committed to continuing with the political process after a Hebron troop redeployment. **********At the end of October, the negotiations essentially ground to a halt. American diplomats said the problem was increasingly Mr. Arafat's loss of trust in the Netanyahu Government, especially after it announced the construction of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank. In recent days, Mr. Arafat's aides have expressed concern that after the Israelis pull back in Hebron, Mr. Netanyahu may try to mollify right-wing constituents by announcing new settlement construction. **********But last week, before Mr. Ross's arrival, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that Israel had made some significant moves and that it was Mr. Arafat's turn to make concessions. **********The specific issues remaining to be resolved reportedly include control over a street running past Jewish enclaves in the middle of the city, what weapons the Palestinian police will be allowed to carry, and where, and the question of ''hot pursuit'' by Israeli soldiers into Palestinian areas. **********The continuing delays in the withdrawal have led to repeated scuffles and confrontations in the center of Hebron between the Jewish settlers and the 160,000 Palestinians, who include a sizable population of supporters of the militant Islamic movement Hamas. **********Today, a firebomb blew up near a Jewish home in Hebron, causing no injuries.

If the number of shares times the offering price is less than $30 million, Mr. Tuttle avoids it: IPOs, he says, \"need to have a sizable float of shares outstanding or institutions won't be interested.\" **********A prospectus also includes the background of the company's management team. \"You don't want a CEO who used to run a bakery and now wants to run a computer company,\" he warns. **********- **********Choose less risky IPOs. **********Their price run-ups may not be as spectacular as a high-flying technology start-up, but there are some handsome, and less volatile, profits in companies with well-known products and a long history of earnings. **********A notable example is Estee Lauder Cos., the cosmetics maker that went public last November.

The organization is the Children's Defense Fund, the Washington-based group that lobbies on issues like health care, nutrition and education. **********Now they are celebrating 10 years together -- a lifetime in the turbulent realm of pro bono accounts. On one hand, many agency executives want to contribute to the community because they are altruistic or desire to appear so. And they may be interested in producing the risk-taking advertising that nonpaying clients often approve and conservative conventional clients often eschew, because such work often wins awards. **********All that, though, must be balanced against the demands on scarce resources that pro bono accounts can make. And there is the danger that paying clients may perceive themselves as being given short shrift by executives who seem more eager to devote time to the pro bono clients. **********''It's hard keeping any client that long, paying or otherwise, in this day and age,'' said Mary Warlick, executive director of the One Club for Art and Copy in New York, which administers the annual One Show for creativity. The One Club is sponsoring a retrospective exhibit, ''The First 10 Years,'' devoted to the campaigns. It is the first show there to be centered on the pro bono efforts of a single agency. **********The work that Fallon McElligott has produced for the last decade -- commercials, print advertisements, posters -- is provocative and surprising, yet does not serve up shock for shock's sake. The ads, which use exhortative themes like ''Leave no child behind,'' look to raise consciousness along with eyebrows. **********For instance, one spot presents a politician kissing baby after baby on the campaign trail. ''This year,'' an announcer admonishes, ''make sure the candidates you vote for care as much about children after they're elected.'' And a print ad aimed at teen-age girls, showing a huge pregnant belly, carries this headline: ''If you're embarrassed by a pimple, try explaining this.'' **********One sign that the campaigns are not typical pro bono work: more than 130,000 copies of posters of the print ads have been sold, generating more than $500,000 for the Children's Defense Fund. **********''You usually get what you pay for,'' Marian Wright Edelman, president of the organization, said of groups like hers as they seek agencies for pro bono work. ''You feel like a beggar at the table.'' **********''But with Fallon McElligott, we've become full-fledged partners,'' she added. **********Ms. Edelman discussed the anniversary in a telephone conference-call interview in which she was joined by Patrick R. Fallon, chairman of Fallon McElligott. At one point, she spoke directly to Mr. Fallon, saying, ''You've treated us as if we were a $100 million client.'' **********Mr. Fallon replied, laughing, that the reason for the agency's devotion was that early on ''we didn't have any'' clients that spent so lavishly. **********''We didn't know when we started that it would turn out to be 'Till death do you part,' '' he added. **********In fact, Mr. Fallon confided, ''We're only partners because they wouldn't take no for an answer.'' His reference was to Ms. Edelman and other executives who had asked the agency to work for the Children's Defense Fund. **********''We were wet behind the ears,'' Ms. Edelman said of her organization a decade ago, ''but we knew we wanted a creative edge to the work.'' **********Ms. Warlick of the One Club said: ''Public-service work isn't easy to do, especially long, sustained work for one client.

The regional phone companies have shelved their efforts to get into television. And the three big long-distance carriers have put through their steepest rate increases in several years. **********''If we're supposed to be on the road to new services and declining rates, we're off to a horrible start,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union in Washington. **********Early this week, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to release its second major set of proposals on fostering competition in telecommunications. **********But critics of the F.C.C. are already sharpening their arguments that these rules -- like the first set of regulations issued by the commission in August -- are the primary reason that so little competition has taken hold. **********Several experts in deregulation said, though, that the criticisms of the new law, or the way it is taking effect, are somewhat misplaced. The retreats and about-faces were not caused solely by flaws in the law, they argue. The companies themselves failed to predict the cost of their new ventures and overestimated the capabilities of the technology. Caught up in the mania of the digital age, some executives simply lost their grip on reality. **********''We can hope for competition all we want, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen,'' said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the F.C.C. and the architect of the Government's efforts to open these markets. **********Mr. Hundt has played a part in slowing the process. Several industry executives said his aggressive approach to prying open local telephone monopolies had provoked a backlash from the companies, who have successfully challenged the commission's first set of competition rules in the Federal courts. **********But when cable and phone executives began lobbying before Congress to change communications laws almost a decade ago, they said they intended to string new wires into American homes to compete with each other in television and telephone service. As the cost of those ventures rose and the potential payoffs receded, they pulled back. **********The nation's largest cable operators, Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner, have both scaled back their plans to offer phone service as they struggle with mounting debt. Bell Atlantic, Nynex and the Pacific Telesis Group, which joined forces two years ago to start an ambitious television programming venture, Tele-TV, are in the process of shutting it down. **********''Partly, this is a case of excessive expectations,'' said Eli M. Noam, the director of the Columbia University Institute for Tele-Information. ''The cable and telephone companies fought very hard to get this law passed, and now they are having second thoughts. **********Some experts contend that the withering of competition between cable and phone companies does not, by itself, doom the prospects for competition. They noted that other industries have been successfully deregulated without the emergence of new types of competitors. **********''We didn't solve the lack of competition in airlines by having trucking companies get into the airline business,'' said Paul W. MacAvoy, a professor of management studies at the Yale School of Management. **********Still, even the more orthodox rivalry between long-distance and local phone companies has been slow to develop. Despite the bold predictions of executives like Robert E. Allen of AT&T, long-distance carriers have barely made a dent in the $100 billion local phone business. **********AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance carrier, is offering local phone service to a handful of customers in Sacramento, Calif. But the company has been stymied in its efforts to expand its local service beyond a few pockets because it is locked in protracted negotiations with the Bell companies to gain access to their networks. **********''I think residential competition is going to be fairly modest in the first half of 1997,'' John D. Zeglis, the general counsel of AT&T, said. ''Whether we can learn enough to break the code and compete in the second half of the year, I'm not going to speculate.'' **********Executives at the Bell companies said the F.C.C. was to blame for their resistance. As part of its so-called interconnection rules, the commission required that the Bells open up their networks to AT&T and other competitors at wholesale rates far below their retail price. The Bells said that requirement was an unlawful taking of their property. **********''Regulations vary widely from state to state, so you can't determine at the Federal level how these things should be priced,'' said Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell economist and Carter Administration deregulator, who is representing the Bell companies in their lobbying battle. **********GTE and other local phone companies recently challenged the F.C.C. in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, saying that the commission did not have the jurisdiction to dictate interconnection terms. The court suspended the rules until a hearing next month. **********Now, the F.C.C. is tackling an even more nettlesome issue: access charges. These are the $23 billion in annual fees that AT&T and other long-distance carriers pay to the local companies to complete their calls. Under the current regulatory regimen, these charges are set artificially high to help subsidize the cost of local phone service. **********In a fully competitive market, most experts agree, access charges should be reduced anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion. But some analysts said it would be irresponsible to slash those charges without allowing the Baby Bells to recoup at least some of the losses by raising their rates. It could also discourage would-be local competitors from building their own operations to compete with the Bells. **********For all that, Mr. Hundt said the F.C.C. had no plans to recommend any rate increases in the proposals it will shortly release. And he argued that his critics were missing a larger point: Deregulation and technology are creating new businesses -- like high-speed access to the Internet -- that will more than offset any losses. **********Indeed, some experts said it was shortsighted to complain about the pace of competition in an industry as unpredictable, volatile and fast moving as telecommunications. Technology and innovation can cause competition to sprout in unlikely places, like direct-broadcast satellite television or new types of wireless telephone service. **********While it is difficult to find a cable executive who rhapsodizes about getting into the phone business, or a Bell executive who wants to buy a film studio, every big cable and telephone company is now scrambling to offer a high-speed link to the World Wide Web. **********''To complain about the state of competition after 10 months makes me burst out laughing,'' said Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who studied the competitiveness of telecommunications for the Justice Department in 1986. ''This is a very big business. It took 10 years for the microcomputer industry to challenge I.B.M.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/13/business/in-sudden-move-miller-shifts-ad-agencies.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-12-13", "snippet": "Miller Brewing Company, bedeviled by slumping sales in increasingly competitive beer market, responds by suddenly shaking up its roster of advertising agencies; changes affect more than $300 million in billings; Miller Lite creative account is tak...", "word_count": 1298, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Sudden Move, Miller Shifts Ad Agencies", "print_headline": "In Sudden Move, Miller Shifts Ad Agencies", "body_text": " **********The Miller Brewing Company, bedeviled by slumping sales in an increasingly competitive beer market, responded yesterday by suddenly shaking up its roster of advertising agencies. The changes at Miller, the nation's second-largest brewer, affect assignments with billings estimated at more than $300 million. **********Miller, which is owned by the Philip Morris Companies, is withdrawing creative responsibilities for its two biggest brands, Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft, from two big agencies, the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago and Bates USA in New York. In doing so, the company is stripping Burnett of its last creative duties for Miller, though the agency was awarded significant media-service assignments in their stead, and removing Bates from the Miller roster after 17 years. **********The creative duties on Miller Lite, the third-best-selling American beer brand, and Miller Genuine Draft, the No. 7 brand, are being shifted to two smaller shops new to the Miller roster: Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis and Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. **********The Miller shifts underscore how younger, creatively focused agencies are winning more assignments from giant marketers seeking to catch the attention of jaded consumers. **********Fallon McElligott, which creates ads for clients like BMW of North America and the Timex Corporation, and Wieden & Kennedy, known for its edgy campaigns for Nike Inc. and the Microsoft Corporation, are considered to be the hottest creative shops in the country along with Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco. **********''Fallon and Wieden are highly regarded agencies with great track records,'' said Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for Miller in Milwaukee. ''Their work speaks for itself.'' **********Benj Steinman, president and editor at Beer Marketer's Insight, a trade publication in Nanuet, N.Y., said that local wholesalers who distribute Miller beers ''have made the point time and again to Miller executives that the creative work was not as strong as competitors' was. I think they think they can do better.'' **********Among the strong, popular campaigns from Miller's rivals are those created by Goodby, Silverstein and another unit of Omnicom Group, DDB Needham Chicago, for the Budweiser, Bud Light and Bud Ice beer brands sold by Anheuser-Busch.  Those humorous ads -- starring frogs, penguins and wacky humans intoning catch phrases such as ''I love you, man'' -- are helping fuel sales gains for Anheuser-Busch brands at Miller's expense. **********''We had a disappointing 1996,'' Ms. Henderson said, ''and we are going through a number of structural changes that include cost reductions'' and layoffs ''to help us re-establish growth. **********Ms. Henderson said that the company was ''concentrating on core, trademark Miller brands like Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft'' -- which had been played down as the company introduced brands like Red Dog, Miller Beer and Southpaw Light -- ''and adding on-premise selling teams of nearly 250 representatives in 45 key markets. And we plan no major new-product introductions in 1997.'' **********The Miller decisions mean that the brewer's three most valuable assets -- its two largest beers and its hefty media influence as the nation's 29th- most-advertised family of brands -- will be in new hands for the new year. **********The decision on Miller Lite was so abrupt that Burnett had to stop working on commercials carrying the theme ''Good call'' that had gone into production only last month. **********To make such substantive changes in one fell swoop (or ''one foul swoop,'' as a Bates executive described it) underscores how daunting the challenges facing Miller are in the $50 billion American beer market as sales grow just 1 percent a year. **********''Anheuser-Busch has had a good year,'' Mr. Steinman said, ''and Miller has had a tough, difficult year in which a lot has not gone right.'' Miller's sales declined 2.6 percent in the nine months through September and 6.5 percent in the third quarter, he added, compared with the corresponding periods a year ago. **********As Anheuser-Busch succeeds with mainstream brands like Bud Light, which has surpassed Miller Lite as the No. 1 light beer, microbrewers that sell premium-priced specialty beers are siphoning off affluent, educated and younger consumers. **********Even before yesterday, Miller had been reshuffling assignments among roster agencies. For example, three shops -- Scaros & Casselman in Stamford, Conn.; Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York, and Bates -- had created campaigns for Miller Beer, which managed to capture only minuscule market share despite an introductory ad budget of at least $50 million. **********Still, the changes yesterday were the most drastic since Miller Lite left Bates for Burnett in 1991. One Bates employee sobbed when she heard the news. **********Fallon McElligott was awarded Miller Lite, with billings estimated at $80 million to $100 million, after that brand spent five years at Burnett and before that 12 years at Bates and a predecessor agency, Backer & Spielvogel. The shift comes even though Miller Lite is the only Miller brand to increase sales, albeit by less than 1 percent, from last year. **********Fallon McElligott and Burnett are crossing paths -- or swords -- often. A longtime Burnett client, the McDonald's Corporation, added Fallon McElligott to its roster to introduce the Arch Deluxe sandwich. And in October, the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation dismissed Burnett and divided its $120 million account between Fallon McElligott and Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York. **********''It's not about Leo Burnett,'' asserted Pat Fallon, chairman at Fallon McElligott. Rather, he said, Miller executives perceived his agency as able to ''add dimensions'' to Miller Lite advertising that ''they weren't receiving.'' **********Miller Lite is ''a serious brand with a great heritage,'' Mr. Fallon said. ''We have the opportunity to see if we can make its future as great as its past has been.'' Among the brand's familiar slogans were ''Tastes great, less filling'' and ''Can your beer do this?'' The current campaign from Burnett carries the theme ''Life is good.'' **********Wieden & Kennedy was awarded the Miller Genuine Draft assignment, with billings estimated at $75 million to $80 million, after 11 years at Bates, which introduced that brand and a sibling, Miller Genuine Draft Light, with campaigns featuring wintry images and themes stressing words like ''cold'' and ''cool.'' Bates retained the brand in a formal review last year, only to find itself recently pitted against Wieden & Kennedy in an informal review. **********''Any time you lose a client whose brand you build and nurture from scratch, it hurts because it's like a family member,'' said Bill Whitehead, chief executive of the Bates North America unit of Bates Worldwide in New York, owned by Cordiant P.L.C. **********''Business is cyclical and we'll see what happens,'' he added. ''This makes us available in the beer category.'' About 10 percent of the 845 employees of Bates USA in New York and field service offices around the country have worked on Miller assignments. Mr. Whitehead said there would probably be layoffs. **********In addition to the creative changes, responsibilities for media planning and buying for the more than $300 million that Miller spends annually on all brands -- which also include High Life, Meister Brau and Sharp's nonalcoholic brew -- are arriving at Burnett from Bates and a Cordiant sibling shop, Zenith Media Services in New York. **********The Bates losses mean that the agency is no longer working for Miller -- a setback not only because of Miller's size but because of its heritage. It was a founding account of Backer & Spielvogel in 1979. **********Miller is the second big client to dismiss Bates in two years. Mars Inc. withdrew accounts in March 1995 with billings of $400 million to punish Cordiant for the departures of Maurice and Charles Saatchi, favorites of the Mars family. **********Other Miller agencies, unaffected by the changes, include Angotti, Thomas, Hedge, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies that handles the Foster's brand; Square One  in Dallas, which handles High Life, and the New York office of Young & Rubicam, which handles brands like Molson and Icehouse. Scaros & Casselman is not now assigned a brand, Ms. Henderson said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/10/world/africa-ills-insight-on-cure-but-avoiding-the-medicine.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1996-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 615, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Africa Ills: Insight on Cure But Avoiding the Medicine", "print_headline": "Africa Ills: Insight on Cure But Avoiding the Medicine", "body_text": " **********When a handful of heads of state and finance ministers from all over Africa gathered in this dusty capital this week, the ostensible purpose was to trade ideas on how to launch an economic takeoff for the world's poorest continent. **********Throughout the discussions, which were organized by the United Nations Development Program, two themes, better governance and stability, were repeated  by nearly all as critical elements missing from whatever formula will eventually move this continent forward. **********There is a clear recognition among leaders that as long as there is conflict, all the talk about economic development will remain just that, talk,\"  said Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity.  \"And as long as this conflict remains so widespread, the outside world will just not care about Africa.\" **********But even while strategies were being thrashed out on questions ranging from debt relief to conflict resolution, participants were fighting perceptions, fed  by the week's news, that Africa's leaders are either powerless or lack the will  to halt their continent's dangerous drift. **********As the United Nations conference began, soldiers in neighboring Niger overthrew a democratically elected Government, citing the inability of the President to work together with a Prime Minister who was drawn from the country's opposition. **********But if the affairs of state in Niger seemed blocked under a fledgling democracy, the military coup brought about an immediate suspension of most foreign aid.

How much will the Fed ease, and what will that do for  the stock and bond markets? During a week in which the Fed cut short-term interest rates a bit, and which ended with a surprisingly weak employment report, we put the questions to three leading Wall Street economists -- Stephen  S. Roach of Morgan Stanley; Philip Braverman of DKB Securities, a part of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, and Robert J. Barbera of Capital Investments International. We found big disputes on the past as well as the future, with one panel member saying workers were going to start scoring big wage gains and another arguing that workers had not done that badly in recent years, whatever the statistics say. **********Q. The European economy seems to be weak. Christmas sales were atrocious in this country. Is there a danger that we're going to have an election-year recession? **********ROACH I don't think so. The fears of recession are overblown. I think we're in a long business cycle expansion. I just got back from Europe, and it's weak but it's not falling out of bed. The core of Europe counts for about 14 percent  of global G.D.P. The other 86 percent is growing -- it's not booming. Christmas  was weak in the U.S., if you talk to the department stores and the specialty retailers. But if you talk to a broad array of other industries that deal in consumer-sensitive demands ranging from home electronics to airlines, business was O.K. This is certainly not a boom, but it's not a bust. And I'm just a believer that expansions do not die a natural death. In the end they are murdered by the Fed, and the Fed is not holding the gun. **********BARBERA I agree that expansions don't die a natural death. The Fed murders them. Sometimes, though, I think it's an inadvertent event. In the current environment, you can make the case that the Fed is very tight. The Fed doubled short rates in 1994 and has really given very little of that back. **********Q. So it's involuntary manslaughter? **********BARBERA Well, Alan Greenspan has erred before. To err is human. And to err twice is to run the Fed, I guess. The risk is that the Fed is too tight. I don't think we'll have a recession because I expect more aggressive Fed easing. **********BRAVERMAN It's a tough call. We've moved to a disinflationary environment in  which business is shifting production to lower-cost labor pools. Consumers have  a sense of distrust for the future that they haven't previously experienced. They have very little in the way of income growth in real terms. The consumer, who represents two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is at least holding back, restraining spending. Things are going to be even tougher in 1996, particularly  in the first half. We have too much inventory. Consumers are cutting back their  spending. We have a decline in mortgage rates, but housing is not improving. We  have huge excess capacity, not only here but around the world. So I see one of the mainstays of the expansion thus far, capital investment, slowing up. I see Government cutting back its spending. **********Is the economy vulnerable to recession? Yes. Will it actually go into it? It's a tough call, but I think the economy will slow to the extent that we will  move to the brink of recession. My view is that in the first half of this year we'll have G.D.P. growth of only about half a percent. **********The consumer has increased borrowing as an end run around the absence of income growth. But it appears that option is being foreclosed to a considerable  extent. **********Q. The option is being foreclosed? I still get plenty of offers for new credit cards. **********BRAVERMAN I know. But we have an increase in delinquency rates on installment credit and on mortgages. We're beginning to see a rise in consumer bankruptcies. And in the last Fed survey of bank lending patterns there was, for the first time, an indication that they are beginning to be shy about lending to consumers. So there's a combination of factors that have already reduced the pace of borrowing. **********ROACH I've got to jump in. This notion that consumers are over extended is overblown. I think we're early in the debt cycle, not late in the debt cycle. The way you measure the burden of leverage on borrowers is not by the volume of  debt they have outstanding. You don't pay off your credit card balance each month out of your current income flow. You pay the interest expenses associated  with that. Mortgage and installment credit combined are well below the highs of  the second half of the 1980's. Consumers are not at the brink. **********These are tough times in terms of job and income security, but the system is  generating enough in the way of purchasing power growth to enable consumers to deliver a reasonable rate of rise in spending. And I don't share the notion that there's weakness everywhere, either. I think that our export sector, capital spending sector and the housing sector will be reasonably firm in 1996. **********BARBERA I think that Steve is right, that it is debt burden, not debt levels  that matter. But obviously you affect debt burdens when you change short-term interest rates. And you did have a doubling of short-term interest rates in 1994. It's critically important to provide substantial rate relief to lower those debt burdens and allow consumers to return to putting more of their cash into purchases rather than into debt service. **********Q. There's another way that consumers can get money besides borrowing it. It's called earning it. The statistics on real income growth have looked bad for years. Will that change soon? **********ROACH Yes. We have gone too far in squeezing the worker to boost corporate profitability and competitiveness. I just came back from Asia, where a third of  the world is perceived to be toiling for a bowl of rice for a day's wage, and therefore no wage increase is ever going to take place in this environment. But  the relatively unskilled, undertrained, inexperienced Chinese worker does not compete with the machinist at Boeing who just successfully held out for a significant increase in real wages for the first time in several years. I think  we're going to see more of that in the U.S. economy because pay rates over the past five years have now been squeezed so that they are running below the productivity curve and economic theory suggests that workers should be paid their marginal productivity contribution. **********At a time when everybody is cracking out the champagne and celebrating the death of inflation, which is truly the view in the financial markets right now,  I think we're going to be surprised that labor may have the final say on that in the years ahead. **********BARBERA But your point is that they should get, at a minimum, the wage increase that allows them to benefit from their productivity contribution, which wouldn't generate any inflation. **********ROACH If in fact wages were equal to productivity, then real labor cost growth would stay forever at zero. But wages have now gone so far below the productivity curve, I think the risk is, in a fully employed labor market, and,  in my view, of an expanding global economy, that we're going to get into a period where wages move back above the productivity curve for a while for some of our more skilled irreplaceable occupations and that will bring the long-dormant wage cycle back to life at a time when no one thinks it can happen. **********BARBERA That begs another question, which is where we are in terms of the domestic employment situation. Over the past 12 months we had a substantial slowing in employment growth but no change in the unemployment rate until the January jump we just saw, because there was less participation in the labor force. I find that too convenient to sound right. We saw precisely the same thing in 1989: a sharp slowing in household employment, sharp slowing in labor force participation and no apparent rise in the unemployment rate. There's substantially more slack in the economy today than there was 12 months ago, a consequence of a material slowdown in employment growth, even if you look at January's plunge with a jaundiced eye. Some increase in wages is a very legitimate event in light of the productivity gains that we've seen. But I don't see any rampant wage-generated inflation pressures because a year-plus of  very slow growth has, as I see it, raised the de facto slack in the U.S. labor market. **********Q. Phil, can I hope for a raise? **********BRAVERMAN Well, you can hope. But that's about the extent of it. We happen to be somewhere in the middle on labor costs. The Germans are at the top end of the range with probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $23 to $26 an hour. The Japanese are close to $20, Americans, $17 an hour. And the Chinese, 54 cents. Now in between there are a lot of efficient, skilled workers available at $5 an  hour in Hong Kong and Korea and Taiwan. **********But it is inevitable that Americans, who are competing not only with the Japanese and Germans and are in a favorable position relative to that competition, but an unfavorable position relative to most of the rest of the world, are running nervous and scared and are literally losing jobs as production and services gradually shift away. Yes, we are gaining to some extent from Japanese and German companies. But the general sense of insecurity that is  taking place in the hearts and minds of most American workers is a key element in causing this slowdown in spending. It's not, in a recession, the people who are unemployed that cause the reduction in spending as much as it is the people  who are employed who fear they may become unemployed that call a halt to the postponable spending. And that's what we're beginning to see now. **********BARBERA There is also the issue of what's going on with real wages in the U.S. I have become one of the proponents of the notion that the Consumer Price Index is overstated and that it's gotten substantially worse over the last 10 years. If you believe that a consequence of the big move into high-technology equipment, a big move toward quality improvements rather than quantity, is to substantially overstate the C.P.I. . . . **********ROACH How much? Give us a ball park. **********BARBERA Leonard Nakamura at the Philly Fed thinks that it's about 2 1/2 to 3  percent. **********ROACH A year? **********BARBERA At present you essentially have more than a hundred percent of the measured inflation as measurement error.    ROACH So we've been in a period of deflation for how long? **********BARBERA He would say that we're right now slightly in deflation. **********ROACH Do you actually believe that? **********BARBERA I think that inflation is overstated by two percentage points. Do you actually believe that there's been no contribution from technological improvement over the last 15 years? **********ROACH I think the technological contribution has just started to click in. To just surmise that we have been riding the crest of this wonderful information age for 15 to 20 years and the productivity benefits have been accruing for all  of us for the entire period is wrong. **********BARBERA Look at medical care, for instance. Look at the extraordinary advances that have gone on in medical technology, and you realize that all of those advances are measured as inflation. It appears, according to official Government data, that we're spending more and more and more for less medical care due to the methodology that the C.P.I. uses. The reason I bring it up is it's interesting that there has not been any substantial and dramatic saber rattling within the labor markets despite what appears in the official data to be a devastation of real wages. I would submit that's because inflation is overstated significantly and real wages have been rising at about the trend rate that you saw in the previous period. **********ROACH I would submit, to the contrary, that Bill Clinton was elected in 1992  under the campaign credo of putting people first and that there is a strong sense of malaise and concern over stagnant real wages in the United States. The  A.F.L.-C.I.O. has just elected the most militant leader in about 40 years, John  Sweeney. **********Let's look at a few other facts that I think really underscore the fact that  this system is not delivering as we thought it should. The widening of the inequalities of income distribution in the 1990's is without precedent in the post-World War II history of the U.S. economy. The share of national income going to the owners of capital through corporate profits is surging. The share going to compensation is falling. This is not the way a democracy is supposed to work. This is not the way our free-enterprise capital system is supposed to allocate its income. So, a very small slice of America is benefiting from the competitive revival and the new-found prosperity. I think the second half of the 1990's is going to be about shifting the benefits of this productivity recovery to the workers who have made the contribution, and so I think we're going to see more in the way of real wage increases going forward than we have seen in the past decade. **********BRAVERMAN The problem is that most economists continue to view the U.S. economy the way they had when we were less exposed to an international competitive threat. We are now part of a global economy. We don't have the control, labor doesn't have the control, management doesn't have the control. The U.S. Government doesn't have the control. We are an open society. Not as much as we may be in some period ahead, but far more than we have been. Over a billion workers have been added to the labor force of the world. **********ROACH But what do they do? I mean, do these workers have the same skill set that, say, a machinist does who's assembling aircraft for Boeing? Do the Chinese really compete with Boeing's machinists? **********BRAVERMAN You use one of the few areas where the United States or a U.S. company has five years' worth of orders and is one of the premiere producers. Those workers producing for that particular company, in a particular industry, yes, still have a fair amount of clout. But you can't use that, what I view as a pretty isolated case, as a demonstration for the U.S.    ROACH I'll tell you why I can. The process of corporate restructuring, which  has been under way since the mid-1980's, is aimed at producing exactly the type  of example that we're seeing in Boeing. Boeing is a byproduct of a successful restructuring. And company after company has followed the same model. They're left with a core of workers that they need to deliver into their expanding global marketplace. And they have to pay those workers what those, that core of  their workers, are contributing. And that's why management elected to pay the machinists a real wage increase at Boeing for the first time in several years. I think you're going to see more of that down the road. **********BRAVERMAN There are spots here and there where highly skilled workers are in  relatively short supply in business. But the essence of business is to operate as lean as it possibly can. Companies don't have the ability to pass price increases through. And because they don't have that ability, they are downsizing, outsourcing and cutting fringe benefits and shifting production outside the U.S., if that's efficient. So the employees are more nervous. And because they're more nervous, not experiencing the income growth or the job security, they are holding back on their spending. That makes them very price sensitive. And that creates a virtuous inflation circle. **********Q. I'm not sure workers find it that virtuous.    BRAVERMAN Well, it's virtuous from the point of view of inflation being an evil. But this deflation can also be an evil. **********BARBERA The single best measure indicating that downsizing has only benefited the corporate sector is that real wages have gone nowhere for 15 years. But my contention is that the C.P.I. is meaningfully overstated and therefore the real  wage numbers have been substantially better, which means that downsizing is what it was supposed to be in the textbooks -- bad for you in the short run, because  you lose your job, good for you in the intermediate term because productivity goes up and real wages go up and living standards go up. Now there is a shift, no question, from wages to profits in terms of share of income. However, we had  an extraordinary decline in profits from 1966 to 1982, and we're about two-thirds of the way back to where we were in 1966. **********Q. Let me ask about a different kind of prices, bond prices. Should I buy bonds? **********BRAVERMAN Yes, definitely. I think most of the economic statistics overstate  the health of the U.S. economy and overstate inflation. I would say that we are  already seeing a C.P.I., if it were properly measured, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent. If you take historical norms over the last 200 years, when inflation wasn't running up the way it did in the 70's and 80's, we only got to current levels of bond yields in the midst of war, and a wartime inflationary environment, or in financial panics. Right now, we are talking about Treasury bond yields at 6 percent, substantially above the median of 4 1/4 percent of that 200-year experience. And if you take the historical relationships to inflation . . . **********ROACH What was the average budget deficit share of G.D.P. over the 200-year period? **********BRAVERMAN Well, we were running budget deficits in the Civil War, in the War  of 1812 and we still got bond yields of only 6 percent, where we are now. **********Q. Most of that time we also had the dollar anchored to the price of gold. **********BRAVERMAN There is no doubt that there were some unique advantages. But inflation, I look to be this year in the neighborhood of 2, 2 1/2 percent. Historical norm would suggest something in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 to at most  3 percent for the real rate, which would give you a 5 to 5 1/2 percent bond yield range this year. So, potentially, a full percentage point under current levels.    ROACH I think that there is one more leg to this rally in bonds as long as the Fed is perceived to be in a fairly aggressive easing mode, as is the case right now. I think that bond yields will fall lower, possibly down to 5 1/2 percent near term. But I would argue that that rally will be short-lived. And that investors should sell into that rally because I think the markets are just  too bulled up on the notion that the economy is going to flirt with recession and that inflation is dead and that meaningful deficit reduction is at hand. In  all three of those counts the markets are going to end up being disappointed. I  see bond yields moving back toward 7 percent in the second half of this year. **********BARBERA I'm quite concerned because our bond market bear has them at 5 1/2 percent near term. That gives me pause. The best friend that the bond had, in the second half of last year, was the Fed, which dragged its feet and extended this period of economic weakness. I believe the Fed is going to be a lot more aggressive in its easing in the first half of this year, and as a consequence, I think there's a lot less to the bond rally in the first half of this year than there was in the second half of last. Dare I mention stocks? **********Q. I haven't heard a number on bonds yet.    BARBERA I'd say, maybe we'll get to 5 3/4 percent on the long bond. In the second half you'll probably have rising rates. Likewise in the equity market in  the second half of last year, economically sensitive stocks had a disastrous relative performance. The rise for the stock market masked a sharp signal of cyclical deterioration. I would think with a more aggressive Fed, that trend reverses and in the first half of this year, economically sensitive stocks do substantially better. **********Q. And the overall market? **********BARBERA Modestly up. **********Q. Anyone else care to forecast stocks? **********ROACH We've been bullish on the stock market at Morgan Stanley for about four years, and my colleague Byron Wien is of the view that we've got one more leg to go in this stock rally. But he shares my view that a rise in long-term interest  rates, which will occur in the second half of this year, is a distinct negative  for stocks. We look for a sharp correction, in excess of 20 percent, in the second half of 1996.    BRAVERMAN Since I think the economy will slow and corporate earnings with it, even though I look for a very substantial decline in interest rates, which has been a positive for stocks, I think that by July the stock market will be hurt by failing expectations for earnings. That will cause a retrenchment in equities, perhaps 5 to 10 percent. **********Q. The Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, was cut to 5.25 percent from 5.5 percent last week. How low will it go? **********BRAVERMAN I look for the Fed to reduce it to 4 1/2 percent before Labor Day and to cut it further after the election. **********ROACH I think the Fed is not going to cut the funds rate even close to what Phil indicated and not as much as what the bond market is clearly expecting. If  the economy does O.K. and if wage trends continue to tick up as they have been doing over the last 24 months and if the global economy comes out of this mid-cycle pause, I think the Fed will actually shock the markets by contemplating a tightening in the second half of this year.    BARBERA I guess it comes down to whether you think the U.S. economy in 1995 slowed as a consequence of monetary policy. My sense is a doubling of short rates from 3 to 6 percent on Fed funds is the reason you had a sharp slowing in  everything you can measure in the U.S. economy in 1995. And then you've got to erase about half of that to put you back on a firmer trend for real economic growth. So 3 to 6 to slow it down; 6 to 4 1/2 to rev it up some. **********Q. Thanks. I'm absolutely confident you're not all right."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/10/world/ethiopian-army-attacks-3-towns-in-border-region-of-somalia.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1996-08-10", "snippet": "Ethiopian troops, tanks and helicopter gunships cross border into western Somalia and attack three towns, killing scores of people and seizing the Gedo region, a stronghold of a fundamentalist Islamic group that with the collapse of central author...", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ethiopian Army Attacks 3 Towns in Border Region of Somalia", "print_headline": "Ethiopian Army Attacks 3 Towns in Border Region of Somalia", "body_text": " **********Ethiopian troops, tanks and helicopter gunships have crossed the border into western Somalia and attacked three towns, killing scores of people, a Somali Muslim fundamentalist faction charged today. Workers for a Kenya-based Western relief organization confirmed the attack. **********High-ranking officials of a Somali group called the Union of Islam said two battalions of Ethiopian troops with tanks and helicopter gunships had seized the Gedo region of southwestern Somalia in fighting on Thursday night and this morning. **********The group said that the troops, tanks and helicopter gunships had swept through the towns of Dolo, Beled-Hawo and Lugh, and that the fighting was continuing. **********The area of the fighting is adjacent to the Ogaden, a harsh desert region controlled by Ethiopia but populated almost entirely by ethnic Somali nomads. In 1977, Somalia and Ethiopia waged a bitter war over control of the region. Ethiopia eventually prevailed with heavy support from the Soviet Union and Cuba. Still, nationalist sentiments still run high among many of the Somalis living there. **********The towns under attack are a stronghold of the Union of Islam, a fundamentalist Islamic group that with the collapse of central authority in Somalia, has carried on the fight for the Ogaden's independence from Ethiopia. **********The group has claimed responsibility for three bombings and one attempted assassination inside Ethiopia since January. **********In a statement released in Nairobi, Kenya, the fundamentalists said that more than 100 civilians and an unknown number of militiamen had been killed and that thousands of Somali families were fleeing because of the Ethiopian attack. **********The group said Dolo and Lugh had been captured by the Ethiopian forces and warned that the Ethiopian Government would have to bear the consequences of what it called a savage attack on Somalia. **********''We declare a holy war against the Ethiopians,'' said the group's leader, Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys. ''The invasion just shows the longtime desire of Ethiopia to occupy part of Somalia.'' **********Michael Gerber, director of the African Medical Research Foundation, told Reuters that four members of his staff had been evacuated by air from Lugh to Kenya today after the town was attacked. **********''They heard gunfire at 6 this morning,'' he said, ''and it got more and more extreme, so they called by radio two hours later for evacuation. **********Mr. Gerber said the European Union Humanitarian Operations agency had sent in a plane for the evacuation but it had been unable at first to land because three helicopter gunships had been flying in the area around Lugh. **********''Our people felt they definitely came from Ethiopia,'' he told Reuters. ''They were attacking Lugh. Our staff at the airport as they left saw Lugh under missile or artillery fire from across the Ethiopian border.'' No faction in Somalia is believed to have any aircraft. **********An Ethiopian Foreign Ministry spokesman in Addis Ababa declined to comment on the reports of the invasion, Reuters and BBC Radio reported. **********Since the collapse of central authority in Somalia after the overthrow of President Mohammed Siad Barre in 1991, rival clans have carved the nation up into fiefs, ruled mostly by young clansmen with guns. **********The Islamic Union is a faction made up of fervently religious people, mostly from the Ogadeni clan in Somalia. The group controlled Dolo and Lugh, having turned them into tiny Islamic city-states ruled according to strict Koranic codes. Even cigarette smoking was considered a crime in Lugh. **********The group, which has offices in Mogadishu, has also claimed responsibility for a violent campaign inside Ethiopia aimed at gaining independence for the Ogaden region. In January, a bomb at a hotel in Addis Ababa killed one person. A month later another bomb at a hotel in Diredawa took three lives. On Aug. 5, a third blast killed another man at a hotel in the capital. **********The Islamic Union has also said it was behind the attempted assassination of an ethnic Somali who is the Transportation Minister in the Ethiopian Government, Dr. Abdul Majid Hussein. **********Dr. Hussein heads a political party in the Ogaden that opposes breaking away from Ethiopia and is seen by some Somalis as a tool of the governing party. He was seriously wounded by gunfire outside his office in Addis Ababa in early July.

Mr. Kerovic also denied that there was any campaign to create panic among the Serbian residents about Muslim resettlement, because the Serbs already know that Muslims and Serbs cannot live together. **********''Not one Serb wants to live with them again,'' he said, referring to the Muslims who lived here before the war. ''We don't want them here. And we don't want to go back to our former homes on the Muslim side.'' **********But that view is not widespread among the Bosnian Serbs who have come here to live in homes vacated when the Muslims fled. **********''I know I'm living in someone else's house, and I wish with all my heart that his family could come back,'' said Slavka Ostojic, 47, a Serb, who with her 12-year old son came here after fleeing an ethnically mixed area when it was captured by Muslim forces three years ago. Like almost everyone else in this town, they are refugees. **********''We can't be happy until we go to our own homes,'' she said. ''All of us say that.'' **********Just as adamantly as Mr. Kerovic rejects the idea of Muslims and Serbs returning to their own homes and living together, Mrs. Ostojic is wistful about her house and her former neighbors, the Muslims as well as the Serbs. **********''But now, with all those things people in town are saying about the Muslims, I'm having dreams that if I try to go home, or if Muslims come here, they will kill us,'' she said. **********Mrs. Ostojic now works as a field hand and lives in a stranger's home with her son. All they have is 10 chickens and two cats. She does not return to her own home, about an hour and a half's drive away, because of her fear of Muslims. **********Her son, like most children here, has stayed out of school for the last two days, waiting for the order to evacuate the town in case the fighting resumes. If they had any money or another place to go, she said, they would have fled already. **********Today, the Muslims who tried once again to return to a hamlet on the nearby hill were kept away by NATO forces. Mrs. Ostojic said that, despite the yearnings of people here to live as they did before the war, fear rules.

In doing so, the Nigerians seemed to be emulating the approach of their own nation, whose intervention in 1990 was meant to stop the raging civil war but which many Liberians feel has sucked their country dry instead. **********The authorities of the Ivory Coast, meanwhile, rejected pleas from Washington to allow the Liberian passengers, many of them sick, off the ship, which has taken on six feet of water. They said that with 300,000 refugees already, the country could not accept one more boatload, and they contended that 2,000 of those on the ship were combatants. **********There was no mention, of course, from political leaders here that Liberia's civil war had begun with an invasion of rebels based here or that members of the principal armed faction, the National Patriotic Front, had been given easy passage across borders, treated as V.I.P.'s. **********[As the ship approached Ghana, it was intercepted by the Ghanaian Navy, Reuters reported.

Although the name officially stands for Ecowas Monitoring Group, the more apt gloss for Liberian civil war victims has been Everything That Could Move Is Gone, a reference to the force's longstanding efforts to strip Liberia of everything from its mineral wealth to machinery. **********The owners of the Bulk Challenge apparently followed suit. After they had scalped Liberians for a steep fare on a leaky boat and had even turned away many who had paid, some Liberians were angered to find stolen vehicles aboard. **********\"For the longest time we watched as Ecomog robbed our country and we just accepted it as the price of peace,\" said George Boley, the deputy chairman of Liberia's ruling Council of State, who was out of the country when the fighting  began in Monrovia and has not been able to return. \"Well, it turns out they have not been able to keep the peace, and they still want to rob us. Maybe they should just go back home.\" **********If indignation like this, directed primarily at Nigeria, has become common, there is also anger at the Ivory Coast and other French-speaking countries. For  many analysts of this region's affairs, the strong sway France holds over its former West African colonies is a key both to the start and the endurance of the Liberian war. According to this view, France, distrustful of Nigeria's emergence as a regional superpower, has discouraged its clients from involvement in peacekeeping. **********In his speech this week to a meeting of the Economic Community of West African State, President Jerry John Rawlings of Ghana made a stinging criticism  of his French-speaking counterparts who, he said, were \"unwilling to contribute  troops to a force meant to establish peace in our own subregion.\" **********There is also mounting criticism in this region of United States policy toward Liberia, a country founded in 1847 by freed American slaves. **********Few would say Washington has a responsibility to take in many of the tens of  thousands of fleeing Liberians.

The cabin crews of Lufthansa AG, Germany's flagship carrier, cannot roll out the drinks cart until an aircraft reaches cruising altitude, generally 10,000 feet, because of insurance regulations that do not apply to Lufthansa's foreign competitors. **********That means hectic and sometimes unfinished service on competitive routes of medium length such as Frankfurt-London. **********J\u00fcrgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, tells the story of the drinks cart to illustrate the tangle of regulations and the high costs that weigh down Lufthansa, which is about 35 percent-owned by the German government, as the airline industry in Europe moves toward the survival-of-the-fittest ethic prevalent in the United States. **********Despite years of cost-cutting, Lufthansa still finds itself vulnerable to price wars in the European market, including what it considers unfair price competition from Air France. **********The first half of 1996, understood to have been a time of plunging passenger loads and falling profit, could be just a foretaste of what will happen if Lufthansa misses its target of cutting 1.5 billion Deutsche marks ($984.6 million) in costs over the next five years. **********When Mr. Weber faces shareholders at Lufthansa's general meeting Wednesday, he is expected to disclose dismal first-half results. As price wars took their toll, a fatal fire in April devastated Germany's second-busiest airport, at D\u00fcsseldorf. With passengers forced to carry their own bags, the airline lost a third of its D\u00fcsseldorf business that month, and flights there are still not running at their old capacity. **********Having already cut costs severely in several areas, Lufthansa now must be more creative than ever in finding savings. It eventually wants to join the handful of pioneering German companies such as Deutsche Bank AG that link bonuses and pay to company performance. But that will mean a radical change in the corporate culture in a nation where unions cling to continuity. **********The travails at Lufthansa illustrate the way markets are forcing unwelcome changes on corporate Germany. For wage talks in the autumn, the airline is considering ideas including a wage freeze and longer hours and is even ready to ask unions to agree to cut their 30 days of annual vacation. **********Coming off record earnings in 1995, Lufthansa cannot expect anything but a fight from its unions, which swallowed what was then an unprecedented wage freeze four years ago, said Guy Kekwick, an analyst for Lehman Brothers. **********To make such concessions palatable, Mr. Weber wants to emulate Lufthansa's U.S. partner, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit, which used an innovative employee share-ownership plan in 1994 to save as much in one year as Lufthansa wants to save in five. After vesting its unions with a 55 percent stake, United can boast of baggage handlers who sprint to meet departure times. In a plan that could take years to implement, Mr. Weber wants to sell 20 percent of the company to employees. **********But what works in the United States might not fly in Germany, analysts warn. Even with the use of discounts to make the shares an attractive buy, success will be far from assured in Germany, where stocks are widely shunned in a risk-averse financial culture. Still, Lufthansa has little choice. Its hub in Frankfurt, where ground handling companies operate as a monopoly, ranks among the most expensive in Europe. **********In several ways, Lufthansa measures itself against British Airways, which already has lower labor costs and plans to cut \u00a31 billion ($1.5 billion) in costs over three years. Even Air France, which has posted losses since 1990, had an operating profit in its latest year, and financially troubled Alitalia this month agreed to sell a 20 percent stake to its unions in return for cost cuts. **********It may not be surprising that Lufthansa's managers are incensed at Air France. In April, Lufthansa joined two nonsubsidized European airlines in a complaint against Air France to the European Commission, asking the EU to block a proposed state payment of 5 billion French francs to the airline. The EU is still considering the matter; it would be Air France's third installment of state aid in as many years. **********Lufthansa's principal argument now is that an airline such as Air France, which apparently can still look to taxpayer bailouts, should not be allowed to undercut market prices on air fares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/24/business/company-reports-pepsico-earnings-rise-20-meeting-analyst-predictions.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1996-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Pepsico Earnings Rise 20%, Meeting Analyst Predictions", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS;Pepsico Earnings Rise 20%, Meeting Analyst Predictions", "body_text": " **********Pepsico Inc. reported strength in its worldwide snack business, its domestic  soft-drink system and its international fast-food restaurant operations yesterday, in a second-quarter performance that analysts said could enable the company to return to its traditional double-digit earnings growth by the end of  the year. **********Net income rose 20 percent, to $583 million, or 36 cents a share, from $487 million, or 30 cents a share, in the quarter last year, in line with analysts' expectations. **********These results included a gain of 1 cent a share, or $11 million after taxes, from the sale of Pepsico's restaurants to franchisees, and a gain of another penny a share, or $12 million, from an accounting change, the company said. **********\"The second quarter reflected solid operating momentum in Pepsico's core businesses,\" Andrew J.

He said reports last week of surprisingly weak retail sales and still subdued inflation \"only make it less likely the Fed will move Sept. 24.\" **********John Lipsky at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York said that \"although data remain benign, the weight of evidence still suggests that the economy is operating on the razor's edge of a potential rise in inflation and inflation expectations.\" Citing the acceleration in hourly wages, he said that \"other forward-looking indicators suggest that the economy is on the cusp of an inflation pick-up.\" **********But Philip Braverman, a New York-based analyst at DKB Securities and nearly a lone contrarian, said the Fed would ultimately cut interest rates in response to economic sluggishness and subdued inflation. **********For traders, however, what counted last week was the prospect that there would be no immediate rate increase \u2014 and that meant massively reversing positions that had been built on the assumption rates would rise. **********The suspicion of many analysts is that the powerful rise in the price of bonds and stocks was largely driven by short-sellers rushing to repurchase assets they had sold on the expectation prices would fall. **********Judging by the exceptionally heavy volume of international bonds offered last week, it would appear that demand for U.S. dollar paper is substantial. But that may be accounted for by the record amounts of outstanding dollar bonds maturing. Redemptions of dollar bonds in the third quarter, mainly in September, and in the final quarter are estimated to be running at $25 billion each. Such flows are typically reinvested in the same currency. **********Some analysts see more to it than that. Peter von Maydell, a London-based analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said: \"It's a yield story.\" The interest-rate differential between the yield on 10-year U.S. and German government bonds had hit a two-year high, with U.S. paper paying 63 basis points more, although by the end of the week the rally in New York had cut that back to a 54 basis-point gain. As recently as March, for example, it was the other way around, with yields on German paper above American levels. **********Jan Loeys at J.P. Morgan in London, said: \"Many international investors have been underweight in exposure to the dollar and the U.S. bond market and are likely to be rebuilding positions.\" **********Neil MacKinnon at Citibank in London also cited the dollar's inability to sustain its midweek level of 1.5171 Deutsche marks, the highest it has been since early July. He said that supported his view that fund managers already owned, or were long, the currency, and while there was incentive to sell the dollar, or go short, there was also no reason for them to add to existing positions. **********The dollar ended trading at 1.5140 DM in New York, a rise of 1.4 percent over the week. Mr. MacKinnon said he expected that \"at the outer limit, the dollar might get up to 1.55 DM.\" But Mr. von Maydell forecast \"a slow grind up toward 1.60 DM early next year.\" **********A substantial portion of three global dollar bonds offered last week were sold into the United States. Domestic investors are estimated to have taken 50 percent of the $1 billion 10-year bonds sold by the European Investment Bank and nearly 70 percent of the $500 million callable issues from the federal mortgage agencies Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. **********Most new issues were for maturities of five years or less, which reflected the defensive nature of the market. **********Attracting the most attention were the jumbo $1.5 billion Italian issue, which was priced to yield 24 basis points over comparably dated U.S. government paper; the $500 million issue from the Export-Import Bank of Korea priced at 44 basis points over the benchmark; and $400 million from France Telecom, which made its debut in the dollar market. **********Britain is expected to issue this week a 10-year, $2 billion issue to complete refinancing of a $4 billion floating rate note maturing at the end of this month. The first part of the refinancing was completed in July when it sold $2 billion of five-year notes. **********The only scheduled issue in marks is South Africa's seven-year issue of up to 500 million DM."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/business/keycorp-plans-to-shed-280-branches-and-cut-2700-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Saul Hansell", "pub_date": "1996-11-26", "snippet": "Keycorp announces vast cost-cutting effort; says it will sell more than 140 rural Key Bank branches, close another 140 branches and eliminate 2,700 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force; Keycorp will take advantage of interstate branching la...", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Keycorp Plans to Shed 280 Branches and Cut 2,700 Jobs", "print_headline": "Keycorp Plans to Shed 280 Branches and Cut 2,700 Jobs", "body_text": " **********Keycorp, which built an iconoclastic reputation as the banker to small towns from Maine to Alaska, said yesterday that it would abandon the country for big-city life. **********In a vast cost-cutting effort, Keycorp said it would sell more than 140 rural Key Bank branches, close another 140 branches and eliminate 2,700 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force. **********Keycorp's stock jumped $2.375 a share, to $51.25, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Keycorp, which is based in Cleveland, also said it would take advantage of the interstate branching law that takes effect in April to combine its 12 separate banks into a single bank with branches in 14 states. The bank said it would take a charge of $100 million in the fourth quarter to cover severance pay and other costs from these moves. **********In all, Keycorp's network of 1,218 branches is to be cut by 23 percent, part of a nationwide trend among larger banks to save money by handling transactions by means of the telephone and automated teller machines rather than human tellers. The new program comes after Keycorp has already closed 83 branches this year. **********''Customer behavior is changing and we have to change with them,'' said Robert G. Jones, Keycorp's executive vice president in charge of consumer banking. He said Keycorp's telephone center now opens as many loans as 120 branches. **********Keycorp decided to sell the rural branches because they do not fit into its new banking strategy, which it began last year. The new approach is to designate certain accounts and certain officials in each branch to serve specific groups of customers: the affluent, the elderly and the ''mass market.'' **********This strategy has been improving the profitability of Keycorp's operations in larger towns and cities, but it does not work, Mr. Jones said, in rural areas where there are not enough of any of these groups to allow this specialization. Keycorp intends to sell groups of rural branches to other banking companies by the end of next year, he said. He declined to say which locations would be closed or sold. **********Keycorp has been the subject of takeover rumors in recent months, but analysts said that with a market capitalization in excess of $11 billion, the company could most likely preserve its independence. And the moves announced yesterday can only help fend off unwanted suitors, analysts said. **********''They can choose their own destiny, provided they can deliver the performance,'' Joseph Duwan, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said. **********The company said it hopes to cut its expenses from 60 percent of its revenue to 55 percent of revenue by the end of 1997. It told analysts that before the cost-cutting moves announced yesterday it would not have achieved its goal of 12 percent earnings growth next year, but that now it will increase profit by 15 percent. **********With high expenses and slow growth ever since its merger with the Society Corporation in 1994, Keycorp has largely disappointed investors and analysts. Last year, the company announced an elaborate plan, called First Choice 2000, meant to improve its marketing, but analysts say the benefits of this plan have been slow to appear. **********''They had a lot of good ideas that made long-term sense, but we hadn't seen the results,'' said Dennis Shea, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. ''This is much more short-term, results-oriented.'' **********Originally based in Albany, Keycorp championed small-town banking, while the Cleveland-based Society had a big-city orientation. Analysts characterized yesterday's announcement as the final indication that Society's culture had vanquished the old Keycorp. **********Keycorp's pullout from rural America is just the latest sign that it is hard to run a nationwide banking company that keeps the local flavor of a hometown bank. Banc One, the once high-flying Columbus, Ohio, banking company, last year decided to end its 25-year-old ''uncommon partnership,'' which gave power to local bank presidents, in favor of a central national command structure. **********The merger into one nationwide bank will let Keycorp customers make deposits and other transactions at its branches nationwide. Now customers must use branches in their home states, though they can use all Keycorp A.T.M.'s. **********Analysts said that other banks would be taking advantage of the nationwide branching laws to consolidate disparate banks into one. **********These consolidations, however, will put increasing pressure on state banking regulators across the country. In the century-old dual banking system, banks can choose to be regulated either by states or by the Federal Government through its Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Until now, many Keycorp banks have had state charters, but it will now merge them into one federally chartered bank. **********Separately, Keycorp said that its board has authorized the repurchase of 12 million shares -- about 5 percent of the shares outstanding -- through the end of next year. The company has already bought about that many shares this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/worldbusiness/IHT-a-few-more-crises-over-euro-on-horizon-eu.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1996-12-16", "snippet": "The European Union's agreement on a budget stability pact has given almost irreversible momentum to the single currency planned for 1999, but the heated debate over the pact's details merely signaled the start of a political struggle over the euro...", "word_count": 5149, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'A Few More Crises' Over Euro on Horizon : EU Accord:Only Start Of the Battle", "print_headline": "'A Few More Crises' Over Euro on Horizon : EU Accord:Only Start Of the Battle", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/05/business/international-briefs-philips-acquisition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Philips Acquisition", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Philips Acquisition", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/23/business/international-briefs-euro-disney-says-loss-narrowed-in-winter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Euro Disney Says Loss Narrowed in Winter", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Euro Disney Says Loss Narrowed in Winter", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/04/business/international-gift-giving-may-be-worthwhile-business-practice-but-there-can-be.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Finney", "pub_date": "1996-12-04", "snippet": "Business Travel column offers suggestions and caveats for corporate gift giving to foreign business contacts (M)\u00c8", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International gift-giving may be a worthwhile business practice, but there can be pitfalls.", "print_headline": "International gift-giving may be a worthwhile business practice, but there can be pitfalls.", "body_text": " **********IT'S global gift-giving time for corporate travelers who want to maintain a warm relationship with key foreign contacts. Whatever the recipient's religion -- maybe Buddhist rather than Christian -- the holidays are an excuse to celebrate the new year and say ''thank you.'' **********''Anything with a world motif is very popular,'' said John S. Petterson, an executive at Tiffany's, whose blue boxes are more of a status symbol to many, particularly Japanese, than the silver, crystal and other gifts inside. **********Letitia Baldrige, a corporate etiquette adviser, said many recipients ''like ties of American design -- Ralph Lauren, Sulka, Hilfiger -- so long as they wear ties at all,'' noting that neckwear is inappropriate for some Muslim or Hindu recipients. She added, ''If it's a businesswoman on your gift list, send American scarves from Donna Karan or Oscar de la Renta. And don't forget the secretaries.'' **********In any case, paying homage to your best contacts abroad at Christmas is a ''strategic'' matter, as a protocol consultant, Sondra Snowdon, put it. ''Do your homework. For instance, the French exchange gifts during the first two weeks of January. Brand-name gifts often have more impact than handicrafts. Also be aware that the cost of foreign customs duties in some cases is greater than the value of the gift. Above all, don't give a gift that's an insult -- like leather to a Muslim.'' **********Ms. Baldrige acknowledges that she almost blew it when she put in an order -- later canceled -- for 68 blue-leather picture frames for her boss, Jacqueline Kennedy, then the First Lady, to send to dignitaries and friends in Muslim countries. **********''The nuances of religion and protocol can make gift selection tricky,'' Mr. Petterson said. ''A crystal decanter or silver corkscrew may be beautiful but not what you should send to an executive in an Arab country where alcohol is prohibited.'' **********Like many multinational companies, Citicorp lets its local offices in 98 countries choose -- or monitor -- what is given, although there are tight guidelines. **********But the main inhibitor to any lavish gift-giving is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The law specifically prohibits gifts to foreign officials that might be construed as a bribe. That can take in a lot of territory, considering the extent of government ownership of industry in countries like China and Italy. **********The good news, said Danforth Newcomb, a lawyer and an expert on corporate gifts and honorariums at Shearman & Sterling, is that Congress amended the anti-bribery law in 1988 to allow ''reasonable and bona fide'' gifts. The law '' doesn't affect gifts between private parties, say an American C.E.O. and a German C.E.O.,'' he said. **********Can such gifts be expensive? ''We've created one-of-a-kind pieces worth $250,000 and above for executives,'' Mr. Petterson said. **********Carat and Stick **********Delta Air Lines and Belgium's Sabena are good code-sharing companions, interchangeably flying brigades of American business travelers to and from Brussels, the capital of the European Union. But their frequent-flier programs aren't so chummy: You can earn Delta miles on any Sabena flight -- but Sabena miles only on Delta's code-shared connecting flights in the United States. **********However, the Belgian carrier's frequent-flier program has a mileage award that may encourage membership: diamond stick pins, pendants and necklace ornaments. **********It takes 560,000 miles, or points, to earn a one-carat diamond, with smaller stones available for fewer miles. Sabena's partners, where points can also be accumulated, include American Express Membership Rewards, Austrian Airlines, Avis, Diners Club, Hilton International and Swissair."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/business/mitsubishi-wants-settlement-of-us-sexual-harassment-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1996-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mitsubishi Wants Settlement Of U.S. Sexual Harassment Suit", "print_headline": "Mitsubishi Wants Settlement Of U.S. Sexual Harassment Suit", "body_text": " **********Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, which is facing potentially the biggest Federal sexual harassment lawsuit in history, wants to settle the case,  the top executive at the company said today. **********In his first interview since the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed its suit about two weeks ago, Tsuneo Ohinouye, chairman and chief executive of the Japanese-owned company, also said the company had dismissed 10  male employees, 4 of them this year, for sexually harassing women workers at its automobile factory in Normal, Ill. The company is a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan. **********The executive's comments about a possible settlement seem to indicate a softening of stance by the company. Until now, the company has been criticized for taking a hard line against the charges and for sending busloads of employees to stage a demonstration in Chicago on Monday against the lawsuit. **********[In Washington, a spokeswoman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Claire E. Gonzales, said, \"We would certainly be encouraged by the possibility of resolution of an issue like this.\" **********Ms. Gonzales said that the chairman of the commission, Gilbert F. Casellas, \"has expressed an openness to settlement discussions.\"] **********The commission's lawsuit contended that there was pervasive sexual harassment of as many as 700 women who work or once worked at the 4,000-employee factory in Illinois. Among the charges were that women were groped in their private parts and were subjected to crude language. Mitsubishi has been sued privately by 29 of the women. **********Speaking by telephone from Illinois, Mr. Ohinouye insisted today that the Chicago rally was the initiative of employees and that the company never intended to defy the Federal agency. \"From the beginning we have had settlement  in mind,\" he said. \"We have no intention to attack the E.E.O.C. or fight the E.E.O.C.\" **********The executive, who returned last weekend from a trip to Japan, said executives at the parent company also \"apparently\" wish for a settlement. \"They  always say that in any litigation between the company and the U.S. Government they wish to have a settlement.\" **********Mr. Ohinouye (pronounced oh-ee-no-way), in an attempt to counter charges that his company turned a deaf ear to complaints from its women employees, said management had dealt with 89 cases of sexual harassment since the plant started  operations in 1987. **********In 10 cases, he said, male workers were dismissed, and in 3 other cases they  were demoted. Many of the other cases resulted in verbal or written warnings. In only four instances, he said, did the company decide that the women's complaints had no merit. **********\"There were serious incidents,\" he said. \"We made a complete survey and fired some male workers.\" Still, he said, the company might need to take more stern measures to eliminate the problem. **********\"We thought we did enough but we intend to do more in the future,\" he said. \"The objective should be zero cases of sexual harassment. That's our target after this incident.\" **********Of the 10 employees dismissed for sexual harassment, 4 left this year. At least one employee was dismissed for placing a photograph from a sex party in the locker of a woman employee. **********Mr. Ohinouye said that news reports of hundreds of cases were exaggerated. As for the private lawsuit, he said that half the complaints were for sexual discrimination, not harassment. \"Pure sex harassment is only 14 cases, and we feel two-thirds of them may be weak in foundation.\" **********The number of sexual harassment complaints at the factory rose sharply to a peak of 25 in 1994. Mr. Ohinouye said that occurred because the company began taking stronger measures to encourage complaints, not because of a growing problem. **********But Mr. Ohinouye, who has been chief executive of the plant since late in 1991, said that it was unfair to say, as some news reports have, that sexual harassment was tolerated because of cultural practices in Japan. He said workers and management sent to Illinois from Japan are trained in advance about American customs. For instance, he said, Japanese employees are told not to bring Japanese weekly magazines, many of which contain photographs of naked women, to  the factory because that would constitute sexual harassment. **********Until 1991, the factory was half-owned the by Chrysler Corporation and management was split between Japanese and Americans. Since Mitsubishi bought out Chrysler's share, the top management has become mainly Japanese. About 60 of the 4,000 employees at the plant are Japanese, he said. All the workers who were dismissed for sexual harassment were American, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/09/news/malaysia-moves-to-rein-in-radical-islamic-fundamentalism.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1996-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Malaysia Moves to Rein In Radical Islamic Fundamentalism", "print_headline": "Malaysia Moves to Rein In Radical Islamic Fundamentalism", "body_text": " **********KUALA LUMPUR\u2014                     Malaysia is acting to curb radical Islamic fundamentalism and strengthen the modern form of the religion advocated by the government of Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad. **********In doing so, it has reassured the country's non-Muslim minorities, which make up about 40 percent of the population of 19 million, that they will not be subject Islamic law. **********By threatening to use the federal government's power to take over the administration of a state that violates the constitution, Mr. Mahathir forced Kelantan \u2014 the only one of Malaysia's 13 states not under the control of his governing coalition \u2014 to suspend its plan to carry out harsh Islamic laws similar to those imposed by the triumphant Taleban fundamentalist militia in Afghanistan. **********The laws proposed for Muslims in Kelantan prescribed stoning to death for adultery, amputation of hands for theft and 40 lashes of the cane for drinking liquor. **********Nuraini Othman, a Malaysian university lecturer in sociology, said that in making Kelantan shelve the Islamic code last week, Mr. Mahathir had cited the federal government's authority over criminal law under the constitution. **********She said that the outcome was important because the legal code proposed by Kelantan was \"the hallmark of an Islamic state\" and would have caused widespread concern among non-Muslims, as well as moderate Muslims, in Malaysia. **********While Islam is the country's official religion, non-Muslims are guaranteed freedom of worship under the constitution. **********Mr. Mahathir wants to make Islam compatible with Malaysia's rapid economic growth and modernization, while preserving harmony between majority Malays, nearly all of whom are Muslims, and minority groups, chiefly non-Muslim Chinese and Indians. **********He told an international conference of Muslim missionaries last month that over the centuries, Muslims had lost their skills, knowledge and strength \u2014 and also the respect for Islam by non-Muslims. **********As a result, Muslim countries today were \"totally weak, dependent upon and often subservient to the big powers,\" he said. **********To regain the world's respect, Mr. Mahathir said, Muslims must show that Islam was not \"an obstacle to worldly progress, skillful administration, development, wealth generated by skills in industry and commerce, and has the strength to defend those in need of help, be they Muslim or otherwise.\" **********The Malaysian government has warned that it will use the Internal Security Act to check the spread of Shiite belief, which it says could cause serious divisions among Muslims in the country. **********The act allows detention without trial for up to two years with subsequent extensions. **********Followers of Sunnism and Shiism, the two main branches of Islam, have frequently been at odds, and sometimes at war, with each another in various parts of the world.

He lost his house, his farm and all his possessions on July 23 at 9:50 A.M., when the main dike holding back the Yangtze gave way here and a 30-foot wall of water wiped clean the slate of his life. **********More than half of this village of two dozen houses disappeared as people scampered up undamaged parts of the dike and watched in horror as the brown flood did its awesome work. **********''First the tree collapsed and smashed the house, and then the house began to wash away,'' Mr. Wu said earlier this month in an interview as he stood with mud-caked feet outside the tent where he now lives with many members of his extended family. Their firewood piles and clotheslines were strewn pitifully along the canted remnant of the dike. **********''This is the property of a lifetime that we lost,'' he said. ''I can't farm. I have no money. I have no house and winter is coming. Please tell the Government. We want some support.'' **********A few dozen miles away, Liu Yueyi sat among a pile of bricks that was once her home, scraping mortar off the reusable ones. ''Look at me,'' she said. ''Here I am, over 70 years old, and I no longer have a home.'' **********She and her husband had been fish farmers at Longkou, where town officials opened a dike on Aug. 18 to relieve the pressure of the surging Yangtze River. ''All of our income came from the fish farm,'' she said, ''but all the fish swam away in the flood. Now we are living one day to the next.'' **********It has been this way throughout China's history. First comes the deluge, then the long, grinding recovery, which far outlives the world's passing notice of China's relentless -- and increasingly frequent -- natural disasters. **********A huge population only magnifies the devastation, as millions of Chinese are forced to live and farm in the shadow of high earthen dikes holding back the country's major rivers. The strength and integrity of the dikes can only be tested when the torrent arrives. And where disaster strikes, for years afterward it saps the energy of the Chinese countryside and, over the centuries, has prevented Chinese in flood-prone regions from climbing out of poverty. **********Under Communist rule since 1949, the Government has put about $27 billion, or 4 percent of all public spending, into water-control projects, including the construction of 120,000 miles of dikes. But that has still not been enough. **********Even the vaunted Three Gorges Dam, which is to be the world's largest flood-control and hydroelectric project, will only help when the summer monsoons drench the Yangtze River basin upstream from the dam site at Yichang in central China. That leaves more than 100 million people in the flood-prone regions of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces vulnerable to the kind of drenching that struck this summer. **********More than 2,700 Chinese have died this year in floods, and more than 4.4 million were left homeless by flood waters that also left at least eight million acres of cropland unproductive for the balance of the year, according to United Nations estimates. In 1995, more than 2,000 died in floods; in 1994 more than 5,000, and in 1991, 5,000 lost their lives in the largest flood of the decade. That disaster left eight million homeless and damaged 35 million acres of cropland. With the decade scarcely half over, the death toll is more than 20,000, and the number of houses washed away or damaged exceeds five million. **********By comparison, the flood that struck the American Midwest in 1993 killed 50 people and left 70,000 homeless. **********The most devastating floods in this century have all taken place in China. In 1931, the Yangtze and Huai Rivers roared out of their banks and killed an estimated 225,000 people. Two years later, a Yellow River flood killed 18,300. In 1954, the Yangtze surged again and killed 34,000 in a disaster that inspired Mao Zedong to promote huge waterworks that could control the nation's floods. **********The most lethal flood of the century, however, was man-made. In 1938, China's Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, blew up the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou to stop the invading Japanese Army. The flood killed an estimated 890,000 Chinese, but gained only three months. **********But over geological time, nature has conspired powerfully against what would become China. The collision of tectonic plates in Asia has heaved the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau to such heights over the last 40 million years that it has created a topographic flood machine where giant rivers crash down from altitudes of 20,000 feet to heavily populated alluvial plains. **********And now, changing weather patterns in the Pacific Ocean, perhaps caused by global warming, have added to China's woes. Studies at the National Meteorological Center blame the more frequent appearance of the mysterious El Nino current in the Pacific on more intense monsoons that wash central and southern China, including the Yangtze River drainage area, where 350 million people live. **********''Forest cutting in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is also a factor in the increasing frequency of flooding,'' says Arthur N. Holcombe, the United Nations Development Fund director in Beijing. ''There is far more runoff today, and the absorptive capacity of the land is less. This has implications for repeated flooding in the future.'' **********While the Yangtze region was the scene of this summer's worst floods, the condition of the Yellow River diking system in northern China has entered a period of even greater danger, as the summer rains pushed the river to its highest recorded level. **********The Yellow River's crest of 94.73 meters -- more than 310 feet -- at Huayuankou in Henan province occurred even though the volume of water was only a third the volume of a much greater Yellow River flood in 1958. **********This means that the Yellow River is now so choked with mud that its bed has risen to a dangerous new height above the plain. In effect, the river flows ''suspended'' between high dike walls at an elevation as much as 30 feet higher than the plain. Any major flood in northern China now holds the potential to breach the main dikes that contain the river, with disastrous consequences. Once the river breaks through the dikes, the water cannot flow back into the suspended channel and must find a new path to the sea. **********Although China has made prodigious efforts to contain the torrent of its major rivers, the task of lifting its flood victims out of their misery often proves overwhelming and, in the end, millions of Chinese are left destitute, relying on the charity of relatives or friends to survive. **********For Westerners, often moved by the plight of China's flood-stricken poor, there is no certainty that donated aid reaches those who need it most. Under Communist rule, the Ministry of Civil Affairs in Beijing has year after year mobilized immediate flood-relief efforts to rescue and evacuate flood victims, and to provide temporary shelter and modest portions of food. But extended flood recovery remains the responsibility of local governments. **********Statistics issued by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs tell the story. Although more than four million Chinese were left homeless by the flood, the Chinese Government reported distributing only 3,000 tents for temporary shelter. **********In many flood zones, local governments tend to channel funds toward rebuilding state-owned and township enterprises that provide the tax and employment base of the affected region. **********The peasants are often told to rely on themselves, to resurrect a livelihood from their ruined fields without any assistance in replacing all that has been washed away. In Longkou, Liu Xiangdao and his family saved only those belongings that could be carried to the second floor of the house before the dike was opened on Aug. 18. **********''We have no work unit,'' said Mr. Liu, referring to state-run urban workplaces through which housing and other social-welfare benefits are distributed. ''So no one has taken care of us. People who worked for the brick factory or the fish farm got a little rice, but we got nothing.'' **********A Longkou official said the province authorities had promised $36,000 for rebuilding the hardest-hit section of the city, but added that only two-thirds of the money had arrived and that it was being used to rebuild a brick factory. **********Here in Gaohuang, it is the same. In this village, no help has arrived beyond the half-dozen tents distributed in the days after the dike broke. Local governments also distributed a small bag of rice for each family member and, in some cases, the equivalent of $10 to $15 for clothes or vegetables. **********In the month that has followed, though, nothing more has come. **********''We hear that the government has received some donations, but nothing has reached our hands,'' said Mr. Wu. ''The government says it is going to use the supplies for the next flood, so the donated material is frozen.'' **********Shaking his head, he said, ''It should reach the victims.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/23/business/law-knows-no-city-limits-as-new-york-s-firms-thin-out-outsiders-rush-in.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1996-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Law Knows No City Limits;As New York's Firms Thin Out, Outsiders Rush In", "print_headline": "Law Knows No City Limits;As New York's Firms Thin Out, Outsiders Rush In", "body_text": " **********Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, a 118-year-old Pittsburgh law firm, had consciously avoided the costs and competition in New York. Last year it hired an international lawyer, Alan A. D'Ambrosio, away from the New York firm of Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis and put him in charge of a new Reed Smith office in Manhattan. \"We realized that we could never get a reputation in the international arena without a New York office,\" said David W. Christopher, Reed Smith's chief administrative officer. **********Pitney, Hardin, Kipp & Szuch, a 150-lawyer firm in Morristown, N.J., opened a tiny New York office two years ago to serve one domestic client. Now it is expanding that office, in hopes of wooing foreign business. \"Offshore clients won't even consider you unless you are in New York,\" said Clyde A. Szuch, a partner. **********Linklaters & Paines, the mammoth London firm, used to send lawyers to New York regularly to advise American investors about London-based capital markets.  Linklaters now has 25 full-time New York lawyers. \"Our business is servicing the capital flow, and now that flow is both ways,\" said David M. Barnard, a New York-based partner. **********At a time when New York law firms large and small are struggling -- and some  even collapsing -- under the burdens of huge overheads, defecting partners and squeezed fees, out-of-town firms are gleefully expanding in New York. \"It seems  every large law firm wants to be here,\" said Klaus Eppler, president of the New  York County Lawyers Association. **********Apparently so. According to The New York Law Journal, between 1990 and 1995 the number of lawyers at the 25 largest New York branch offices of out-of-town firms grew by 27 percent, to 1,821; the numbers at the 25 largest homegrown firms shrank 4 percent, to 7,409. **********Meanwhile, small branch offices keep opening.  The influx is so great that the Association of the Bar of the City of New York is, for the first time, compiling a list of those offices so it can notify them of association services  and prod them to do pro bono work. \"Now there are just too many for us to keep up,\" an association spokeswoman said. For their part, old-time New York lawyers  profess not to be worried about the competition. \"The firms that did not survive had serious management problems and cultural problems,\" said Jerome C. Katz, a partner in Chadbourne & Parke, a 94-year-old New York firm. \"You can't infer from the breakup of a few law firms that the demand for exceptionally good lawyers isn't still very high.\" **********But why are the out-of-towners all coming now? Mr. Katz has an answer for that, too. \"Their markets have matured, and lawyers are always searching for new demand,\" he said. \"For us that meant opening four offices overseas in five years; for out-of-town firms, it means opening offices in New York.\" Perhaps most important, New York -- historically a hub for finance and corporate law -- is finally a nut that can be cracked. **********New industries are opening here -- interactive technology is the most visible one -- that have no entrenched connections with local law firms. And international business traffic in and out of New York is increasing exponentially. More foreign banks are lending money to New York landlords, more  foreign retailers are opening stores, more foreign investors are buying property and even companies. **********All of them need New York lawyers to ease their way, but few have longstanding legal relationships in the city. And when they do, it is generally  with a lawyer, not a firm. As recently as a decade ago that was a specious distinction: lawyers and law firms bonded for life. Today, lawyers readily take  clients from firm to firm. **********Indeed, entire ready-made practices are becoming available, as many New York  law firms succumb to an array of strains that collectively apply relentless economic pressure on once-stable practices. Many have invested heavily in new computer systems that among other things can fit an entire law library on a few  disks but that ironically enable them to do a client's work more quickly and thus reduce their billable hours. Many are still paying huge rents and salaries they agreed to in the high-flying 1980's. Yet many are being pressed by corporations to do more for less, or lose the business. **********The toll has been high. Shea & Gould, once the epitome of legal prestige and  opulence, dissolved amid partner bitterness two years ago. Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith and Bower & Gardner are gone, victims of high costs and too-rapid  expansion. Townley & Updike just went down. Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon is disbanding. **********The out-of-town firms are happily picking the carcasses. Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, once firmly ensconced in Philadelphia, picked up nearly 60 partners from Lord, Day & Lord, and now has about 200 lawyers in New York, almost as many as it has at home. Mudge Rose lawyers are at the New York offices of the Los Angeles firms of Latham & Watkins and O'Melveny & Myers, and of San Francisco-based Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. Orrick, in fact, has built almost its entire 125-member New York office by lifting practices from other firms. **********\"It is great when you take entire practices because the lawyers are used to working together; they feel stable,\" said Ralph H. Baxter Jr., Orrick's chairman. **********The availability of a juicy law practice can actually tip the scales for an out-of-town firm weighing a New York move or expansion. A few years ago, Orrick  found out that the 12-member labor law department of Baer, Marks & Upham was ready to move, and voila, Orrick started a New York labor practice. \"If they had been in Washington, we would have done it there,\" Mr. Baxter said. **********Similarly, until recently Reed Smith's growth strategy involved spattering the Middle Atlantic region with satellite offices, the most recent in Princeton, N.J., in 1994.  New York was not part of the equation until Mr. D'Ambrosio, whose client roster includes Gucci and other high-profile European companies, said he would join. **********\"Until then, the idea of New York was a skeleton we'd periodically dust off,  talk about fleshing out, then just put back into the closet,\" said Daniel I. Booker, the firm's managing partner. **********Firms like Reed, Smith have discovered that a New York beachhead not only gives them access to new clients but also lets them wrench more business from existing ones. **********Dimeling, Schreiber & Park, a Philadelphia management buyout firm -- and a Reed, Smith client -- has often been forced by New York lenders to get opinions  from New York lawyers. Now it will steer that business to Reed, Smith. \"We save  the cost of educating two law firms on one transaction, and we avoid the higher  New York law firm fees,\" said William R. Dimeling, a partner. **********The cost differential can be considerable. Mr. Szuch, for example, suggests that a top New Jersey lawyer would charge maybe $350 or $375 an hour, while an associate's time would be billed at $150 to $175. Their New York equivalents, Mr. Szuch says, would be charging at least $100 an hour more. **********It is not surprising that many out-of-town firms ship the necessary legal scut work back to the home office, where associates' salaries and office rents are lower than in New York. \"That's why we can offer New York law at New Jersey  prices,\" Mr. Szuch said. **********And they can measure their growth, hiring lawyers as they need them, and cherry-picking practice areas to avoid those where local legal stars seem to have a lock on the biggest clients. **********\"We'll stick with our mainstay real estate, international and corporate law practice,\" Mr. D'Ambrosio of Reed, Smith said. \"We won't compete in product liability, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, or other areas where we can do it cheaper, but not necessarily better.\" **********The new firms also often have more manageable real estate costs. Rents are nowhere near as high as they were in the 1980's, when many New York firms were locked into long-term leases. And today's clients often view fancy offices not as symbols of success, but as signs of ostentation and fee bloating. **********Many new firms try to compromise between shabby and chic, and choose either a fancy building or a fancy address. Linklaters is in the \"Lipstick building,\" a smart building on mundane Third Avenue at 53d Street, because \"being on Park or  Fifth was never important to us,\" Mr. Barnard said. Orrick last year moved into  666 Fifth Avenue, a nice address for a fairly old, albeit recently renovated, building at 52d Street. **********\"Our offices look professional, but not opulent,\" Mr. Baxter said. \"Our clients won't think we're spending too much money on overhead, but they won't think they are at a discount center, either.\" **********Of course, not all out-of-town firms are immune to the practices that felled  some of their New York predecessors. **********Linklaters, for one, plans to recruit a half-dozen or so graduates from top law schools. Mr. Barnard is ready to pay top dollar for them -- and charge top dollar for their services. \"The guys who say, 'Hey, we're from Pittsburgh and don't pay our lawyers as much,' are making a statement about how they value expertise,\" he said. **********Reed, Smith's new office is in the Seagram Building, the elegant 52d Street tower on Park Avenue that has some of New York's highest rents. Mr. Christopher  insists that while American clients may be glitz-averse, offshore clients are not. **********\"We know we are paying a premium, but if you want to establish an international boutique, you do want the Park Avenue image,\" he said.  Mr. Booker added, \"We see New York as important for marketing purposes in a way that the Princeton office, say, is not.\" **********That attitude, even among firms in less spectacular digs, may give the out-of-town firms their most formidable competitive weapon. Many feel less pressure to meet high costs with high fees because they see their New York offices as marketing tools for the rest of the firm. **********\"We'd never say, 'All right, New York, your expenses were this but your revenues were that, buck up,' \" Mr. Baxter of Orrick said. \"New York may send great clients to California.\" **********Still, even with lower expectations, the New York newcomers may still hit obstacles. New York firms, angry at the competition, may stop making lucrative referrals to them in their hometowns. They may grow to the point where their costs simply cannot be absorbed by marketing budgets, and where their partners indulge in the same kind of infighting that killed Shea & Gould. **********\"When you start merging people who come from different firms, the sense of a  cohesive culture frays,\" warned Barbara Paul Robinson, the New York bar association's president. \"The result is not always a marriage that sticks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/16/business/company-news-bhc-financial-s-issues-slide-on-informal-notice-of-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BHC FINANCIAL'S ISSUES SLIDE ON INFORMAL NOTICE OF CUTS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BHC FINANCIAL'S ISSUES SLIDE ON INFORMAL NOTICE OF CUTS", "body_text": " **********The stock of BHC Financial Inc. tumbled almost 30 percent yesterday after the company said it had received \"unofficial oral notice\" that its largest client, Citicorp Investment Services Inc., planned to do its own securities processing.

Chagnon carries on the work of his great-grandfather running a company that builds what many see as the Cadillac of machines that fold and seal cardboard boxes. But all that changed when an unsolicited merger agreement landed on Mr. Chagnon's desk at the International Paper Box Machine Company. **********Mr. Chagnon quickly persuaded state officials to grant him a multi-million-dollar loan guarantee designed to fend off what he described as a hostile offer that jeopardized the jobs of 150 employees at the 93-year-old, closely held company. **********And that's when this seemingly insignificant business squabble, with its tortured tale of family intrigue, took on a whole new character. State governments have long offered tax breaks and other favors to corporations that threaten to leave or promise to bring new jobs. And several have enacted broad anti-takeover legislation to protect local companies. But never before, experts say, has a state gone so far as to side with management in a corporate battle for control. **********''It's a new one on me,'' said Robert Lovejoy, an investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company who specializes in contested mergers. ''States have given subsidies to corporations and passed legislation to save jobs, but actually writing a check to achieve a result in a takeover situation takes it to a new level.'' **********New Hampshire's action infuriated dissident shareholders, who are also descendants of Elie Labombarde, the founder of International, as it is known to its workers. The dissidents want to sell the company to outsiders, rather than allow Mr. Chagnon to buy them out. At a special shareholders meeting scheduled for tomorrow in Manchester, these cousins hope to oust Mr. Chagnon and the six other company directors so they can sell International to an unnamed pair of venture capitalists. **********''We hope to remove the entire board of directors,'' said Edward Hahn, the lawyer and spokesman for 10 dissident shareholders who control an estimated 50.8 percent of the company stock. ''They have not been responsive.'' **********Jack Donovan, executive director of New Hampshire's Business Finance Authority, conceded that the International deal was a ''unique'' use of the state's loan guarantees, which generally go to companies in financial trouble or those trying to expand. But he considered the merger offer a serious threat to good manufacturing jobs in the state. **********''This is one of the few companies around that still makes something for export,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''An unsolicited bid for 100 percent of the company certainly meets my definition of a hostile offer.'' These individuals are in a venture capital business looking for an undervalued company. They want to get in and out.'' **********The company harkens back to Nashua's past, when brick woolen mills lined the streets radiating from the Merrimac River. A feed and grain merchant, Elie Labombarde, founded it in 1903, after inventing the first automatic box-folding machine. Over the years, the mills were supplanted by the likes of Lockheed Martin and the Digital Equipment Corporation. But the Labombardes continued to build machines that can be found folding and sealing as many as 150,000 orange juice cartons or cereal boxes an hour at General Foods and Nabisco, as well as at companies in Japan and Korea. International now controls about a tenth of the $200 million market. **********The roots of the current family feud date back to 1980, when Raymond Labombarde, then the company president, asked his nephew Louis to join the family business. A former clinical social worker and a lawyer with a degree in management, Louis quickly moved up the company ladder, as did his cousin Hugh (Bud) McAdam, then the chief engineer and later vice president for sales. But when Raymond died in 1986, the directors passed over Mr. McAdam and named Louis president. To insure that the company remained in family hands, Mr. Labombarde's will granted the voting rights from his stock to Louis, while the benefits went to his wife. **********The two cousins were a study in contrasts, according to several longtime employees. Mr. McAdam, who declined comment, was hard working, but somewhat overbearing, the employees said, while Mr. Chagnon was soft-spoken and deliberate. After sparks flew one too many times,  Mr. McAdam finally left in 1995. **********Mr. Chagnon said he suddenly got a call from his cousin on Oct. 23. Mr. McAdam told him that his side of the family had found someone to buy the company for about $8 million. That severely undervalued a company with $20 million in annual sales, Mr. Chagnon said, even though it only makes a modest profit, which he declined to disclose. At a subsequent shareholders meeting, Mr. McAdam disclosed that the buyers would pay him $143,585 in fees and that he had offered another set of cousins $180,000 to go along with the plan. **********Mr. Chagnon had his own intricate connections to outsiders, too. Bernard Streeter, a member of the state's five-member Executive Council that approved the deal with International, is also a vice president at Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, where Mr. Chagnon serves as chairman. **********''These corporate raiders are interlopers,'' Mr. Streeter said. ''They want to make a quick buck at the expense of 150 people who have good jobs in this community.'' **********Mr. Chagnon said his cousins were noncommittal when he offered to raise the money to buy them out at the same price, $11.65 a share. He went ahead anyway, obtaining a $4.8 million loan from Fleet Bank, which the state promptly agreed to guarantee. Fearing that the buyers would close International, Gov. Stephen E. Merrill and the state's Executive Council approved the deal. **********But Mr. Hahn, the lawyer for the dissidents, said the state had no business intervening. Mr. McAdam's group does not want to leave a company hobbled by debt, Mr. Hahn said, nor does anyone know whether the buyers intend to shut International, as Mr. Chagnon contends, because ''no one has talked to them.'' **********''Those state guarantees should be used to further the interests of business in the state, not the personal interests of any one person or group,'' Mr. Hahn said. **********Yesterday, Mr. Chagnon failed to obtain a court order blocking the Dec. 14 stockholders meeting called by the dissidents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/20/business/international-business-japan-trade-surplus-plummeted-in-january.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1996-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 469, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Japan Trade Surplus Plummeted in January", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Japan Trade Surplus Plummeted in January", "body_text": " **********Japan almost posted a trade deficit in January, the Finance Ministry reported today. **********Japan's trade surplus in January plummeted 83 percent from a year earlier to  only $467 million. That is far below the typical monthly surplus, which last year averaged about $9 billion. **********The trade surplus with the United States shrank 51.2 percent from a year earlier to $1.549 billion, the fastest rate of decline in 16 years. **********For the first 20 days of the month, Japan actually ran a global trade deficit, and some economists and currency traders had expected Japan to post its first monthly deficit since January of 1984. **********Economists cautioned that Japan's trade surpluses in January tend to be unusually low, in part because holidays at the beginning of the year slow exports. Hence, the monthly figures recorded for the rest of the year will be much higher. **********Still, the January figure confirms that Japan's trade surplus, the highest ever recorded by any country in the world, is on the decline. **********The January surplus, the excess of exports over imports, was the lowest recorded since January 1990. And the 83 percent decline from a year ago was all the more striking because in January 1995, exports were disrupted by the Kobe earthquake, resulting in an unusually low trade surplus. **********Japan's imbalance has been dropping because the rise of the Japanese yen over the last three years has crimped exports and spurred imports. For 1995 as a whole, the surplus, as measured on a customs clearance basis, dropped for the first time in five years to $107 billion. **********But in recent months, the yen has weakened again to about 105 to the dollar,  compared with a high of 80 to the dollar last spring. **********The fall in the yen actually increased the January trade surplus because it lowered the price of Japan's exports and raised the price of imports, as measured in dollars. Yet buyers on both sides of the Pacific Ocean have not had  a chance to adjust their buying patterns to reflect the new situation. **********In the coming months, however, if the yen stays at around 105 yen, Japan's exports might pick up and imports growth could slacken, thereby slowing the decline in the trade surplus. **********\"We're kind of skeptical that the trade surplus will continue to go away,\" said Yoshito Sakakibara, an economist in Tokyo for Salomon Brothers. He said that seasonally adjusted, the January surplus was $5.4 billion. **********In January, imports, as measured in dollars, grew 16.9 percent from a year earlier, led by a 71.5 percent rise in imports of computers and other office equipment.Exports rose 6.7 percent over all but those to the United States declined 2.9 percent. Exports of cars continued to decline as the United States  car market weakened and as Japanese auto makers shifted more production to the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/business/markets-closed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Closed", "print_headline": "Markets Closed", "body_text": " **********Financial markets in the United States are closed today in observance of Thanksgiving.

They followed the shipment from its entry at the Spanish port of Ca\u0301diz to its arrival in Britain before moving in and arresting seven people and confiscating more than a ton of cannabis. **********That kind of cross-border police cooperation is growing more vital as Europe seeks to stem the infiltration of Russian mafia groups, Balkan gangs and Chinese triads into trafficking of everything from drugs to people and nuclear materials. **********But fundamental differences over the nature and extent of that cooperation are limiting Europol, established by the European Union two years ago to lead the fight against organized crime, to a modest coordinating role. **********\"We are handicapped,\" said Ju\u0308rgen Storbeck, the former head of organized crime investigations at Germany's federal police office, who heads Europol. **********The political problem hobbling Europol revolves around the reluctance of some EU countries, in particular Britain, to curb national freedom of action for the sake of the common European good. It is a fundamental divide with far-reaching echoes as Europe prepares to begin negotiations at the end of this month on reforms to improve EU decision-making and give Europe a stronger voice in international affairs. **********Initially proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1991 as a sort of European FBI, Europol's vocation has been trimmed down to reflect the limits of cooperation among 15 nations with different legal and policing traditions, not to mention languages. **********The agency has been charged with coordinating investigations involving several EU countries and pooling data to track international criminal networks, but unlike the FBI it cannot conduct its own investigations. **********Even Europol's limited role has been constrained, however, by Britain's refusal to give the European Court of Justice any jurisdiction over disputes involving Europol. Britain's stance is holding up ratification of a convention governing Europol operations. Without the convention, the agency is restricted to cases involving drugs, stolen cars and illegal immigrants. And Europol can only respond to requests from national police forces. **********\"At the moment, we are only reacting,\" Mr. Storbeck said. \"We really need a breakthrough now to become the effective tool for fighting against international criminality.\" **********Equally important, he said, the political dispute was hampering Europol's ability to develop closer cooperation with authorities in Eastern Europe and the United States. **********No one in Europe disputes the need for Europol, a fact that the agency's mushrooming caseload underlines. Operating out of a former monastery in the Dutch capital, Europol assisted in nearly 1,500 criminal investigations last year compared with 600 in 1994. **********Most Continental EU countries believe that the Luxembourg-based European court must have some jurisdiction to ensure that issues like the admissibility of evidence gathered via Europol are treated equally in all 15 countries. But Britain has railed against the growing influence of European court rulings on national law. Last week, it announced that limiting the court's role would be a prime British objective in the EU reform negotiations that begin in Turin on March 29. **********EU officials said Britain's stance appeared to rule out any progress on the Europol contention when justice ministers meet in Brussels on Tuesday and made it increasingly likely that the Union would fail to resolve the dispute by June, the deadline set by EU leaders. Europol is being \"held hostage\" by Britain's broader agenda on EU reform, a European official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/15/business/adventure-travel-offers-a-tonic-for-the-ailing.html": {"writer_name": "David Morrow", "pub_date": "1996-12-15", "snippet": "Travel agents report number of people with cancer and other serious illnesses are seeking out adventure trips, or exotic destinations they will never again have a chance to see; photos (S)", "word_count": 1132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Adventure Travel Offers a Tonic for the Ailing", "print_headline": "Adventure Travel Offers a Tonic for the Ailing", "body_text": " **********FEW people like to ponder their inevitable appointment with the Grim Reaper, but those who believe their day may be drawing near are fast becoming big clients of the adventure-travel industry. **********Faced with fatal or serious illnesses, people who could travel were once content to spend their free time popping bonbons in Paris or sunbathing in Florida. Now they are more apt to go all out, assuming their illnesses leave them the strength to do so. Travel agents say this gusto has bolstered the market for extravagant trips and expensive fantasy vacations that include everything from taking a motorboat down the Amazon to hiking past cobras in an African jungle. **********''If you've just been diagnosed with full-blown cancer, you're not going to take your assets and go out and buy real estate,'' said Lynette Wilson, owner of Destination World, a travel planning company in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''Instead, people sell their insurance policies and take their friends on an exotic vacation.'' **********Even though there are no travel agencies that specialize in adventure trips for the ailing, traditional agents say they are seeing more requests. Part of the increase is a result of the rising number of companies that buy life insurance policies for cash and the growing popularity of adventure travel in general. **********''Certainly, most of the people who take one of our adventure vacations are not dying,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''So they appeal to everyone. But it's interesting, you know. We've never advertised this part of our business, and yet there are a lot of folks out there who are ill and want to try an adventure trip. They want to use their imaginations.'' **********Adventure travel, by definition, involves some sort of outdoor activity. Traditionally, the most popular exotic fare was an African safari. But animal gazing is just too lame for many ailing travelers. Perhaps they are in denial or rebelling against their disease, but most ailing tourists want as strenuous a workout as they can handle. **********''The people who are sick who come to us for a vacation almost always want to do something really physical,'' said Hanns Ebensten, president of Hanns Ebensten Travel in Key West, Fla. ''They've been to Paris. They figure, 'Now's the time to do what I always wanted and didn't.' '' **********Adventure trips can also be great therapy. Sally Berg, a breast cancer survivor, decided 10 years ago to take her cancer support group from Mount Kisco, N.Y., backpacking in Bethel, Me. They went on the first of several Outward Bound trips for breast cancer victims. Another Outward Bound trip, in 1988, took her whitewater rafting down the Yampa River in Utah and Colorado. **********''My first thought when I was diagnosed with cancer was that I was going to die,'' Mrs. Berg said. ''But then I realized that I wasn't going to die this week and maybe not even this year. Doing the canoeing and other adventure trips I've taken helped me to know my limits. It gave a meaning to my illness.'' **********Like other adventure tourists, ailing travelers have plenty of trips to choose from. In addition to offering rafting trips and safaris, many agencies book personalized vacations, enabling anyone to fulfill a wish, regardless of how farfetched it may be. **********One man who was dying of AIDS decided last year to float down the Nile. Instead of booking passage on a ship, he and a group of friends boarded a centuries-old sailboat. He ended his trip by crossing the Sinai Peninsula in a Land Rover, spending each night huddled in a sleeping bag in the sand. **********Other ailing travelers want to live another life. Last year, Mr. Ebensten arranged a trip for a dying man to Mount Athos, Greece. There, he stayed with the monks four nights, in four different monasteries, helping with the chores and praying. **********''That trip is very moving,'' Mr. Ebensten said. ''They have a rather basic guest quarters. You really do live a medieval life.'' **********ADVENTURE trips can provide ailing travelers with an emotional release, but they must be chosen carefully. Because these trips are often elaborate, with itineraries that cross several countries and currencies, they are usually quite expensive. The sailboat tour down the Nile went for $6,000, excluding air fare, while the weeklong stay at the Greek monastery -- certainly no Hilton --cost $5,000, excluding air fare. **********A typical tourist may balk at such a bill, but few ailing travelers do. They often have few concerns about money, travel agents say, because many have already cashed in their life insurance policies for one last blast, not expecting to survive their illnesses. **********''Generally, their attitude is that they have the money now so why not splurge,'' Mr. Ebensten said. '' 'Why keep the money, when I can see the monastery and do all those things I always wanted to do?' '' **********If money is not a problem, health usually is. Travel agents usually make sure the trip's physical demands are not too pressing, but sometimes the strains -- like hauling equipment on a hike or spending a long day in a rowboat -- are unavoidable when an ailing tourist travels with a group of healthy strangers. **********Many of those problems can be allayed with a little planning. ''Most people travel with a traveling companion,'' Mr. Ebensten said. ''There have been times when someone has arrived off the plane, and I'll think, 'Oh, no, he's not going to make it.' But he always does. Doing a physical vacation is so much a matter of the mind.'' **********People who are too sick for an adventure trip have other options. Dalmation Dreams, a nonprofit group in Santa Barbara, fulfills last wishes for dying adults. Most of the 14 requests it handles each month are for family reunions, or putting a sick person in touch with a hero. One dying man not only met Glenn Close but actually sang with her for about an hour. **********For the ailing traveler longing for the outdoors, however, there are few bounds. Ms. Wilson is booking clients on a tour of Transylvania over next Halloween. **********But the truly daring may try the 16-day excursion in August to Bali and Tana Toraja, an area in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Keeping with local tradition, the Torajans who are dying have a life-size model carved in wood by the village artisan. Funeral season in Tana Toraja is in August, and everyone is laid to rest at once. On top of being allowed to witness the three-day service, tourists can hike about the remote Indonesian island. **********''I used to say that you should not try an adventure trip if it's not your cup of tea,'' Mrs. Berg said. ''But now I think everyone should try one, regardless if you're sick. You see things you never would have before, and more importantly, you discover what you're capable of. You come away from it realizing you were stronger than you thought.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/13/business/prodigy-to-get-new-owners-and-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1996-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prodigy to Get New Owners And Strategy", "print_headline": "Prodigy to Get New Owners And Strategy", "body_text": " **********I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck finally ended their costly foray into the computer  on-line business yesterday when they agreed to sell the Prodigy Services Company to about 40 Prodigy managers and an American start-up company backed by a Mexican billionaire. **********A management buyout of Prodigy had been expected for weeks. It was reported in early April that Prodigy's new management team wanted to buy the service, and efforts by I.B.M. and Sears, begun last fall, had failed to find a major corporate buyer interested in the struggling on-line service. **********In recent weeks the Prodigy management, helped by the investment bankers Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., had been scrambling to find a financial backer for its buyout plan. **********The investor willing to back Prodigy's revival plan is International Wireless Inc., a company in Cambridge, Mass., that was founded two years ago. One of its  co-chairmen, 36-year-old Greg Carr, is also chairman of Boston Technology Inc.,  a supplier of services like voice mail to phone companies. **********A major investor in International Wireless is Grupo Carso, a Mexican conglomerate whose holdings include a stake in Telmex, the phone company. Grupo  Carso is owned by Carlos Slim Helu, one of the richest men in Mexico. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated the net worth of Mr. Slim and his family at $3.7 billion. **********The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. But a person familiar with the deal said the value was nearly $200 million, including the value of real estate leases on buildings Prodigy occupies and its communications network. **********The price is a fraction of the estimated $1.2 billion that the International  Business Machines Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company had invested in Prodigy in more than a decade. Yet both companies were apparently willing to sell for so little because their corporate priorities had shifted and neither wanted to keep backing Prodigy in what analysts say is a risky turnaround effort. **********Prodigy's losses have been written off by I.B.M. and Sears over the years, analysts say, so for both companies the financial effects of the sale are likely to be small gains. **********The challenge faced by Prodigy's management team and its backers is formidable. Once a pioneer in the on-line business, Prodigy has slipped to third behind America Online Inc. and Compuserve Inc., a unit of H& R Block, which recently sold part of Compuserve in an initial public stock offering. **********In the first quarter of 1996, according to analysts, Prodigy lost subscribers, slipping to little more than one million, while America Online and  Compuserve grew considerably. America Online, the industry leader, had 5.4 million subscribers by the end of the first quarter, estimated Arlen Communications Inc., a research firm in Bethesda, Md. **********Yet under its president, Edward A. Bennett, a former Viacom executive, Prodigy has assembled a new top management team and has changed its strategy. Young executives have joined Prodigy from NBC; ABC; McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm; Atlantic Records, and elsewhere. **********Mr. Bennett's strategy is to remake Prodigy as a \"new-media studio,\" backing  mainly independent producers of entertainment, information and special-interest  sites on the World Wide Web. Because the strategy calls for Prodigy to shift quickly from proprietary on-line technology to the standard programming languages used on the Web, fewer full-time employees will be required to create  the same amount of on-line programming. In April, Prodigy announced that it was  laying off 115 of its 680 workers. **********Still, all the major on-line services are moving to the Web, with the only issues being how fast to move and how to make money on the Web, where most information and entertainment is free. **********For his part, Mr. Carr, the International Wireless co-chairman, said he was impressed by the Prodigy team and willing to bet on its plan. \"We think there's  a tremendous potential asset there,\" he said yesterday. **********International Wireless operates mainly abroad with a cellular phone business  in Africa and a fledgling on-line service, called Africa Online. With the backing of its Mexican partner, International Wireless plans to push Prodigy abroad aggressively. **********The plan, Mr. Carr said, includes translating Prodigy into Spanish for Latin  America and possibly into Mandarin for the huge potential market for Chinese-language computer users. **********\"Almost everything is in English now on the Internet, and that's going to change,\" Mr. Carr said. \"We think that with our international contacts, we can help Prodigy take advantage of that opportunity.\" **********In addition, Mr. Carr said his company's telecommunications expertise could also be applied to new methods of delivering Internet services, like wireless or direct satellite technology instead of phone lines. **********After the International Wireless board approved the deal at noon yesterday, Mr. Bennett of Prodigy said that his company could now concentrate entirely on trying to make the leap to the new business model. If successful, he said, the real payoff for him and the rest of the management team will be to sell stock in an initial public offering in the next few years. **********\"We've got to move from a proprietary on-line service to an Internet service  -- that's the future,\" Mr. Bennett said. \"And when we do it, there's no reason we can't go public.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/treasury-to-sell-bills-and-notes-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury to Sell Bills and Notes This Week", "print_headline": "Treasury to Sell Bills and Notes This Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to the bills and notes markets, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three-  and six-month bills.

Gidwitz, 50, who is not only president and chief executive of Helene Curtis but is also one of Mayor Richard  Daley's closest friends in the business community. Mr. Gidwitz is also a leading figure in local and state Republican party politics and a prominent member of numerous civic, cultural and educational boards. **********Those boards that Mr. Gidwitz does not belong to often tap the fund-raising skills and enthusiasm of his wife, Christina Gidwitz. She is the daughter of James Kemper, founder of the Kemper insurance empire, and was already prominent  locally as a fashion model when the couple married in 1975. The couple have two  sons, 11 and 8, and live in the fashionable Gold Coast district near Lake Michigan, where Mr. Gidwitz served as a Republican ward leader for several years. **********The Gidwitz family's involvement in Helene Curtis dates to 1927, when Ronald's grandfather, Jacob Gidwitz, invested $5,000 in what was then a struggling manufacturer of mudpacks and facial masks. Today, about 75 percent of the voting stock of the company is controlled by the Gidwitz family. **********The company said today that Mr. Gidwitz intended to stay on as chief executive, which raised hopes here that the sale would not mean an end anytime soon to the company's commitment to manufacturing on the city's impoverished West Side. **********Those who know Mr. Gidwitz will be watching to see how well he fares within the legendary bureaucracy of Unilever. \"I think he likes running a company, and  the influence being a C.E.O. brings is important to him,\" said David Paulus, a former senior executive at First Chicago Bank who became Mr. Gidwitz's friend when the two worked on political campaigns and school reform efforts here during the 1980's. **********Mr. Gidwitz's civic background may have given him some helpful training for the corporate politics ahead. He has been prominent in recent years in his job as head of the troubled City Colleges, leading a series of cutbacks, administrative changes and tough union negotiations that have made him the focus of blistering attacks by local labor and education groups. That job, like  an earlier position reviving the city's Economic Development Committee, at times consumed as many as 30 hours a week. **********\"He's very gutsy,\" said Grace Berry, executive director of the Economic Club  of Chicago. \"He's really tried to be the change agent in some tough situations.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/business/lawsuit-is-filed-in-cellular-fraud.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lawsuit Is Filed In Cellular Fraud", "print_headline": "Lawsuit Is Filed In Cellular Fraud", "body_text": " **********Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile has filed a Federal suit contending that two men swindled the company out of $130,965. **********The company says Edward L.

Among 30- to 49-year-olds, 65 percent said all or most of their satisfaction came from home and family, compared with 54 percent in 1992, the public opinion pollster, Yankelovich Partners, said. **********The Association of Home Builders said that by 2,000, spending on renovation would increase 57 percent, to $180 billion annually from $115 billion. **********\"We are sensitive to a greater interest in the home than was the case even as recently as three years ago,\" S. I. Newhouse, Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc, said. \"We no longer feel that we have to focus the energy that we had to focus on A.D.\" **********What the revamped House & Garden will actually contain has been a closely guarded and eagerly awaited secret while publication had been in the works for the last year. But as the magazine trickles out to advertisers, designers and the media this week -- officially hitting the newsstands Aug. 13 -- it remains to be seen whether, despite the conventional wisdom that creative nesting has replaced conspicuous consumption as the latest rage, there could possibly be a place for yet another magazine having anything to do with matters trowel or tartan. **********\"Is there room for everybody? No, I don't think so,\" said John J. Miller, the vice president and group publisher of the Hachette Filipacchi home group, which  owns the magazines Elle Decor, Metropolitan Home and Home. \"This is pretty typical of any market situation: When things look bad, people bail out, and when things look good, people jump in. **********\"The bad news is, we're probably at the top of the market right now. The next media recession that we have is going to be when we see another shakeout in the  marketplace. That's where the rubber meets the road.\" **********And while insisting that as Joe Armstrong of Meigher Communications, which publishes Garden Design, put it, \"A rising tide lifts all boats,\" the competition is inevitably nervous about House & Garden's return. **********\"I'm going to continue doing what I'm doing as if House & Garden never closed,\" Marian McEvoy, the editor of Elle Decor, said. \"When it did close, I had a tough time isolating who my competitor was. I've got one now, I can assure you.\" **********It was only a short time ago, during the recession, that the market was not vital enough to sustain all comers and, Ms. McEvoy said, \"You couldn't give furniture away.\" **********But as the economy improved, so did the business outlook for shelter magazines, attracting a new breed of advertisers such as automotive, cosmetic and computer companies. \"Demographic groups that read those magazines have come  back,\" Leo Scullin, a magazine consultant, said. \"The segments they serve are becoming more interesting to advertisers.\" **********With 207 pages of advertising, indeed, the articles are hard to find for all  the ads, House & Garden broke the record for ad pages in a second debut. But those issues have their own distinct once-in-a-lifetime appeal to advertisers. The larger question is, can House & Garden hope to keep it up? **********Advertisers seemed to think so. \"There is enough advertising to go around,\" Steve Greenberger, vice president and print media director at Grey Advertising,  said. \"This genre of the home and the garden is something that has been able to  absorb new titles over the last few years, and we're very interested in seeing House & Garden come back.\" **********As long as people have money to play with, designers and advertisers said, there is almost no limit to exploiting the basic instincts that make these magazines so successful: People covet what they don't have, want to know what is in fashion even if they can't afford it, and long to see how the other half lives. **********\"It's like hero worship,\" the designer, Mario Buatta, said. \"The magazine becomes a sort of wish book. They are looking in the windows of houses where they would never be invited.\" **********House & Garden's editor, Dominique Browning, 40, said she was unabashedly tapping into that perennial curiosity. It was the same trait that made her a self-described \"shelter magazine\" junkie, even though her experience as an editor at Texas Monthly (where she was in charge of business and politics), Newsweek (where she ran the life style section) and Mirabella (which Rupert Murdoch closed three months after Ms. Browning took over as editor and which he  subsequently sold to Hachette) had almost nothing to do with houses or gardens. **********\"We love the voyeurism of going into somebody else's home,\" Ms. Browning said during an interview in her sunlit, earth-toned office, swatches of fabric tossed on her desk among half-finished bottles of Spa water. \"We love the indulgence of being let into the room.\" **********Still, given that readers can already peer into the living rooms of the famous in Architectural Digest, get up to speed on the latest European designs in Elle Decor and learn how to to make hurricane lamps from Martha Stewart Living, how will House & Garden be different? **********For one thing, the publisher, David Carey, who came from Smart Money, said, it will be smarter. \"There is nothing incompatible about interior design, great  writing and sharp thinking,\" he said. **********Judging from the first issue (the magazine promises a circulation base of 400,000), the subject matter appears to be somewhat more high-minded than that of most shelter magazines. The gardening column, for example -- called \"Dig It\"  -- is about gardening in China after the Cultural Revolution. The column, \"Art & Craft,\" by the art critic Arthur C. Danto, begins with a reference to Henry James's classic novel \"The Golden Bowl.\" And a regular section that will debate  the merits of various design elements -- such as the pros and cons of using tufted ottomans as coffee tables -- is called \"Dialectical Materialism.\" **********Ms. Browning said she also planned to regularly enlist novelists and poets as contributors. In House & Garden's first issue, John Updike writes about houses from his childhood, Cynthia Ozick writes about her favorite everyday object (the ladle) and Jay McInerney writes about wine. **********Even though House & Garden is very much a new product, Ms. Browning said she  wanted to bring back the best elements of the old magazine -- founded in 1901 in Philadelphia by three architects. **********Ms. Browning cited, for example, the work of House & Garden's former art director, Alexander Lieberman, an Englishman who brought a foreigner's heightened appreciation for ordinary American icons to the magazine, featuring the inside of a dishwasher on the cover. **********In this vein, House & Garden's new front-of-the-book section, \"Domestic Bliss,\" features an entire spread on the latest rage in vacuum cleaners (including a photograph of the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi vacuuming in his pajamas). **********\"All of us really do love the stuff of everyday life,\" Ms. Browning said, adding that one of her mottoes for this redesign has been \"no subject too small.\" **********The article also referred incorrectly to Mr. Liberman's background. He was born in Kiev, Ukraine, then a part of Russia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/24/business/investing-it-bre-x-has-a-cinderella-story-to-tell.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1996-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 771, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING IT;Bre-X Has a Cinderella Story to Tell", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT;Bre-X Has a Cinderella Story to Tell", "body_text": " **********THREE years ago Bre-X Minerals Ltd., then operating out of the basement of its president, David Walsh, paid $80,000 (Canadian) for mineral rights to 475,000 acres near Busang in northeast Borneo. **********What has happened since has become a Cinderella story of investing.

Many larger companies have approached it, but Steve McAnulty, vice president in charge of investor and corporate relations, said no decision would be made until midsummer. **********Bre-X owns a 90 percent stake in the mine. The other 10 percent is held by an Indonesian partner, Askatindo Karya Mineral. Another mining company, Minorca Resources of Toronto, has worked out a complex deal with the partner that effectively gives it a 4.2 percent stake for $12.5 million plus three million Minorca shares, which closed Friday on the Montreal Stock Exchange at $4.65. **********The deal caught Bre-X by surprise. \"It's a nuisance to us, but of minimal relevance,\" Mr. McAnulty said. **********Mr. Walsh and other senior managers own 10 percent of the 21.3 million shares outstanding. Insider-trading reports show that Mr. Walsh sold 318,000 shares over 10 weeks early this winter at an average price of $55.20. His wife, Jeannette, a Bre-X corporate secretary, sold 70,000 shares at an average price of $64.79. **********Another 24 percent of Bre-X is held by Bresea Resources, also founded by Mr.  Walsh and named after both of his sons, Brett and Sean. Institutions own 25 to 40 percent and the remainder is held by the public. **********Brendan Kyne, Canadian equity portfolio analyst for Driehaus Capital Management of Chicago, which manages the 20-20 RSP Aggressive Equity fund, said: \"We bought 427,000 shares in May 1995 at an average price of $4.08 and still own about 200,000 shares. We do let our winners run, but there comes a certain time when for prudence you don't want one stock to be 40 percent of your portfolio.\" He said the stock was now worth about $225 a share. **********Investing in mining companies can be risky and most investment advisers say the shares should only be a small percentage of an investment portfolio. Still,  individual investors have also done very well with Bre-X. Doug Imrie, 47, who works at the General Motors plant in Oshawa, Ontario, is sending a son to college on some of the profits. \"This isn't going to make me retire tomorrow,\" Mr. Imrie said, \"but it gives me a very big lift economically.\" **********Yet some mining analysts voice caution. \"There's no question this is a real discovery,\" said Paul Esquivel, research consultant for McDermid St. Lawrence Chisolm Ltd., \"but the market is suggesting investors are getting carried away.\" **********Jack Kindermann, an investor in St. Paul, Alberta, bought his shares earlier  this year. **********\"I've earned enough from the stock to build a skyscraper,\" Mr. Kindermann said, \"If it doesn't work out,\" he chuckled in a telephone interview, \"I just jump off.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/26/world/flooding-in-china-sweeps-thousands-of-villages.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1996-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 773, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Flooding in China Sweeps Thousands of Villages", "print_headline": "Flooding in China Sweeps Thousands of Villages", "body_text": " **********Floods have ravaged several central provinces in China in recent days, as heavy rainfall and a swelling Yangtze River have waterlogged thousands of villages and towns, destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes and damaged millions of others. **********Relief workers venturing into badly affected areas described seeing families  of farmers who resisted leaving their homes for fear of losing all they own, even though water was engulfing one- and two-story homes in rural areas. **********We rowed into one village where people had all climbed up on their roofs of their homes, surrounded by water,\" said Catherine Bachy, a Belgian nurse and volunteer for Doctors Without Borders, the international relief organization, speaking by telephone from Anhui Province. **********\"They had pigs and chickens and sacks of rice up there, too, whatever they needed to save.\" **********Taking blankets, food, medical supplies and plastic sheeting to the victims,  relief workers like Ms. Bachy said conditions are dire in many areas along the Yangtze and could get even worse in the coming weeks.

But with a stock market value of less than $300 million, and with half of its shares in insiders' hands, it has never attracted much attention, despite ties to a fabled tobacco dynasty and a board studded with business celebrities. **********Anyone who was curious about this New York-based holding company, which also owns a commercial nursery and an industrial packaging company, could consult Culbro's annual report, which this year hails the sales growth and rising stock  price generated by \"the link that now exists\" between premium cigars and wealthy consumers. \"Every gathering of cigar smokers is a cause for warm companionship,\" says the chairman, Edgar M. Cullman, 78, in his genial letter to shareholders. **********But forget the graceful annual report. The really juicy news cannot be found  there this year -- it is all tucked away in the frumpy Form 10-K filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission last month. **********There, you can read about the 3,000 pounds of marijuana seized by Customs agents at a company plant in Alabama last spring; about the internal investigation that stumbled across a crooked invoicing scheme that defrauded the company of about $1 million over four to five years; about a senior executive, dismissed last year, who has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of bribing foreign officials and cheating on Federal campaign laws. **********In this jaw-dropper of a report, you can even read the company's prediction that this former employee will himself be indicted soon, and you can learn that  since May the S.E.C. has been informally looking into trading in the company's shares before Culbro announced plans, later dropped, to sell half its General Cigar subsidiary to a Spanish conglomerate. **********The company's annual shareholder meeting, normally a quiet affair, is scheduled for Thursday in New York. \"They will certainly have a lot to talk about this year,\" one investor said. **********They will indeed. Since last spring -- when a customer found a brick of marijuana in a shipment of company cigars -- executives and directors have been  caught up in a real-life mystery that makes Wall Street's usual fare look tame.  And their experience offers a warning to all corporate officers and directors who assume that crime could never infect their own tidy, tautly managed companies. **********\"No one ever thinks it can happen to them,\" said Edgar Cullman Jr., 50, Culbro's president and his father's chosen successor as chief executive, in an interview last week. And he felt confident that his company had taken steps to protect itself. \"Ever since my father has been in business, we have practiced the highest possible ethical standards.\" **********But corporate watchdogs say there is another lesson here: beware the ties that blind. For as strong as Culbro's response has been, these experts say, it is flawed because the board left the investigation to the in-house counsel rather than putting it in the hands of independent directors. One possible reason? An \"incestuous web of conflicts\" that links board members to one another and to the company,said Prof. John C. Coffee Jr. of the Columbia University School of Law. **********\"This is less than the textbook example of how you should conduct an investigation of this sort,\" said Professor Coffee, an S.E.C. adviser and specialist in corporate and securities law. **********Mr. Cullman Jr. begs to differ. \"Maybe it looks better\" if outside directors  run an investigation, he said, \"but nobody from our board can spend the time that we have spent and will continue to spend to track all of these things down.\" As for the close ties among board members, he said, \"There is a lot of collegiality, no question about it -- but that goes two ways. They want to see us protected as much as they want to be sure that we are not blindsided.\" **********He can understand his critics' point of view, he added. \"It may appear to have a certain smell about it,\" Mr. Cullman Jr. said. \"But when you get below the surface, you see that these are quality people and it is really a good process.\" **********He noted that James D. Harmon Jr., a former executive director and chief counsel of the President's Commission on Organized Crime, was hired as investigative counsel at the first sign of trouble last spring, and former Federal Judge Kenneth Conboy, a widely respected jurist and now a partner at the law firm of Latham & Watkins, was hired in February to look into the former employee's allegations. In addition, the company has tightened its audit controls and has improved security at its operations. **********Thomas C. Israel, a Culbro director and chairman of the audit committee, also defended the company's response. \"Management feels very free and open, and we discuss everything,\" he said. \"This is a lot more than a rubber-stamp board.\" He added, \"By knowing senior management as well as we do, we feel very confident that they have paid great attention to detail. They are the most moral, highly ethical people in the world. We are comfortable that, with the exception of one  or two bad apples, everyone is doing what they're supposed to do.\" **********It certainly looked that way until the news about these spreading scandals broke last month. **********The Cullman family has been in the tobacco industry for generations: Mr. Cullman Sr.'s father and uncle were in the cigar business, and the family firm,  Cullman Brothers, owned the Benson & Hedges cigarette line until it was sold to  Philip Morris in the mid-1950's. Edgar Cullman's brother, Joseph, joined Philip  Morris, helping shape it into a national giant before retiring as chairman and chief executive in 1978. **********Mr. Cullman Sr., who is married to an heiress of the Bloomingdale retailing fortune, stayed at the family firm. In 1961, he bought a controlling stake in the General Cigar Company, which had been listed on the New York Stock Exchange  since 1906. In 1976, General Cigar changed its name to Culbro, an echo of the family firm name. A diversification into wholesale grocery distribution lifted revenue in the 1980's, but rarely produced strong profits. Two years ago, the company cut its stake in that business to concentrate on cigars \"and related affluent market segments.\" **********The shift was well timed, for that was when cigars began to shed their politico-gangster image and become stylish. Mario Gabelli, the high-profile investment adviser and a cigar-puffer of long standing, noticed it early last spring when he was unable to get a reservation at the annual dinner sponsored by Cigar Aficionado magazine. Mr. Gabelli had been a Culbro investor for years. But the cigar boom increased his appetite, and he began to build up his stake, as the stock began to climb toward $20 a share from around $12. **********CULBRO'S stock now stands at $65.50, and 1995 profits were $11.2 million, or  $2.52 a share, up almost tenfold over the results of 1994. First-quarter profits, announced last week, continued to be robust, with cigar division earnings up 55 percent over the same period last year -- driven not only by the  emerging cigar culture but by innovative company marketing of its cigars, lighters and related products. **********For example, Culbro has set up a cigar-centered Web site on the Internet. It  sells Macanudo and Partagas bomber jackets and sportswear. And next month it will open its own Manhattan cigar bar, Club Macanudo, with a decor by Cullman &  Kravis, the decorating firm owned by Elissa Cullman, Mr. Cullman Jr.'s wife, and Hedi Kravis, former wife of Henry Kravis, the leveraged buyout specialist. Consulting on the menu is the chef-proprietor of a small New York restaurant in  which the Cullmans have a stake. **********As those assignments indicate, Culbro has a close-knit board where even ostensible outsiders may be closely involved with company life and with each other. **********Its 11 members include Francis T. Vincent Jr., whose career has ranged from the S.E.C.'s corporate finance division to the executive suites of Columbia Pictures and Coca-Cola to being Major League Baseball commissioner; Dan W. Lufkin, an active private investor and a founder of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Peter J. Solomon, the feisty former Lehman Brothers partner immortalized in Ken Auletta's book, \"Greed and Glory on Wall Street,\" who also served as deputy mayor of New York City under Ed Koch. **********Mr. Solomon's firm, Peter J. Solomon & Company, earned a $75,000 fee for advising the company on financial strategies last year and stands to get a much  larger fee for handling the pending sale of CMS Gilbreth Packaging Systems, a Culbro subsidiary. From 1992 to 1994, Mr. Vincent was a senior adviser to Mr. Solomon's firm, and in the late 1970's, he and Mr. Lufkin worked together at Columbia Pictures, on whose board Mr. Lufkin served. Another outside director is Graham V. Sherren, chief executive of Centaur Communications Ltd., a British business magazine publisher in which Culbro has a substantial stake. **********Other outsiders on the board are John L. Bernbach, the retired vice chairman  of DDB Needham Worldwide, and Bruce A. Barnet, chief executive of Cowles Magazines. **********Besides the elder Mr. Cullman, the board also includes his son, Mr. Cullman Jr.; his son-in-law Frederick M. Danziger, a partner at Latham & Watkins, Culbro's outside counsel; and his nephew John L. Ernst, whose Bloomingdale Properties manages the company's headquarters building on Park Avenue South in New York. These family members and their various trust accounts control 50.1 percent of Culbro's stock. In addition, Mr. Danziger's son David became an officer and vice president last year. **********Even the largest outside investor, Mr. Gabelli, who controls 20 percent, has  a company \"job\": One of his affiliated companies manages the Culbro pension fund. **********UNTIL now, these close ties -- all meticulously disclosed in proxy reports -- have raised few eyebrows among investors. But when a company finds itself in Culbro's situation, only a convincingly independent investigation can preserve the company's credibility with prosecutors and regulators, said Neil Getnick, an anti-corruption specialist and president of the International Association of Independent Private-Sector Inspectors General, a standard-setting group for lawyers and investigators serving as corporate watchdogs. **********And Culbro's arrangement, \"while not improper, is just not preferable,\" Mr. Getnick said. \"And to some extent it is self-defeating: when you go to those lengths to bring in counsel with a reputation of skill and integrity and independence, it makes little sense to structure it in a fashion that is not truly independent.\" **********The views of legal experts were the last thing on the mind of A. Ross Wollen, Culbro's in-house counsel, on the day last spring when he interrupted a Florida  trial to take a call from Austin T. McNamara, the president of the General Cigar subsidiary in Bloomfield, Conn. The news was a shocker: a customer \"had opened what should have been a box of cigars, and in it, he found a brick of marijuana,\" Mr. Wollen said. **********The lawyer immediately sought out a friend and former West Point classmate, Jim Harmon, a one-time Federal prosecutor now in private practice in New York. Mr. Wollen laughed ruefully when he recalled what he told his friend so many billable hours ago: \"This won't take too many hours of your time, but you know better than we do how to report this to the proper authorities.\" **********Mr. Harmon did two things: He immediately got in touch with Federal Customs officials and law enforcement agents in Alabama, and he hired Willis Krebs, a retired New York City police detective experienced in narcotics cases. As Mr. Krebs devised ways to strengthen the company's physical security, Mr. Harmon asked Customs agents to watch the company's shipping containers entering the Port of Miami. **********\"Customs agents found one of the company's containers had been used to ship marijuana,\" Mr. Harmon said. With the knowledge of Mr. Harmon and Mr. Krebs, who agreed not to inform the company, Customs agents conducted what Mr. Harmon called \"a controlled delivery: following the container from Miami to wherever it was going to go.\" **********It wound up at a General Cigar plant in Dothan, Ala. The plant was swiftly raided and agents seized 3,000 pounds of marijuana from the container. Two employees were arrested and later indicted; they have pleaded not guilty and have denied any knowledge of how the drug got to Dothan. **********INDEED, while a local Federal grand jury continues to investigate, Mr. Wollen said the company is still in the dark about how the drugs arrived and where they were bound. **********But Mr. Harmon did stumble across a curious pattern in certain invoices submitted by a local trucking firm used to cart materials to and from the plant. In a civil lawsuit later filed in Montgomery, Ala., General Cigar accused the trucker of billing for about $1 million of shipments that were never made. The checks that paid those invoices were all cashed, rather than deposited into the  trucking company's bank accounts, Mr. Wollen said, and the bills had all been approved by General Cigar's senior vice president for manufacturing, Paul T. Cleveland. Mr. Cleveland, 41, based in Connecticut but responsible for the Dothan plant, was dismissed; he has been added as a defendant in the company's civil suit against the trucking line. **********Mr. Cleveland, in a telephone interview on Thursday, denied that he had done  anything wrong at Culbro, but declined to comment further. \"I've got a lot of legal issues to deal with in Alabama and Connecticut,\" he said. **********After being dismissed, Mr. Cleveland sued Culbro in state court in Connecticut, contending wrongful termination. In that lawsuit, Mr. Cleveland said he was dismissed because he was aware of, and had objected to, certain actions that he contended were taken by General Cigar: paying bribes to foreign  politicians and kickbacks to distributors, for example, and pressuring executives to make political donations. **********The company denies Mr. Cleveland's accusations, Mr. Wollen said. **********In the lawsuit, Mr. Cleveland also said General Cigar's president, Mr. McNamara, had told him that a senior Culbro executive had tipped a friend in advance to Culbro's plan last spring to sell a stake to Tabacalera S. A., a Spanish tobacco company. The lawsuit does not identify who may have received such a tip. **********The S.E.C. has been informally investigating trading in Culbro shares in advance of the Tabacalera deal since May. Mr. Wollen said that investigation did not involve any company executives, and that he did not know its current status. Among the people the S.E.C. has interviewed is Mr. Gabelli, who said he was confident that nothing untoward would be found. \"We operate in a goldfish bowl,\" he said. \"It is a flagrant abuse to connect our firm with allegations of using inside information.\" The S.E.C. does not comment on pending investigations. **********It was after Mr. Cleveland's allegations were made in court that Culbro's handling of its troubles began to fray, in the view of several governance experts. Culbro's board seems to have dismissed the charges out of hand. Mr. Harmon continued to devote his attention to the Alabama situation. \"It just seemed to be a disgruntled ex-employee, trying to throw up a lot of chaff,\" one director said, speaking on condition of anonymity. **********Mr. Vincent said, \"Nothing we saw in his complaint impressed us very much.\" **********But on Feb. 7, a subpoena issued by a Federal grand jury in Connecticut was served on General Cigar, seeking company documents \"relevant to many of the charges contained in the lawsuit\" by Mr. Cleveland, who had sent the complaint to Federal prosecutors after he filed it. **********Faced with a new set of troubles, Mr. Wollen immediately hired Mr. Conboy as  special counsel to investigate the Cleveland allegations. **********It turned out that several General Cigar executives had made personal political donations, totaling about $11,000 and including gifts to the Presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole, and had been reimbursed by the subsidiary -- a violation of Federal campaign laws. Mr. Cullman Jr., though, said he believed the executives who solicited the gifts did not realize their actions were improper. **********Mr. Conboy said the political campaigns had refunded the gifts and the company was negotiating a settlement with the Federal Election Commission. As for the subpoenas in the Cleveland case, Mr. Conboy said, \"We appreciate that they have a duty to investigate, and we will be presenting all of the documents  that are germane. I expect, when all of the documents are examined and interviews are completed, that there will be no basis for prosecutors to proceed with a criminal charge.\" **********His confidence is bolstered by an affirmation, submitted in Federal court in  Alabama by Charles Niven, an assistant United States Attorney. In that filing, dated Feb. 6, Mr. Niven explained that a Federal grand jury was investigating the accusations filed in General Cigar's civil racketeering suit against Mr. Cleveland and the local trucking company. **********\"Upon consideration of the law and the evidence, I reasonably expect the grand jury to return an indictment against defendants named in\" that civil suit  within 60 to 90 days, Mr. Niven continued, \"including defendant Paul Cleveland.\" **********Mr. Cleveland declined to comment. **********Were shareholders told any of this? None of Culbro's adventures in the land of law enforcement were disclosed during the year or are mentioned in the annual report. Mr. Wollen said he felt \"disclosure was made when appropriate and where appropriate,\" since none of it was deemed to be financially material. **********Mr. Gabelli has no qualms about the company's handling of its investigation.  \"These are the creme de la creme,\" he said, \"so you don't worry about whether this is an issue of corporate governance.\" He and his senior aide, Douglas Jamieson, acknowledge a bit of chagrin, however: they held a meeting to introduce Culbro to Wall Street analysts at the end of October, and none of these issues came up. \"Maybe we just didn't ask the right questions,\" Mr. Jamieson said. **********Those questions are sure to be asked now, and the answers will test how well  this board has learned the lessons of the 1990's, when company directors, from the Cooper Companies to Morrison Knudsen, found to their mortification that a board room is no place to pull your punches."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/02/business/general-re-to-buy-rival-for-940-million.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1996-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 634, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "General Re to Buy Rival for $940 Million", "print_headline": "General Re to Buy Rival for $940 Million", "body_text": " **********The General Re Corporation, the largest property and casualty reinsurer, agreed yesterday to buy the National Re Corporation, a smaller competitor, for $940 million in cash and stock in a deal that analysts said might signal consolidation in the reinsurance industry. **********Analysts said the sale was a move by Richard M. Bass, the Fort Worth investor who is a major investor in National Re, to cash in before trends in the reinsurance industry erode the value of his investment. **********Anaysts said that General Re, based in Stamford, Conn., was acquiring a crosstown rival that had made smarter underwriting decisions and had better clients but that also was too small to prosper in the long run in the intensely  competitive reinsurance field. **********The purchase price of $53 a share, half in cash and half in General Re stock, is a 40 percent premium over National Re's closing price Friday of $37.75 a share. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of National Re surged $13.625 yesterday, closing at $51.375. **********Wall Street favored the deal for General Re as well, and its shares jumped $2.25 to close at $154.50. **********The purchase price is almost 16 times the consensus estimate among analysts for National Re's 1997 net operating profits per share. The stock market on Friday had priced the company at slightly under 11 times earnings. **********The deal should allow National Re to trim $3 million in expenses by cutting some jobs and eliminating J.  P. Morgan & Company as its investment adviser, while at the same time making riskier investments that will raise its return on  capital by perhaps one-half of one percentage point, Alice D. Schroeder, an insurance industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said. **********Ronald Ferguson, chief executive of General Re, said in a statement that the  purchase \"complements and solidifies General Re's position as the leading U.S. reinsurer and augments our position as the premier global reinsurer.\" **********Both General Re and National Re focus their businesses on the less volatile segments of property and casualty insurance, with relatively minor exposure to catastrophic losses from hurricanes, oil tanker groundings and other costly disasters, analysts said. Because of the huge costs of these catastrophes, insurers have been demanding that reinsurers strengthen their balance sheets, analysts said, and adopt more sophisticated investment strategies. **********Ms. Schroeder called the deal a \"plug-and-play acquisition because most of National Re management are ex-General Re employees and National Re has always marketed itself as a smaller, more responsive version of General Re.\" She said,  \"Their cultures are very much alike and General Re should be able to retain more of National Re's key people than anyone else could have.\" **********Ms. Schroeder and others said the principal risk to General Re shareholders in the deal would be losing many of the National Re executives and underwriters. **********It will take two years to measure General Re's success at keeping the best talent, David Seifer, an insurance analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********Steven Gavios, an insurance analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said \"the premium represents a fair price given National Re's higher quality book of business and client list, the significant high-quality group of clients they bring and their underwriter discipline, which is too rare in insurance and reinsurance.\" **********He said National Re's payout ratio was about 100 percent of premiums, compared with as much as 105 percent for some other reinsurers. Reinsurers profit by investing premiums, which are collected long before claims are paid, but they have difficulty turning a profit if claims exceed premiums, he said. **********National Re's largest shareholders are two Texas investment groups that share the same address: Keystone Inc., which is controlled by Mr. Bass, and Acadia Partners, in which he is a major investor. **********National Re was taken private in a 1989 leveraged buyout and then went public four years ago at $25 a share."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/despite-concern-over-abuses-albanian-local-vote-goes-smoothly.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-10-21", "snippet": "Voting in local Albanian elections, watched with unusual concern by international observers, proceeds relatively smoothly, though Government took number of actions before vote that Western diplomats say seemed intended to undermine voter confidenc...", "word_count": 755, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite Concern Over Abuses, Albanian Local Vote Goes Smoothly", "print_headline": "Despite Concern Over Abuses, Albanian Local Vote Goes Smoothly", "body_text": " **********Voting in local Albanian elections that was watched with unusual concern by international observers appeared to go relatively smoothly today, though the Government took a number of actions before the elections that Western diplomats said appeared intended to undermine voter confidence. **********The Government of President Sali Berisha, a former Communist, had been heavily criticized by the United States after parliamentary elections in May were marred by fraud and violence. **********Full results from today's elections were not expected until Monday and the main opposition parties remained concerned that there would be some fraud in counting the votes. **********Before the election, the Government refused to allow the chief European election monitoring group to bring its full team of observers and waited until the last minute to give accreditation to the largest domestic monitoring group. **********After supporting Dr. Berisha as a leader who held out the promise of stability in the unstable Balkans, the United States was embarrassed by his use of police violence to break up an opposition rally days after the May elections. **********Western governments said the elections in May, in which Dr. Berisha's Democratic Party claimed it had received 90 percent of the vote, were marked by fraud and intimidation. Dr. Berisha, whose early indications that he respected democratic principles have given way to increasingly autocratic methods, refused in July to meet with a State Department official who wanted to express displeasure over the May election. **********Elsa Ballauri, who has founded a human rights group in Albania, said  the biggest cost of Dr. Berisha's actions in May was a widespread loss of confidence among ordinary Albanians that voting would make a difference. **********In a country where turnout is usually extraordinarily high because Albanians were virtually forced to go to the polls under the four decades of  Enver Hoxha's Communist dictatorship, turnout was light today at some polling places in Tirana, the capital. Ms. Ballauri said the turnout was a sign that voters doubted whether their votes would be counted correctly after their experiences in May. **********Ms. Ballauri said she was also concerned about the restrictions put on the Albanian monitoring group, The Society for Democratic Culture, which was founded four years ago with the help of a Washington group, the National Democratic Institute. At the last minute, the Albanian Government prevented the society from enlisting monitors under age 25, and the Government declined to release monitoring credentials until two days before the election. **********''They wanted to eliminate university students who wanted to be observers,'' Ms. Ballauri said. **********A State Department spokesman said the Clinton Administration was ''deeply troubled'' by Dr. Berisha's decision to limit the number of observers from the monitoring group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Because of the refusal to allow a full delegation of monitors from the group's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the group withdrew. In support, monitors from the parliamentary assembly of the European group, of which Albania is a member, abandoned plans to come. **********A contingent of 56 observers from the United States, more than 150 from Italy, 35 from the Council of Europe and others from Austria and France, fanned out across the country this morning. **********Under pressure from the West, the Government had agreed to strengthen election laws before today's vote. Monitors reported that the most vital elements of the new law -- keeping the police out of the polling places and allowing opposition party members to sit alongside members of the governing party inside the polling places -- were being enforced. **********In Fier, 90 miles south of the capital, Ethem Lalaj, a former army officer who stood inside a polling place as an observer for the opposition Socialist Party, said the voting was going ''quite well.'' **********''But I'm not sure about how the counting will go after the polls close,'' he said. **********Asked what the election was really about, many voters took a jaded view. **********''The Mayor? It's a job for someone to get rich, that's all,'' said Aslam Ndreko, an appliance salesman in Fier. ''The Mayor of this town is not running again because he made lots of money in the last four years. He's building an apartment block in the center of town.'' **********The Mayors of Tirana and Vlora, a  port town, were not running again because they had become wealthy enough, some voters in those cities were saying. **********City services in Albania are virtually nonexistent, voters said. ''Everyone takes life into their own hands,'' said Viola Vetani, 20, a saleswoman in a furniture store in Fier. ''See the new sidewalk outside the store?

Unfortunately, those who bought were destined to suffer. **********Today, the company, now renamed Metal Recovery Technologies, trades on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board, having been delisted from Nasdaq in 1995. And after a 1-for-20 reverse split, also in 1995, the stock trades for about 82 cents. In other words, the share that went for $6.56 is now worth about 4 cents, for a 99 percent decline in less than three years. **********Those who bought the stock may be inclined to dismiss the investment as an unfortunate speculation, but yesterday Federal prosecutors provided another explanation: at least some brokers who steered their clients into the stock were bribed to do so. The person paying them was a stock promoter hired by Malvy. **********Charges filed in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., accused five brokers for small firms of committing fraud by taking bribes from a stock promoter named Harcourt Wiltshire, who had previously pleaded guilty to paying such bribes. Three of the brokers were cited for taking bribes to sell Malvy stock at prices ranging from $2.28 to $4.94 a share. Altogether, the brokers were accused of taking bribes to sell seven different stocks. **********Rick Murad, the assistant United States  attorney prosecuting the case, said the five brokers had agreed to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation. **********Officials of Metal Recovery, which is based in Houston, could not be reached for comment. The number listed for the company is no longer in service. **********The brokers who were charged with wire fraud and securities fraud were Simon D. Baier, who worked for Joseph Roberts & Company and for Euro-Atlantic Securities in Chicago; David W. D'Andrea, who worked for Barron Chase Securities in Boca Raton, Fla.; Nicholas J. Giandomenico, who worked for Greenway Capital, Meyers Pollock Robbins, Thomas James Associates and Barron Chase, in Florida and Boston; Richard D. Henderson, who worked for Cohig & Associates in Chicago, and Joseph Miceli Jr., who worked for Barron Chase in Boca Raton. **********None of the brokerage firms were accused of complicity in the practice, in which, according to the charges, the brokers were paid about 20 percent of what their customers paid for the stock, on top of the normal commissions they were paid by their firms. The payments were contingent on clients not selling the stock without permission from the promoter. **********These were the six other companies involved, according to the charges: ***********Madison Sports and Entertainment Group of Fort Lauderdale. The brokers were said to have sold investors shares at prices between $3.16 and $6.68. It closed yesterday at $2.09 a share. ***********U.S. Exploration of Independence, Kan. It now trades for $2.97 a share, in contrast to the $1.37 to $7.09 paid by customers. ***********Entertainment and Gaming International of Pompano Beach, Fla., now known as Whitestone Industries.

Investors paid 44 cents to $3.38 for shares now each worth 25 cents. ***********Linium Technology of Miami, now called Value Holdings. Holders paid 51 cents to $1.51 for shares now worth a tenth of a penny each. ***********Wavetech of Tucson, Ariz. Holders paid $1.03 for shares worth 72 cents. **********While the charges say the companies had retained the promoters, they do not specifically contend that the companies were aware of the techniques that would be used to sell their shares. **********One thing most of the companies involved in these cases have in common is that they were listed on the Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets, places for companies that cannot even be listed on Nasdaq's small capitalization list. While there are good companies on the Bulletin Board, it is also a place where many dubious ones are found. **********Performance Nutrition **********Dismisses Chairman **********Another Bulletin Board company was in the news yesterday, expressing shock at learning that its chairman and chief executive was a convicted felon. **********Performance Nutrition Inc. said it had dismissed the chairman, Gary Lewellyn, and the company's secretary and treasurer, Tamara Halling, and was investigating the activities of the prior management as well as the accuracy of its past financial statements. **********The company said that the actions were taken following the publication of an article noting Mr. Lewellyn's past, which included a prison term for embezzling $16.7 million from an Iowa bank run by his father. **********But the announcement did not note that the article in question ran in The Dallas Observer, a weekly newspaper, on June 27. Since then, the stock price has fallen from about $2.38 to 88 cents. **********Performance Nutrition has been marketing a diet supplement as being beneficial to children afflicted with attention deficit disorder. **********If those officials really learned of Mr. Lewellyn's past from the newspaper article, their diligence is open to question. In late 1994, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Mr. Lewellyn and Charles Bazarian, now in Federal prison on other charges, contending that they had manipulated the stock of Performance Systems in driving it to a 1992 peak of $8.125. Those charges, which are still pending, described his past. **********It was not clear what the company thought might be wrong with the financial statements. The Observer article did not criticize them or mention Ms. Halling, who has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment. **********Yesterday's announcement of new management at Performance Systems named David Wynne as the new corporate secretary.

In London, investors pushed BT's shares up more than 4 percent in heavy trading, but on the sidelines some analysts sniped at both MCI's price and its prospects. **********The surge of 16 pence in BT's share price, to 372 ($6.10), \"is not a ringing endorsement of the MCI deal,\" said Peter Roe, an analyst with Paribas Capital Markets. Instead, he and others said it mostly reflected BT's promise to pay a special dividend of 35 pence a share next year. Prospects for the combined entity \u2014 to be known as Concert Global Communications PLC \u2014 and for the entire industry are far less certain. **********\"The world of telecommunications is becoming more expensive and at the same time less lucrative,\" Andrew Harrington, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said, citing increases in competition and investment around the globe. **********In the United States, the industry outlook is clouded by a changing regulatory environment. Long-distance companies are being allowed to offer local phone service, and terms are being finalized to allow local companies to sell long-distance service. This offers both an opportunity and a threat for MCI. **********\"MCI may be the second-largest long-distance phone company in the United States, but it has yet to prove itself in the local market, where the profits and the growth will be,\" said Graham Johnson, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute. **********Analysts said various legal challenges to deregulation had already effectively delayed the onset of unbridled competition from the beginning of this year until late next year. **********Those uncertainties have left many analysts wondering whether BT, at best, has overpaid for MCI. **********BT's eagerness to press ahead with the deal, uncertainties and all, may reflect its own predicament: The company has been criticized for its heavy dependence on its home market. In Britain, the former state phone monopoly has managed to hold on to 83 percent of the business market and 93 percent of the residential market since it was privatized in 1984, but it has been forced by regulators to agree to annual price cuts. In that context, some see the leap into the U.S. market as just the tonic BT needed. **********\"This is just the catalyst BT needed to escape its share-price coma of the last two years,\" said Evan Miller, an analyst **********at CS First Boston. For three years, BT has owned 20 percent of MCI. Together they have made their joint international arm, Concert, the world leader in offering seamless global phone service to multinational companies. **********Now Mr. Miller and others say BT not only has swept away the complexities of the old joint venture but has, by buying MCI, transformed itself into a global phone giant. That enhanced status, argue the optimists, should make its easier for the new Concert to find and sign up long-sought partners in Asia. The new company would have operations in 72 countries, 43 million customers and annual revenue of $42 billion **********BT also stands to benefit from tying itself to an organization far more entrepreneurial in spirit. The lessons MCI has learned in wrenching 20 percent of the U.S. long-distance market away from AT&T Corp. should be useful to Concert in its ambitions to grab market share in Europe after deregulation in 1998. **********For MCI, the rewards of the transaction will be mostly financial. MCI has big ambitions. Among other things, it plans to begin local phone service in the 25 largest U.S. markets by early next year, giving it a foothold in a $100 billion-a-year market. Expanding that foothold will take vast amounts of capital, something that BT can raise far more cheaply than MCI could."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/28/business/cable-chief-has-a-full-agenda-and-1.2-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1996-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cable Chief Has a Full Agenda, and $1.2 Billion", "print_headline": "Cable Chief Has a Full Agenda, and $1.2 Billion", "body_text": " **********If U S West completes its planned purchase of Continental Cablevision, Amos B.

In an industry in which companies are frequently criticized for treating customers badly, \"Continental is renowned for first-class operations,\"  said John Reidy, who follows the cable industry for Smith Barney. **********Continental has a reputation for good customer service, and Mr. Hostetter has been instrumental in supporting services like C-Span and Cable in the Classroom. **********Mr. Hostetter grew up in Short Hills, N.J., the son of a Wall Street stockbroker. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1961, he became involved in a tiny cable company in New Hampshire. That gave him and a fraternity roommate from his college days at Amherst, Irving Grousbeck, an interest in cable that they pursued, eventually investing in cable systems in two towns in Ohio. Mr. Grousbeck later left the business to teach at Harvard; Mr. Hostetter went on to build Continental. **********Today the company is the third-largest cable operator in the nation, after Tele-Communications and Time-Warner. Despite its size, Continental has been pressured to raise financing. In 1994, the company acquired the Providence Journal Company's cable business, with 770,000 subscribers, for stock. But because Continental was a private company, its shares were not readily convertible into cash, and Mr. Hostetter promised the Providence Journal shareholders that they would have such liquidity by October 1996. **********At the time of that deal, Continental stock was valued at $19 a share by Bear, Stearns & Company. Believing that he would not get the price he wanted if  he took his company public, Mr. Hostetter chose instead to sell to U S West. As  a result, he will get about $30 a share. **********He is not the only one who stands to make money. Mr. Hostetter said that roughly 100 of Continental's 10,000 employees would make $1 million or more as a result of the sale. **********Though he is clearly in charge of his company, Mr. Hostetter handed much of the negotiating to Steven Rattner, his investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company, and Timothy P. Neher, a vice chairman at Continental. **********But Mr. Hostetter can be tough when he has to be. Both Continental and Tele-Communications were shareholders in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. when Time Warner said last year it would buy Turner. Mr. Hostetter was not happy with the preferential treatment he believed Tele-Communications was getting from Time Warner. \"John had some right to a premium because he had veto rights to the deal, but we thought it was excessive,\" Mr. Hostetter said of Mr. Malone. **********Ultimately, Continental got itself a better deal. **********Entrepreneurs often grow restless and impatient with corporate hierarchies, but in an era in which many media executives seem happy to get out of the business, Mr. Hostetter gave every indication yesterday that he was planning to  hang around. \"I would go crazy if I went to the beach; I'm mildly hyperactive,\" he said, smiling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/business/is-lebow-picking-fight-with-icahn-over-rjr.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1996-11-07", "snippet": "Market Place column explores two potential proxy challenges to RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp's board, one by Carl C Icahn and one by his erstwhile ally, Bennett S LeBow (M)", "word_count": 874, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Is LeBow Picking Fight With Icahn Over RJR?", "print_headline": "Is LeBow Picking Fight With Icahn Over RJR?", "body_text": " **********Has Bennett S. LeBow, the investor and sometime corporate raider, picked a feud with his erstwhile ally, the financier Carl C. Icahn? This is a question of intense interest to investors in the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, who this week saw the start of not one but two potential proxy challenges to the company's board. **********Mr. LeBow and Mr. Icahn were, of course, allies in last April's unsuccessful proxy battle against RJR Nabisco's board. They parted company in June -- as friends, they said. But on Tuesday, Mr. LeBow took shareholders by surprise with his 11th-hour filing of a dissident slate of board nominees in yet another attempt to force RJR Nabisco to immediately spin off its food business from its tobacco operations. **********That was only a day after Mr. Icahn renewed his own battle to force an immediate spinoff by filing his separate board slate. **********The idea of a LeBow-Icahn battle is hardly far-fetched, since the two investors have not always been best buddies. For a time they were archenemies, during the reorganization under bankruptcy-law protection of the New Valley Corporation, the former holding company of Western Union, which Mr. LeBow now heads. **********Mr. Icahn pressured Mr. LeBow to forgo more than $1 million a year in management fees, which he agreed to do. But, after Mr. Icahn was paid 100 cents on the dollar for his bonds, the two men quickly reconciled. **********But now, according to Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst for Smith Barney, Mr. LeBow's board slate proposal ''undercut'' Mr. Icahn's slate, ''as if he's saying that Icahn isn't up to the job.'' Mr. Icahn declined to comment on Mr. LeBow. **********On the face of it, the very idea of a new LeBow challenge is windmill-tilting. ''I don't think that RJR shareholders will give him a chance,'' said Diana K. Temple, a securities analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. **********After all, many analysts attributed the failure of last April's proxy battle to the settlement made by Mr. LeBow's Liggett Group Inc. cigarette company with a consortium of plaintiffs' lawyers representing smokers and five state attorneys general suing tobacco companies. **********The Liggett agreement was followed by a dramatic decline in the value of shares of not only RJR Nabisco but also the Philip Morris Companies. Many institutional investors lost money in the decline, and some blamed Mr. LeBow. **********Mr. LeBow was in Moscow yesterday and could not be reached. There he announced that he would collaborate with Donald Trump on a new luxury high-rise residential tower on land controlled by Mr. LeBow's Russian tobacco-and-real-estate subsidiary. **********Several executives with knowledge of Mr. LeBow's RJR Nabisco strategy said that the advance filing was a formality intended to keep his options open. It was made necessary by RJR Nabisco's unusually early filing deadline to register proxy slates, nearly six months in advance of the April annual meeting. **********Several executives who know both Mr. Icahn and Mr. LeBow said that they had not renewed their enmity, despite Mr. LeBow's filing. Indeed, these executives said, the two investors recently had a cordial social meeting. **********So if malice wasn't the reason, why did Mr. LeBow mount another board slate? ''LeBow loves the tobacco business and he doesn't want to let go of his dream of running RJR Nabisco,'' said an executive familiar with Mr. LeBow's thinking. ''He's hoping against hope that before the next annual meeting some doomsday problem or lawsuit will lower RJR's stock to $17, and that then they'll come to him wanting to do a deal with him, merging with Liggett.'' **********The five states' attorneys general have agreed to include RJR Nabisco in the Liggett settlement if the company should ever be merged with Mr. LeBow's Liggett cigarette maker. That would shield RJR Nabisco from some liability. **********''If this is Mr. LeBow's thought process,'' said Mr. Feldman, the analyst, ''he is misguided in the extreme.'' **********The challenge of Mr. LeBow and Mr. Icahn ''is not a tactic I'm going to respond to,'' Steven F. Goldstone, RJR Nabisco's chief executive, said yesterday in an interview. ''I'll let our shareholders decide how to deal with them.'' **********Mr. LeBow's filing sets up a three-way competition for RJR Nabisco's 450,000 shareholders at the company's annual meeting, although Mr. Icahn or Mr. LeBow could attempt to call a special meeting sooner with a 25 percent vote of all shares. **********''I don't think that investor sentiment is receptive to a special meeting right now,'' said Ms. Temple, the analyst. But other analysts have said that given Mr. Icahn's 7.4 percent of RJR Nabisco shares, and Mr. LeBow's 1.3 percent, it was not impossible to imagine that together they could proselytize for the 25 percent of shares needed to call a special meeting. **********As investors ponder this proxy battle, they can be cheered by yesterday's rise in tobacco stocks. Shares of RJR Nabisco rose $1, closing at $30.125 on The New York Stock Exchange, and shares of Philip Morris rose $3.875, closing at $97.375. **********But this run-up had nothing to do with Mr. LeBow or Mr. Icahn, said Mr. Feldman and Ms. Temple. The reason, they said, was the prospect that a Republican-controlled Congress would be friendlier to tobacco companies -- and more favorably disposed to settlement by plaintiffs' lawyers, the tobacco companies, Congress and the White House that would end the tobacco-litigation threat that has depressed the value of cigarette stocks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/business/executive-changes-078719.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********APPLE COMPUTER INC., Cupertino, Calif., named George Scalise chief administrative officer. **********FIDELITY INVESTMENTS, Boston, which is owned by FMR Corp., named Sherif A.

Israeli officials said 45 rockets struck northern Israel today, as many as fell in the last two days. [The Israeli Army said the guerrillas resumed the shelling on Monday morning, but no one was hurt, Reuters reported.] **********For the third day in a row, Israeli helicopter gunships struck Beirut, hitting what the Israelis described as offices of the Party of God in the southern suburbs. Lebanese reports said the rockets struck shops adjacent to the office. **********The Israelis also hit an electrical transformer station in the Bekaa region,  blacking out parts of the city. Officers said the strike was in retaliation for  a Katyusha rocket that did similar damage on Saturday in the northern city of Qiryat Shemona. **********The actions followed Israel's two-pronged strategy of battering guerrilla bases and offices, and of building pressure on the Lebanese and Syrian Governments to rein in the Party of God, the Iranian backed-militant group known as Hezbollah , which has been waging a guerrilla struggle for 11 years to  drive the Israeli Army from the buffer zone it maintains inside southern Lebanon. **********The warnings today to the southern port city of Tyre, and to the western Bekaa region and the towns of Nabatiye and Zaharani, doubled the estimated number of refugees on the move to 400,000, confronting Lebanese and Syrian authorities with a huge problem. Syria, with 35,000 troops in Lebanon, has effective control over Lebanon's politics. **********The Israelis launched the offensive on Thursday, charging that two rocket attacks against northern Israel this month were the last straw in what Israel described as a steady escalation of the Party of God's attacks, both against soldiers in the buffer zone and against settlements in northern Israel. **********In the attacks on northern Israel today, two people were slightly wounded, and one rocket landed in a school in western Galilee, causing extensive damage but injuring no one. Schools in northern Israel have been closed since the military operation began, and most children, along with a majority of adults, have left for safer zones. **********Those who remained in Qiryat Shemona, the city most often struck by Katyushas, were joined by the Israeli President, Ezer Weizman, and his wife. Interviewed in the bunker he shared with a group of residents, Mr. Weizman said, \"We came here because there is tension.\" **********Despite the size of the barrage, the Israeli military chief of staff, Lieut.  Gen. Amnon Shahak, said in a televised news conference that the Party of God's fire was weakening. He said that instead of the salvos of missiles that the guerrillas usually launched, they were now firing one, two or three and running  away. **********At the news conference, the commander of the Israeli Air Force, Maj. Gen. Herzl Budinger, showed videotapes of Israeli warplanes making what he said were  precise hits on buildings used by the Party of God. The images of the lengthy series of strikes were reminiscent of the American demonstrations during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and served to support Israel's contention that the Israeli military is taking great care not to strike civilian targets. **********On a visit to northern Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres stressed those efforts. **********\"If there is a village from which Katyushas were launched against Israel, we  ask the residents of that village to evacuate the village,\" he said. \"If in that village there was a particular house from which Katyushas were fired against Israel, or a house from where someone from the Hezbollah acted, we attack that house, and only that house. We are very careful to safeguard human lives.\" **********Lebanese radio said the toll in Lebanon stood at 29 dead -- including 6 killed on Saturday when an Israeli helicopter rocketed an ambulance -- and 109 wounded, while no Israeli has been killed. The last major Israeli operation in Lebanon, in 1993, took 130 lives. **********There was no indication how much longer the operation would last, though Israeli officials said it would be at least several more days. The 1993 strikes  lasted seven days. **********The current operation has touched off a flurry of diplomatic activity, although the United States, the only country with the authority to mediate a cease-fire, maintained its stance of putting the blame solely on the Party of God and otherwise largely standing aside. **********The Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik al-Hariri, traveled to Cairo and to Paris, trying to get help from President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Jacques Chirac of France. **********In an interview with French television, Mr. Hariri reiterated his insistence  that Lebanon was powerless to curb the Party of God, and that the only solution  was for Israel to vacate the buffer zone. \"Israel asks that we disarm Hezbollah  and at the same time it occupies part of our territory,\" he said. \"We cannot do  that. It is impossible. We cannot resolve this problem with force. Israel must withdraw, and we take responsibility for security there. I don't say that because I am obstinate, but because I see no other solution.\" **********At Lebanon's request, the United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting on the conflict for Monday. **********But without pressure from the United States, there was no chance Israel would bow to pressure from the United Nations or any other government, or that it would end the operation before it felt it could expect a favorable cease-fire. Israel's main demand in any truce is an end to all Katyusha attacks. **********But the Party of God declared its intention not only to continue, but also to spread the fight. Israeli radio said the Islamic organization's television station showed 70 young men wearing masks taking an oath on the Koran to mount suicide attacks against Israel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/business/tough-crackdown-on-nasdaq-market-announced-by-us.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1996-08-09", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission charges Nasdaq stock market has been dominated by small group of brokers who fixed prices while National Association of Securities Dealers, industry self-regulatory group, ignored illegal behavior; censures NASD ...", "word_count": 1704, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOUGH CRACKDOWN ON NASDAQ MARKET ANNOUNCED BY U.S.", "print_headline": "TOUGH CRACKDOWN ON NASDAQ MARKET ANNOUNCED BY U.S.", "body_text": " **********The world's second-largest stock market, Nasdaq, has been dominated by a small group of brokers who fixed prices with impunity while those who were charged with regulating the market ignored the illegal behavior, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged today as it announced tough measures to change the way that market is administered. **********The commission imposed a formal censure on the National Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory organization that oversees the Nasdaq market. It was the first time the commission had ever censured a major stock market. **********The Nasdaq market has grown rapidly in recent years, with a roster of companies that includes leading  technology companies like Intel and Microsoft. One commission official estimated that investors in Nasdaq stocks had lost tens of millions of dollars in recent years as a result of the price-fixing. **********Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the S.E.C., said the commission had found a pattern of conduct in which brokers coordinated what they charged customers. ''Investors paid too much, and received too little, when they bought and sold stock on Nasdaq,'' he said. **********Mr. Levitt said the anticompetitive practices, far from being a secret, were routinely taught to new traders, and became a part of expected behavior. ''Where was the N.A.S.D., the cop on the Nasdaq beat?'' Mr. Levitt asked. ''The N.A.S.D. was not blind to these practices in the marketplace,'' he said. ''It simply looked the other way.'' **********When some dealers nonetheless tried to compete on the basis of price, the S.E.C. said, they were discouraged through harassment and intimidation by other dealers. The commission said N.A.S.D. officials knew of such actions, but did nothing to stop them. **********The N.A.S.D. is an organization that includes virtually all the nation's brokerage firms. It is charged with regulating the Nasdaq market, which, unlike stock exchanges with trading floors, is essentially a computer system that links brokers, who generally make trades by telephone.  The word Nasdaq originally stood for National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation system, but that was dropped years ago. **********The N.A.S.D. accepted the censure without admitting or denying the charges, and issued a statement emphasizing the changes it had already made under the prodding of a commission headed by Warren B. Rudman, a former Republican Senator from New Hampshire. Among other things, they separated the regulatory responsibilities from the running of the stock market, and put Mary L. Schapiro, a former member of the S.E.C., in charge of the regulatory activities. Mr. Levitt said he had confidence in the people now running the N.A.S.D. **********While the commission said N.A.S.D. officials knew of the illegal practices, it did not name any of them and apparently has decided to bring no charges against individual officials. But the inquiry remains open, and brokerage firms may yet be charged. **********The S.E.C.'s settlement with the N.A.S.D. calls for that organization to spend $100 million over the next five years to step up monitoring of the market to prevent further abuses. **********The money will come from Nasdaq's budget, which is raised from trading fees and other assessments on brokerage firms. Of that, $25 million is to be spent this year, representing just a 7 percent budget increase for the regulatory operation. **********The settlement also calls for a number of changes, some of them already put into effect, to prevent such things from happening again. **********The settlement, many of whose terms had been leaked earlier in the week, was announced this afternoon, less than 24 hours after the end of negotiations that had gone past midnight for three consecutive nights and involved the heads of major brokerage firms as well as executives of the N.A.S.D. **********It appears clear that the practices outlined by the S.E.C. cost investors large sums of money by forcing them to pay more for securities when they bought them, and to get less when they sold them, than might otherwise have been the case. **********To some extent, those losses may have been offset by reduced commissions, but the net effect was to raise profits of the brokerage industry substantially. **********Those profits are likely to come under some pressure as a result of the settlement today, but they could be hurt even more if the S.E.C. goes ahead with its plans to impose new trading rules later this years. Those rules, as proposed last year, were aimed at assuring that investors got the best possible price in trading. **********Many Nasdaq traders were outraged by the proposed rules, warning that they would devastate brokerage profits and reduce liquidity in the Nasdaq market by driving brokers out of business, and efforts have been made to get Congress to block the rules. But the picture of dealers contained in the report released by the S.E.C. today, as well as in a similar document released by the Justice Department last month, when it settled antitrust charges against the major dealers, may make it difficult for the dealers to arouse sympathy. **********Quoting liberally from tape recordings of Nasdaq traders -- tapes that had been made by the brokerage firms to protect themselves in case of disputes over particular trades -- the commission provided evidence of traders at one firm telling others about customer orders, of putting pressure on other firms to fix prices, and of delaying trading reports to deceive customers. **********In one case, a trader called the N.A.S.D. regulators to report that he had traded a stock during a trading halt, and to ask what to do. Such a trade was against the rules. The N.A.S.D. official, who was not named, responded by recommending that the trade be resubmitted to show, inaccurately, that it had taken place before the trading halt. **********In the last 25 years, the Nasdaq market has grown from a tiny backwater of over-the-counter stocks, most of them in small companies, into a market whose trading volume, measured in dollars, is second in the world only to the New York Stock Exchange. **********But unlike that exchange, the Nasdaq stock market is a ''dealer'' market, in which competing brokers known as market-makers stand ready to buy and sell stock. (Markets like the N.Y.S.E are ''auction'' markets, in which public orders are matched with each other and one market-maker, known as a specialist, is present with a mandate to trade if his involvement is needed.) **********Each Nasdaq market-maker quotes a ''bid'' price, at which he stands ready to buy, and an ''asked'' price, at which he is willing to sell, with the difference called the spread. Historically, the public could trade only at those two prices. **********If the price of a stock was $20 bid and $20.25 asked, and an individual wanted to buy at $20.125, the order might not even be accepted, and would not be executed unless the asked price fell to that level. That has withered under reforms instituted since the S.E.C. began putting pressure on the N.A.S.D., and would be all but completely obliterated under the rules the S.E.C. is considering. Under those rules, anyone, not just a market-maker, could submit a bid that was shown as the best one in the country. **********One practice in the Nasdaq market that was evidently known to traders, but not to the public, concerned just how wide spreads should be. Because at any given time a market-maker will be more interested in buying than selling a given stock, while another is more interested in selling it, it is unusual that the same market-maker would have both the best bid and the best asked price. So a given market-maker would have a wider spread between his bid and asked prices than was present for the overall market in that stock. **********The convention, both the S.E.C. and the Justice Department say, was that in any stock for which there was a dealer spread of at least 75 cents, the bid and asked prices must be in increments of 25 cents. That is, a bid could be at $20 or $20.25 or $20.50, but not at $20.125. If that were adhered to, then the combined best bid and asked prices could not be closer to each other than 25 cents. **********Only if a market-maker were willing to narrow his own spread to 50 cents, and only if that quote were good for an unusually large number of shares was it considered proper by traders to post an odd price, like  $20.125. Anyone doing so otherwise was subject to harassment and possible retaliation, as other traders tried to force that trader to go back to trading at what they viewed as a more proper and profitable spread. **********The S.E.C. quoted the head of Nasdaq trading at an unnamed firm, speaking to another trader in a taped phone conversation: ''Why should I do that?'' he asked, regarding the idea of lowering spreads. ''We might as well milk it for as long as we can.'' **********While this is the first censure of a major national stock market, it is far from the first run-in between the S.E.C. and the stock markets. Mr. Levitt recalled abuses by the N.Y.S.E. in the 1930's and the American Stock Exchange in the 1960's. In those years, however, the S.E.C. had the power only to put a market out of business, not to impose a lesser penalty like censure. **********The commission said that nearly all aspects of the N.A.S.D. had come to be dominated by market-makers, who enforced the rules as they wished, meting out punishment to those who fought them and ignoring violations by their own kind. In addition, they made it harder for firms they viewed as enemies to join the organization. Some of the changes  ordered by the commission are aimed at reducing that power by increasing public representation and by assuring that N.A.S.D. staff members can act without being hampered by member firms. **********While the harshest criticism in the S.E.C. report concerned the fixing of prices, it also criticized many other practices. It said that the N.A.S.D. had not enforced rules aimed at preventing market-makers from backing away from their quotes or from reporting them late. **********It also said that the N.A.S.D. had not made sufficient efforts to enforce a rule limiting political contributions by underwriters of municipal bonds, which are issued by states and cities. ''This failure reinforces concerns that the N.A.S.D. is reluctant to enforce rules against the major constituencies of its membership,'' the S.E.C. said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/02/business/market-place-score-one-for-s-l-investors-who-won-a-bet-against-the-us.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1996-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;Score one for S.& L. investors, who won a bet against the U.S.", "print_headline": "Market Place;Score one for S.& L. investors, who won a bet against the U.S.", "body_text": " **********JACKPOT! **********That was the reaction among investors yesterday after the Supreme Court cleared the way for some of the nation's savings and loans to pursue billions of dollars in damage claims against the Government. After years of on-again, off-again rulings in the case, savings and loan investors finally saw their most profitable day of the decade. **********Stocks surged after the ruling. Shares of the Glendale Federal Bank, one of  the lead plaintiffs in the case, jumped $1.50 to close at $19.625 in trading on  the New York Stock Exchange. The price of Cal Fed Bancorp, which has also sued the Government, jumped 75 cents, to $19 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. **********But the biggest price increase was in a security issued by Cal Fed to allow investors to gamble on the outcome of the litigation. These lawsuit futures -- much easier to remember than their official name, Contingent Litigation Recovery Participation Interest -- jumped $3.875 to close at $12.625 in over-the-counter  trading. **********Those closing gains were still down from sharper increases earlier in the day, as investors who had hung on to the securities in anticipation of the court decision cashed out. **********At the center of all this market excitement is a lawsuit that is essentially  nothing more than a Gargantuan contract dispute. The first suit was filed six years ago by savings and loans contending that the Government had reneged on a contract. **********Take the Cal Fed case. Years ago, under urging from the Government, Cal Fed bought six savings and loans with an understanding that it could count certain intangible assets as capital and take as long as 40 years to write them off -- a generous accounting treatment that protected its profits and capital base. **********But in 1989, Congress changed the rules with the savings and loan bailout. The law required institutions to write off intangible assets, known as good will, more quickly and prevented the institutions from counting intangible assets as capital. Everybody was forced to comply -- even those with previous agreements stating otherwise. **********Laden with $485 million in good will, Cal Fed was in danger of violating the  capital rules imposed by regulators. So it scrambled to stave off a takeover by  the Government, but at a cost -- its share value. Its stock has gone from an adjusted price of about $140 a share in 1989. **********The same story was played out at the other savings and loans. Glendale took over a failing Florida savings and loan in 1981, relieving the Government of $783 million in potential liability, on the same promise. The switch in accounting requirements devastated the company's earnings. Glendale filed suit six years ago. **********In their lawsuits, the savings and loans charged the Government with breach of contract and with an unlawful taking of property. The Government disagreed, arguing that lawmakers were free to wreak such havoc with new legislation if the intent was for the general good. But in its 7-to-2 decision yesterday, the Supreme Court tossed out that argument and found the Government liable for breach of contract. **********\"It's over,\" said Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst with the law firm of Auerbach Pollack & Richardson. \"The S.& L.'s won.\" **********That is not to say that either the companies or the investors will be seeing  any of this money anytime soon.

Much of Eastern Europe is just emerging from five years of brutal economic recession. By the reckoning of some experts, growth rates in many of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe over the next few years will hit between 4 percent and 7 percent \u2014 on a par with the Asian \"tiger\" economies. **********Of course, the Communists and their allies now in power are reaping the benefit of the hard work of the \"reformists\" whose orthodox policies brought economies under control but won few friends among the electorate. **********But investors considering an East European component to their portfolio would do well to ponder the question of what the resurgence of Communism really means for each economy.Are the new power structures composed on technocrats, committed to reform? Or are they thick with hard-liners eager to turn back the clock? **********The consensus among political risk analysts and brokers is that the Communists running many of the former Soviet satellite countries are in the reformer mold.In Russian and many of the countries of the former Soviet Union, however, the picture is more worrying. Many analysts fear that any further gains by the Communists in Russia could seriously derail reform. **********\"It is important to make the distinction between the Communists in Russia and those of Central Europe,\" says Bob Mckee, an economist at Independent Strategy Research, which advises fund managers.\"When the Soviet system collapsed, the Communists in Central Europe quickly remodeled themselves. Now that growth is starting to pick up, we believe that these countries offer the best emerging market prospects in the world after East Asia.\" **********\"Although the Communists are in power in most states in Central Europe, these parties bear little resemblance to their ancestors,\" says Laza Kekic, chief economist for Central and Eastern Europe at the Economist Intelligence Unit, which monitors political risk.He likens today's Communists to \"social democrats,\" committed to bringing their economies in line with a view to joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********Indeed, it is difficult to understand why Lajos Bokros, the respected finance minister of Hungary, even considers himself a Communist.\"Our task as socialists,\" he said recently, \"is to dismantle the state\" \u2014 which he has been doing. **********There seems little doubt that economic reform and privatization will continue throughout Central Europe. This is reflected in the country risk ratings recently compiled by the EIU, which show that, in terms of political and economic stability, the Czech Republic and Slovenia rate higher than Greece and Turkey. **********However, the situation further east is not as rosy, with Russia and Ukraine ranked among the riskiest countries.A large part of the trepidation, says the EIU, stems from the success of the Communist Party, whose members snatched 22 percent of the popular vote in the State Duma elections last month to make it the biggest party in Russia. **********What made the resurgence of the Communists even more worrying was the parallel success of other extremist parties: the ultra-right Nationalist Party, led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and the hard-line agrarians also did well. Many pundits estimate that hard-liners will have over 40 percent of the seats in the new Parliament. **********But the persistent question, analysts say, is whether the Communists in Russia are less committed to reform than their counterparts in Central Europe seem to be. **********Beth Hebert, who runs the Fleming fund investing in Russia, invited Vladimir Zyuganov, the Communist Party chief, to meet the investors in her fund before the elections. \"Our investors went away with the impression that the Communists were not a serious threat to the reform process,\" she says.\"In a sense they are part of the mainstream: no worse, no better than the other parties.\" **********Nancy Curtin, head of emerging markets at ING Baring Securities and former manager of Russia funds, adds that the answer may have to await the results of the presidential election in May \u2014 when Russians choose a leader whose most important tasks will be economic, not political.\"There is no doubt that Zyugaynov could win\" the presidency, Ms. Curtin says, \" but is he really that frightening? He will have to deal with economic reality like every other politician.\" **********FOR the time being, Russians don't seem unduly worried by the prospects of a Communist victory. Jura Ostrowsky, investment manager at Pictet & Co., which runs the First Russia Frontiers fund, says that Russians who have taken money out of the country over the past five years are starting to put some of it back in. Martin Andersen, who heads Brunswick Securities in Moscow, says: \"Even if you take the worst case scenario and you believe that there is a 30 percent chance of chaos, Western investors are still dramatically overestimating the risk. Stocks are trading at PEs of 1 and have a really good chance of multiplying by 15 or 20 times.\" **********Mr. Kekic at the EIU says it is important to separate hype from reality:\"Western reaction to the Communists varies from complacency \u2014'It won't change anything' \u2014to panic \u2014'It will turn the clock back to 1953.' **********\"The reality is somewhere in the middle. If the Communists win, there is likely to be protectionism, price control, and more state subsidies which might stain the budget. This adds up to a qualitative change which will probably mean higher inflation,\" he says. **********\"But they haven't won yet, and much depends on the health of President Boris Yeltsin. For the time being Mr. Zyuganov is on a roll, but things can change very quickly.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/04/world/have-nots-need-stake-in-mexico-envoy-says.html": {"writer_name": "Sam Dillon", "pub_date": "1996-12-04", "snippet": "Interview with James R Jones, US Ambassador to Mexico, who voices concern about growing gulf between country's haves and have-nots (M)", "word_count": 747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Have-Nots Need Stake In Mexico, Envoy Says", "print_headline": "Have-Nots Need Stake In Mexico, Envoy Says", "body_text": " **********One of James R. Jones's most sobering experiences as United States Ambassador here, he says, was a conversation in Tijuana with a cluster of young, unemployed Mexican men waiting for nightfall so they could climb the steel fence along the border. **********''The vast majority of these emigrants are young, they have a skill and they're just looking for work,'' Mr. Jones said. His conversation that night and others with desperate Mexicans seeking a better life have deepened his concerns about the growing gulf between the country's haves and have-nots. **********''I think we're living on limited time,'' Mr. Jones said. ''This generation of adults will probably survive on hope, but I think over the next five to ten years, if that isn't translated into benefits and real opportunities, you're going to have demagogues rise up who will want to turn the clock back.'' **********Mr. Jones, 57, a former Congressman from Oklahoma and chairman of the American Stock Exchange who arrived here in August 1993, has witnessed one of Mexico's most turbulent periods, marked not only by growing political strife but also by watershed economic change. **********During his tenure here, Mr. Jones has been a vigorous promoter of American-style capitalism, and he has rarely publicly expressed concern about the sometimes ruthless free-market system that is emerging as the country dismantles its state-managed economy. **********But in a recent interview in which he said he would leave his post early next year to return to the private sector, Mr. Jones warned bluntly that too few Mexicans are enjoying the fruits of the economic reforms. **********During the two-hour conversation,  Mr. Jones also said that American executives had expressed concern to him about the Helms-Burton Law. The American law aims to isolate Cuba by punishing foreign companies that invest there, but he said the executives had complained that it is instead isolating American corporations throughout the world. **********He also described how he worked this year to keep the close ties the Clinton Administration has nurtured with Mexico from becoming an issue in the American Presidential campaign. ''I was concerned that the U.S. political dialogue would become too strident or insensitive or offensive to Mexico,'' he said. **********The Clinton Administration has not yet nominated a replacement for Mr. Jones, and he would not say whom he had recommended. But other American and Mexican officials said they believed that Thomas F. McLarty 3d, President Clinton's chief of staff until June 1994, is the leading candidate. **********When Mr. Jones arrived here, his first mandate was to use his influence with American business to lobby on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Congress approved three months later. **********When the Zapatista guerrillas began an armed uprising six weeks later, Mr. Jones said, he urged Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the President at that time, not to rely on force. **********''There were a lot of people here who were suggesting that that was the answer,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I tried to give them my best judgment of what investors would do if they abused human rights and relied on the old authoritarian methods of cracking down.'' **********Then two years ago, Mexico found itself in an economic crisis, forced to devalue the peso. The United States led a largely successful $20 billion rescue effort, which he helped assemble. All of these events have been punctuated by a series of political assassinations, kidnappings and upheaval for the governing party. **********Last month the Finance Ministry announced that Mexico's economy surged by 7.4 percent in the third quarter, another sign of the country's economic recovery, which Mr. Jones predicted repeatedly when many financial analysts were warning foreign investors to stay away. **********But despite the encouraging economic signals, he said, the skewed distribution of wealth means that too few Mexicans are benefiting. **********''I would say maybe 40 percent or 50 percent of the population is benefiting from the new freedoms,'' he said. ''The other half -- or more -- are not.'' He noted that President Ernesto Zedillo contends that with 14 million of Mexico's 92 million people illiterate, merely building a modern factory would not solve the problem. **********But Mr. Jones recommended that the United States Government and corporations work with their Mexican counterparts to improve education and health systems and to build the country's infrastructure. **********''I don't believe in artificially distributing wealth, but this is a little bit like the Depression era in the United States,'' he said. ''Opportunities have got to become real for these people.'' **********''Otherwise,'' he added, ''these people are going to lose faith in free markets and democratic freedoms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/08/business/japan-tci-venture-in-asia.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan-TCI Venture in Asia", "print_headline": "Japan-TCI Venture in Asia", "body_text": " **********The Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, Tele-Communications Inc. and the Tokyo Broadcasting System have agreed to form a venture in Singapore to broadcast Japanese-made television programs by satellite through the Asia-Pacific region.

But neither the glare nor the special low-interest financing was enough to attract even glances from the few customers at the Yokohama Chrysler dealer one recent Sunday. **********''When the Neon was released, I think most Japanese were interested because of the price,'' said Kentaro Oba, a 36-year-old engineer, who, like most customers, was interested in the sexier Jeep Wrangler. ''But the Neon was delayed in coming to Japan, and in the meantime Japanese companies have cut prices.'' **********Indeed, the Neon, once dubbed the ''Japan car killer'' because of a base price under $10,000 when it was introduced in the United States in 1993, is instead getting killed in Japan. Chrysler has sold only about 900 of the cars since a specially made model with the steering wheel on the right went on sale in June. That means it will fall well short of its sales target of 4,000 by the end of the year. **********The Neon is not alone. In the wake of an automobile trade agreement in June 1995, American auto makers have aimed several small and midsized passenger cars at the Japanese market, and as a group they are doing worse than expected. The Ford Taurus, the best-selling car in the United States, is selling in Japan at only half the rate the Ford Motor Company anticipated. And the Chevrolet Cavalier, which is being sold here by the Toyota Motor Corporation in a closely watched cooperative experiment, is also falling short. **********The slow starts for the Big Three's big three strategic vehicles show that merely introducing cars with the steering wheel on the right -- as Japan repeatedly urged Detroit to do -- will not by itself be enough to succeed in Japan. It also means the advances of the American manufacturers in the Japanese market are starting to slow, after big gains in the last three years. **********To be sure, those three models are failures only when compared with the companies' targets, which -- given the lingering Japanese perception that Detroit's cars are of poor quality -- were probably overly ambitious to begin with. **********Taurus sales, for instance, are up 57 percent, on a year-to-year basis, since the right-hand-drive version was introduced in March. And while sales of the Cavalier will fall short of the annual target of 20,000 that Toyota and General Motors announced, the 12,000 or so that will be sold this year will by themselves more than double G. M.'s imports of American passenger cars. **********''If the target wasn't there, people might be talking about how successful it is,'' said Donald W. Hudler, president of G. M.'s Saturn division, which will soon be selling cars here. **********Still, the failure to meet the targets could make it difficult for the American companies to attract new dealers. It could also influence the willingness of the companies to bring the next generation of cars to Japan, since sales of about 20,000 a year are needed to justify the investment to make a right-hand-drive version. **********Ford had been hoping to sell 35,000 cars imported from the United States and Europe this year, but will probably sell 22,000, up about 5 percent from last year. Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Japan, now says that Ford's goal of selling 200,000 cars in Japan by 2000, with half of them imports, ''was sort of propaganda'' and that reaching that target will instead take 10 years. **********Chrysler had hoped to sell a total of 25,000 cars in Japan this year but will probably reach 16,000 or so, up about 10 percent. Only G. M. is seeing strong growth this year. **********The disappointments could set the stage for a revival of auto-related trade tensions, which have been held in abeyance since a 1995 pact. **********So far, Washington and Detroit have expressed satisfaction with progress under the agreement and particularly with the growth in sales of American cars this year. **********Over all, sales of imported vehicles by the Big Three through October were up 24 percent this year, to 103,460, with 65,656 of them made in America. Most of the growth came from Opel, G. M.'s German subsidiary, and from the Cavalier, which was not on sale last year. **********But Detroit has expressed concern that only 117 new dealer outlets handling American cars have opened since the agreement was signed, short of the United States goal of 200 by the end of the year. The United States contends that Japanese manufacturers discourage dealers from adding American cars to their lineups. Japan, which does not acknowledge the 200-outlet goal, says dealers are free to carry other brands but perhaps fear they will not make a profit selling American cars. **********A bigger contributor to trade tensions is the rise of the dollar against the yen, which has allowed Japanese companies to become more price competitive in the United States and to make strong gains there. **********Automobile exports from Japan to the United States, which in general have been declining for a decade, shot up 36 percent in October from the comparable month last year, although for the year as a whole exports are still down 15 percent. Japan will export about one million cars to the United States this year, more than 10 times the Big Three's exports of American-made cars to Japan. Over all, Japanese companies will sell more than 3.5 million cars and light trucks in the United States this year, including those made at their North American plants. **********Officials at G. M., Ford and Chrysler say they are not deterred by recent setbacks in Japan and are continuing with plans for new products. **********''Chrysler is committed to the market long term,'' said Hideo Hohgi, the president of Chrysler Japan Sales. The company will begin selling a right-hand-drive version of its Voyager mini-van in Japan in the spring. G. M.'s Saturn cars will also go on sale in the spring, while Ford recently introduced a right-hand-drive version of its Explorer sport-utility vehicle. **********The Big Three cannot directly blame the stronger dollar, which tends to raise the price of imports,  for their difficulties because they have held their retail prices steady here, accepting lower profits instead. **********The rise of the dollar is having an indirect effect, however, in that it has sharply lifted the profits of Japanese manufacturers, allowing them to mount advertising blitzes that caught the Americans flat-footed. **********''We were so surprised, but it was too late to revise the budget,'' said Osamu Nagata, vice president for marketing at Chrysler Japan Sales. **********Another problem is a sharp change in the market here. For years, Japanese executives have been saying that Detroit sold so few cars in Japan because it did not offer what the market wanted -- namely, small passenger cars with the steering wheel on the right. **********The American manufacturers are still not making cars with engines smaller than 2 liters, which account for the bulk of the market here, though with the 2-liter Neon and the 2.4-liter Cavalier they are getting closer. **********But now the market has shifted away from sedans to station wagons, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. Three-quarters of the Tauruses sold in Japan are wagons, but there are no wagon versions of the Neon and Cavalier. **********And even in the sedan market, the cars do not seem to fit. The Taurus, for instance, does not appeal to Japanese consumers. ''The design is too unique and too original, too strange,'' said Motooki Kihara, manager at Ford Seijo, a Tokyo dealer. The car is also a bit longer than the 16-foot-5-inch limit at some parking garages. **********Ford, which is seeking a mass market rather than the luxury niche inhabited by most imports in the past, has priced the Taurus low against competitors like the Toyota Mark II and Nissan Cefiro, two midsized models not sold in the United States. But the lower prices only raises suspicions among some consumers as to the car's quality. **********The Neon, which has a base price in Japan of about $12,000, suffers from Chrysler's limited distribution. It is also considered less reliable than competitors like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. **********''U.S. cars have made great progress in quality, but most people still have a bad image of them,'' said Tatsuhiko Kamiya, editor in chief of Motor magazine. **********For the Cavalier, there have been complaints about engines stalling and turn signals not working. ''We sell 400 to 500 Carinas a month and never have reports like that,'' said Kunihiko Masame, a spokesman for Kanagawa Toyota, a big dealer chain in the Yokohama area, referring to a Toyota sedan. ''We sell 50 Cavaliers and receive five complaints.'' **********As part of the G. M.-Toyota agreement, Toyota emblems appear on the hoods of Cavaliers, but Kanagawa Toyota has replaced some of them with Chevrolet insignias. Mr. Masame said this was intended to emphasize the American feel of the car,  but the move could be interpreted as an effort to disavow Toyota's responsibility for the vehicle. **********Analysts say the real problem is that Toyota's decision to sell 20,000 Cavaliers a year was made for political reasons, not because it needed such a car in its lineup. In a recent interview with Automotive News, Toyota's president, Hiroshi Okuda, said Toyota would ''not ever'' make such an agreement again. **********''I do not want to see our marketing and sales efforts diverted by Toyota having to sell Cavaliers or Volkswagens,'' he said. **********Still, the agreement with G. M. is for five years, so Toyota, its pride at stake, has started a new series of advertisements for the Cavalier. Mr. Masame of Kanagawa Toyota said the Cavalier was getting one and a half to two times as much promotional spending as its sales would justify. **********Hiroyuki Yoshino, executive vice president of the Honda Motor Company, said the American manufacturers would not succeed unless they designed cars specifically for the Japanese market, as opposed to modifying an existing car, as was the case for the Neon, Cavalier and Taurus. Even Honda's Accord, which does phenomenally well in the American market, does not sell nearly as well in Japan. **********The Japanese do design some cars, like the Accord and the Toyota Avalon, either partly or completely in the United States. But that is because they sell a huge number of cars there. American executives say it is impractical to design an entire vehicle for Japan given the volumes they can expect to sell here. **********Mr. Suzuki of Ford Japan said the idea that the Americans have to sell compact cars to succeed in Japan ''is a trap'' because ''in this area, the Japanese manufacturers are the strongest.'' American manufacturers, he said, should sell other types of vehicles for which they can offer something unique."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/31/world/croatian-general-plans-to-surrender-to-hague-tribunal.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1996-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1036, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Croatian General Plans to Surrender To Hague Tribunal", "print_headline": "Croatian General Plans to Surrender To Hague Tribunal", "body_text": " **********The Croatian Government announced today that a Bosnian Croat general charged  with involvement in the killing of hundreds of Muslim civilians would turn himself in to international prosecutors on Monday.

Tihomir Blaskic, is the only Bosnian Croat officer under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The extradition of such a high-level suspect could signal a new willingness by Croatia to cooperate with the tribunal. **********The timing for his surrender was announced after meetings today between Croatian leaders and Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who had warned that international financial and military aid to Croatia was threatened by the reluctance of its Government to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal. **********The Croatian Government, which had been promising for weeks that General Blaskic would be turned over to the prosecutors, insisted that he was not being  sent against his will. \"He has volunteered himself to go to the Hague tribunal,\" the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, said after meeting with Mr. Perry. **********But American officials said that General Blaskic was actually under house arrest in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and that he was being ordered to surrender, apparently in response to pressure on the Croatian Government by the  United States and other countries. **********\"He's being pushed onto that plane,\" said an American official here. **********The general was indicted by the tribunal in November for crimes against humanity for killings during vicious fighting between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian  Muslim forces in 1993 and 1994. He is accused of commanding troops that rampaged through at least 14 towns in the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia, near Vitez, killing hundreds of Muslims and torching their houses. **********The Croatian move will almost certainly step up the pressure on the Serbs and the Bosnian Muslims to cooperate with the tribunal, which has so far arrested only 5 of the 57 people it has indicted for war crimes committed in the Balkan civil war. **********Seven Bosnian Croat civilians, most of them believed to be living in Croatia, are among those indicted by the tribunal. **********The Croatian Government insists that it wants to cooperate with the tribunal  but that it cannot act against the suspects until its Parliament approves a new  law allowing for the extraditions. General Blaskic was presented as an exception because he had supposedly volunteered to give himself up. **********In meetings this month in Geneva with Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  Mr. Tudjman tentatively agreed to the transfer of General Blaskic to The Hague. **********But the agreement appeared to unravel last week, with the general insisting that he would give himself up only if prosecutors agreed to place him under house arrest in The Hague -- instead of in a jail cell -- and allowed him complete freedom of contact with his family and lawyers. **********At the Geneva meeting, the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, promised to hand over two Bosnian Serbs -- Drazen Erdemovic and Radoslav Kremenovic -- who are wanted for questioning in the killing of some 1,200 Muslims in Srebrenica. **********The two men were handed over to the tribunal in The Hague today but have yet  to be indicted by the war crimes tribunal, which allowed Mr. Milosevic to claim  in Geneva that he was not establishing a precedent of handing over indicted Serbs. They may be indicted after questioning. **********Mr. Erdemovic and Mr. Kremenovic are former troopers in the Bosnian Serb army who told the French newspaper Le Figaro that they took part in the reported killings of civilians at Srebrenica in July 1995. **********In discussing why General Blaskic had agreed to face his accusers, President  Tudjman said, \"There has been some slight confusion because his attorney has tried to delay things.\" **********The Croatian leader insisted that whatever legal ruckus involving General Blaskic took place last week, \"the Republic of Croatia remains committed to full cooperation with the Hague tribunal.\" **********Whatever his public assurances, Mr. Tudjman and his deputies had until today  seemed no more enthusiastic about working with the war crimes tribunal than their counterparts in Serbia and leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have. **********Several of the suspects indicted by the tribunal -- most notably the Bosnian  Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic -- are considered freedom-fighting heroes by their followers. Of the 57 people indicted so far, 46 are Serbs. Similarly, many Croats consider General Blaskic a hero in the cause of Croatian  nationalism. **********But outside pressure, especially economic and military pressure from the United States, may be forcing the Serbs and the Croats to cooperate with the tribunal after months of waffling. **********Mr. Perry told reporters today that the Croats \"must turn over indicted war criminals\" and that without full cooperation with the tribunal, they risked the  loss of American financial and military assistance, as well as American support  for Croatia's application to a NATO's program intended to be the first step toward full NATO membership. **********Mr. Perry's trip to the Balkans -- first to Croatia and then to Bosnia -- is  aimed largely at bolstering the fragile Bosnian Federation that anchors the Dayton peace agreement. Meeting with reporters aboard his Air Force plane, the Defense Secretary dismissed suggestions that the federation was collapsing. **********\"It is not unraveling,\" he said. \"But it is not working as well as we would like either, and we would like both the Bosnian Government and the Croatian Government to put maximum efforts and maximum pressure behind making this federation work.\" **********Mr. Perry said he would warn officials on all sides that the American-led NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina would move to shut down illegal checkpoints that have appeared with worrying frequency in recent weeks.  Many have been set up by Croatian or Muslim militias to extort money from refugees. **********The peacekeepers \"will fan out all over the country, and any place they come  across a checkpoint, they are going to knock it out, and they are not going to be polite about the way they knock it out,\" he said.

But the conflict, which had its roots in a 1954 coup sponsored by the United States Central Intelligence Agency, has been going on for so long that most of Guatemala's 10.5 million people can no longer remember what started it, even though they have had to live with the consequences their whole lives. $(Page A16.$) **********In the accord signed today, the fifth to emerge from the talks, the military agreed to reduce its 46,000 troops by one third next year and cut its budget by one third by 1999. The armed forces consented to a revised mandate that removes them from responsibility for security matters inside Guatemala, returning them to the traditional role of defending the nation's borders from outside threats. **********Several difficult points remain to be negotiated. The sides must still agree on how the rebels, who have been in hiding or exile, will be reincorporated into civilian life in Guatemala. The armed forces want a general amnesty for past crimes, but the rebels reiterated today that they will not accept an amnesty. **********Still, the sense of a breakthrough was powerful in the crowded chambers of the Mexican Foreign Ministry, where the ceremony took place. After the signing the head of the Government delegation, Gustavo Porras Castejon, broke out in smiles and fell into an affectionate bearhug with a top rebel commander, Rolando Moran. **********Even Gen. Otto Perez Molina, the highest-ranking military officer in the Government delegation, went beyond a handshake to accept an enthusiastic embrace from a veteran guerrilla commander, Rodrigo Asturias, his enemy in jungle combat for decades. **********The accord came after President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen carried out a bold anti-corruption purge in the military on Wednesday, dismissing two generals from their posts, including the Deputy Defense Minister. In all, nine senior officers were dismissed as part of an investigation into a big smuggling and theft ring that operated from within the army. **********The 1954 coup sponsored by the C.I.A., which was acting ostensibly to protect the interests of American corporations, overthrew an elected leftist Government and brought the military to power. **********In 1961 the first guerrilla organizations, radicalized by Marxist ideology, began to fight the army. The rebels' clandestine war was nurtured in the mountain villages of the majority Indian population and among other grass-roots groups who suffered in a country where the racial and class divisions are extreme. **********At the height of the war in the early 1980's, the army sponsored death squads to kill opposition political figures and army units carried out massacres in Indian hamlets where the guerrillas were known to operate. The guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union never showed much military might but endured because of widespread sympathy for their anti-military cause. **********Although Guatemala returned to civilian government in 1985, Mr. Arzu is the first civilian President to enjoy enough popular backing to move aggressively to curb the abuses of the military. Mr. Arzu, who took over early this year, recognized that most Guatemalans were fed up with the lack of peace and immediately stepped up the pace of the negotiations. **********Although no cease-fire has been signed, there have been no hostilities in Guatemala for the last five months. But the possibility of violence remains real. Last October, 11 Indian refugees who had just been returned to their home villages in the highlands by the United Nations were gunned down by army soldiers who suspected they were guerrilla sympathizers. **********The military agreement is the fifth major pact to emerge from the talks since the United Nations stepped in as mediator in January 1994. The other agreements dealt with human rights, Indian rights, poverty and land tenure, and set up a commission to review some of the crimes committed during the war. **********Taken together, the five agreements broadly rewrite the rules of politics in Guatemala and set down principles that could provide a new basis for the dispossessed to defend their rights without risking persecution or death. **********''We are coming close to peace and we are optimistic,'' Commander Moran of the guerrillas said today.  Only the human rights clauses of the agreements have gone into effect. **********The military agreement calls for the creation of a new police force to take over the army's domestic security functions. The Government agreed to clean up and retrain the current police force and expand it with new recruits. Under the pact, the redeployment of the army to defend Guatemala's borders will take place in 1997. **********General Perez Molina said he was confident there was broad support in the armed forces for the changes. **********''All of our forces are aware that an end to the conflict is coming, and we must reduce the number of our troops,'' he said. ''In the new conditions of life in Guatemala, those resources must be used for other priorities.'' **********The accord abolishes several notorious army-affiliated units, including the civilian anti-guerrilla patrols that had become a lawless force, blamed by human rights groups for many violations in recent years, and the mobile military police, who were rented out for profit by local commanders to private farms and businesses. **********The presidential general staff, whose main purpose was to watch and control the President, will also be abolished. For the first time most political intelligence-gathering will be taken out of the hands of the military and brought under the control of the President through the Interior Ministry. **********The purge on Wednesday follows an investigation into the smuggling and car-theft operations of a former military intelligence officer, Alfredo Moreno Molina, who was arrested last weekend. Eight police and customs officials were also detained for investigation, a military spokesman said. The military officers are confined to quarters in the main barracks in Guatemala City. **********The spokesman, Col. Edgar Palacios, said the investigation would be handled by civilian prosecutors ''so there will be no problem of impunity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/international-briefs-mexico-trade-surplus.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Mexico Trade Surplus", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Mexico Trade Surplus", "body_text": " **********Mexico racked up a $7.4 billion trade surplus in 1995 compared with a deficit of more than twice that size in 1994, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.

Jack Lamberton, a drug industry analyst with NatWest Securities, projected that Prozac sales would pick up again in the second half, for an 11.4 percent gain this year.

Rubin in announcing the program. He did not give details of the new issue, which will be debated during a 30-day public comment period before the bonds are actually offered. **********Mr. Rubin said the Treasury was considering issuing the new bonds for terms of 10 and 30 years at minimum prices of $1,000 to attract small investors. As an example, he cited a bond that might pay 3 percent annually, which is traditionally what investors expect to earn before inflation. If inflation ran 3 percent, the Treasury would add $30 to the bond's principal at the end of the year, and it would be worth $1,030 **********For the investor to come out ahead compared with fixed-income bonds, inflation has to jump unexpectedly, as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s. **********But Mr. Rubin has not decided which measure of inflation the new bonds would be indexed to \u2014 wage costs, consumer prices, or the deflator that is used in figuring the gross domestic product. **********Dispute rages among economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman who favors indexed bonds, over which measure is best.

The improvement in consumer confidence followed two months of outsized gains in employment and an easing in  the wave of announcements of layoffs by large corporations. **********Other indications of a quickened economic tempo came from a stronger-than-expected report on economic conditions from the purchasing managers of companies in the Chicago area and another, somewhat slower, advance  for an index of purchasers in the New York area. **********Analysts say it has become increasingly clear that the economy has pulled back from what many regarded last winter as the brink of recession. But in the \"good news equals bad news\" environment that often prevails on Wall Street, some economists have begun to worry that faster growth and higher incomes might rekindle inflation. **********\"I think there's grounds for some unease,\" said L. Douglas Lee, economist at  HSBC Washington Analysis, a research company. In contrast to the effects of higher commodity prices, which often dissipate before reaching consumers, \"when  wages creep up, that tends to get into everything,\" Mr. Lee said.

Naroff, chief bank economist for the First Union Corporation, said in a report to clients, \"It appears as if the low unemployment rates coupled with continued good economic growth are putting some additional pressures on wages and salaries.\" He said that benefit costs were unlikely to decline further, so \"inflation could begin to tick up\" if pay keeps accelerating without offsetting  increases in productivity. **********Other analysts, however, found only a minimal threat of inflation in today's  figures on overall compensation, which showed an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent for the January-March period, the same as the average for the two preceding quarters. **********Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said the increases in wages and salaries were \"narrowly based,\" with wages in retailing up a sharp 2.1 percent while other industries, including manufacturing, were \"far more restrained.\" **********Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that labor costs were unlikely to spiral upward. \"I just don't believe this is a harbinger\" of serious inflation pressure, Mr. Kellner said. **********Wayne Shelly, a Labor Department economist who works on the index, said the report found \"some upturn\" in wages from a long-established range as pay in private industry rose 3.3 percent over the latest 12 months compared with 2.8 percent for the 12 months through December and 2.9 percent for the year that ended in March 1995. **********While reluctant to call the latest results a \"trend,\" Mr. Shelly added that neither did they seem to be exceptional. \"There's no reason to think this is an  aberration,\" he said. **********Financial markets reacted calmly to the reports, with both the bond and stock markets off only slightly. **********The 1 percent rise in first-quarter pay for all civilian workers, including those in government and the nonprofit sector, was the biggest since a matching burst in the spring of 1991. It lifted the 12-month increase to 3.2 percent, from 2.9 percent at the end of last year, the report showed. **********Benefit costs, which had jumped 1 percent in the final 1995 quarter, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in the latest period. **********Benefit costs usually rise sharply at the start of a year but \"insurance companies just didn't raise premiums this year,\" Mr. Shelly said. Besides health coverage, other benefit costs to employers include bonuses, holiday and vacation time, shift differential and overtime pay, and premiums for life and unemployment insurance and for workers' compensation. **********For the 12 months through March, total compensation for white-collar workers  rose 3.4 percent compared with 2.2 percent for those in blue-collar and service  occupations. The larger increases for white-collar workers continued a trend that has prevailed for most of the last 15 years, the department stated. **********In the first quarter of this year, the white-collar rise was 1 percent compared with two-tenths of 1 percent for blue-collar occupations. This reflected twice as large a gain in wages and salaries -- 1.4 percent against seven-tenths of 1 percent -- and a rise of one-tenth of 1 percent in white-collar benefits while blue-collar benefits fell seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********Over the latest 12 months, compensation costs rose 3.1 percent for nonunion workers and 2.7 percent for union members, a pattern that held for goods-producing industries but not in services, where unionization made almost no difference. **********As for consumer confidence, the Conference Board's index leaped to 105.3 in April, compared with 98.4 in March. The component that reflects attitudes toward the present situation advanced to 118.2 from 110 while the expectations component rose to 96.7 from 90.7. **********\"This month's improvement in consumer sentiment is largely attributable to less apprehension about employment,\" said Edgar R.

Despite their attempts and those of Hong Kong's Governor, Christopher Patten, Britain's Parliament has repeatedly rebuffed pleas to grant citizenship to Hong Kong residents, often in a hailstorm of racial abuse. **********Mr. Major today made clear once again that British citizenship, which many regard as the only real guarantee against Chinese mistreatment of the territory, would not be granted. **********In Britain some Conservative back-benchers reacted with dismay to Mr. Major's announcement, and a few warned of dire consequences, saying that thousands could enter the country and stay on illegally, especially if there were a crackdown in Hong Kong once China took control. **********Mr. Major's visit, the first in four years, comes even as China's plans for the region are moving swiftly ahead, largely with indifference toward either Britain's views or those of many elected officials. **********Already, China has promised to replace Hong Kong's legislature, which was elected only last September, with lawmakers more amenable to its wishes. China has rebuffed efforts to link the territory's highest court more closely to the appellate court systems of Commonwealth countries. And China is sifting through  names in search of a first chief executive of Hong Kong under Chinese rule. **********All these moves are regarded by some here with a mixture of resignation and trepidation and by others as redress for historical wrongs and a reassertion of  Chinese dignity. **********But more than half of Hong Kong's 6.2 million people are refugees from China  -- many of whom fled the worst atrocities of Communist rule -- and they have little confidence in the future. Indeed, the latest polls confirm that, as the 1997 takeover draws closer, a majority of residents continue to oppose Chinese rule. **********Against this tapestry of doubts and concerns, Mr. Major delivered his small package of incentives intended, he declared, \"to provide reassurance to you, the people of Hong Kong, about Britain's active interest in your future.\" **********\"Hong Kong,\" he said, \"will never have to walk alone.\" **********For the first time, he warned China that Britain would aggressively confront  violations of the Joint Declaration, the treaty that sets forth the terms of China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong. \"If there were any suggestion  of a breach of the Joint Declaration, we would have a duty to pursue every legal and other avenue available to us,\" said Mr. Major. Later, however, he refused to say whether those avenues included representations before the International Court of Justice or before the United Nations, where the treaty is registered. **********Mr. Major did say that ethnic minorities in Hong Kong -- about 7,000 or so people mainly of Indian and Pakistani origin -- would be eligible for full British citizenship if they \"came under pressure to leave Hong Kong\" by the Chinese Government. China has insisted that only ethnic Chinese are eligible for citizenship in Hong Kong. The Prime Minister also extended citizenship to some 27 widows of soldiers killed in World War II. **********Mr. Major said that last week he had discussed with Prime Minister Li Peng China's intention of abolishing the current Hong Kong Legislative Council. **********\"We reached no agreement,\" Mr. Major said of the discussion, which took place in Bangkok. \"We did not agree to disagree. We just disagreed.\" **********He maintains that the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law -- a somewhat ambiguous document that will serve as a mini-constitution for Hong Kong -- support his contentions that the elected legislators should be allowed to serve  their four-year terms. **********\"This is what Hong Kong people wish to see. That is what the world would wish to see.\" **********Reaction to Mr. Major's announcements was mixed. **********While the Chinese did not respond directly today to Mr. Major's comments, the Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, said in remarks to regional leaders gathered in Beijing that the Chinese Government is confident of a smooth transition of power in Hong Kong. In Britain, Charles Wardle, a former Immigration Minister who resigned from the  Government last year in a dispute over immigration policy, told the Press Association that anyone who denied a risk was \"talking through his hat.\" **********He said: \"This is an unstable part of the world. Some of the people who will  make their way here as visitors and will stay over illegally will include people originally from South China.\" **********A Tory Member of Parliament, Nicholas Budgen, said an influx of illegal immigrants would trigger a backlash. **********\"Good race relations depend upon strict controls on immigration,\" he said. \"Letting people into this country without any need for a visa is an open invitation for them to stay.\" **********Another Tory back-bencher, Sir Teddy Taylor, declared that the Prime Minister's decision was fair but then added, \"There would be a bit of a nightmare if things go wrong in Hong Kong after the takeover, because anyone arriving in Britain could apply for asylum and this could create mighty problems.\" **********Recently Britain, along with other European countries, has tightened its asylum laws, making it more difficult for people to claim asylum and even cutting off benefits while their cases are being decided. **********To try to calm the fears of Conservatives, Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  said it was \"totally unwarranted\" to envision Hong Kong residents coming to Britian and refusing to return. **********\"There are dozens of countries around the world which have visa-free access to the United Kingdom, just as we have visa-free access to many other countries,\" he noted. \"If there is abuse, and some attempt to outstay a welcome, from whichever part of the world a person comes, then we are able to take steps  to deal with that.\" **********Here, Martin Lee, the head of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong and a vocal critic of Beijing, hailed the visa decision but said that it was insufficient. **********\"It still remains the case that Mr. Major has made no progress whatsoever on  the two things of greatest concern to Hong Kong people and indeed the entire world community, the continuation of democratic institutions and human rights in Hong Kong.\" **********\"I am afraid that from Hong Kong's perspective, after 1997 it may be very much too late,\" he said. **********Another legislator, Emily Lau, was more blunt. \"The main worry of the Hong Kong people is whether we can continue with the same way of life and the same rule of law,\" she said. \"On these he has failed to deliver.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/01/business/international-business-deere-to-open-plant-in-mexico.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Deere to Open Plant in Mexico", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Deere to Open Plant in Mexico", "body_text": " **********Reflecting the continuing impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement on corporate investment, Deere & Company said today that it would build a new diesel engine factory for $100 million in Torreon, Mexico. **********Deere, the farm and construction equipment maker based in Moline, Ill., said  the factory would be the largest the company has built since the late 1970's, when it expanded in Waterloo, Iowa.

France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom average 180 connections per employee, while at Societa Finanziaria Telefonica, the holding company for Telecom Italia, staffing is better balanced, at 300 lines per employee. **********Deutsche Telekom says that with operations in cable television and other activities, it has employees who handle more than telephone service. But the German company and many of its counterparts across Europe have begun to cut staff to try to become more efficient. **********Deutsche Telekom is aiming for a work force of 170,000 by the end of the century, down from 230,000 now. It set aside 1.8 billion DM in severance costs this year alone, but the staff will still be too large, in the view of some analysts. **********\"At the moment, it looks like Deutsche Telekom has very strong cost controls in place, and they appear to be on the right track,\" Martin Stuerner, a fund manager with PEH Wertpapier, told Bloomberg Business News. \"But one has to see what the strategy is going to look like in a free telecommunications market.\" **********The company also is looking for efficiency in other ways. It is, for example, speeding the digitalization of its entire fixed-line network, an investment that increases services offered while lowering the number of employees needed to monitor the entire system. **********At France Telecom, union pressure has prevented deep cuts. **********Because Germany has the biggest market in Europe, estimated at 100 billion DM a year by 2000, more competitors are lining up there than in any other European Union country. **********Big companies such as the engineering and heavy-machinery giant Mannesmann AG, the utility and engineering company VEBA AG and the utilities RWE AG and VIAG AG have teamed up with the likes of AT&T Corp. of the United States and British Telecommunications PLC and Cable & Wireless PLC to challenge Deutsche Telekom. Bracing for competition on international calls, the French and German national companies have teamed up to buy a 20 percent stake in the American company Sprint Corp., forming the Global One international business telecoms joint venture. **********But none of those measures addresses what some analysts regard as the most difficult task of all: changing corporate cultures. **********To varying degrees, Europe's national companies must convert institutional mentalities that are often unaccustomed to service in the quintessential service industry, now that customer response could be a make-or-break advantage. **********In Europe, one London analyst said, \"the French and Germans are least prepared by a long way.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/03/business/american-air-and-its-pilots-reach-accord.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1996-09-03", "snippet": "American Airlines and its pilots' union reach tentative agreement on new contract, ending two years of negotiations during which American executives refused to place any new orders or options for new aircraft; industry analysts expect airline to r...", "word_count": 833, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Air And Its Pilots Reach Accord", "print_headline": "American Air And Its Pilots Reach Accord", "body_text": " **********American Airlines and its pilots' union reached a tentative agreement yesterday on a new contract, ending two years of negotiations that had prevented the airline from growing. **********Though airlines and their unions rarely resolve their differences quickly, American's long-running dispute with its pilots was particularly significant. American executives had signaled that they would let the airline shrink until they reached an agreement with the pilots. As a result, American, for the first time in about 20 years, has no orders or options for new aircraft. **********Industry analysts said that was likely to change with the new agreement, which remains subject to approval by the board of the AMR Corporation, which is the carrier's parent, and the more than 9,000 members of the pilots' union. **********''Historically, American Airlines has occupied a leadership position in the industry,'' said Julius Maldutis, an airline industry analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''But this protracted labor negotiation has inhibited American from following that strategy. With the new agreement, it will be able to resume its traditional position in the industry.'' **********Neither American nor the union would comment on the terms of the agreement. And spokesmen for the airline declined to comment on the likelihood that the airline would place aircraft orders in the near future. But American executives have on several occasions expressed their interest in buying new jets if they reached a beneficial agreement with the union. **********If American does place new orders, it would join many other carriers that have been growing again after several years of sluggish orders. Boeing, for example, announced orders for 68 planes, worth $6.3 billion, yesterday at the Farnborough air show in England. **********The agreement with the pilots was the last of three labor accords American has reached in the last year. Late last year, the airline reached agreements with its mechanics and its flight attendants, though the latter deal came only after a five-day strike in 1993. **********Though details of the deal with the pilots were not released, both sides had already made concessions. In July, American dropped its requirement that the pilots accept a 2 percent wage cut. For its part, the union gave up its demand for a 5 percent raise, retroactive to 1994. **********As part of the agreement, American had also dropped its goal of moving about 20 percent of its pilots into a new, low-cost operation where they would have earned less than their counterparts at American's main operation. Several competitors of American, including United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have formed or plan to form low-cost subsidiaries in an effort to cut costs. **********American had also offered to end  marketing agreements with Reno Air and Midway Airlines that had enabled those airlines to offer American's frequent-flier program. The pilots contended that those deals had been costing American business. **********Several factors appeared to be pressuring each side. The pilots' union, for example, found American to be unwavering in its commitment not to increase its fleet until a deal was reached. **********And though American executives have for years talked about the need to improve the airline's competitive position through lower labor costs, that argument has carried less force recently as American and most other United States airlines -- through tight capacity and strong demand, which have allowed them to raise fares -- have improved their profitability. Many analysts, in fact, expect the industry to report record profit margins this year. **********American, which is based in Fort Worth, is also seeking Government approval for its plan to form a marketing alliance with British Airways. **********''In my opinion, it is a very fair contract that provides the pilots with job security, pension security and compensation he and she needs in exchange for the productivity enhancements the company needs to compete,'' said Jim Sovich, president of the pilots' union. **********The resolution of the dispute will  probably be viewed as another success for Donald J. Carty, the veteran planning and finance executive at American who was given the title of president last year. **********''With this matter behind us,'' Mr. Carty said in a statement, ''we can now focus our full attention on providing the outstanding service our customers expect.'' **********About two weeks ago, Mr. Carty became personally involved in the talks, giving them some apparent momentum. Last year, Mr. Carty also helped resolve some lingering differences with flight attendants after their strike. When he took over as president from Robert L. Crandall, who remains chairman and chief executive, Mr. Carty was expected to offer a more conciliatory front in labor talks than Mr. Crandall, who has on occasion publicly berated the pilots. **********''This is a big feather in his cap,'' Mr. Maldutis said of Mr. Carty's role in helping reach the agreement with the pilots."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/world/french-bishop-supports-some-use-of-condoms-to-prevent-aids.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Bishop Supports Some Use of Condoms to Prevent AIDS", "print_headline": "French Bishop Supports Some Use of Condoms to Prevent AIDS", "body_text": " **********The chairman of a French Roman Catholic bishops' committee suggested in a report published today that the use of condoms could be justified in some cases  to prevent the spread of AIDS, contradicting the Vatican's general condemnation  of most methods of birth control. **********\"Many competent doctors maintain that a condom of reliable quality is today the only means of prevention,\" wrote the chairman, Bishop Albert Rouet of Poitiers, in his discussion of the report on AIDS by the Social Committee of the French episcopate, the highest authority of the church in France on social issues. \"As such, it is necessary.\" **********But the bishop was careful to limit the possible moral justification for using physical contraceptives. **********He added: \"It is appropriate to make distinctions among users, those whose sexual activity is sufficiently enlightened and requires taking precautions against risks; authorities who simply do not know what else to propose, and propagandists of a libertarianism that reduces sexuality to insignificance.\" **********In his discussion, appended to the committee's report and intended, it says,  for all Roman Catholics, the bishop also warned of the importance of balancing \"the avoidance of serious risk\" of AIDS by using a condom with the church's view that \"it is not a proper means of education into adult sexuality.\" **********Though the 235 pages of Bishop Rouet's discussion and the committee's report, called \"AIDS: Society in Question,\" broadly conformed to the church's emphasis on abstinence and its condemnation of most birth control, several experts in France and abroad found the bishop's assertion that condom use could ever be justified as an important break with the official Roman Catholic position. **********An administrative board of American Roman Catholic bishops approved the mention of condoms in AIDS education programs in 1987, but John Cardinal O'Connor of New York later called the statement \"a grave mistake,\" and a later statement by the full conference of American bishops dropped the reference. **********\"The document of the social committee of the episcopate agrees with what numerous doctors and scientists think -- namely that the condom is a mechanical  means of preventing infection, but not the only one,\" said Prof. Luc Montagnier  of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. \"As such, this is an important change.\" **********Thomas C.

But Guatemalan prosecutors scrutinizing the papers are now wondering whether all the prodding and the protest was worth the effort. **********Guatemalan officials had expected  that the documents, which cover the period January 1984 to March 1995, would shed light on a dozen notorious cases in which American citizens were killed, tortured or raped. They also hoped that the papers might reveal useful information about the longstanding links between the Central Intelligence Agency and the Guatemalan Armed Forces, which have been accused of committing most of the crimes against the Americans. **********''But the truth is that not one of these documents has any value at all in a judicial proceeding, not as proof, not as investigative leads,'' Julio Arango Escobar, head of the special prosecution team the Guatemalan Government has appointed to examine the papers, said in an interview here. ''What we have seen is nothing that has not been disclosed publicly already. **********''These are not declassified documents,'' he added, waving a sheaf of papers in which many names are blacked out and some long sections of text have been excised. ''They are censored documents.'' **********John D. Roney, a spokesman for the American Embassy here, said: ''We've released what we could. But even with the documents that were made public, there are still portions which for privacy and national security reasons were withheld.'' **********In the past, the Guatemalan Government has dragged its feet in investigating controversial cases that received much publicity in the United States, like the deaths of Michael DeVine, an American innkeeper, and Efrain Bamaca, a guerrilla leader married to an American lawyer. But President Alvaro Arzu, who took office in January, replaced the country's Chief Prosecutor this spring and is facing mounting public pressure here for an accounting of human rights abuses by the military during the country's 35-year civil war, in which more than 100,000 people have died. **********Thus far, nine boxes of State Department documents have been shipped here, totaling an estimated 20,000 pages. Mr. Arango and his unit have examined only one box, which deals with the case of Dianna Ortiz, an American Ursuline nun who says Guatemalan Army personnel kidnapped, tortured and raped her in November 1989, freeing her only after an American agent named ''Alejandro'' intervened. **********Because 503 documents Washington deemed ''restricted'' are not available, it has been hard for Mr. Arango to gauge how much the United States knows about the cases. But the papers made public indicate that Thomas F. Stroock, a Wyoming businessman who was the Bush Administration's envoy here, viewed local human rights organizations as left-wing fronts, initially doubted the nun's account, and then mounted a wide-ranging public relations effort to distance American officials from the incident. **********''You can clearly see the concern of the American Embassy regarding the management of the Ortiz case,'' said Vicente Cano Ponce, another member of the special investigative team. ''That seems to be their principal consideration.'' **********The documents were first made public in May, after Sister Ortiz had staged a hunger strike and met with  Hillary Clinton, the First Lady. At the time, the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, called the release ''a demonstration of the strong commitment of President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher to clear up these cases and the participation, if there was any, of the United States.'' **********Copies of the 5,847 documents, many of which are newspaper clippings or letters from members of Congress, were made available to the Guatemalan Embassy, which arranged for them to be flown here in three shipments that ended last month. The arrival of the first consignment was full of drama, with an armored car, escorted by motorcycle policemen and television cameramen jostling for position, taking the papers from the airport to the office of the Attorney General. **********Shortly afterward, someone broke into Mr. Arango's unguarded office at night and rifled through some of the documents and other papers. On another occasion, the investigators returned to their office after a long weekend to discover that their computers had been tampered with. **********''There are a lot of people with guns who thought their names were going to turn up in the documents,'' said Mr. Arango, who previously worked on the Bamaca case. ''Those fears have diminished as the press has made known how little we really have to work with.'' **********Prensa Libre, Guatemala's largest newspaper, complained in a recent editorial that on this occasion, as in the past, ''all that became known was what the C.I.A. wanted.'' **********In fact, said Helen Mack, a Guatemalan human rights campaigner  whose sister Myrna, a prominent anthropologist here, was killed by the military, Washington continues to cover up its knowledge of abuses here by exempting both the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense from public disclosure. **********''Those are the documents that really matter, because they are the ones that have the comments of Guatemalan military sources,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/15/world/building-boom-in-egypt-produces-some-collapsible-houses.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1996-12-15", "snippet": "Egyptian Government is razing new Government-sponsored housing complex, Qatamiya, because of substandard construction; evacuates residents from another shoddy Government-sponsored project, Nasr City; probes at least 50 top officials; Cairo's housi...", "word_count": 566, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Building Boom in Egypt Produces Some Collapsible Houses", "print_headline": "Building Boom in Egypt Produces Some Collapsible Houses", "body_text": " **********For five years, Atef Sadiq, a security guard, watched proudly as the concrete blocks sprang from the sands, shelters-to-be for Egyptian homebuyers ready to settle on the desert's edge.

All 129 identical  buildings in the section have now  been condemned. **********By early next year this Government-sponsored project, in a poor suburb an hour south of Cairo, was to have housed more than 2,500 families. As many as one in six apartments sits vacant in Egypt, experts say, while the country is groaning with overpopulation. **********Among the reasons for Cairo's housing shortage are socialist-era laws that fix rents at absurdly low levels, allowing longtime tenants to live in sprawling apartments for as little as $10 a month. **********Because the return is so low, many landlords leave their property vacant in the hope that it will one day command a fair market price. **********Investors have embarked on a dash to build new housing for buyers rather than renters, adding to existing buildings a crazy-quilt of irregular construction to which officials have often turned blind eye. **********For good reason, many average people regard with great suspicion the projects built by private entrepreneurs.

In the last 25 years, the Government boasts, this enterprise and others have built a quarter-million new apartments for Egyptians. But in the uproar that has followed the disclosures about the housing complexes,  Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri has ordered public prosecutors to investigate what could have gone wrong, and at least 50 top officials are under investigation. **********The preliminary findings, as presented in the country's semiofficial newspapers, indicated that in Qatamiya a technical examination found  that foundations had been laid not in concrete but in soil mixed with sand. In places where concrete was used, it was so shoddy as to be unstable; in Nasr City, the steel meant to keep the buildings standing was dangerously brittle. **********To repair the flaws of each building in Qatamiya, the report concluded, would cost twice the $100,000 the Government has spent to build them.

And it plans to inject $487 million more before it spins off NCR to its shareholders at the end of the year, according to the document. **********That is roughly $1 billion more than most analysts estimated. The reason for the disparity is that AT&T has not reported NCR's operating cash flow in its quarterly earnings. NCR's operating losses, which were reported, and a $1.6 billion NCR-related charge that AT&T took in the third quarter of 1995 both understated the total drain on AT&T. **********The disclosure, which AT&T made in connection with its spinoff of NCR, capped a week of grim news for the company, the nation's largest long-distance carrier. On Tuesday, AT&T warned analysts that its profits would fail to meet expectations by as much as 10 percent for the rest of the year, because of high costs and erosion in its residential phone business. **********That announcement drove AT&T's shares down $5.625, or 9 percent, in a single trading session. Yesterday, the company's shares rose 37.5 cents, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange. But the company's Government filing was released after the market closed. **********Still, some analysts welcomed AT&T's filing -- even with its larger-than-expected losses -- because it indicated that the company was on track with its plan to abandon the computer business by next year. **********''They're closing a door on that chapter of AT&T's history,'' said Simon Flannery, an analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company. ''NCR has been such a millstone around their necks. Now they can just forget it.'' **********Indeed, AT&T's filing also indicates that NCR's operations have begun to turn around under its new chairman and chief executive, Lars Nyberg. In the first half of 1996, the company's net loss narrowed to $83 million from $389 million in the comparable period last year. NCR's revenues declined to $3.27 billion from $3.86 billion in same period. Previously, AT&T had reported only NCR's operating earnings. **********Still, the filing provides stark evidence of how NCR began hemorrhaging money two years after AT&T acquired it for $7.48 billion in 1991. In 1993, AT&T poured $425 million into NCR; by 1995, the infusion had ballooned to $1.03 billion. NCR, which is based in Dayton, Ohio, had operating losses of $720 million in that year. **********AT&T plans to inject an additional $419 million of cash into the company in the next two months, according to the filing. And it will contribute $68 million more to retire NCR's debt. Eileen M. Connolly, a spokeswoman for AT&T, said yesterday that both measures were intended to shore up NCR's balance sheet in advance of the spinoff. **********Because NCR shares are being distributed to AT&T's shareholders, Ms. Connolly said AT&T would treat the $487 million total as a capital expenditure, and would not take a further charge against its earnings. **********As a stand-alone company, Mr. Flannery estimated, NCR would have a market value of about $4 billion. Given that AT&T spent $7.4 billion to acquire NCR and an additional $3.3 billion to prop it up, AT&T's total loss on its investment would be roughly $6.8 billion. **********The filing also disclosed that NCR did not plan to pay a dividend on its stock ''in the foreseeable future'' -- a policy that is not uncommon for newly issued securities. **********After the steady drumbeat of bad news, AT&T is hoping for better tidings next week. On Monday, the company will complete a spinoff of Lucent Technologies, its equipment-manufacturing arm. The company sold 17.4 percent of Lucent in an initial public offering in April. And within the next two weeks, AT&T expects to complete the sale of the AT&T Capital Corporation to a management-led consortium for $1.8 billion. **********All of these financial acrobatics are part of AT&T's plan to split itself into three publicly traded companies, which was announced last September. Robert E. Allen, the chairman of AT&T, said earlier this week that the company was on track with the so-called trivestiture. **********But AT&T's core long-distance business has been eroded by discount long-distance carriers and established rivals like MCI and Sprint. And the company's costs are mushrooming as it expands into new businesses, including Internet access, video distribution and wireless. **********Several analysts downgraded their recommendations on AT&T's stock yesterday, joining a flood of others who have lost faith in the stock during the last three days. Despite growing questions about AT&T's leadership, Mr. Allen said in an interview on Tuesday that he had the full support of AT&T's board and had no plans to step down."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/business/sometimes-passing-up-tax-breaks-is-the-best-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1996-10-27", "snippet": "Advice on complex new tax rules for withdrawing funds from retirement accounts; new law will suspend for three years penalty for withdrawing too much money in any one year from pension plans and end in 2000 averaging over five years of large lump-...", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sometimes, Passing Up Tax Breaks Is the Best Strategy", "print_headline": "Sometimes, Passing Up Tax Breaks Is the Best Strategy", "body_text": " **********IMAGINE that a prized tax benefit will disappear in three years. And imagine that a costly tax penalty is being suspended for three years. Should financial consultants brace for a host of clients trying to exploit this window of opportunity? **********Well, a new Federal law makes such revisions in certain rules for retirement accounts, and Mark Niziak, a lawyer for NYL Benefit Services in Norwood, Mass., thinks he knows how his clients will react. ''We haven't seen much yet,'' he said, ''but I believe we will.'' **********These new rules -- part of the minimum-wage bill signed by President Clinton in late summer -- are more complex than they seem. At first blush, it seems clear that people should exploit this three-year window, specifically by withdrawing money from their retirement accounts. But, in fact, the wisdom of doing so depends on a worker's age, income, portfolio size and other factors. **********Under one provision, a tax break that has been available since 1986 will end in 2000. Retirees will no longer be able to average over five years a large lump-sum retirement distribution and thus avoid a high tax bill for any single year. In dropping this break, Congress decided that the rules governing the rollover of pensions, individual retirement accounts and other retirement money had been loosened enough to enable investors to avoid heavy taxes without it. **********Some investors will still be able to average their distributions over several years. But to do so they must have reached age 50 before Jan. 1, 1986, and they must use the income-averaging calculations and the fairly high 1986 tax rate. For some of these people, this option may not be worth it. **********Starting Jan. 1, the new law will also suspend for three years the 15 percent tax penalty for withdrawing too much money in any one year from pensions, 401(k) plans, I.R.A.'s and other tax-favored retirement accounts. **********The maximum annual withdrawal, adjusted each year for inflation, is currently $155,000, or $775,000 in the case of a lump-sum distribution. These may seem like amounts that affect only corporate big hitters, but with the long-rising stock market, that is not the case. The temporary repeal, in fact, was an attempt by Congress to protect the little guy. **********''The 15 percent tax was hitting a lot of people who weren't wealthy, but who were working for well-off companies that have large stock-purchase plans,'' said one Congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Why penalize a guy who's making $30,000 to $40,000 a year when you're talking about his nest egg?'' **********At first glance, both these legal changes ''basically work out to a Government-provided, early retirement window,'' said Valerie Grace, a retirement consultant at William M. Mercer Inc. ''For the next three years, certain investors will have two strong incentives to retire.'' **********But Ms. Grace and other analysts cautioned that quick withdrawal might not make sense, especially given the tax advantages that investors receive from their retirement accounts. **********''The 15 percent tax burden really pales in comparison to the tax-deferred buildup'' of a retirement account, said James Klein, president of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans in Washington. **********Ethan E. Kra, chief retirement actuary at Mercer, agreed, although he noted that needs might differ for workers who are  relatively close to retirement. ''If you expect to need the money within 10 years, take it out during the three-year window,'' he said. ''If not, it's usually better to leave it in the plan, even with the 15 percent tax.'' **********Another exception, Mr. Kra added, may apply to people in poor health. ''The trick here is to withdraw the money during the lifetime of the employee or the spousal beneficiary,'' he said. ''Otherwise, estate taxes may eat up virtually everything.'' **********SIMILARLY, investors should not rush to embrace five-year income averaging even though that benefit is scheduled to end. Doing so may be especially damaging for people with large accounts. **********''Once you pass $400,000, the loss of the tax deferral outweighs the small benefits you receive from income averaging,'' Mr. Kra said. The tax break may be most valuable, he said, to investors who expect distributions of less than $200,000. **********Other factors may also make postponing withdrawals the wiser course. For example, people who are younger than 59 1/2 and who leave their retirement money alone until they stop working can avoid the 10 percent early distribution tax that they would pay if they withdrew money and stayed on the job. **********And the new law will remove in 2000 the  ''combined plan limit'' now imposed on employers who offer both traditional pensions and defined-contribution plans. According to Mr. Kra, some employees will receive better benefits if they wait for this ceiling to be lifted. These include a fair number of low-income, second-wage earners who, because they are not necessarily the primary source of household income, tend to contribute heavily to retirement plans. **********Not all parts of the new law will spur people to speed up their retirement withdrawals. One provision, for instance, permits workers to wait until they actually retire to begin taking money out of employer retirement plans. Formerly, most investors had to begin withdrawing money from their employer plans at age 70 1/2, regardless of their work status. That rule still holds for I.R.A.'s. **********In looking at the overall changes, Mr. Kra and Ms. Grace cautioned against broad conclusions and advised investors to ask financial planners to analyze their particular circumstances. **********''It's very fact-specific,'' Ms. Grace said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/18/business/company-news-sun-to-buy-some-cray-research-assets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SUN TO BUY SOME CRAY RESEARCH ASSETS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SUN TO BUY SOME CRAY RESEARCH ASSETS", "body_text": " **********Sun Microsystems Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc. said yesterday that they had  agreed to a deal in which Sun will buy Sun-related assets of the supercomputer maker Cray Research Inc., which was recently acquired by Silicon Graphics.

In the townships, a camera is an expensive and sometimes daunting piece of equipment, something to be handled by a professional like Innocent Mahoa. **********Mr. Mahoa, 21, is one of thousands of street photographers who charge roughly 85 cents a photo -- a pittance, to be sure, especially when customers order only one. But the Eastman Kodak Company, returning to South Africa after an absence of nearly eight years when it agreed to observe sanctions against apartheid, is trying to make sure that every nickel-and-dime photo opportunity is another Kodak moment. **********''I am not doing this only to make a profit,'' Mr. Mahoa says. ''I want to prove to my children that photography is important. That it is not for white people only.'' **********This is music to the ears of Kodak, which is vigorously pursuing the black consumer market while it tries to win back the favor of whites, some of whom resent it for leaving in the first place. When Kodak left the country in 1987, it had 60 percent of the film market. When it returned in 1994, it had only 4 percent -- all of it gray-market purchases for professional photographers. **********The Fuji Photo Film Company and, to a lesser extent, Agfa, a unit of the Bayer Group, and Konica had stepped into the gap. And since 1994, despite the company's world-famous name, Kodak's market share has returned to only about 12 percent. **********Part of the reason is that the Fuji distributorship, owned by the Premier Group, a large food, pharmaceutical and retailing conglomerate, has a tight grip on the South African market. It owns or has contracts with 600 of the country's 950 small labs, requiring that they use only Fuji paper and chemicals and stock 80 percent Fuji film, according to surveys by S.A. Photo, an industry magazine. **********And, as Kodak acknowledges, there is lingering animosity among some whites. ''We stock their film because tourists ask for it,'' said the manager of a Foto First lab in the wealthy northern suburbs here. ''But a lot of people here won't buy Kodak because it left the country. Fuji stuck it out during the bad times.'' **********That is a painful lesson many American corporations that left during sanctions have learned. There is little gratitude for having done the right thing: the Mandela Government gives no special breaks to companies that honored sanctions. Whites, who still have most of the disposable income, are loyal to companies that stayed. Blacks, only now getting a piece of the economic pie, don't know the brands that left. **********''A whole generation has never been exposed to Kodak,'' said Brian Schwartz, who owns a new Kodak Express lab in the Woodmead Shopping Center, in a white neighborhood in northeastern Johannesburg. **********Yet some companies that left prospered, finding ways to continue selling their products. Coca-Cola, for instance, moved only to Swaziland, a small independent nation surrounded by South Africa, and distributed through South African Breweries. Pepsico truly left, and its market share plummeted. **********Pepsi is trying to come back, touting itself as ''the drink of liberation,'' buying lots of billboards in the townships and using prominent black Americans like Whitney Houston and Johnnie Cochran as spokesmen. Coke still dominates the market. **********Unlike cola, however, film has until now been a business for white customers. Nearly all the small labs are in white neighborhoods, or in downtown shopping areas patronized by people of all races. During Kodak's absence, Fuji and Agfa did little to expand the customer base. Roughly the same number of rolls -- 10 million -- were sold in this country last year as in 1990. That's about a quarter of a roll a person a year, compared with roughly two rolls a person in the United States. **********To expand, Kodak is franchising its own small labs, like Mr. Schwartz's, that stock only Kodak products. It hopes to have 110 by 1998, but it's slow going. Virtually every mall already has a Fuji-connected lab, and there are very few malls in black areas. **********Kodak is also mailing free test rolls of its newest slide film to professional photographers. It is advertising on television. But the ads, unlike Pepsi's, are nonracial and apolitical -- the same ''Kodak for the Moments of Your Life'' ones used in the United States. **********Its most important strategy, however, said Ron Crane, managing director of Kodak South Africa, is to encourage blacks to shoot pictures. ''Seventy percent of South Africans have never taken their first picture,'' he said. **********In areas where blacks shop, Kodak is selling rudimentary plastic 35-millimeter cameras with batteries and film for about $27. In two places, they are marked: ''Uses Kodak Film,'' a calculated statement since any 35-millimeter film would fit. **********Fuji's reaction to the threat is dismissive. Kodak executives and outside analysts say that Fuji is arrogant, and a conversation with Malcolm Ryan, managing director of Fuji South Africa, seemed to bear that out. **********''Obviously, as a household name, they are going to gain some market share,'' he said. ''But I don't think it will be significant. I believe they'll take it from Agfa, since their 35 percent share is unreal. **********''We're the leader,'' he said. ''It's for them to chase us.'' **********Mr. Ryan also suggested that appealing to black customers was futile. ''We've done a lot of study of that market,'' he said. ''Blacks don't see their own past as a happy memory, so they don't want photos of it. For example, they don't see their kid going to school on the first day as a happy thing, because they have to go to a township school or walk five miles to school.'' **********Asked about that, Innocent M. Ndlovu, Kodak's man in charge of reaching out to street photographers like Mr. Mahoa, sneered. ''What a load of rubbish,'' he said. ''You can see why they've never shown any commitment to the black market.'' **********Calculating that its best point of entry is street photographers like Mr. Mahoa, Kodak is going to great lengths to win them over. A two-month survey by the company found that what they wanted most were lessons in photography and business, and those can be pretty basic. Public education for blacks has been bad for decades, and some street photographers can barely read and write. **********But Kodak has done things in a highly visible way, bringing over living legends like Gordon Parks to teach workshops. **********''I learned from him to change the aperture when the weather changes,'' said Midion Mthimkhulu, who was sitting by a waterfall in a downtown park, hoping for customers to pose beside it. **********Kodak has also had senior officers of local banks explain how to open a checking account. It offers kits to registered freelancers that include not only Kodak camera bags to spread the brand name, but also business cards and invoice books. **********Perhaps most important, the company has developed a special film, ProFoto II, for them. Its emulsion chemistry is adjusted for taking black faces in bright sunlight. (Professional photographers all over Africa complain about the difficulty of getting such high-contrast exposures right.) **********The film is also trimmed long, so that a careful photographer can get 40 shots from a roll of 36. And, in a price-sensitive market, it costs only $2.75 a roll -- compared with about $5 for Kodak Gold and $3.50 to $4.50 for Fuji or Agfa. **********''We obviously try to keep it as far away from the amateur market as we possibly can,'' said Anthony Doyle, Kodak's marketing manager. ''To buy it, they have to show a card saying they're in our freelance program.'' **********Kodak also supports labs catering to street photographers, whose customers typically return in a day or two to look at the picture and pay for it. Thomas Thosa's lab on Bree Street downtown offers inexpensive processing for ProFoto II, plus a lounge, kitchen and lockers. **********''A lot of the photographers live in squatter camps, and the postal service is no good there,'' Mr. Ndlovu explained. ''And they can leave their gear in the box. There are a lot of robberies on the trains to the townships.'' **********Mr. Thosa, a former street photographer, appreciates Kodak's attitude. ''I come from a background where blacks weren't supposed to know anything,'' he said. ''We buy photographs, but we don't think we can take them. **********''Kodak explains how it works, and they say 'You need this thing -- when a child is born, you need a picture.' And besides -- a lot of blacks are moving into the middle class. They can afford to go on holidays to Kruger Park, or to the beach. There are no street photographers there.'' **********Right now, said Mark Young, S.A. Photo's editor, customers say Kodak still seems disorganized. Its expanding sales force has trouble returning phone calls and getting deliveries in on time. ''But I imagine they'll get that sorted out,'' he said. **********Harvey Thomas, the publisher, said he expected Kodak's growth to take time. ''They're fighting for market sectors, and they didn't choose the battleground,'' he said, adding that in 10 years' time, Kodak may be the film of choice. ''But the Americans are going to have to spend a lot of money to get back,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/12/business/market-place-time-of-testing-in-love-affair-with-wall-st.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Eaton", "pub_date": "1996-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;Time of Testing In Love Affair With Wall St.", "print_headline": "Market Place;Time of Testing In Love Affair With Wall St.", "body_text": " **********While the rest of New York enjoyed a beautiful spring day, it was drizzling yesterday on Wall Street, where spirits are being dampened by the nasty suspicion that maybe, just maybe, the stock market will not continue to go up forever. **********Such a suggestion has almost become heresy this year as the market has soared, aided by low interest rates and a flood of money from average Americans, many of them investing for their retirements. These often inexperienced investors have been told that every decline is just a chance to pick up a bargain. And until now, that has been right. **********Most stock prices have been falling since last Thursday. And while blue-chip stocks managed to eke out a gain yesterday -- the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.09 points, to 5,487.07 -- it capped the worst five trading days for the market in two years. For the first time in a long time, the stock market is not  immediately bouncing back from bad days and bad news. **********The immediate culprit is probably worries about inflation; commodity prices are hitting highs, and bond yields are climbing awfully close to 7 percent. \"Until last week confidence was very high that inflation was not a problem, rising interest rates are not a problem, the Fed is not a problem,\" said Michael Metz, the chief strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. \"Now the whole story is gone, and it was the only justification for a market that otherwise looks extremely overvalued.\" **********Which leaves the stock market relying on Russ Roach. **********Mr. Roach is not a market guru; he is a state legislator in Oklahoma who found a great way to increase the size of his campaign war chest -- by investing a big chunk of it in the stock market. In fact, he concentrated his bet on just  one stock and scored big with a gain of more than 60 percent in just 11 months. **********From the floor of the House of Representatives in Oklahoma City, Mr. Roach, a Tulsa Democrat, said he was quite an experienced investor -- he owns about seven stocks and six mutual funds -- and that he did not rely on a hot tip to put his  money in the Williams Companies, a local pipeline concern. It was, he said, \"a very safe investment.\" **********Such serene confidence in the stock market, the almost complete lack of fear, seems to characterize investing in the 90's. It is part of the phenomenon of billions of dollars flooding into stock mutual funds -- as much in the first three months of this year as in all of 1994 -- and Congress seriously proposing  that Social Security money be invested in stocks. **********Indeed, it may be a kind of New Age Ebullience. It used to be that the stock  market madness that signaled trouble was symbolized by guys guzzling champagne and throwing big bills out the windows of Rolls-Royces; today, market mania may  be characterized by retirees-to-be confidently shoveling their cash into stocks, believing that over the long run, whatever that may be, the market will rise. **********So far, the weak market does not seem to have soured average investors, at least those who buy mutual funds. At Charles Schwab & Company, a discount brokerage concern, investors sold slightly more stocks than they bought in the month through April 10 -- $2.18 billion versus $2.22 billion. But they bought more stock mutual funds, for $1.25 billion, than they sold, for $800 million. **********Whether the new love affair of Americans for equities is a good sign or not depends on the point of view of the analysts -- and, probably, their ages. It used to be that when individual investors got interested in the stock market, the professionals pulled back, because they believed ordinary people buy at the  top. **********But today, the huge inflows into stocks via mutual funds are widely considered to be a prime impetus behind the rising market, the idea being that demographic demand for equities pushes up prices. As more Americans have to make their own decisions about investing their pensions, they have been inundated with studies showing that stocks are always the best investments in the long run. **********\"That has been true for the last 15 years, so why not believe it?\" asked Robert J. Farrell, senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch. \"Except that one  day it won't be true, because the market goes from one extreme to another.\" **********Eventually, he said, returns are not going to match the average investor's expectations, and when that happens, the consequences could be severe. \"I'm afraid people are going to be disappointed.\" **********Old market hands like Barton M. Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management, like to point out that no market goes up forever. \"It wasn't so long ago that the conventional wisdom was commercial real estate was the way to get rich,\" he wrote recently, \"and you couldn't go wrong buying your home with a big mortgage since prices only went up.\" **********Over the next few years, he has predicted, stocks will return only 4 percent  a year, far less than the 14 percent they have averaged in the last five years. **********The bull market has been going on at least since 1987 and by most measures since 1982. The value that the stock market puts on America's blue-chip companies, as measured by the Dow industrial index, has doubled since 1991. **********None of this means that the stock market is necessarily going to crumble next week or next month or even next year. It has not paid investors to be cautious,  much less bearish, in a very long time. **********And many seasoned investors, like Lazlo Birinyi, who runs his own research firm in Connecticut, remain bullish. \"Though with a small b,\" he said, adding that he expects the Dow to bounce around between 5,400 and 5,700 this year, which does not leave much room for further gains. Yesterday, the Dow was down 203 points from its high of 5,690 on April 3. According to his figures, the last time the Dow suffered such a steep drop was in March 1994, when the Dow tumbled  almost 243 points in a week. **********But Mr. Metz of Oppenheimer points out that even pension investors are not forced to keep their money in the stock market. \"In the dark age, this money used to go into Guaranteed investment contracts, bond funds and balanced funds,\" he said. **********And it may well do so again if interest rates continue to rise. Right now, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds is 6.93 percent. A 7 percent bond yield is \"neutral territory\" for stocks, but 7.5 percent is \"bearish at this price level,\" said Eric H. Sorensen, the head of global quantitative research for Salomon Brothers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/02/business/outlook-96-economy-middle-age-catches-up-with-megeneration-changing-shape.html": {"writer_name": "Dennis Hevesi", "pub_date": "1996-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: THE ECONOMY: Middle Age Catches Up With the MeGeneration; Changing the Shape Of the Housing Market", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: THE ECONOMY: Middle Age Catches Up With the MeGeneration; Changing the Shape Of the Housing Market", "body_text": " **********After having \"paired and nested,\" many members of the baby boom generation are now in the process of trading up to single-family homes, public policy analysts say. **********\"They are trading up to bigger homes and to communities where they will want  to stay for quite a while,\" said James W.

After a late 1980's slump in the market, housing starts in 1991 fell to a postwar low of 1.01 million units. **********Mr. Carliner estimated there were 1.4 million housing starts in 1995. **********While the boom of the 1970's was largely spurred by the construction of multifamily dwellings, with the Government providing subsidies for such construction, the current turnaround was prompted by the maturation of the baby boomers. **********At least through the rest of this decade, said H. James Brown, director of the Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, \"trade-up households will  dominate the market and housing construction.\" **********Regional economies, of course, will give particular shape to local housing markets. The prevalence of trade-up buyers in the Northeast and California, where economic recovery has been slower, will be more evident than in communities like Denver, Phoenix or Las Vegas, Nev., where new jobs attract younger, first-time buyers. **********Mr. Hughes of Rutgers noted that in 1994, 88 percent of the units constructed in New Jersey were single-family -- up from an average of 61 percent since 1960. \"And that's typical of the suburban ring\" of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, he said.

D. Deve Gowda, heads the government of the southern state of Karnataka. As Chief Minister there, he has promoted foreign investment, particularly in Bangalore, the state capital, which is known as one of India's most economically dynamic cities. Several major American corporations have investments in Bangalore, and their executives have generally spoken positively  of Mr. Deve Gowda. **********The switch to Mr. Deve Gowda, who is in his early 60's, came after the main  left-wing group, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), held a fractious central committee meeting in New Delhi that ended with a decision not to put forward its leader, Jyoti Basu, for Prime Minister, and not to join directly any center-left government. **********The decision was a rebuff to other parties in the alliance known as the National Front-Left Front, which had settled on Mr. Basu as their prime ministerial candidate on Tuesday and announced that they had the Communists' backing for the move. **********Some leading Communists favored accepting the offer, which would have ended nearly 50 years of being excluded from power in New Delhi. But the argument that prevailed was one long advanced by Mr. Basu, the 81-year-old Chief Minister of West Bengal state, who has said joining or leading a government in which Communists would be a small minority would entail too great a compromise of Communist principles. **********\"We felt that with the numbers we have, it would not be possible to effect any fundamental change in government policies,\" said Sitaram Mechury, an aide to Mr. Basu. **********Mr. Deve Gowda went to see India's titular President, Shankar Dayal Sharma, and told him that he was ready to form a government. But the political arithmetic after last week's inconclusive election meant that Mr. Sharma would have to weigh the competing claims of the Deve Gowda group and the Hindu nationalists before deciding which was more likely to form a government that has any chance of lasting. **********Mr. Sharma's decision could come at any time after noon on Wednesday, when the election commission will formally report the election results to the President. **********He will face a choice between the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, with a total of about 195 seats in the 545-seat lower house of Parliament, and the National Front--Left Front, which will have direct control of only about 125 seats, but the likelihood of support on an issue-by-issue basis from two other major groups, the Congress Party and four Communist groups, with a total of 190 seats. **********Mr. Sharma's decision could hinge on his assessment of how reliable the backing of the Congress Party and the Communists would be. **********Few Indians have forgotten the political instability that set in the last time the country was ruled by minority governments with support of other parties. **********In 16 months beginning in December 1989, two center-left Governments collapsed when first the Hindu nationalists, then the Congress Party withdrew support. A new election was needed, and it resulted in the Congress Party's governing for five years until this election. **********India's problem now, once again, is that the fragmentation of the electorate, which routed the Congress Party and divided its support among 20 other groups, appears to leave little prospect of a coherent government. **********While the Hindu nationalists' parliamentary bloc appears fairly solid, with the Bharatiya Janata Party supported by four other groups, other Parliament groups have shunned them. But those other groups, in turn, have been unable to put together a convincing majority, leaving many Indians convinced that another  election may be inevitable within as little as a year. **********The role of the Congress Party in the maneuvering has been widely criticized  among Indians. Although it voted at a weekend meeting to support a center-left government, the departing Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, has not given up  hope of returning to power if the center-left alliance's efforts collapse and other groups turn to the Congress Party to lead a new government. **********Again today, Mr. Rao's spokesman, V. N. Gadgil, issued ambivalent statements  about Mr. Deve Gowda's bid to form a government, saying the Congress Party would decide whether to support the candidate after talks. \"It is a matter of discussion, debate and negotiation,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/business/somber-news-for-women-on-corporate-ladder.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Dobrzynski", "pub_date": "1996-11-06", "snippet": "Analysis of two recent reports showing women are not rising up corporate ladder; one report, a census of women at top of corporate America conducted by Catalyst, nonprofit women's research group, delivers somber news that women hold just about 2 p...", "word_count": 1325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Somber News for Women on Corporate Ladder", "print_headline": "Somber News for Women on Corporate Ladder", "body_text": " **********If only corporate America would make it easier for women to take care of their duties at home, they could at last compete on an equal footing with men in the workplace -- and rise to the top. **********That, at least, was the much heralded theory of the 1980's. A comparison of two recent reports suggests, however, that it is not working out that way in the 1990's. **********One, a census of women at the top of corporate America, delivers the somber news that women hold just about 2 percent of the power positions no matter how they are defined -- by title, by paycheck or by responsibility for the bottom line. Of the nation's 500 largest companies, only 61 can count a woman among their five top earners or can say that a quarter or more of their officers are women. Just 13 of the 61 can do both. **********When a roster of those 61 companies is placed side-by-side with a list of companies that have won plaudits for their enlightened work-and-family policies, there is very little overlap: few companies that did well on the census conducted by Catalyst, a nonprofit women's research group, also shined on Working Mother magazine's list of the ''100 Best Companies for Working Mothers,'' released in September. And vice versa. **********Only a handful of companies -- Avon Products; the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Merck  among them -- proved to be exceptions, showing up on both lists. **********''The lack of association'' between the two lists, said Heidi Hartman, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington, D.C., ''suggests that this could be a problem,'' **********Jean Lipman-Blumen, a professor at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, Calif., and author of ''Gender Roles and Power,'' also finds the contrast worrisome. ''I think it means that the women who are making it are making it in the old-fashioned way, accepting the traditional organizational structure and culture,'' she said. ''And it looks like the organizations that have made it easier for women to work in are substituting that for hard-nosed rewards at the top.'' **********Right now, any conclusions about the significance of the two studies are pure conjecture because they are not comparable in approach, subject or measurement. Catalyst's census covered only companies on Fortune magazine's list of the 500 largest American corporations. Working Mother looked at a wider spectrum of companies -- including some large law firms and advertising agencies, for example -- when it rated pay rates, advancement opportunities, access to child care, flexibility in work schedules and other family-friendly benefits such as paid maternity and paternity leave. **********Without research specifically studying the relationship between women's advancement and workplace policies, it is hard to say exactly what is happening in corporate America. But several experts said these two studies, while admittedly apples and oranges, did suggest a few hypotheses. **********Women may simply be climbing the corporate ladder fastest in industries traditionally friendly to women, like cosmetics and retailing, and work-and-family policies may not be much of a factor at all in their advancement. On the other hand, Catalyst's list of companies where women are making good strides is diversified, ranging from Pitney Bowes to Corestates Financial Corporation. **********It might be, instead, that some companies are putting one foot before the other. ''These are different dimensions of women's advancement, and you need both,'' Ms. Hartman said. ''The fact that some companies excel at one and not the other may mean they just got through one culture change first, that the Polaroids and the Xeroxes and the I.B.M.'s may have to develop family-friendly policies to get women up the pipeline, to keep them before they can promote them.'' If so, women may grow impatient, but they can have hope. **********The divergence in lists might also spring from the difference between rhetoric and reality. ''Some companies with a good reputation for policies on paper are not so good in practice,'' said Robin Ely, an associate professor at Columbia University who specializes in gender and race relations. ''It can be perceived as a negative if you take advantage of these policies.'' At such companies, having family-friendly policies on the books would not matter one way or the other. **********The most extreme theory is, in Ms. Hartman's words, the ''paranoid'' one. ''It may mean what we always thought it meant,'' she said, ''that family-friendly policies are a way to keep women in their place and not let them rise too far, that the policies that allow for advancement may also limit advancement.'' **********Without further study, it is difficult to say which thesis is right. What is true at one company may not describe the situation at others. At any corporation, too, a combination of factors might be at work to allow or prevent women's advancement. **********Nonetheless, many people familiar with corporate life lean toward the view that for women rising to the top remains incompatible with a thriving family life. ''To be successful in a lot of companies, a woman has to conform to the image of someone who doesn't have an outside life, who doesn't have a family, and who doesn't have any interests outside of work,'' Ms. Ely said. ''We're not much better on this than we were a few years ago.'' **********Men in high-powered jobs naturally point out that there are no special rules or policies allowing them to have better home lives; they accept that success in the corporate world is incompatible with attendance at every school play and soccer game. But women counter that expectations for them still differ considerably from those for men. ''We don't ask men to distort their lives as much as we ask women to distort theirs,'' Ms. Lipman-Blumen said. ''We expect men to have a traditional family, with the pictures on his desk, and that puts demands on women, too.'' **********That is why, in the view of Dana Friedman, who co-founded the Families and Work Institute, a research group, ''the Mommy track is alive and well.'' **********The ''Mommy track,'' of course, is the idea advanced in the late 1980's by the late Felice N. Schwartz, who founded Catalyst. She suggested that corporations defined a path in which women would take less demanding, lower-paying, more flexible jobs so they could also attend to children and family. **********Although Ms. Schwartz said she had intended the Mommy track to be a voluntary and often temporary choice, critics protested the very idea. It was dangerous, they said, to say that women managers had to choose between career and family, while men could have both. Worse, critics complained, giving credence to a Mommy track would reinforce discrimination against women under a more sophisticated guise. Smart women were advised to ignore the Mommy track. **********Companies apparently did not, however. Ms. Friedman, now a senior vice president at Corporate Family Solutions, a Nashville company that helps companies design work and family policies, said that today many companies were indeed equating the use of family-friendly policies, like flextime, with a move to the Mommy track. **********Family-friendly companies may not, of course, have evil lurking in their hearts. ''I don't know if the 'good' companies are doing it on purpose,'' Ms. Lipman-Blumen said. ''I think they think they are doing great things for women. But that's the first step. They need to take the next.'' **********''And,'' she added, ''the other companies need to make life more livable for both men and women who want to get to the top.'' **********But if the reasons are unclear, the lack of progress at the top is not. ''We're not better off than we were a few years ago,'' Ms. Ely said. ''It's not happening, except at the margins. Some big companies call me, concerned about high turnover among women. They want me to come and give a talk to senior managers. And then nothing happens.'' **********The message to women is also transparent: ''For most working women, for those looking for a family life and to move up the corporate ladder,'' Ms. Friedman said, ''this is not something the corporation is going to make easy for you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/business/philip-morris-sharply-cuts-prices-on-post-and-nabisco-cereals.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1996-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 838, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Sharply Cuts Prices on Post and Nabisco Cereals", "print_headline": "Philip Morris Sharply Cuts Prices on Post and Nabisco Cereals", "body_text": " **********In a bid to take market share from its larger competitors, the Post cereals division of the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies announced an immediate 20 percent reduction yesterday in the retail prices of its Post and Nabisco breakfast cereals. **********The price cuts range from 90 cents for a 24-ounce box of Post Grape-Nuts to $1.14 for a 20-ounce box of Post Premium Raisin Bran. **********Consumer activists dubbed yesterday's announcement \"Grape-Nuts Monday,\" in an analogy to Philip Morris's \"Marlboro Friday,\" when it slashed the prices of its premium cigarettes by 40 cents in April 1993.

It's important because if they  are undercut by a dollar a box, that will put a lot of pressure on Kellogg and General Mills.\" **********Mr. Bivens added: \"If Kellogg and General Mills don't match the reduction, they'll lose market share.

Philip Morris acquired all the Nabisco ready-to-eat cereal brands from the RJR Nabisco  Holdings Corporation in 1993. **********Kellogg and General Mills have reduced their promotional strategies, putting  less money into coupon discounts and more money into the marketing of specific brands. Analysts likened yesterday's move to everyday low pricing initiatives, an attempt to regularize confusing discounts. **********Mr. Adelman of Dean Witter said he wondered if the price-reduction strategy could be as effective for Post as it was for Philip Morris, since Marlboro was the world's best-selling cigarette brand in 1993, and Post Cereals have a much smaller, 15 percent share of the ready-to-eat cereal market today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/world/marlene-s-street-of-dreams-to-the-barricades.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1996-12-16", "snippet": "Campaign is under way to rename Templehofer Weg, drab Berlin street, after Marlene Dietrich, but many residents of neighborhood, mostly older people, are opposed because she sided with allies in World War II; photos (M)", "word_count": 1025, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marlene's Street of Dreams?

During the Second World War she donned an American uniform as she sang to lift the spirits  of Allied troops. **********The protests -- in letters to the authorities that are echoed in conversations with older Berliners -- have startled some of the politicians promoting the name change. The opposition to the name change, they suspect, betrays an alarming, secret reverence for a dark chapter of Germany's past. **********''It's frightening,'' said Hanns Leske, a Social Democratic politician. ''These people have these ideas in their head and there's no way you can get them out.'' **********Mr. Leske has led the drive to have the street renamed in response to taunts that the reunified Berlin has done little to commemorate those who brought it fame. Not only is there no Marlene-Dietrich-Strasse, but no Willy-Brandt-Strasse or Herbert-von-Karajan-Strasse, either. **********Neither would it be easy to simply find another street to name for Miss  Dietrich. **********Some, for instance, have suggested that the street that could be named for her should be the one where she was born, as Maria Magdalene von Losch on Dec. 21, 1901. Impossible, say the Social Democrats, part of a coalition with environmentalist Greens that runs the district, because that street -- Leberstrasse -- is already named for Julius Leber, an anti-Nazi Social Democrat who was executed in 1945 for his resistance to the Third Reich. **********However, the house where she was born on that street, No. 65, does already bear a bronze plaque in her honor. **********Another faction has suggested that the nearby Kaiser-Wilhelm-Platz be ''sacrificed'' to Miss Dietrich, as one local politician put it, though it is not clear how many people might leap to the Kaiser's defense before district authorities resolve the matter at a meeting next month. **********A further idea has been to commemorate her at an existing memorial to Germany's wartime resistance movement, but that has upset others, like a local Christian Democratic politician named Eberhard Opuchlik, who has said Miss Dietrich's elevation to the status of a resistance fighter would represent an ''insult'' to those Germans who actively fought the Third Reich within Germany. **********One businessman on Tempelhofer Weg, Theo Assfalg, said that, until the issue of renaming the street ''shook things up, I never knew she had so many opponents.'' **********Already a star from her role in Josef von Sternberg's ''Blue Angel,'' Miss Dietrich left Germany for Hollywood in 1930, and refused entreaties by Hitler in the late 1930's to return home. In 1939, she became an American citizen and toured with other entertainers during the Second World War to raise the morale of American troops. ''Lili Marlene'' -- the song for which she is probably best remembered -- was itself an emblem of her ambiguity toward  Germany. **********With lyrics by Hans Leip and music by Norbert Schulze, a version recorded by the popular German singer Lali Andersen became a huge hit among soldiers on both sides of the lines in North Africa when it was broadcast by a German propaganda station from Nazi-occupied Belgrade. Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda chief, found it so sentimental that he tried to have it replaced by a more martial version of the same song. **********But, though the original version, entitled ''Lili Marleen'' in German, had been recorded before the war by Miss Andersen, the rendering that became the Allied favorite was the English-language one sung by Marlene Dietrich. **********And people don't forget. **********''She wore a foreign uniform and she never came back,'' said a 68-year-old woman who identified herself only as Renate as she shopped in Schoneberg today. She said she did not want to give her full name because she did not wish to be publicly identified in the debate. **********''After 60 years abroad, she should be treated as someone who has betrayed the Fatherland,'' she said. **********Other people in the same age  group made similar remarks, but refused to be identified by name. **********Mr. Leske, the Social Democratic politician, said such views were widespread among older people in Schoneberg, who also took exception to her pacifism. They had, he said, sent letters to him and other local officials calling her a traitor who had no claim to be honored in her native land. ''For these people, her aversion to militarism made her somehow non-German,'' he said. **********That much was apparent when Miss Dietrich returned to Berlin in 1960 for a tour that drew bomb  threats and protesters lofting banners that said: ''Marlene, go home.'' **********Yet, after her death in Paris in 1992, she was buried, as she had requested, in Berlin, next to her mother at a cemetery here, where fans these days lay flowers. **********And despite the fuss, the local authorities seemed determined to press ahead with their plan to rename the street for her, hoping that Marlene-Dietrich-Strasse will become the centerpiece of a planned redevelopment project in Schoneberg encompassing new apartment houses, kindergartens, sports fields -- and, maybe, a lantern or two for the lovelorn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/27/business/two-companies-to-share-237-million-order-from-army.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-12-27", "snippet": "United States Army announces $237.5 million order for portable computers, software and related equipment, to be shared by Government Technology Services Inc and Sysorex Information Systems Inc (S)", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TWO COMPANIES TO SHARE $237 MILLION ORDER FROM ARMY", "print_headline": "TWO COMPANIES TO SHARE $237 MILLION ORDER FROM ARMY", "body_text": " **********Government Technology Services Inc. and Sysorex Information Systems Inc. are to share a $237.5 million order from the United States Army for portable computers, software and related equipment, the Army said yesterday.

Aged 74, with a  rambling monotone, a countenance that seems frozen in a frown and a stature that leaves him virtually hidden behind banks of microphones at election rallies, Mr. Rao has become a cartoonist's dream, represented daily in newspapers across  the country as an Indian variation on the children's book character, Mr. Grumpy. **********If Mr. Rao seems unable to rouse voters in the manner of Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, and her son, Rajiv Gandhi, it is not his only problem. **********Some Indians are saying that the days are gone when any party in India can win a majority. **********\"I think we're going to see a result that will be a belated recognition of the fact that we do not any longer have a party that has a real all-India presence,\" said Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a private research group in New Delhi. **********\"It will be a recognition of a new political reality, that no single party can rule India, and that we are at the beginning of an era of coalition politics.\" **********In addition to shifting voter trends, Mr. Rao is also faced with a corruption scandal that blew up as the election approached, forcing the resignations of seven ministers who are accused of accepting kickbacks in a pay-for-influence scheme. **********Mr. Rao, too, is under investigation in connection with accusations that he took nearly $1 million in cash from New Delhi business people in 1991 and used part of it to bribe opposition legislators into supporting his Government. **********India's Supreme Court, suspicious that Mr. Rao was using his powers as Prime  Minister to manipulate the investigators, ordered them last month to bypass Mr.  Rao's office and report directly to the court. **********On top of this, opinion polls have indicated that Indians are deeply divided  on the principal accomplishment the Rao Government is carrying into the election, the abandonment of socialist economic policies adopted in the Nehru-Gandhi era. **********Those policies had virtually bankrupted India by 1991, when the country's central bank had to ship planeloads of gold to London to get emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Rao, in office only a few days at the  time, was given a deadline by international bankers to change course. **********Abandoning a reputation for procrastination as a minister in the Administrations of Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, Mr. Rao and his Oxford-educated Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, moved on a broad front to open up the economy, deregulating business and industry, slashing import tariffs and setting some of  Asia's most relaxed terms for foreign investment. **********While the steps helped boost the country's economic growth rate to 6 percent  last year from barely 2 percent in 1991, the main benefits have accrued to 150 million middle-class city dwellers, bypassing 600 million mostly poor villagers. **********Taking these circumstances together, many in the Congress Party are bracing for a setback in the election. Almost all the voting in the country's 32 states  and territories is set for April 27, May 2 and May 7. According to several recent polls, the results, to be announced about May 10, are likely to show the  Congress party winning less than 200 of the 545 seats in Parliament. When the last Parliament was dissolved, the Rao Government, with 260 Congress seats and the support of allied parties, commanded a clear majority. **********A typical poll, published this week in Outlook, a weekly news magazine, predicted that the Congress party could end up with its worst showing since 1977, when Mrs. Gandhi, after a 21-month state of emergency in which she suspended parliamentary democracy and civil rights, won only 154 seats. The other occasion that drove the Congress Party from office was in 1989, when a corruption scandal cost Rajiv Gandhi an election. **********The Outlook poll, based on soundings among 15,000 voters across the country,  showed that if the election were held now, the Congress Party would win 191 seats; its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist group, would take 170 seats; a coalition of centrist and leftist parties known as the National Front-Left Front alliance would win 139 seats, and splinter parties would share the remaining 37 seats. **********Forecasts like these have convinced many Indians that the most likely prospect is a coalition government, probably one led by the Congress Party, although not necessarily by Mr. Rao. **********The prospect is hardly relished, since the coalitions that governed on two previous occasions -- after the 1977 and 1989 elections -- were marked by chronic political instability. Neither served a full five-year term, and political analysts are already saying that India, once the current voting is over, may have to brace itself for another election as early as 1997. **********The splintering seen in the polls is a reflection of an underlying social fragmentation, along lines of caste, language and region, which has always been  part of India, but was disguised in previous elections by the unifying power of  the Congress party and its dynastic leaders. **********Among some in the Congress Party, Mr. Rao's election strategy has been faulted for failing to emphasize what he has said to scores of foreign visitors  in recent years -- that India \"fell behind\" other Asian nations economically in  recent decades because of its socialist rigidities and can only catch up if the  next Government sweeps away the remaining legacies of the socialist system, including a vast array of loss-making state enterprises that government studies  have shown need to be re-organized, privatized or closed. **********The Indian leader's ambivalence was on display at the opening rally of his campaign, in the town of Amethi, which was Rajiv Gandhi's parliamentary constituency. **********Much of his speech was dedicated to presenting himself as a faithful implementor of the policies laid down by Mr. Nehru and the Gandhis, and he referred to the reforms only obliquely. \"Give me a mandate and see how this country progresses -- it will go ahead by leaps and bounds,\" he said. **********If the Congress Party does better than some forecasts have indicated, it could be because the parties that are its main rivals are also in disarray. **********After scoring its best performance in 1991, winning 120 seats, the Bharatiya  Janata party has shown signs of losing some of its appeal in the Hindi-speaking  states of northern India that have been its stronghold. The party's president, L.K. Advani, has been indicted in the corruption scandal that has claimed seven  of Mr. Rao's ministers. **********The third of the main political blocs, the National Front-Left Front alliance, is also in disarray. Several of its leaders have been indicted in the  payoffs scandal, and the man alliance boosters have touted as a candidate for Prime Minister in an alliance-led coalition, Jyoti Basu, the 82-year-old Communist who is chief minister of West Bengal state, has said he does not want  the job. But if the alliance holds the balance of power in the new parliament, as many polls predict, few doubt that it would join a Congress-led coalition in  preference to the Bharatiya Janata party."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/14/business/company-news-talks-between-fund-american-and-mellon-end.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;TALKS BETWEEN FUND AMERICAN AND MELLON END", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;TALKS BETWEEN FUND AMERICAN AND MELLON END", "body_text": " **********Fund American Enterprises Holdings Inc. said yesterday that it had ended talks with the Mellon Mortgage Company about a potential sale of Fund American's Source One subsidiary.

He is trying to restore Mexicans' sense of stability after coordinated attacks in six states on Wednesday by masked fighters of the leftist Popular Revolutionary Army. **********The Government is looking for a way to combat the rebels without risking accusations of imposing a wider political clampdown.

The exception was the chairman of Baby Superstore, Jack Tate, who agreed to take $16.23 a share for his 46 percent of Baby Superstore stock. Under terms of the deal, Mr. Tate will step aside once it is completed, which is expected to be in January. **********Toys ''R'' Us hopes the acquisition will improve the growth of its Babies ''R'' Us unit, which like Baby Superstore sells everything from diapers to cribs to formula, as well as the company's lagging stock price. **********For Baby Superstore, whose stock has dived more than 50 percent this year, the deal would give the company a chance to ride on the coattails of an experienced giant. **********''I think strategically this is advantageous,'' said Peter Caruso, a retail analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''This allows Toys to fully leverage their distribution efforts, and at the same time removes a competitor in a way that is not dilutive to earnings.'' **********What the deal would mean for investors depends entirely on when they bought each company's shares. Some Toys ''R'' Us long-term investors, who have suffered over the last two years, are mildly enthusiastic about a possible new growth vehicle to perk up the company's earnings, and said that grabbing Baby Superstore, which is based in Duncan, S.C., was the best way to get a quick roll from the Babies ''R'' Us store concept. **********Nearly all Baby Superstore investors, except for those who bought the stock very recently, have considerably less reason for enthusiasm, given where Toys ''R'' Us currently trades. But those who got in when it hit bottom, and even investors who bought it at richer prices, are likely to be better off with Toys ''R'' Us, analysts and investors said, given the grim near-future prospects for Baby Superstore. The company had grown beyond its means and needed to use its capital to invest in its infrastructure. Further, Toys ''R'' Us was breathing down its neck with its Babies ''R'' Us store rollout. **********''If they are going to do this,'' said Greg Jackson, a vice president of Yacktman Asset Management, an institutional investor in Chicago that holds 600,000 shares, ''this is a very good acquisition.'' But the underlying concern, he added, is whether baby supplies is a market Toys ''R'' Us really needs to be in. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Toys ''R'' Us closed up $2.625, at $31.50. In Nasdaq trading, shares of Baby Superstore jumped $5, to $24.875. **********Toys ''R'' Us has been looking for new growth opportunities since its earnings took a 72 percent nose dive at the end of the last fiscal year. Store expansions abroad have proved less than thrilling, and so the company is looking to expand its business in the United States, adding Babies ''R'' Us this year, and building superstores that combine Toys ''R'' Us; Kids ''R'' Us, its children's clothing business, and Babies ''R'' Us under one giant roof. **********By making the purchase, Toys ''R'' Us leap-frogs its own plans, putting Babies ''R'' Us into Baby Superstore spaces. Babies ''R'' Us will operate 73 stores in 23 states **********Kids ''R'' Us has never taken off -- it represents only about 5 percent of earnings -- but Michael Goldstein, the chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, said that the Babies ''R'' Us stores were more viable. **********''Kids is not a real profitable operation,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''We think that the juvenile business is much bigger because it combines apparel and hard goods, and we think it is much more suitable to super-store format.'' Further, both Mr. Goldstein and analysts said, there are simply fewer competitors than in the children's apparel business, which has attracted many players. **********Yesterday's acquisition announcement seemed to signal a pickup in the pace of consolidations among superstores. It was not so long ago that one company would roll out a superstore, copy cats would follow, and slowly the fittest took over the others over a number of years. **********But these days, consolidations seem to take place almost minutes after competitors hit the ground. Sporting goods, office supplies and computer merchants have all consolidated quickly, and this infant super-store consolidation started before real expansion ever began. **********''I think what is causing these quick consolidations is that you are seeing huge amounts of capital devoted to stores' expansions,'' said Mr. Caruso, the analyst. ''Retailers today are setting record rates of expansion, and the competitive landscape can change in a matter of a few years. **********''If you come to the rational assumption that competing with Toy 'R' Us is a difficult task,'' he added, ''then selling out is probably a good strategy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/world/kenya-s-leader-keeps-rivals-at-bay.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1996-09-29", "snippet": "Pres Daniel arap Moi appears headed for re-election in Kenya, where the splintered opposition is unable to unite behind a single candidate or agree on an agenda with which to challenge him; some opposition leaders call for constitutional conventio...", "word_count": 863, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kenya's Leader Keeps Rivals at Bay", "print_headline": "Kenya's Leader Keeps Rivals at Bay", "body_text": " **********With an election looming next year, Kenya's opposition parties are splintered and crippled by infighting, unable to unite behind a single candidate or agree on an agenda with which to challenge President Daniel arap Moi, who has governed for 16 years. **********Some opposition leaders say they have given up on defeating Mr. Moi under the current election system and instead are calling for a new constitution. In recent weeks, they have joined with members of the clergy in calling for a constitutional convention, threatening demonstrations to press the Government to accept reforms. **********''There is not going to be an election,'' said Kenneth Matiba, a party leader who lost to Mr. Moi in 1992. ''We are going for a constitutional conference first.'' **********But the governing party, the Kenya African National Union, has flatly refused to consider changing the election rules, much less replacing the Constitution. Since few people expect any changes before Mr. Moi calls the election sometime in 1997, it looks as though the President will win easily, even if he pulls less than half of the vote, diplomats here say. **********There is no doubt the deck is stacked heavily in Mr. Moi's favor. To begin with, the Constitution requires a president to get at least a quarter of the vote in five of the country's eight districts. This has diminished the power of heavily populated regions where Mr. Moi enjoys less support, which would have a better chance of electing an opponent if there were a simple popular vote. **********Second, Mr. Moi's party controls all the television and radio stations in a country where few people outside the capital read newspapers. Moreover, Mr. Moi enjoys an enormous financial advantage over opposition groups because he can tap state resources for his campaign. **********The local administrators and police chiefs in Kenya are all members of the governing party who owe their livelihoods to patronage, opposition leaders say. In the past the local officials have used archaic public-order laws to harass opposition politicians and keep them from holding rallies, especially in rural areas, where most people live. **********''How can the elections be said to be free and fair if the opposition can't reach the masses in the countryside?'' said Paul Muite, an opposition member of Parliament. **********Beyond these advantages, Mr. Moi has resorted to some cruder political maneuvers. For 15 months his Government has refused to register a new opposition party, Safina, which is led by Dr. Richard Leakey, the anthropologist. The police have broken up Safina meetings and assaulted members. **********Mr. Moi has also insisted on issuing new identity cards to every citizen before next year, and has said the old cards will not be honored at the polls. So far, most of the new cards have been issued to people in his political strongholds. **********Despite these problems, diplomats say, much of the blame for the lack of a challenge to Mr. Moi lies with the opposition leaders. Constantly bickering, they have been unable to rise above ethnic rivalries to forge a coalition that could defeat the President. **********Two of the three main opposition parties have split as rivals for party leadership have battled for control. Relations among the three parties are not much better. There are currently two rival alliances of opposition leaders who have promised to agree on a single candidate. But neither group can claim to control the parties they come from. Nor has either announced a candidate or a platform. **********''They are disorganized and unable to coalesce around a unifying theme or a unifying candidate,'' said one diplomat. ''They can't develop a theme people can relate to.'' **********One reason for the chaos is ethnic.  The biggest hindrance to a united front has been a long-running feud between the two largest tribes, the Kikuyu and the Luo. **********In the 1992 presidential race -- the first all-party election in the country's history -- the voting broke down almost exactly along ethnic lines. Most Luos backed Oginga Odinga, while the Kikuyu vote was divided between Mwai Kibaki and Kenneth Matiba. Mr. Moi's coalition of Kalenjin, Akamba, Masai and other small tribes easily survived the challenge, winning 36.7 percent of the vote. **********''The last election was seriously flawed,'' said Dr. Leakey, of the Safina party. ''He did not win the presidency with a significant majority of the votes cast.'' **********Now opposition leaders are calling for an amendment to the Constitution that would require a candidate to win at least 51 percent of the vote countrywide and would do away with the requirement of winning a quarter of the vote in five provinces. If no candidate won a majority on the first ballot, a runoff would be held. The proposal received a big boost in August when Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy members announced they supported the idea. **********Critics say the opposition leaders are misjudging the voting public. Most people in the country care little about constitutional reforms. They are more concerned with unemployment, food shortages, bad roads and poorly run hospitals. **********''It's self-delusion on a grand scale,'' said one political analyst, who asked to remain anonymous. ''Kenyan people don't even know what that document is.

And operating profits at the banks fell by an average of more than one-third from a year earlier. **********Japan's banks are still groping their way out from a morass of several hundred billion dollars in bad debt, much of it tied to real estate. For the six months that ended in September, results at the money center banks, known as city banks, underscored how slow the recovery will probably be unless more drastic measures are taken. **********''I think there is progress,'' said David Threadgold, a financial analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research Ltd. in Tokyo. ''But is it a sprint rather than a walk? Not really. It's a fairly sedate walk. There's still some work to be done.'' **********All the banks are navigating a tricky path. Charging off giant chunks of unrecoverable loans and thereby incurring losses chips away at their thin capital base. But they are eager to put their problems behind them, and officials at several banks today even expressed interest in listing on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Collectively, the 10 banks, which include Asahi but not Hanwa, wrote off unrecoverable loans and set aside reserves against loan losses worth only $9.7 billion. That leaves about $104 billion troubled and reworked loans, 7 percent less than the amount they posted last March, and 14.8 percent lower than the peak level a year ago. **********All the banks, except for the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, said that the main portion of their troubled loans would be disposed of by March 1997. **********''I would have hoped they would be more aggressive,'' said Paul Heaton, a financial analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Capital Markets Ltd. **********Though several banks have made efforts to increase their capital bases to maintain international standards, they will have to rely on their shrinking operating profits to offset the amount of bad loans they write off. A year ago, the operating profits were at record highs, mainly because the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, lowered interest rates to help support the banks in their bond trading and lending businesses. **********Today, however, most of the banks announced sharp drops in profits from their core banking business and bond trading, and profit margins in general declined. The narrowing gap between the banks' lending rates and fund-raising costs hurt profits, as did a drop in profits from bond dealing, despite a rally in the bond market this fall. **********Operating profits at the Fuji Bank fell 39 percent from a year earlier. At the Sanwa Bank, operating profits fell 46 percent. At the Dai Ichi Kangyo Bank, they fell 27 percent. **********The Daiwa Bank, which was barred from doing business in the United States after the discovery of hidden losses of $1.1 billion over a decade, which were attributed to a bond trader, saw operating profits drop 58 percent. The expulsion of Daiwa partly contributed to its weak results because it sold its American operations to the Sumitomo Bank. **********Now the Asahi Bank seems to have had a run-in with United States bank regulators. **********The Kyodo News Service reported on Thursday that two employees, one American and one Japanese, at the New York branch of Asahi broke into a locker and examined confidential inspection reports under seal by regulators from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed inspectors discovered the break-in the next day, Kyodo said, citing unnamed people close to the bank, and started a four-month inspection. **********Another American employee at the branch read a second inspection report sealed by the Fed, Kyodo reported. It said that he had been dismissed by Asahi and barred from working in the financial industry in the United States. **********Asahi Bank officials in Tokyo tried to play down the incident today, and said that they did not expect regulators to bring a case against the bank. **********''We apologize for causing a stir,'' said Eiichiro Kobayashi, a senior managing director at Asahi, at a news conference to announce the half-year results. ''There has been absolutely no impropriety of a monetary nature.'' **********Mr. Kobayashi said he could not discuss the case in detail because of restrictions imposed by Federal regulators. But he denied that the bank had dismissed anyone and said that the investigation had ended. The Fed has not commented on the situation. **********The Asahi Bank's operating profits dropped 39 percent. All 10 banks said they expected to report pretax profits for the full year, though the range varied considerably from Sanwa, on the high end, to Hokkaido Takushoku, at the low end. **********On Thursday, the Finance Ministry suspended operations at Hanwa, the first time since World War II that it had done so at a commercial bank. Some bankers and analysts suggested that the Finance Ministry might have been trying to demonstrate a greater willingness to allow market principles to govern its management of the banking industry. **********Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto recently announced a program to deregulate Tokyo's financial markets to become competitive with New York and London by 2001. Some of the changes will certainly mean greater burdens for the banks. **********In the half-year results announced today, for example, costs rose as deposit insurance premiums jumped sevenfold as part of the Finance Ministry's efforts to set up a deposit insurance system. **********''The reason U.S. banks are ahead is that Japanese city banks have not been allowed to do what their U.S. counterparts had the freedom to do,'' said Takeshi Yano, senior managing director at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ''I am pinning hopes on the deregulatory process.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/business/another-agency-creates-ads-for-mcdonald-s-adult-burger-raising-eyebrows-madison.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-08-16", "snippet": "McDonald's Corp adds Fallon McElligott to its agency roster to create ads for its Arch Deluxe adult burger (M)", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another agency creates ads for McDonald's adult burger, raising eyebrows on Madison Avenue.", "print_headline": "Another agency creates ads for McDonald's adult burger, raising eyebrows on Madison Avenue.", "body_text": " **********A SECOND agency is suddenly taking a bite out of the Arch Deluxe. **********Early this year, the McDonald's Corporation added to its agency roster Fallon McElligott, the creative hot shop in Minneapolis. That agency was awarded the assignment to produce campaigns for the Arch Deluxe, the hamburger sandwich introduced in May with an advertising and promotional blitz estimated at $150 million to $200 million -- the largest ever in fast food. **********In hiring Fallon McElligott, McDonald's managed to cause many eyebrows to, well, arch along Madison Avenue. That's because the company had long divided its general market account, with billings estimated at more than $750 million, between two far bigger Chicago shops: the Leo Burnett Company and the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. Fallon McElligott is known for stylish, low-key work for well-known brands ranging from BMW automobiles and Time magazine to Prudential insurance and Timex watches. **********But a television commercial for Arch Deluxe that began appearing this week, titled ''Chef Andrew,'' was produced not by Fallon McElligott but by DDB Needham Chicago. The spot focuses on the ingredients of the new product like a soft potato-flour roll, a mustard-mayonnaise sauce and an optional slice of bacon. **********Those attributes are lovingly described by the creator of the Arch Deluxe, Andrew Selvaggio, the executive chef for McDonald's. He builds a sandwich on camera with the same self-confident flair he exhibited at a glitzy news conference May 9 at Radio City Music Hall; at one point he exclaims, ''I'm in the zone.'' **********The approach of that commercial contrasts sharply with the tack taken by Fallon McElligott in its sales pitches for the Arch Deluxe, which have primarily presented brand imagery meant to convince consumers that the sandwich is ''the burger with the grown-up taste.'' For instance, a teaser campaign showed Ronald McDonald -- the character who appears in campaigns aimed at children that are created by Burnett -- pursuing adult pastimes like golfing, shooting pool and disco dancing. **********The introductory advertising went on to spoof perceptions of the McDonald's menu as for children only. One Fallon McElligott commercial depicted a classroom of youngsters reacting disdainfully to the mere mention of the Arch Deluxe. A billboard showed a scowling child with this headline: ''Arch Deluxe? Later.'' Magazine ads even affixed coupons to photographs of a boy's stuck-out tongue. **********''We're very happy with what Fallon McElligott has done,'' said Julie Cleary, a spokeswoman for McDonald's in Oak Brook, Ill., because it ''has greatly contributed to the product's success. We're also thrilled with what DDB Needham created.'' **********It is ''not uncommon at all to have a number of different agencies'' work on the same assignments for McDonald's, Ms. Cleary said, adding that the fact a second shop created a commercial for the Arch Deluxe was  ''absolutely not a sign we're displeased with Fallon.'' **********Asked whether DDB Needham Chicago might continue to create ads for the Arch Deluxe -- or if Burnett might join in -- Ms. Cleary replied: ''I can't speculate on that. Stay tuned.'' **********Rich Stoddart, management supervisor on the McDonald's account at Fallon McElligott, said: ''We continue to be very pleased with the work we're doing, and we think McDonald's is, too. The Arch Deluxe continues to be an extremely important assignment for us.'' **********Two more brand image commercials from Fallon McElligott, which ran for a week before the Summer Olympics, are now returning to television, Mr. Stoddart said. One features Grant Hill, the basketball player, who rejects a young prospect who has never eaten an Arch Deluxe. The other shows a crotchety old man cleaning up a little-league field who mutters ''Darn kids'' as he picks up candy and ice-cream wrappers and ''Darn grown-ups'' as he picks up Arch Deluxe wrappers. **********Ms. Cleary declined to discuss why or how DDB Needham Chicago ended up producing an Arch Deluxe spot. Mr. Stoddart referred questions to McDonald's, as did a spokeswoman at DDB Needham Chicago. **********However, executives familiar with McDonald's advertising said they believed that McDonald's had asked Fallon McElligott to create a commercial that focused on product attributes, but agency executives disagreed such a spot was necessary, asserting it did not fit their brand advertising strategy. DDB Needham Chicago then presented a product concept McDonald's liked, the executives said, which became the ''Chef Andrew'' spot. **********The production of that commercial, Ms. Cleary said, also should not be interpreted as a sign that McDonald's is ''displeased with'' sales of the Arch Deluxe. **********How the new sandwich is faring at the 12,500 McDonald's restaurants across North America has been the subject of intense speculation among those who follow the industry. **********''McDonald's is not saying much,'' said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting company in Chicago. ''But from what I can tell, the repeat business is lower than they would like to see. I don't think it's holding its volume. **********''The consensus view is that it's O.K., all right,'' he added. ''But it's not a Big Mac.'' **********One problem, Mr. Paul said, is that an Arch Deluxe typically costs more than $2 -- too high a price, he asserted, at a time when other chains are heavily promoting menu items costing 99 cents or $1.99. As for chicken and fish versions of the Arch Deluxe that are expected in the fall, he added, ''each one only adds smaller incremental volume; it's a low-risk, but not a high-potential, strategy.'' **********DDB Needham Chicago usually creates promotional advertising for McDonald's. Burnett handles the bulk of the account, producing campaigns aimed at pre-teens and adults as well as children. **********Two additional agencies create ads for the Arch Deluxe that are aimed at black and Spanish-speaking consumers. They are, respectively, the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago and del Rivero Messianu Advertising in Coral Gables, Fla."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/29/business/chemical-bank-to-arrange-3.7-billion-kmart-credit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chemical Bank to Arrange $3.7 Billion Kmart Credit", "print_headline": "Chemical Bank to Arrange $3.7 Billion Kmart Credit", "body_text": " **********The Kmart Corporation said today that Chemical Bank had agreed to provide $3.7 billion in credit, enabling the struggling retailer to clear its largest financial hurdle. **********Kmart plans to use much of the $3.7 billion in credit to replace about $3 billion in debt due next year. **********The agreement is key to Kmart's revival, analysts said.

Moore, a world-renowned pioneer  in business cycle forecasting, to sign over the rights to his life's work, then  callously evict him from his office? Or did the university walk the last mile with Dr. Moore, an 82-year-old economist, absorbing his deficits for a decade and arranging for a wealthy alumnus to underwrite his money-losing research center before cutting off his paycheck? **********Just who has the better claim to the high moral ground in this embarrassingly public dispute between the Ivy League university and an icon of economics remains murky. **********What is clear, though, is that Columbia's problem is linked to the widely pursued effort these days by universities to profit from the intellectual output of their professors. Columbia, for example, expects to earn nearly $50 million from intellectual property this year, most of it from licensing biotechnology and other scientific endeavors. **********The tangled tale of Dr. Moore and his institute is a study in what can go wrong when a university goes out of its way to provide a home for research unrelated to the interests of its regular teaching faculty. **********Dr. Moore was in the vanguard of economists -- a group that included the former Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns -- to search for statistics that would explain past recessions and predict future ones. Their approach to analyzing ups and downs of the economy, begun under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the 1940's, has achieved commercial success in the business world. Indeed, Stephen McNees, a consultant to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, notes that \"it won the war for popular acceptance over formal econometric modeling in forecasting business cycle turning points.\" **********Dr. Moore, who continued the development of his predictive indexes at his own center, garnered clients like Chase Manhattan Bank, Business Week magazine, and  the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Publication of the Government-sponsored index of leading indicators, a dozen measures derived from Dr. Moore's work and  used by many to forecast economic activity six months to a year down the road, has often had as much impact on markets as Government reports on inflation or employment. **********And for decades, the pronouncement by Dr. Moore that the economy had entered  a recession has been regarded as the closest thing around to a certification from Mount Olympus. \"His work is without peer,\" says Hank Hatch, the head of EMG Advisors, a money management company in Fairfield, Conn. **********But this approach to business cycle research went out of fashion long ago among academics. They favor the use of more complex models designed to answer the same questions. Though Dr. Moore's place in the economist's pantheon is assured and forecasting is making a bit of a comeback in some quarters -- he was named the American Economic Association's \"distinguished fellow\" for 1995 -- his welcome at the ivory tower has at times been strained. **********In 1983 Dr. Moore was forced to find a new host for his Center for International Business Cycle Research when Rutgers University chose not to underwrite his deficits. The Columbia Business School was then approached by some of Dr. Moore's friends. **********The association seemed a natural since Columbia's economics department had once been home to Arthur Burns. And while the business school was prepared to supply seed money, the university administration apparently gambled that with the prestige of the Columbia connection the center would quickly become self-sufficient through the sale of forecasting services. \"All research institutes are expected to pay their own way,\" Michael Crow, Columbia's vice provost, said. **********Revenues from the sale of Dr. Moore's indicators did increase, perhaps in part because of his coup in predicting the 1990-91 recession before other forecasters. But according to Mr. Crow, they were never large enough to cover the center's annual budget, which had ballooned to as much as $600,000. By 1993, the cumulative deficit exceeded $1 million, and the university ran out of patience. **********Giulio Pontecorvo, a professor at the business school, rode to the rescue. As a member of the center's board of faculty advisers he had earlier raised private donations for the center. And he persuaded one former \"angel,\" Edward Armaly, a  Lebanese-born British investment banker who had earned a Ph.D. from the Columbia Business School, to underwrite what was expected to be a long-term solution to the center's financing problem. **********Under the December 1993 deal, Dr. Moore assigned to Columbia the rights to the dozens of economic indexes he developed. In turn, the university licensed this intellectual property for 15 years to the Foundation for International Business and Economic Research, a company registered in the Cayman Islands that  was controlled by Mr. Armaly. Columbia received $150,000, plus 5 percent of future royalties. In a separate contract the foundation, known as Fiber, agreed  to pay at least $150,000 a year for five years to Columbia to support continuing research at the center. **********The foundation demonstrated its determination to create a viable business by  luring Victor Zarnowitz, a well-known researcher in business cycles, out of retirement to help Dr. Moore oversee the work. The center's work was marketed to bond traders on Wall Street. **********But within months of the new union there was friction between the center's staff and Richard Pantel, a new manager brought in by Mr. Armaly. Some of the center's staff members were transferred to work at the foundation, while others  were dismissed. And last year, to the university's dismay, Fiber failed to come  up with the minimum research budget it had guaranteed for the center. **********\"We have been negotiating in good faith with the university,\" Mr. Pantel responded, \"but the research must have commercial applications.\" **********Given its policy that research centers should be self-sufficient, Columbia was unwilling to reassume the center's obligations. It finally threw in the towel last month. \"I am sorry to have to inform you that, due to the loss of funding for CIBCR, I am forced to put you on leave without salary,\" the Business School dean, Meyer Feldberg, wrote to Dr. Moore. **********Even before the cutoff, Dr. Moore and several of his colleagues moved to set  up a rival to Fiber called the Economic Cycle Research Institute. \"I think an amicable resolution is still possible,\" explains Dr. Moore, who says he still wants to re-establish ties to Columbia that makes future operations self-financing. **********Lakshman Achuthan, who is serving as the new institute's business manager, notes that its first newsletter will be published next week. \"We hope to regain  the rights to sell Dr. Moore's indexes,\" he says, \"but we'll go forward either way.\" **********Where you sit determines where you stand on whether Columbia has an obligation to sustain the center. Mr. Crow, the vice provost, dismisses the idea that the university should treat Dr. Moore more generously than other scientists with research appointments. Moreover, he notes that the fees that Columbia received from licensing Dr. Moore's research amounted to a fraction of the center's debt and less than one-half of 1 percent of Columbia's total income from royalties on faculty research. **********But Mr. Achuthan insists that the university has played hardball, exploiting  the unworldliness of the aging researcher in convincing him to sign over the fruits of decades of labor without explicitly assuring future financing. \"The man has been prohibited from using his life's work,\" he argues. **********Moreover, Mr. Achuthan insists that the center's debt to Columbia is much smaller than the university contends. \"When the deal was done with Fiber,\" he says, \"the university was made whole financially.\" **********The root of the problem, it now seems clear, was in grafting a research operation onto an economics faculty with which it had so little in common. The isolation left Dr. Moore and his colleagues with few allies within the university who had a stake in raising funds. And it almost guaranteed that the university would be faced with the problem of phasing out the operation once Dr. Moore left the scene. **********How could it have happened, then? \"Big universities are complicated places,\"  laments Philip Cagan, a recently retired professor of economics at Columbia. \"Nobody knows what anybody else is doing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/business/international-briefs-peugeot-citroen-sales-gained-3-in-first-half.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Peugeot Citroen Sales Gained 3% in First Half", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Peugeot Citroen Sales Gained 3% in First Half", "body_text": " **********The French car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen said yesterday that its sales rose 3 percent in the first six months of the year to 89.04 billion francs ($17.8 billion), helped by a sharp improvement in the second quarter.

Smith, was planning a huge communications deal, he held a decisive meeting with John C. Malone, the chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc. aboard Mr. Malone's yacht off Maine. **********There, the two executives passed a languid afternoon, musing about how the merger of their companies could revolutionize the world of information and entertainment. To the chagrin of both men, the $21.4 billion deal they announced a short time later unraveled over a pricing disagreements and regulatory uncertainties. **********This time around, when Mr. Smith decided to merge Bell Atlantic with Nynex, the utopian gave way to the utilitarian. He conducted a crucial meeting last October with Nynex's chairman, Ivan G. Seidenberg, in a conference room at Philadelphia International Airport. There, the two dispensed with formalities and set straight to work sketching an organization chart for the combined companies. **********Yesterday, after Bell Atlantic and Nynex announced they would merge in a deal valued at $22.1 billion, Mr. Smith said he was now glad that the TCI pact foundered. **********For Bell Atlantic, analysts say, this marriage has a better chance for success than the TCI tryst, because Congress has removed most of the regulatory  confusion, and the new competitive environment appears to encourage phone and cable companies to stick to their knitting. **********The Government's recent overhaul of communications law permits the Baby Bells to expand into long-distance, while allowing long-distance carriers like AT&T and MCI to expand into local service. Because long-distance is such a vast opportunity, analysts said it had cooled the ardor of phone companies for the television business. **********\"If the telecom act had passed five years ago, we probably would have been talking to Nynex instead of TCI,\" Mr. Smith said yesterday in an interview after he and Mr. Seidenberg announced the merger. **********For consumers, this deal may actually make life simpler. By teaming up, Bell  Atlantic and Nynex will be able to offer local, long-distance and cellular phone service in a uniform package throughout the Northeast. If Bell Atlantic had gone through with the TCI merger, consumers would have faced the bewildering prospect of a phone company offering cable service -- or a cable company hawking phone service. **********One can measure the legislation's profound effect just by tracking the types  of communications deals that have occurred since Bell Atlantic announced its merger with TCI in 1993. What started as a flurry of alliances between cable and telephone companies has more recently shifted toward a series of deals between companies in similar businesses. **********Earlier this month, two other Baby Bells -- SBC Communications and Pacific Telesis -- announced that they would merge. And last fall, Time Warner, whose holdings include the nation's second-largest collection of cable systems and the HBO cable channel, said it would acquire another cable programmer, Turner Broadcasting System. In May 1993, Time Warner had become the first cable company to ally with a phone company, striking a $2.5 billion deal with U S West -- a troubled alliance that now finds the partners fighting each other in Delaware Chancery Court. **********Even without his own cable alliance, Mr. Smith said he was still determined to become a player in television. But he and Mr. Seidenberg both were far more interested yesterday in talking about the $20 billion worth of long-distance telephone calls originating each year in the 12 Eastern states from Maine to Virginia that the new company would serve. **********Mr. Seidenberg said the new company, which will be based in New York and called Bell Atlantic, would begin competing in the long-distance market as soon  as this fall. Analysts said the new Bell Atlantic stood an excellent chance of grabbing nearly half of those calls. **********\"The reason that long-distance carries the day over television is that it is  just so easy,\" said William C. Bane, a telecommunications consultant at Merger Management Consulting in Washington. \"The problem with them getting into cable TV is that they don't have the plant,\" he added, referring to the miles of high-capacity cable typically required for video networks. **********The telecommunications legislation has steered the Bell companies away from the cable industry for another reason. By allowing them to offer an array of services in their own regions, the bill has obviated the need for Bell Atlantic  or Nynex to acquire companies in different parts of the country as a way to expand beyond the local phone business. **********\"What we're doing is building from what we have -- not running around trying  to get things from other people,\" Mr. Seidenberg said. **********To be sure, Bell Atlantic and Nynex are upgrading their networks to carry video services. Along with Pacific Telesis, the two companies are partners in a  television programming venture, Tele-TV, which plans to begin offering service in November using wireless cable technology that would offer fewer channels than most regular cable systems. **********But since the companies struck the Tele-TV partnership last year, they have all become distracted by other opportunities. Tele-TV has languished as its target date for beginning service has been moved back several times. Executives  at the venture said they were frustrated at having plowed $100 million into technology and programming without signing up a single viewer. **********Senior executives of Bell Atlantic said they were sympathetic, but that the Nynex merger and other matters took precedence. **********\"Their single goal is to get up and running,\" said James G. Cullen, a vice chairman of Bell Atlantic who will be chief executive of the new company's consumer businesses. \"But we have several other goals.\" **********Technology has also played a part in keeping both telephone and cable companies focused on their own businesses. Mr. Smith said that Tele-TV's slow start was partly a result of delays in developing a converter box that would allow phone companies to deliver video signals. \"I'm as frustrated as they are that the technology has been delayed,\" he said. **********And in any case, technological overhauls can be prohibitively expensive. Cable companies have learned that lesson as they have tried to upgrade their coaxial networks to carry telephone calls. After TCI's deal with Bell Atlantic fell apart, TCI struck an alliance with two other cable operators and Sprint to  offer a nationwide package of cable and phone service. **********But Mr. Malone said in an interview that the partners decided to scale back the wired telephone part of the alliance. And he said that TCI and the other cable companies -- Cox Communications and Comcast -- had begun to doubt that the phone business made economic sense in all its systems. **********Time Warner, meanwhile, is doggedly upgrading its cable systems for telephone service. But the company is facing stiff competition from incumbent local phone  companies and rivals like AT&T. In Rochester, Time Warner's flagship market for  phone service, it still has only 1,000 residential customers. **********And of course, one of the seven Baby Bells, U S West, has continued to pursue an aggressive cable strategy. In addition to its alliance with Time Warner, U S  West in February agreed to acquire the nation's third-largest cable operator, Continental Cablevision, for $5.4 billion. **********But telephone executives said that U S West was different from its Bell brethren in one critical respect. Unlike Bell Atlantic and Nynex's populous East Coast stronghold, U S West's Rocky Mountain region is sprawling, sparsely populated -- making it difficult to capitalize on the long-distance and wireless opportunities that Bell Atlantic and Nynex have within their own territories. **********Cable companies have suffered under the weight of technological hurdles that  are imposing enormous construction costs at a time when the financial markets are making it difficult for the debt-laden cable operators to borrow money. **********When Bell Atlantic struck its deal with TCI in 1993, the company agreed to pay $34 a share for the stock of TCI and its programming arm, Liberty Media. Yesterday, shares of TCI and Liberty closed at a combined value of $26.46. And Mr. Malone recently had to reassure Wall Street that he had not lost his pioneering touch. **********For telephone companies, by contrast, the biggest issue is not debt but cost-cutting. Indeed, one of the most controversial facets of the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger may be the prospect of paring the combined companies' payrolls. But while the Communications Workers of America has vowed to fight the merger, the companies said yesterday that they would cut only 3,000 nonunion positions out of a combined total of 133,000 employees. **********As for his own job, as chairman of the merged companies, Mr. Smith has agreed to relinquish it to Mr. Seidenberg after two years. But Mr. Smith did secure the right to call this new behemoth Bell Atlantic. **********Bell Atlantic shareholders would also wind up owning more than half the new company, once the merger was completed -- something expected to take 12 months.  Under the terms of the deal, the new company will issue stock to shareholders at a ratio of one share for every share of Nynex, and 1.3 shares for every share of Bell Atlantic. **********In trading yesterday, Bell Atlantic's shares rose $2.25, to $67.25, while shares of Nynex slipped $2.50, to $50.50. **********Despite all that has transpired since that 1993 meeting on Mr. Malone's yacht, Mr. Smith looked the picture of calm yesterday as he presided over yet another jam-packed news conference to announce yet another blockbuster deal. With Nynex's $13.4 billion in revenues and lucrative home market in his grasp, he probably no longer has to fear the prospect of squaring off against Mr. Malone or the rest of the cable industry. **********As Mr. Smith himself said, \"I don't stay up nights worrying about it -- at all.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/02/business/outlook-96-the-economy-modest-forecasts-for-us-shift-focus-overseas.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1015, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: THE ECONOMY;Modest Forecasts for U.S. Shift Focus Overseas", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: THE ECONOMY;Modest Forecasts for U.S. Shift Focus Overseas", "body_text": " **********A YEAR ago, almost no one expected 1995 would turn into one of the biggest boom years for the American economy since the end of World War II. **********It took the country by surprise: a huge surge in productivity, an even larger run-up in the stock and bond markets, a tidal wave of exports. American manufacturers, who only a few years ago were symbols of industrial decline from Germany to Japan, suddenly regained an aura of success unseen for 30 years. **********Not surprisingly, many investors, corporate strategists and executives, have come to the same conclusion: it cannot last. **********That conviction has propelled one of the odd paradoxes of the mid-90's boom.  When the nation's capital seems to be growing more isolationist -- contributing  less to the United Nations and the World Bank, cutting back on the government agencies pressing foreign nations to buy more American goods -- corporate America is finally investing abroad with a vengeance. **********In the 1980's and early 1990's, companies talked about globalization but often had to be dragged abroad. A General Motors executive in Asia once spent an hour explaining to a reporter why it made no sense for G.M. to invest in Thailand, even though its auto market was growing at an annual rate of 130 percent. **********Now American investment abroad is surging. By some estimates, American companies invested roughly $150 billion abroad between 1993 and 1995, triple what they invested outside the United States in the late 1980's. **********Estimates of modest growth are behind the change. The American economy is expected to expand no faster than 2.5 percent a year through 2002, assuming no big recession intervenes. That is not the kind of number that makes a corporate  strategist think about spending too much time at home. **********The problem is where to go. Japan's recession seems endless; 1995 was supposed to be the year of recovery. **********\"It's not going to be a pretty year,\" said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief economist for Deutschbank Group (Asia). \"And you can see it in the speed with which the Japanese themselves are headed out: more money into China and Southeast Asia.\" **********Europe is not much better. The European Union seems mired over monetary union. Britain, traditionally the favorite foreign investment for American companies, has seen the inflow of direct investment fall by half, to lows it has not seen since 1987. **********And then there is Latin America, still shaking off the Mexican shock of a year ago. In many countries throughout the region, starting with Chile, the markets look promising, and American business is starting to stir again. But Mexico made everyone a bit gun shy, and Brazil and Argentina are still feeling the effects. **********That leaves the obvious: East Asia, especially China. Its growth is still phenomenal, upward of 7 or 8 percent a year, and some weeks it is hard to book hotel rooms in Shanghai with all the American, Japanese, Taiwanese and European  executives muscling each other aside to strike deals. **********But in the last year a good deal of the gloss has come off investing in China. Corruption has run rampant, and China's relationship with Washington was  on a slide all last year. Many more arguments are expected this year over the treatment of dissidents and the piracy of American software, music and movies. **********A recent survey of top executives by the Control Risks Group, a London-based  consulting firm, concluded that bribery was skyrocketing in China's provinces and that for many companies \"competitive pressures may leave them with no choice but to conform.\" No surprise there; the other big economic powers in China, including Japan and Germany, have no equivalent of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the law that makes it illegal for American businesses to bribe officials abroad. **********And then there is China's increasing skill at dangling the prospect of huge aircraft purchases from Boeing or a big deal for General Motors just as Washington is considering how to respond to the latest imprisonment of a dissident. **********Such problems have left Washington in disarray, lurching from crisis to crisis, constantly weighing commercial costs against diplomatic interests. It is an ad hoc equation, rarely explained in terms of consistent principles. Often, Washington is alone. No country has joined the Administration's ban on direct investment in Iran's oil industry, for example, and a French company, Total S.A., won a huge deal that Conoco Inc., a Du Pont company, was forced to give up. **********This leaves executives angry that their deals are entangled in foreign policy disputes over which they have no control. **********Officials in other nations charge that even when it comes to business disputes, America is abandoning international trading rules. In their view, a mercantilist American administration would prefer to \"manage trade\" with Japan and other big trading partners one on one, reserving for itself a guaranteed share of their markets, rather than leave disputes over cars or semiconductors to international bodies like the new World Trade Organization. **********Many Americans agree. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs, the former Under Secretary of Commerce for International Affairs, Jeffrey E. Garten, who left the Administration a few months ago, delivered a stinging critique of America's go-it-alone approach. **********But the tide in Washington is not with Mr. Garten. While American business is saying it needs Government support abroad more than ever before -- akin to what  Germany and Japan regularly provide for their businesses -- the Republican majority in Congress is going in the other direction. **********And conservative Republican candidates for President, most notably Patrick J. Buchanan, see involvement in international groups like the W.T.O. as a surrender of national sovereignty. **********If Mr. Buchanan does well in the primaries, it could make the question of America's business role abroad a much more potent one in the political world. But no matter how the election year turns out, the broad movement of the 1990's  seems clear: there is no turning back for American business on its new focus on  emerging markets abroad. Whatever the risks, whatever the political complications, there are few other places to grow. Just ask the American car companies: over the last few months, they have suddenly become interested in Thailand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/25/world/french-battle-lines-form-again-after-a-month-of-labor-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 465, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Battle Lines Form Again After a Month of Labor Peace", "print_headline": "French Battle Lines Form Again After a Month of Labor Peace", "body_text": " **********A month after the end of the most disruptive strikes in a decade, French labor unions and the Government are squaring off for new confrontations, even though the most sensitive parts of the Government deficit-reduction plan that set off the unrest have been dropped. **********The Cabinet passed the most painful provision of the plan today, a new tax of one-half of 1 percent on all incomes over the next 13 years to pay off the $50 billion debt the health care system has accumulated.

Blue-collar workers put in more overtime. Professionals and business executives spend ungodly hours at the office. Nonunion office and service employees commonly hold two or three part-time jobs. **********This is not how it was supposed to be. With a population explosion after  World War II, the nation widely assumed that the available work would be shared more evenly and that people -- aided by new labor-saving technologies -- could finish their work in less time. **********The futurologists of the 1950's and 1960's thought that too much leisure, not overwork, would be a major social problem of the late 20th century. **********So, what went wrong? Why does our larger world population create more work per capita, not less? **********Biologists note that behind the luxuriant facade of the tropical rain forest, the struggle for survival is much more intense than anything seen in temperate climates. Nutrients and sunlight may be plentiful in the rain forest, but all the resources there are used with utmost efficiency -- so much so that farmers clearing the Amazon region have found only a very thin layer of fertile soil. **********The world economy faces a similar problem as our population surpasses six billion. There are simply too many of us jostling for space on a smallish planet; it's become a case of survival of the most efficient. Our farming must grow enough food to feed everyone. Our manufacturing must turn out vast quantities of clothing, furniture and other consumer goods. Our technology must keep bolstering labor productivity, energy efficiency and farm yields. **********The need for greater efficiency explains why the free market holds such ideological sway. Market forces are the best mechanism for allocating resources efficiently, and any interference, like taxation or regulation, reduces that efficiency. **********This is not a new discovery; economists have known this since Adam Smith. But the role of free-market dogma as the driving force in policy making is new, emerging only since increased population began to strain world resources. **********And governments everywhere are getting out of the way of the free market by cutting taxes and weakening regulation. An overpopulated world, according to this view, simply can't afford luxuries like a clean environment, safe products, public support for the arts and a welfare safety net for the poor. **********State-provided pensions and care for the elderly are also viewed as inefficient uses of scarce resources. Such programs will eventually be curtailed, even though the voting strength of the long-living retired community has so far protected Medicare and Social Security from the worst excesses of the budget ax. **********In rich industrial countries, the market for labor has long been one of the most rigid, distorted and inefficient. Earlier in this century, social reform and gains by the labor movement helped guarantee worker safety, outlaw child labor, limit work  hours, set a minimum wage and mandate health benefits. **********But unions were seen as a further blight on market efficiency, contracting to sell labor at monopoly prices and keeping away others who could potentially undersell them. **********Now, however, the labor market is being radically restructured in the name of greater flexibility. Employers have discovered that it is cheaper to pay overtime to an existing staff than to add new employees, and that the use of part-timers can reduce the budget for fringe benefits. Companies have also realized that they can eliminate whole layers of jobs and pay higher salaries to the remaining employees to do the work of their laid-off colleagues. **********According to the free-market creed, lifetime employment just tends to have a relaxing effect on workers anyway, and full employment makes them capricious and demanding. The new, more efficient labor market is mobile and unstructured. The welfare bill signed recently by President Clinton will infuse an already vast labor pool with an army of workers willing to accept lower wages and highly irregular hours. Get rid of the laggards, the theory goes; keep the work force flexible. **********In this environment, the select few who do have job security cling to it. They hustle to prove that their positions are indispensable.

Rather, the 35 1/2 hours of contests are intended as a showcase for the new so-called extreme sports -- \"sheer unadulterated athletic lunacy,\" as they are billed in the X Games promotional campaign by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore. -- like sky surfing, skateboarding, sport climbing and even bungee jumping. **********We've tapped into a growing segment of sports,\" said George Bodenheimer, senior vice president for domestic sales and marketing at the ESPN unit of the Walt Disney Company in New York, and sponsorships for 1996 \"sold out in all categories.\" **********The 13 sponsors include returnees like AT&T; Nike; General Motors, for Chevrolet trucks and Pontiac, and Pepsico, for Mountain Dew soft drinks and Taco Bell fast food. Among the newcomers are Bell helmets and Coors beer. **********Critics complained that the initial presentation last June, under the name Extreme Games, was a human version of tractor pulls or a 1990's version of television \"trash sports\" of the 1970's like \"Battle of the Network Stars.\" **********Mr. Bodenheimer's riposte: \"Our viewers like us to provide diversity, new sports. These sports come from the streets, not from a TV studio.\" **********Indeed, the games found enough favor among marketers and viewers -- particularly those males in their teens and 20's -- for ESPN to schedule them annually instead of every two years. And a winter version of the X Games, with sports like snowboarding and ice climbing, is planned for late January. **********\"Last year, people were skeptical,\" said Alan Friedman, executive editor of Team Marketing Report, a sports business newsletter in Chicago. \"But it's got legs.\" **********\"For a summertime event, it delivered good ratings and it attracted good sponsors,\" he added. \"Those were pretty strong indications the event was credible.\" **********The X Games are also emblematic of a trend in sports marketing that favors proprietary events, which can help develop brand identity among advertisers as well as consumers. **********\"To own an event is an ideal position,\" Mr. Friedman said, \"because then you  can make an investment in building up recognition because you know it will stay  on your network.\" He cited as an example the decision by the NBC unit of the General Electric Company to buy rights to all five Olympics from 2000 through 2008. **********\"And the beauty of the X Games is that ESPN doesn't have to worry about rights fees,\" Mr. Friedman said, because it is ESPN's creation. **********Mr. Bodenheimer said ESPN would spend about $10 million to produce the games  from three sites in Rhode Island, \"in the same ball park\" as last year. He declined to discuss advertising rates because sponsors buy what are known as integrated packages, which also include signs, the on-line ESPNET Sports Zone and the X Games Road Show, a touring sports exhibition.

Opinion polls indicate that a coalition of opposition parties, which bill themselves as proponents of market reforms, are likely to form the next government. **********Why Mr. Iliescu has been able to hold on to power in the face of a precipitous drop in living standards is a puzzle. He has shown little of the flexibility of other former Communists, like Prime Minister Gyula Horn in Hungary, or President Aleksander Kwasniewski in Poland, both of whom came to power after Mr. Iliescu. **********Romanians offer a variety of explanations that range from the weakness of a fractious opposition to what they call the inherent conservatism of many Romanians. **********One analyst who offers a view from the inside, Silviu Brucan, a former Romanian Ambassador to Washington during the 1950's, said that Mr. Iliescu owes his tenure to Romanians' fear of change and the upheavals associated with capitalism. Many Romanians, inured by a tough past, were willing to suffer severe levels of poverty, he suggested. **********''He has a chiefly conservative constituency,'' said Mr. Brucan, who has criticized Mr. Iliescu for his handling of the economy and for retaining elements of the secret police from the time of Mr. Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed in 1989. **********''There are four million members of the former Communist Party and their families who are afraid of retribution,'' he said. ''There are workers in the big plants whose products have no markets who are afraid of unemployment. There are those who are renting apartments who are afraid the opposition will overturn the law on nationalization of property. And there are the people in the old state structures in the regions.'' **********Here in the capital and in some bigger cities, though, Mr. Iliescu's popularity has plunged. At a campaign rally this week at a tractor plant in Brasov, north of Bucharest, Mr. Iliescu was confronted with angry protesters carrying placards reading ''Enough of Your Humbug.'' **********''We have disastrous living conditions,'' said a retired army colonel, Ion Popescu, 64, as he browsed among the second-hand books on outdoor tables near the University of Bucharest this week. ''We can't afford anything but minimal survival.'' **********As the piles of books in the nearby newspaper stand attested, Romanians can now read what they like -- or, at least, what they can afford. But the Government controls the only nationwide television station, through which it broadcasts a dreary diet of circumscribed news and out-of-date entertainment. **********Mr. Iliescu has done little to dismantle the centralized economy. At outmoded state-run steel, chemical and fertilizer plants, workers cling to jobs at 75 percent of full pay. The average pay in Romania is $100 a month, one-third of that in Poland. Despite recent wage increases, take-home pay in September was 71 percent of that of five years ago. **********The health care system is regarded as the worst in Central Europe, with hospitals and the medical staff little changed since the Ceausescu era, when blood supplies were tainted and anesthesia often hard to come by. Recent opinion polls show that, after the high prices, inadequate health care is the biggest concern of Romanians. **********One of the reasons for Mr. Iliescu's reluctance to change the old system seems to stem from his strict Communist background. He came from an impoverished family, but as a bright student was sent to the University of Moscow to specialize in hydroelectricity. He returned to Romania to take full-time positions in the Communist Party's hierarchy -- first as head of the youth movement and then as head of propaganda in the Politburo. **********The early 1970's, when Mr. Iliescu criticized Mr. Ceausescu's support of North Korea, he was sidelined from the inner-most party circles and sent to head up party secretariats in the cities of Jassy and Timisoara. **********Despite Mr. Iliescu's career that was so close to Communist ideology, some say he is less a man of ideology than a political survivor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/14/business/business-digest-795739.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 521, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Privatization Program Is Canceled by Mexico **********Abandoning a central pillar of its economic modernization program, the Mexican Government canceled its prolonged, troubled effort to sell portions of the state-owned petrochemical industry to private investors. **********The scheduled privatization of 61 plants had prompted months of protests from oil workers and even many businessmen; the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party formally announced its opposition last month.

It is at the core of the premier suburban office market in the Boston area, about eight miles from downtown on the inner beltway, Route 128, and a major east-west highway, Route 2. **********Boston Partners is headed by Edward H. Linde and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who also owns The Daily News in New York and U.S. News & World Report. The company bought the 36-acre office park in 1985. It had an existing building of 162,000 square feet, now the corporate headquarters of the Stride Rite Corporation, the shoe company. The park also had the space for two additional buildings -- the one now under construction, and a possible future building of 50,000 square feet. **********William F. McCall Jr., president of McCall & Almy of Boston and a real estate adviser whose market assessments usually fall on the pessimistic side of conservative, said that the timing of the Boston Properties project was ''exquisite.'' **********''Boston is one of few markets nationwide where the central business district and the suburbs are both enjoying a wonderful upsurge,'' Mr. McCall said. Since the start of the year, rents for prime downtown office space have risen about 20 percent to the low $40's-a-square-foot range, he said. The downtown vacancy rate is 7.4 percent, said Patrick D. Moore, director of research for the Boston office of Cushman & Wakefield. **********In the Lexington area of Route 128, the vacancy rate is 3.8 percent, Mr. Moore said. It was 19.3 percent five years ago, and almost the same in Boston at that time as well. **********The resumption of speculative construction has attracted attention given the trauma of the last trough in the real estate market. During the dark days for the Boston office market from 1989 to 1993, unrented office projects that had been financed and constructed before they were leased led to the downfall of many developers and the banks that backed them. **********Earlier this year, another speculative office building of 73,000 square feet and seven stories went into construction in suburban Woburn, about five miles north of here. But the developer, William Cummings, is financing the project himself and Woburn is mostly an industrial and research-and-development market, not a class A office location, said Mark Roth, director of suburban leasing for Cushman & Wakefield's Boston office. **********Boston Properties, building in a prime location, is investing about $5 million of its own. The remaining $14 million in development costs is being financed with a construction loan from the Bank of Boston. **********''This is more of a benchmark because it's a traditional deal,'' Mr. Roth said, ''not a wealthy individual putting up his own cash and able to hold onto the property as long as necessary.'' **********Besides the market consideration governing its decision to build, Boston Properties said that if it had waited much longer to start, it would have had to apply to the town for a new building permit. That can be a lengthy process here. The decision to build ''came out of a situation which required us to act at a time when the market seemed able to support the site,'' Mr. Linde, president of Boston Properties, said. **********As a major suburban landlord, the company saw demand rising and supply tightening. ''We missed several deals because we didn't have the space,'' Mr. Linde added. **********Since the beginning of the year, companies in a variety of industries -- computing, financial services, biotechnology, medical instruments and communications -- have been leasing class A suburban office space for rents in the low-to-mid-$20-a-square-foot range.

And each has its own vocabulary, mixing algebraic statements with simple words to tell the computer to perform repetitive tasks. **********Of the thousands of programming languages invented over the last several decades, only a few are still in widespread use. Fashions in programming languages change slowly; sheer inertia often keeps languages alive much longer than they deserve. **********Based on a totally unscientific survey (those programming languages that occupy at least 3 feet of shelf space in the McGraw-Hill Bookstore in Manhattan), only six languages currently reign. The member of this odd and motley crew come in this order of seniority. **********1 COBOL, the Common Business-Oriented Language, is 35 years old and remanins the most popular language for corporate mainframe programming. Many insurance policies and bank accounts are still maintained by Cobol programs. **********Cobol has almost no fervent enthusiasts. As a programming tool, it has roughly the sex appeal of a wrench. A listing of Cobol code is a wordy and stodgy mind-numbing affair that only a bureaucrat could love. **********Indeed, Cobol was designed to be somewhat readable by nonprogrammers. The idea was that managers could read through a printed listing of Cobol code to determine if the programmer got it all right. This has rarely happened. There are limits to human endurance. **********2 BASIC, the Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, was developed at Dartmouth in the mid-1960's. Thanks to Bill Gates, Basic was the first programming language availbable on the very first personal computer (the Altair) in 1975, and it was also one of the first languages available on the I.B.M. personal computer. **********Basic has a notorious reputation for fostering poor programming practices. Historically, the primitve features of the language almost mandated that programmers created convoluted ''spaghetti code'' that no one else could decipher. **********More recent enhancements to the language (most notably in Microsoft's Visual Basic environment) have made it suitable for writing small applications for Windows. Visual Basic is currently quite popular among recreational weekend programmers, and for specialized corporate Windows applications. **********3 PASCAL was invented in the late 1960's by Prof. Niklaus Wirth of Zurich as a tool to teach students proper programming structure before their brains became hopelessly warped by Basic. The syntax of Pascal practically forces programmers to write neat, structured, well-mannered code. **********Pascal would probably have faded into disuse had not a young Swede named Anders Hejlsberg designed a Pascal programmng environment for the personal computer. This eventually became Turbo Pascal, the flagship product of Borland International, and a mid-1980's programming craze. **********Though Borland's best corporate days may now be behind it, throughout the last decade, the company has kept Pascal alive through several incarnations. The most recent is Delphi, a popular object-oriented programming environment for Windows. Delphi competes with Visual Basic, but appeals more to people who hate Microsoft and prefer not buying its products. **********4 C was developed in the early 1970's by Dennis Ritchie of AT&T Bell Laboratories in connection with the development of the Unix operating system. By the mid-1980's, it was ready to become the most popular programming language for personal computers. Virtually all the early applications for Windows and for the Apple Macintosh were written in C, and many still are. C is a terse, elegant, deceptively simple language that allows programmers almost unlimited flexibility. It appeals to the macho intincts of young and wild PC hackers, as well to the puzzle-solving impulses of more mature programmers, because of its power and ther variety of ways to sovle problems. **********Alas, because C is so powerful, it's almost impossible to write a bug-free program in C. Allen Holub, a programmer and author, gave one of his books on C programming the title ''Enough Rope to Shoot Yourself in the Foot.'' **********People often ask, ''How did it get the name C?'' Answer: It was derived from an earlier, little-used language called B. **********5 C++ C++ (prounced ''C plus plus'') is an extension of C developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Labs in the early 1980's. C++ extends C by adding ''objects.'' In object-oriented programming, objects are reusable computer codes that fuction as the basic building bloks of programs. In theory, the use of objects makes program code easier to maintain and reuse, although no one has actually shown this to be true. C++ is currently the language Microsoft encourages for new Windows programs. **********C++ is somewhat more bug-resistant than C but intorduces problems of its own. As Mr. Stroustrup once said: ''C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot. C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.'' **********6 JAVA came about just a few years ago at Sun Microsystems as part of a project involving interactive cable TV. Java is now the darling of the computer industry. **********In its general syntax, Java is very much like C++. But it does introduce some changes that (depending on your perspective) correct some flaws of C++ or botch up some features. **********Java's biggest selling point is that little Java applications (called applets) can be incorporated in a World Wide Web page along with text and pictures. The same programs can run on Windows, Macintosh or other systems (although certainly not as fast as native programs). **********Currently, Java is largely unfinished, untested and unproven, but that is not preventing big players in the computer industry from throwing vast resources to fitting Java into their futures.

If not, don't despair. Your time is coming. Around the world, companies are embracing employee polls as the latest must-have tool for good managers. **********\"We are making our employee satisfaction index part of our monthly reporting structure right along with things like margins,\" said Waldemar Schmidt, chief executive of ISS International Service System, the world's largest cleaning company. **********The Copenhagen-based ISS, which started surveying its employees in Scandinavia two years ago and credits the practice with helping to raise productivity, plans to expand its monthly polls worldwide. **********The keen interest companies have suddenly taken in the views of their staffs comes at a curious time. It is a time when demands for ever greater employee commitment clash with ever-shrinking willingness by employers to offer regular raises and even job stability. **********\"Job security is in free fall right across Europe,\" said Roger Maitland, managing director of International Survey Research, Europe's largest employee survey firm. **********Mr. Maitland, who says his business has \"taken off,\" harbors no illusions about the motivations of some of his clients. \"This is not a reflection of employers' being nice,\" he said. \"In fact, in some instances it is an exercise in finding out just how horrid managers can be to people.\" **********Using surveys to test employee tolerances has raised fears of bosses resorting to Orwellian monitorings and manipulations of their underlings. Add the new technology and the potential increases exponentially. **********The 700 European employees of the public relations firm of Burson-Marsteller/Europe are polled monthly via the company's in-house computer system. Responses flow in via e-mail. Full survey results \u2014 typically from a surprising 85 percent of employees \u2014 materialize within 48 hours, replete with breakdowns by division, country and seniority level. **********Ferdinand de Bakker, Burson Europe's chief executive, and many others dismiss the idea of Big Brother. They see their surveys as nothing less than a new means for a democratization of the workplace. To use the jargon of the moment, they see the exercise as part of an \"empowerment\" of the workforce, a means by which employees can exert influence over their own professional destinies and those of their firms. **********Typically, pollsters will ask employees for their views on everything from their salaries to the performance of their bosses. The BBC, for instance, is preparing for its third survey in four years of all 20,000 of its employees around the world. It not only publishes the results in its in-house paper, but also folds in management's pledges about what it intends to do to set right whatever the employees believe has gone wrong. **********\"It is not always easy to do because many times you would be happier just to sweep some of the findings under the carpet,\" said Bob Nelson, the BBC's head of organization and management development. **********In fact, the cardinal rule of employee surveys is that the results \u2014 no matter how dire \u2014 must see the light of day, if for no other reason than employees will simply assume the worst if they are not published. **********The results of a recent staff poll at the Bank of England, for instance, must have sorely tested management's desire for open communications. The survey revealed that 96 percent of the staff ranked morale as poor. **********Despite being the bearers of such prickly findings, pollsters say the sudden vogue for their services and the rafts of data they deliver reflect a number of trends. **********First, they note that as personnel officers have been increasingly recast in the weightier mold of human resource managers, the need to monitor and to quantify swings in employee sentiment has grown. Just as a treasurer needs his cash flow projections, the human resources supervisor needs poll readouts. **********Also, as companies place more emphasis on providing quality products and services \u2014 not just cheap ones \u2014 they have realized that unhappy workers are more likely to churn out shoddy goods. It is that linkage that has elevated employee satisfaction readings to the point where many companies now use them as an element in reviewing the performance of all their managers, right up to the chief executive. **********The bottom line is that the quantification of employee attitudes has given them more weight. In the past the brave manager who told his board that morale was bad might have been dismissed as a naysayer. **********\"But if they can say only 29 percent of the staff is happy, that is something that the board would be far more inclined to take seriously,\" said Keith Mainland, a consultant in the employee survey division of Towers Perrin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/18/business/bell-atlantic-to-buy-additional-stake-in-omnitel.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-12-18", "snippet": "Bell Atlantic Corp says it will acquire additional 5.8 percent stake in Omnitel, Italian wireless company, for 432.5 billion lire, or about $282.5 million (S", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BELL ATLANTIC TO BUY ADDITIONAL STAKE IN OMNITEL", "print_headline": "BELL ATLANTIC TO BUY ADDITIONAL STAKE IN OMNITEL", "body_text": " **********The Bell Atlantic Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire an additional 5.8 percent stake in Omnitel, an Italian wireless company, for 432.5 billion lire, or about $282.5 million, increasing its interest to 17.4 percent.

Health workers in Thailand calculate that by 2000, they will have prevented two million infections with H.I.V. by controlling other sexually transmitted diseases that may increase susceptibility to AIDS infection, and by educating people to practice safer sex. Their findings are among those to be presented to 15,000 participants from 125 countries at the conference. **********New tests to measure the amount of the virus in the blood seem to be a better measure of survival than the widely used count of CD-4 immune cells. Other laboratory advances identifying factors that help H.I.V. enter cells promise to  help scientists unravel some mysteries about one of the most pernicious viruses  known. **********By trumpeting the gains in glowing terms before the meeting, a number of leaders in AIDS research and drug companies have transformed the pessimistic mood that has prevailed at the last several international meetings to one of exuberance.  The change reflects testimonials from some patients who seem to have bounced back from their deathbeds, and statements from researchers testing  a new class of drugs, known as protease inhibitors, in combination with AZT and  other drugs in industry-sponsored trials. **********In recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the marketing of three protease inhibitors: indinavir (Crixivan), ritonavir (Norvir) and saquinavir (Invirase). **********One factor contributing to the optimism is a Canadian study showing the benefits of a combination of drugs (AZT, ddI and nevirapine) that did not include a protease inhibitor. The effective combinations act on different enzymes at different sites in the virus to overcome the resistance that often develops to treatment with a single drug. **********Preliminary findings of the first human trials, reported in Washington in February, showed that such combinations could suppress the amount of virus in blood to levels that could not be detected by the latest laboratory techniques as long as 24 weeks after therapy began. **********The findings do not necessarily mean that the drugs can rid the body of H.I.V. and cure AIDS, because the virus could still lurk in the body. Yet reports that virus-suppression has been extended to nearly a year are expected to generate excitement. More important, experts said, consistent findings are coming from a number of investigators. **********Nevertheless, not enough time has passed to determine how many infected people the combination therapies will benefit. The line between excitement over genuine progress and false hope is thin. Health specialists who have worked in the field since the disease was first recognized  in 1981 and who are usually cautious in their language are not playing down the  gains. While trying to guard their optimism, they often have difficulty restraining their enthusiasm. **********\"We can't claim victory until the fat lady really sings,\" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. \"She hasn't sung yet, but I think she is getting ready to sing.\" **********Dr. Fauci, like many other researchers and officials, is wary of past experience in which initial hope about gains in research gave way to despair as  early results later failed.  They are concerned that publicity about the new therapies has created false expectations. **********Dr. Martin Hirsch, a virologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said that as \"the nihilism has vanished and people have become enthusiastic,\" he and others \"fear that we may be getting ahead of ourselves by  delivering more hype than hope.\" **********Today a wide variety of groups with competing interests met to further their  own agendas. For example, drug companies held sideshows to promote even the smallest advantage of their products. **********Arguably the buildup to this meeting has been the biggest of any international AIDS conference. **********Dr. Martin T. Schechter of Vancouver, a co-chairman of the meeting, said in an interview that the organizers wanted to overcome the \"doom and gloom\" atmosphere of the last several meetings, when \"people would come with totally unrealistic expectations and go away bitterly disappointed when they failed to materialize.\" **********He said the risk was that people would fail to understand that \"the solutions were not going to happen tomorrow\" but that \"we were beginning to chip away at this thing.\" **********\"AIDS is not the total despair it was five years ago,\" Dr. Schechter said. \"Our theme is tempered hope with a realistic sense of the challenges that lay ahead.\" A number of unknowns underscore the difficult challenges. **********It takes on average about a decade from the time a person is infected with H.I.V. until he or she develops AIDS. But no one knows how long the benefits of  the combination therapies will last, because the first human trials have lasted  only about a year.  Although the virus may not be detected in blood after combination drug therapy, it may still hide in the brain, testes, intestines or  elsewhere. **********Virologists like Dr. David Ho, who heads the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City, and Dr. Douglas Richman of the University of California at San Diego are now testing lymph nodes, semen, vaginal secretions and other tissue to detect hidden virus. **********Preliminary results hint that H.I.V. disappears from lymph nodes with combination therapy in occasional cases, but the tests have yet to be done in organized studies. **********\"If a sanctuary site is found, everything changes,\" said Dr. Ho. **********For those whose immune systems have been damaged by H.I.V., efforts may be needed to restore function. Dr. Fred T. Valentine, a leading AIDS researcher at  New York University, said, \"It is of great concern that despite improvement, the immune system does not fully return to normal, even if you knock down viral replication.\" **********Another unknown is the optimal time to begin such therapy. The answer can come only from additional studies. **********The therapies involve taking up to 20 pills a day in a rigid regimen that even the most compulsive person could find difficult. No one knows how long the  drugs' effects will last and whether extended use will lead to unexpected and dangerous adverse effects. Few experts expect most people to be able to comply with such a regimen for a lifetime. Also, some people cannot take the drugs because of extreme irritation of the stomach. And some protease inhibitors interfere with the action of other drugs. **********A crucial question is whether the virus could develop resistance to the drugs. Although tests cannot detect any H.I.V. in the blood of many patients, the virus could still be replicating at low levels and a mutant strain could emerge to become resistant to one or more of the drugs used in combination. However, a reason for optimism is the general belief that a virus has to replicate to mutate, and with a low level of replicationm chances for mutations  drop. **********Drug-resistant strains of the virus might emerge among individuals who do not take the drugs according to schedule or who stop taking them because they feel better. Under such circumstances, resistant strains could be transmitted to others. **********Combinations including protease inhibitors cost $15,000 a year in the United  States, and tests like those measuring the amount of H.I.V. in the blood can raise the total to $20,000, experts said. Health insurance may cover the costs for many Americans, but many others can not afford the new treatments. **********Ninety percent of H.I.V.-infected people live in the third world, said Dr. Peter Piot, who heads the United Nations AIDS program. **********As he looked from his hotel across Vancouver harbor at the mountains, Dr. Piot said that the new therapies were unlikely to have a major global public health impact even if they lived up to their promise because third-world countries could not afford them. Developed countries should act out of \"enlightened self-interest\" to insure adequate treatment in the third world, he  said, to minimize the chances of resistant strains developing from improper use  of drugs. Otherwise, the resistant strains of H.I.V. could enter the developed world. **********The best prevention would be a vaccine, Dr. Piot said. But little substantial progress is expected to be reported here. **********The apparent ability of drug combinations to suppress the virus has led some  experts to ask whether one or two drugs might be dropped -- or therapy even stopped entirely -- after a year or two. **********Before studies can be conducted to answer that question, experts need to learn how long it takes for the body's population of infected cells to die out. If it turns out to be a year or two, and if new ways can be found to strengthen the immune system, then a few experts speculate about the possibility of ultimately curing AIDS. **********\"It is wrong to say we are close to a cure,\" Dr. Ho said, \"yet it is equally  wrong to just flat out say that it is not possible.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/28/world/most-improved-french-wine-try-montmartre-95.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-10-28", "snippet": "Montmartre section of Paris, famous for winegrowing in Roman times, is trying to make comeback; Francis Gourdin has been hired by City of Paris and local municipality to make something potable out of grapes grown on urban lot, which until recently...", "word_count": 838, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Improved French Wine?

But until this year, the wine it produced was, as the resident winemaker, Francis Gourdin, put it, ''difficult to drink.'' **********Mr. Gourdin was hired two years ago by the vineyard's owner, the City of Paris, and its municipal caretakers in the 18th arrondissement to try to make something potable out of what had been a thin, pinkish liquid with more diuretic than dietetic qualities. **********His first effort, Clos Montmartre 1995, looks invitingly like Beaujolais. All 850 half-bottles of it sold out at the annual grape harvest festival this month in front of and around the terraced hillside vineyard on the Rue Vincent, where the leaves on the vines -- mostly the Gamay Beaujolais variety -- are still gloriously aflame. **********''It was a real wine, for the first time,'' exulted Valerie Lovat, a permanent civil servant in the 19th-century district city hall where Clos Montmartre is made, aged, and bottled by hand in the cellar. **********The proceeds, about $30,000, went as they do every year to provide  meals for needy shut-ins and hospital patients and other acts of charity around the 18th arrondissement. People who bought the 1995 vintage were asked to donate a minimum of $40 a bottle. **********The 1996 vintage is still maturing inside a gleaming metal vat, not much bigger than a large washing machine, in the city hall cellar. **********''It's still quite acid, but I hope the second fermentation, if it ever gets started, will take care of that,'' Mr. Gourdin said the other day after drawing off a bit of the new wine with a siphon and sampling it. After the pucker factor is reduced, the liquid will go into oak barrels in the cellar, to be aged until bottling next spring. **********''The vineyard is on a north-facing slope, the worst possible situation for growing good wine grapes,'' Mr. Gourdin said. ''I thought I did pretty well last year just to get it to look like red wine.'' **********Mrs. Lovat said most of the buyers just wanted to do good by preserving social cohesion in what is one of the most picturesque and varied communities in Paris. **********Montmartre is named after the hill that dominates it and, according to local tradition, got its name from the early Christian martyrs, among them St. Denis, the first Bishop of Paris, beheaded at its foot around 250 A.D. Legend has it that St. Denis and his companions picked up their heads and walked with them about five miles north to his burial place, underneath the first Gothic church built in France. **********The feeling might not be unfamiliar to tourists who spend too many hours beguiled in the bars around the Place Pigalle, under the shadow of Montmartre's dominant architectural feature, the neo-Byzantine Sacre-Coeur Basilica, built in a sort of expiation after 20,000 people died in the repression of the Paris Commune in 1871. **********The neighborhood is still rebellious.

The police eventually moved in, but almost all the immigrants were later freed and most of them are still in the country. **********The vineyard on the other side of the slope started off in 1929 as the Square of Liberty, named by Poulbot and the other artists who saved it as an open space for the Republic of Montmartre, which they had proclaimed to protest the poverty and neglect of the people with whom they shared the neighborhood. **********Poulbot, a painter of street children and an illustrator of children's books, also paid for many of his meals at the Pomponnette Restaurant, down the Rue Lepic from the more famous Moulin de la Galette, by painting frescoes and murals that are still on the smoke-stained walls. **********Mrs. Claude Moureau, a great-grandchild of the Pomponnette's owners in those days, lamented: ''The neighborhood isn't as steady as it was.

It has sold a chain of fabric stores called Northwest Fabrics and Crafts, a commodity futures broker and a mail-order food business. **********The company plans to bundle the layoff and restructuring costs with other charges. The total, the company said, would reduce its income this quarter by about $360 million, or $1.57 a share. **********According to Zacks Investment Research, analysts expected Conagra to earn 70  cents a share this quarter before the charges were announced. **********William Leach, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, told Reuters that  he viewed the restructuring as positive. He said he expected the changes to add  13 cents a share to earnings in the next fiscal year. **********The charge consists of $350 million for restructuring, $100 million related to changed accounting practices, and $55 million for a divestiture plan the company has already finished. **********As a result of the restructuring, Conagra expects pretax savings of $50   million in the 1997 fiscal year, $100 million in the 1998 fiscal year and $125 million in the 1999 fiscal year. The company said that \"some of the savings in each year will bolster earnings in that year and some will be reinvested to support future results.\" **********Conagra has steadily raised its profits in the last several years.

Throughout the 1980's and 90's, as longtime depositors have fled in search of higher returns, banks have taken only the most elementary steps toward building competitive fund groups. **********Plenty have tried, of course. Most notably, the Mellon Bank Corporation bought the Dreyfus family of funds in 1994, immediately placing the Pittsburgh bank in the lead among bank fund companies. But with Mellon still struggling to  incorporate that mutual fund group into its overall strategy, the venture cannot be labeled a success. **********Among the handful of banks that have made a name for themselves in the fund  business is the Chase Manhattan Corporation, parent of the Vista Capital family  of stock and bond funds. While Chase's goals remain similar to those of several  other big bank companies -- expand the fund business overseas, sell more aggressively in the United States and build a stable of top-performing managers  -- its Vista group has been different in one important way. Its performance record has been good enough to attract money through financial advisers, one of  the most sought-after groups because they increasingly control investment dollars. **********Now, however, on the eve of Chase's $13 billion merger with the Chemical Banking Corporation, whose additional fund assets will vault Vista to near the top of the bank fund groups, the company runs the risk of alienating many customers. Last year, only three of Vista's 12 funds ranked in the top 25 percent of all funds in performance, and according to one industry expert, Vista gained almost no assets through new sales. **********In addition, Chase must overcome what has been a persistent obstacle to growth for bank funds: disenchanted consumers who have experienced many big bank mergers and who have come to view their banks as a necessary evil, rather than as the answer to their investment needs. **********To Leonard M. Spalding Jr., president of Vista, all those challenges come down to one basic strategy. \"Our plan is to hire and retain the best managers we can,\" he said. \"And I'll make sure we do that. We are not going to put up with a lot of extended third- and fourth-quartile performance.\" **********His statement hints of some significant changes ahead for the Vista group, far beyond the already difficult task of merging two fund families -- Vista and  Chemical's much smaller Hanover group -- and associated back-office systems and  cultures. **********Industry analysts leave no doubt that Mr. Spalding has his work cut out for him. \"If the new Chase intends to be a player in the mutual fund industry, they  have got to step up and aggressively promote these funds, and find an additional flagship fund or two that will attract assets,\" said Jeff Lovell, a partner at Putnam Lovell & Thornton, a fund advisory and investment banking firm. \"Right now, I don't think they have the investment record.\" **********Even after Chase and Chemical consummate their $13 billion merger next week,  creating the country's largest bank, Vista will rank no better than 29th among mutual fund companies, the biggest of which is Fidelity Investments. **********\"When you consider that we came from No. 129 a few years ago, we're coming along pretty well,\" Mr. Spalding said. Which is not to say that he is content. By next year, he expects Vista's assets under management to grow to $25 billion, from about $17 billion now, a growth rate one and a half times that of the mutual fund industry as a whole. **********All of that, he asserts, will come from new fund sales, not from market gains. And if most of it occurs in Vista's stock and bond funds, as Mr. Spalding hopes, Vista's assets there could more than double. **********In part, Vista aims to expand by establishing agreements to sell funds overseas, where the company can use the Chase Manhattan name. In the United States, to avoid customer confusion about what is covered by deposit insurance,  fund companies owned by banks cannot use the bank's name in fund titles. **********But much more of the growth potential lies at home, where consumers have made mutual funds their favorite savings vehicle. Like that of most bank fund companies, the bulk of Vista's assets lie in money market funds, a low-margin and less stable segment of the business. **********Money market funds, in fact, are about all that Chemical Bank will contribute to Vista in the merger. Of Chemical's $7.2 billion in fund assets, less than $500 million is in stock and bond funds. Chase has nearly $4 billion in stock and bond funds, about 38 percent of its $10.1 billion in total funds, according  to the Financial Research Corporation, a Chicago company that tracks fund assets. **********Mr. Spalding is counting on much of those money market assets to migrate to stock and bond funds, which contribute more to the bottom line. Much of Vista's  marketing will be aimed at bank customers -- particularly Chemical depositors, who made little use of the company's Hanover stock and bond funds. The Hanover funds will be merged into Vista's funds, subject to a shareholder vote scheduled for April 2. **********But if the new Chase does not go beyond that plan, analysts say, it will be little different from dozens of other banks that have merely dusted off the cobwebs of age-old trust departments and converted those assets into mutual funds -- making little impact in the fund business. **********\"If they depend solely on their captive relationships to expand their business, they are going to hit the wall,\" said Avi Nachmany, who heads Strategic Insight, a New York consulting firm. **********To succeed, Vista must attract investors from outside its banking base, particularly in New York, where consumers have experienced waves of bank mergers, branch closures, fee increases and other inconveniences that may have soured them on banks. **********Vista has seeds of promise there, analysts say. Chase was one of the first bank groups to sell its funds through outside distributors, and now has agreements with 1,100 entities, from individual financial advisers to big Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney. Roughly 75 percent of the company's growth comes from outside sales, Mr. Spalding said. **********Vista got a big boost in that area in 1993, when it acquired the Olympus funds, already sold through brokers. Vista also benefited that year from joining Charles Schwab's network of mutual funds sold to professional investment advisers, who practically threw money at Vista's Growth and Income fund, which had a superior long-term record. The fund's assets ballooned to more than $1 billion from less than $200 million the previous year. **********A significant part of the fund's performance advantage can be traced to 1991  and 1992, when the fund did better than its peers despite two manager changes in a few months. More of it stemmed from 1988 and 1989, when the fund was the best  performer in the country. **********But recently, that fund and the other Vista funds have lagged behind their peers in performance. For example, over the last five years, three of Vista's funds placed in the top 10 percent of funds in their category, according to Morningstar Inc. None did so over the last three years. **********Some of the company's most popular funds have had gruesome declines in the rankings. The Growth and Income fund ranks in the top 8 percent of funds in its  category over the last five years, but in the bottom quarter over the last three years. The Capital Growth fund ranks in the top 5 percent over the last five years, but in the bottom half over the last three. **********Further slowing Vista's momentum last year was the loss of Growth and Income's manager, Mark Tichner, to Paine Webber. The fund is now managed by David Klassen, who oversees fund management and equity research for Chase Asset  Management, which manages the Vista funds. **********\"With the financial resources that the new company has in retail banking, they need to make some moves to enhance their position,\" said Mr. Lovell, who added that Chase did not even rank in the top 80 fund companies in net sales of  funds last year. **********Expanding the sales effort is the purview of Steve Samson, who joined Vista in 1993 and who oversees product management and marketing for Vista, and James Detmer, head of sales management, who deals with outside sales. Like Mr. Spalding, Mr. Samson intends to shape Vista in the mold of successful fund companies like Fidelity and the American Funds, rather than those of their banking brethren. **********\"We're beginning to understand we need to offer innovative products across the board,\" Mr. Samson said. \"I don't think we're doing that yet. We're 50 percent there.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/05/world/el-salvador-s-stolen-children-face-a-war-s-darkest-secret.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1996-08-05", "snippet": "El Salvador Disappeared Children's Search Assn, private investigative program, is forcing country to confront one of darkest secrets of its civil war, namely, disappearance of hundreds of children who were kidnapped by Saladoran military during at...", "word_count": 1777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "El Salvador's Stolen Children Face a War's Darkest Secret", "print_headline": "El Salvador's Stolen Children Face a War's Darkest Secret", "body_text": " **********He was only 5 when he saw his mother and younger brother killed and the soldiers took him away to their base in a helicopter. She was just 6 when she was separated from her parents during a bombing raid and delivered to an orphanage here. **********Amilcar Guardado, who is about to turn 22, was raised by military officers on an air force base. Imelda Lainez, now 17, ended up being adopted by a family in the United States, where she was given the name Gina Marie Craig. **********Now, both have been reunited with their original families, beneficiaries of a private investigative program that has forced El Salvador to confront one of the darkest secrets of its civil war, which lasted from October 1979 to January 1992. **********Some 75,000 people were killed in the war -- most of them by troops trained and financed by the United States -- or disappeared and were presumed dead. **********Among those who disappeared were hundreds of children who, parents and human rights groups say, were kidnapped by the Salvadoran military during attacks on peasant settlements suspected of harboring guerrilla fighters or sympathizing with the leftist insurgency. **********''These children were robbed, abducted in the countryside by the military for a variety of motives,'' the Rev. Jon de Cortina, a Spanish Jesuit priest who is the founder of the El Salvador Disappeared Children's Search Association, said in an interview at the group's headquarters here. ''But we believe that their right to recover their identity, and the right of their families to know the fate of the children they lost, must be fulfilled and respected.'' **********Since its founding in 1994, the Children's Search Association has registered what it says are 323 instances of children who were taken by army troops or separated from their families in battle zones. **********But the group has barely begun working in some areas that experienced heavy combat and expects at least 500 cases to be uncovered before that task is complete. So far, there have been 29 reunions of children with their parents. **********Though most of the missing children appear to be in El Salvador, where the military placed them in orphanages or with new families, nine have been located in the United States, Italy and France. To help match parents and children, Physicians for Human Rights, a group based in Boston, has conducted DNA tests on both. **********But reunification has not been easy. Records have disappeared, some orphanages and family court judges have refused to cooperate, and the Salvadoran military has discouraged efforts to link the disappearances to massacres and military offensives or to investigate the possible trafficking in kidnapped children. **********In contrast to its stance during the war, the United States Embassy here now says Salvadoran officials engaged in ''clear-cut fraud in certain instances'' in which children here were adopted by American families. **********There are no reliable statistics on how many of the 2,300 Salvadoran children adopted by Americans during the war may have come from the pool of abducted children, but there has been no suggestion by anyone involved that adoptive American parents acted in anything but good faith or that more than a small percentage involved abducted children. **********''We were dealing with a Government agency, courts and our own embassy, so we just assumed everything had been checked out,'' Thomas Craig, Gina's adoptive father, said in a telephone interview from his home in Ohio. ''Here we have been trying to build a relationship, and now we find that the whole cornerstone of it is built on a lie.'' **********Abducting Children As a Tactic of War **********Gen. Humberto Corado, the Salvadoran Defense Minister, has rebuffed efforts to obtain a public accounting for the missing children. **********Last year Gen. Adolfo Blandon, a former military chief of staff and Defense Minister, acknowledged that families had been separated during the war but attributed the military's conduct to humanitarian motives. **********''During the war, there occurred cases in which children were found in war zones in situations of extreme danger and evacuated to the sites of different units,'' he said. ''Some were handed over to welfare institutions, others given to the care of some families, while others remained under the responsibility of the unit that evacuated the zone.'' **********Others tell a much different story. Taken together, their accounts suggest that some children were abducted to prevent their later incorporation into guerrilla groups, others to intimidate families sympathetic to the insurgents and a few to serve as mascots or trophies of war or even to be sold for profit. **********Miss Craig, for instance, remembers being with her parents, who acknowledge they were rebel supporters, and two sisters when a bombing raid began one day in 1984. **********Wounded by shrapnel in the attack, which killed her older sister, Vilma, she was evacuated to a rebel field hospital. Days later, she was taken away by soldiers during an assault that left no other survivors. **********Miss Craig was wounded in her right leg. At the orphanage, where the soldiers left her, she was put in a wheelchair. But after the Craig family adopted her, she was operated on and is now an avid basketball, softball and volleyball player. **********''The emotion is very great,'' said Jose Lainez Ayala, 40, Miss Craig's biological father. Mr. Lainez, a farmer, was re-introduced to her last week when Miss Craig visited the poor village of Los Cocos, where he and his wife, Miss Craig's mother, Victoria, live. **********''You can't imagine what it is like to lose a loved one,'' he said. ''This fills the vacuum we had in our hearts.'' **********Not a day went by during the dozen years she was missing, Mr. Lainez added, that he did not wonder whether his daughter was dead or alive. **********''This is like awakening from a nightmare that I thought would never end,'' he said. **********Years of Alienation And Resentment **********For Miss Craig, and both of her families, there is now peace. Miss Craig said she is planning to finish high school and attend college in the United States, but hopes to visit her family here regularly and eventually to assist them financially. **********''We were able to heal her of her war wounds, to educate her and to bring her up in the faith of the church,'' Tom and Stephanie Craig wrote in a letter to Jose and Victoria Lainez, expressing their happiness at the way things have turned out. ''But we were never able to mend her broken heart.'' **********But not all the family reunions have had such a happy ending. The first words that a dazed and distant Juan Carlos Serrano uttered to his mother after 12 years of separation, workers from the Children's Search Association recalled, were ''Why did you abandon me?'' **********Soldiers had taken the boy, named Nelson Ramos at birth, from the arms of his mother, Maria Magdalena Ramos, during a military operation in 1982 when he was only six months old, she said. As her child grew up in an orphanage, Ms. Ramos lived with the tormenting conviction that he had been forced into the army and might end up in a unit that would attack and kill her. **********''In some cases, the abducted children were told by soldiers or Red Cross workers that they shouldn't cry, that their mothers would come for them soon,'' said Rosa America Lainez, a psychologist who works for the Children's Search Association and is not related to Jose and Victoria Lainez. ''So they sat in the orphanage each day, waiting for their mothers to return, until they had built up a resentment toward their parents.'' **********Though some of the children have fared better than others, ''the moment of separation has proven traumatic in all cases for everyone involved,'' whether child or parent, Ms. Lainez said. Some children, she said, can still recall seeing their parents killed before them. ''Always there are the same questions,'' Ms. Lainez continued. ''What happened, and why did it happen to me? Who am I, and where does my true path lie?'' **********For Amilcar Guardado and his brother Mauricio, 25, those questions are especially hard to answer. After their mother was killed in 1980, soldiers took the boys back to their barracks and provided them with food, shelter and an education, but not the warmth of a family. **********''After the death of my mother, I became cold,'' Mr. Guardado said. ''The good side is that we learned things, and some of the officers would take us out on trips. But all we saw was wounded soldiers, how they, too, were poor guys who suffered in the war. There never really was true affection, nor any of the hugs and kisses that only a mother can provide.'' **********Today, Mr. Guardado and his brother continue to live at an air force base, where they work as helicopter mechanics. But they have re-established contact with their only surviving uncle and his children. **********In an interview here, Gina Marie Craig said that when she began to feel estranged from her adoptive parents, she was sent to see therapists. Invariably, she said, they told her that the belief she had another family here was ''just a dream,'' a fantasy that needed to be overcome. **********''All along, though, I had the feeling in my heart that they were still alive and out there looking for me,'' she said. As a result, ''I couldn't get along with anybody'' in the Akron suburb where she grew up so immersed in middle-class America that she lost her ability to speak Spanish. **********''I was forced to come,'' she said of her adoption and move to the United States. ''I didn't have a choice. That's how I felt. I always saw myself as Imelda, not Gina.'' **********Questions Raised On Embassy Actions **********Miss Craig's case has raised questions about how the American Embassy processed adoption petitions here during the war. In her own case, she said, American consular officials readily accepted ''a false birth certificate'' and a certificate of ''moral and material abandonment'' that had to be issued by Salvadoran courts for her adoption. **********About half of the 2,300 adoptions of Salvadoran children by American families took place over four years in the mid-1980's, when fighting was most intense and families were most likely to be separated. **********A spokesman for the American Embassy here, Chris Midura, acknowledged that ''there wasn't much procedure for checking up on these things during the early years of the war.'' But as the conflict went on, he said, ''and there was obviously fraud going undetected,'' the embassy ''starting around 1989 began investigating every individual case for veracity,'' and the number of adoptions dropped. **********Recently declassified State Department documents indicate that the embassy here was aware of at least some irregularities. In them, a prominent Salvadoran death squad leader with close ties to the military is identified as ''having snatched babies from the conflictive zones in order to sell them for adoption.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/24/business/media-business-advertising-seeking-consistency-for-change-pepsi-plays-off-its.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;Seeking consistency for a change, Pepsi plays off its 1995 campaign.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;Seeking consistency for a change, Pepsi plays off its 1995 campaign.", "body_text": " **********THE Pepsi-Cola Company has spent most of this decade in seeming agreement with Ralph Waldo Emerson's assessment of consistency, disdaining it as the hobgoblin of little minds -- or perhaps of minds located in Atlanta.

Drink Pepsi,\" which was deemed overly literal in defining the Pepsi mindset as solely  the province of teen-agers. **********\"It has been an erratic history,\" Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark L.L.C., a beverage industry consulting company in New York, said of the Pepsi-Cola corporate behavior through 1994. \"They were all over the lot.\" **********Worse yet, as Pepsi-Cola floundered, the Coca-Cola Company was making an advertising comeback with an effective campaign for its own flagship brand carrying the theme \"Always Coca-Cola.\" **********But since Pepsi and Diet Pepsi have been steered back into the middle of the  road, Pepsi-Cola and BBDO New York executives say, the brands' performance has perked up in terms of sales, market share and consumer attitudes. **********\"We wanted to build on success,\" Brian Swette, executive vice president for marketing at Pepsi-Cola in Somers, N.Y., said yesterday. \"The essence is 100 percent the same. **********\"We're delighted with our results and we'll keep on the track we're going,\" added Mr. Swette, who was in San Diego to introduce the campaign to Pepsi bottlers. Pepsi-Cola is a unit of Pepsico Inc. **********According to data from Information Resources Inc., Pepsi-Cola's market share  in retail outlets grew seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first nine months of 1995, compared with one-tenth of 1 percent for Coca-Cola. (Coca-Cola, however, cites data from the A. C. Nielsen unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which show Coca-Cola gaining sixth-tenths of 1 percent and Pepsi-Cola three-tenths.) Pepsi-Cola is estimated to spend more than $100 million annually  on Pepsi and Diet Pepsi campaigns. **********The crucial element, Mr. Swette said, is again \"the basic, simple proposition that people go to extraordinary lengths to enjoy Pepsi.\" And \"all the drama comes out of the product,\" he added. **********Mr. Pirko, who was provided copies of the commercials by Pepsi-Cola, praised  them. **********\"You can see the brand now for the first time in a long time,\" he said, \"and  focusing on the trademark can only help.\" **********For instance, in one commercial, a young man trudging through the frosty tundra sips a can of Pepsi, only to have it freeze to his lower lip. After an arduous journey to a doctor's office, he finds a waiting room filled with victims of the same mishap. **********In another spot, a goldfish shows off to a brother and sister by pretending to play dead for a sip of Pepsi. The stunt backfires when the children's father, unaware of the pet's ability, disposes of it. But there's always a happy ending  as the gifted goldfish re-emerges in a stream. **********And in a third commercial, which is produced to resemble videotape footage from a store security camera, an actor portraying a Coca-Cola deliverer is caught reaching for a can of Pepsi as \"Your Cheatin' Heart\" by Hank Williams plays on the sound track. **********\"We're trying to set a mark and stay on it,\" said Ted Sann, chief executive and chief creative officer at BBDO New York, which is owned by the Omnicom Group. \"We're very focused on the notion people drink Pepsi for the sheer pleasure of it.\" **********Michael Patti, vice chairman and executive creative director at BBDO New York, said: \"A number of the spots this year, like last year, have simple, strong concepts, like 'Security Camera' and 'Goldfish.' It's important to get one thought for one Pepsi out there.\" He and Mr. Sann joined Mr. Swette in San Diego for the bottler presentation. **********Like last year, the campaign promotes Diet Pepsi under the \"Nothing else\" umbrella rather than giving that brand a separate campaign. One of the initial seven commercials is for Diet Pepsi, featuring the model Cindy Crawford and the  actor Malcolm McDowell. The puzzling plot involves an animated Crawford character, a blend of Wonder Woman and the heroines of Japanese cartoons. **********\"I keep telling everybody you're not supposed to get it,\" Mr. Swette said, laughing, adding that the spot was meant to appeal to young fans of hip animation programs like \"Aeon Flux\" on MTV. **********Mr. Sann and Mr. Patti said five of the seven commercials are likely to run during the Super Bowl. One likely contender features Deion Sanders of the Dallas Cowboys, whose team faces the Pittsburgh Steelers in the game. **********Pepsi-Cola has bought four minutes of commercial time during Super Bowl XXX from NBC, which charged a record average of $1.2 million for each 30-second spot."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/19/business/international-briefs-peugeot-citroen-says-profits-fell-45.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Peugeot Citroen Says Profits Fell 45%", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Peugeot Citroen Says Profits Fell 45%", "body_text": " **********The French car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen said yesterday that its profits slumped 45 percent last year as it fell victim to currency shifts, sluggish car  sales in Europe and stiff price competition.

Internet, would dismiss nearly half its 515 employees today. The cutbacks will come a week after MCI Communications announced that it would reduce its 50 percent stake in the service, and would back a rival on-line service just started by the Microsoft Corporation. **********One person close to News Corporation said Scott Kurnit, the chief executive  of the venture, would probably resign soon. Mr. Kurnit, who was hired by MCI, declined to comment on his plans beyond saying that he would \"oversee the transition\" of the venture as it seeks new partners to replace MCI. **********Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has been negotiating with the Oracle Corporation, a software developer, to sell a stake in the service, which  is the successor to Delphi Internet Services. The talks have been fruitless so far. **********The action by News Corporation is part of a broader shakeout in the on-line industry, which is grappling with the explosive growth of the Internet and its World Wide Web. General Electric recently sold off its on-line service, Genie, while the three biggest on-line services -- Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online -- have announced plans to offer an Internet-access service. **********\"In order to move forward, they've got to get stuck in the Web,\" said Greg Wester, director of Internet research at Yankee Group, a consulting firm in Boston. \"The on-line service model is bankrupt.\" **********Traditional on-line services charge users a flat fee to browse through content that is licensed exclusively to the service. Internet-based services are more open, and often provide users with a navigation device to sort through information. These services will eventually make most of their revenue by selling advertising. **********Several analysts said News Corporation's troubles laid bare another reality of the cyber-age: Even well-financed companies with strong editorial content cannot succeed without a coherent strategy. **********Greg Clark, president of News Corporation's technology group, said the company planned to overhaul the division from a proprietary on-line service to an Internet-based service. He acknowledged that News Corporation had encountered trouble translating its vast resources in print and electronic media to the new  medium of the Internet. **********\"We were slow in getting started,\" Mr. Clark said. **********Mr. Murdoch made his foray into cyberspace in 1993 by acquiring Delphi, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., and has roughly 100,000 subscribers. News Corporation, based in Sydney, Australia, planned to use Delphi as a foundation for an expanded service that would harness the company's other media properties, which range from TV Guide and the publisher HarperCollins to the Fox television  network and the 20th Century Fox film studio. **********But current and former employees said the venture had been dogged by constant delays and frequent shifts in strategy. In a bitter twist, the venture plans to  open its Web site on the Internet on Tuesday so that browsers on the Internet can get their first peek at News Corporation's efforts just as the company undergoes a wrenching restructuring. **********\"The sad thing about News Corp. is that they've always had the most visionary approach,\" Mr. Wester said. \"But they've had extraordinary difficulty in executing on that approach.\" **********At the loft-like offices of News Corp. Internet in Chelsea yesterday, employees were updating their resumes and trading the latest rumors about how deeply the layoffs were going to cut. **********\"At the very moment that our work is going up on the Web and we're supposed to be celebrating, we all assume we're going to be fired,\" said one young editor, who asked not to be identified. **********Executives close to the venture said MCI's departure made the job cuts unavoidable. Although MCI will retain an equity stake in the venture of about 15 percent, it is channeling its cash into the new Microsoft service, which is called the Microsoft Network. **********A spokesman for MCI declined to comment yesterday. But one executive close to the company said that MCI had been impatient with the sluggish pace of developments at News Corp. Internet. \"We've got a better brand name with Microsoft anyway,\" the executive said. **********MCI, the long-distance carrier based in Washington, has a broader alliance with News Corporation and has agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Mr. Murdoch's company. Several executives said the Internet had become a peripheral part of that relationship. MCI and News Corporation are teaming up to build a satellite  broadcasting service using an orbital slot that MCI recently acquired for $682 million in an auction held by the Federal Communications Commission. **********\"News Corporation is fundamentally a broadcasting company and film company, and the corporation's strategy is very focused on how to grow those assets,\" said Mark Benerofe, a former executive vice president of News Corp. Internet, who now owns his own consulting firm. **********Separately, News Corporation reported that net income dropped 24 percent in its second quarter, which ended Dec. 31., to $294 million, on weak results at 20th Century Fox and HarperCollins. **********The company's results were announced after the market closed in New York. Earlier, the American depository receipts of News Corporation rose 12.5 cents, to $21.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. Each A.D.R represents four shares of the company. **********A spokesman said Mr. Murdoch was unavailable for comment. Mr. Clark said that despite the on-line retrenchment, Mr. Murdoch had not given up hope of becoming  a player on the Internet. **********\"Rupert is still absolutely committed to this being a crucial distribution channel,\" he said. \"But we want to invest in where the Internet industry is going, not where the on-line industry has been.\" **********One area of focus for the venture will now be the 24-hour cable news channel  that Mr. Murdoch recently announced. Mr. Clark said News Corporation would provide on-line text and video to supplement the material on its new service. Mr. Murdoch recently hired Roger Ailes, the former chief executive of the CNBC cable channel, to start the 24-hour news service. **********As a result, executives close to News Corporation said the editorial staff of the venture would not be hit as hard by job reductions as the customer service and marketing departments. In particular, they said, News Corporation's sophisticated customer service center in Lowell, Mass., will be almost completely dismantled. **********One senior editor at the on-line service, Jonathan Miller, resigned yesterday. But people close to News Corporation said Anthea Disney, the editor in chief of the venture and the former editor of TV Guide, was probably secure. **********The plan by Mr. Murdoch to use the service as an adjunct to his cable news service would seem to put MCI into an awkward position. The company's new on-line partner, Microsoft, has an alliance with NBC to develop a 24-hour news service called MSNBC. But MCI remains an equity investor in News Corp. Internet, which will be developing a competing on-line news service. **********\"No telecommunications or media company wants to be left out of this game,\" said Mr. Benerofe, the former News Corp. Internet executive. \"As a result, there will be many more annulments, divorces, and separations than lifelong marriages.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/business/worldbusiness/IHT-france-telecom-chief-in-court.html": {"writer_name": "Max Berley", "pub_date": "1996-01-16", "snippet": "Michel Bon, the chairman of France Telecom, is scheduled to appear before a Paris court on Friday on charges of\"racial defamation\" linked to a speech he made in 1994 while heading the state unemployment agency, Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi,", "word_count": 2724, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France Telecom Chief in Court", "print_headline": "France Telecom Chief in Court", "body_text": " **********Michel Bon, the chairman of France Telecom, is scheduled to appear before a Paris court on Friday on charges of\"racial defamation\" linked to a speech he made in 1994 while heading the state unemployment agency, Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi, according to the court schedule. **********Mr. Bon will answer charges brought by a prosecutor following a complaint by an anti-racism organization, Mouvement contre le Racisme et pour l'Amiti\u00e9 entre les Peuples (MRAP),that in a speech on \"the role of work in society\" delivered at a colloquium in October 1994, he made racist comments while explaining the need for customer-friendly employees in a service economy. **********Calls to Mr. Bon's attorney were not returned.

It was also unclear whether the demand for fees came from higher authorities or local officials. **********Throughout most of today it seemed as if the detention of the 16 people near  Sarajevo would not be resolved easily. **********Bosnian and NATO officials said the detentions were a violation of the Dayton accord's guarantee of complete freedom of movement throughout Bosnia. **********Bosnian Serb officials, on the other hand, maintained that some of the people were were guilty of espionage or black marketing and that others had traveled in Bosnian Serb territory without permission. **********\"Any government must keep the right to say what people may enter its territory,\" said Nedjeljko Prstojevic, Mayor of the city of Ilidza, where most of the people were reportedly detained. **********In an interview at midday, Mayor Prstojevic, dressed in combat fatigues and wearing a pistol, said no one would be released, despite the guarantees in the Dayton agreement. **********Then, British and French NATO officers began to call on the mayor. Over the next hour and one half, according to Col. Thierry Cambournac, a French NATO officer, there was very tough negotiating, and then a sudden breakthrough. **********The breakthrough came about the same time as there was a surprising change in the demeanor of Bosnian Serb military officers at another meeting, according to  a senior United Nations official present. **********That meeting was convened by NATO officers to discuss problems in putting the Dayton agreement into effect with ranking Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Government officers. During that meeting, according to the United Nations official, the Bosnian Serb officers were called by officials in Belgrade, Serbia and told the  prisoners should be released. **********The release came within an hour. **********Throughout the confrontation with Bosnian Serbs, NATO officers insisted they  were not responsible for the safety of individual Bosnian citizens, saying that  was the duty of an international police force, which is still being organized. **********Today, however, Carl Bildt, the former Swedish Prime Minister who is to oversee the police force, said he does not expect to have more than a handful of officers for several weeks. **********But in any case, he said, he will have about 1,700 officers to cover the whole country and he doubted that they could guarantee that Bosnian citizens would be safe if Bosnian Serb authorities wished to harass them. **********Instead of using soldiers or police to insure freedom of movement, he said, diplomatic pressure and persuasion will be more effective. **********Despite a general feeling that the confrontation had eased, some confusion remained about whether all those detained had been released.  Late tonight Bosnian Government officials said that one of the men originally reported missing was not among those released. Earlier, the Serb mayor of Ilidza said there were three men, a Muslim and two Serb residents of Sarajevo, who may not have been on the government's list and who he claimed had been found driving a military vehicle equipped with a radio transmitter. **********The mayor said these men were in different category than the other detainees, and were being held in a separate facility. **********As he tried to compare the list of those reported missing against those released, the chief of the United Nations Civilian Police here, Col. Vladimir Rybnikov, said, \"It looks like we have everybody, but we'll have to check the Serb jails.

The street's many bars, usually brimming  with people swapping stories over beer, were nearly empty. **********The camp was sealed off at dawn on Tuesday with United Nations support, preventing 190,000 refugees in the Kibumba camp from trading with surrounding communities. The operation, the latest in a long string of efforts by the United Nations to get the refugees to return to Rwanda, has turned into a war of nerves between refugee leaders and the Zairian and United Nations authorities.  The initial guard of 250 soldiers that sealed the camp has been reduced to a few dozen men. They lounge with their weapons in hastily constructed guardhouses outside the camp's main exits, keeping refugees from their jobs on nearby plantations and construction sites. The paved road to Goma, normally filled with refugees toting goods to market, was desolate, except for an occasional United Nations water truck. **********But most of the camp's inhabitants appeared to be shrugging off the latest attempt to persuade them to go home. Inside the camp, many people seemed to be settling in for a test of wills. **********\"It is difficult but we will manage,\" said Thacien Rubayiza, a 35-year-old medical assistant who owns a bar here. \"We are just going to adapt. This isn't going to make us go back. Everyone here is afraid to go back. There is no peace  there.\" **********Frustrated with the slowness of the repatriation, the Zairian authorities arrested the mayor of the tent city, Jean Baptiste Sibomana, his deputy and three other camp leaders, on charges that they had intimidated refugees from returning home by spreading lies about the Tutsi-led Government in Rwanda. The men were being held on Tuesday night at an undisclosed location in Goma, United  Nations officials said. **********The refugees here are part of an exodus of two million people who fled Rwanda in July 1994 to escape the advancing army of Tutsi rebels. The rebels defeated the former Hutu-led Government and took power, ending a hundred days of killing  that began in April 1994 and left at least 500,000 people dead, most of them Tutsi. Besides ordinary refugees, the camps house tens of thousands of militiamen, soldiers and civil servants who participated in the massacres and who have nothing to gain from returning to Rwanda. **********Zairian officials have said they want to empty all 40 camps on their soil, beginning with Kibumba. Their strategy is to squeeze the refugees economically while relief workers step up a public relations campaign aimed at persuading refugees it is safe to return. Zaire's Defense Minister, Mavwa Mudima, and the Interior Minister, Gustave Malumba Mbangula, have been going into the camps to talk to refugees. **********So far, the results have been disappointing, United Nations officials said. Only 73 people boarded buses for Rwanda today, below the average daily rate before the operation. On Tuesday about 50 people returned. **********Carrol Faubert, a special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, said it was too early to tell if the strategy would work. The aim, he  said, was to cut out the economic incentives for the camp leaders to stay and to focus the United Nations public relations efforts on one group at a time. Kibumba was chosen, he said, because it was close to the border and had fewer militia members than other camps near Goma. **********\"We are certainly at a turning point,\" he said. \"After this, what else?\" **********While refugees in the camp said they were sticking close to home because of the soldiers outside, United Nations officials said the camp leaders had sent a  message through the camp's well developed political machine, telling people not  only that they should not return to Rwanda, but also to keep a low profile and abide by the instructions from Zairian soldiers. **********\"For the moment people are respecting the instructions they received,\" said Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. \"The question is for how long.\" **********A senior United Nations official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: \"The leaders are still putting the word out 'Don't go home.' The word has  gone around, saying, 'Don't move. Stay there. Smile.' \" **********Outside the camp's markets, life proceeded as it has for months. Children played soccer on dusty fields. Women tended vegetable gardens of corn, beans and cabbages that they have wedged into arable patch of land they can find on the rocky ash plain where the camp lays, between three volcanoes. Relief workers continued to deliver firewood, food, medicine, and water and to organize sanitation efforts. **********But the mood was tense, especially among young men along the Rue Ruhunda. Several vowed they would never return to Rwanda. A few recent arrivals told of being beaten and tortured by Tutsi soldiers. **********The conventional wisdom among these younger refugees is that the new Government in Kigali would arrest them immediately after they crossed the border. Several pointed out that 66,000 Hutu have been detained indefinitely in  overcrowded jails on charges they took part in genocide. None have been brought  to trial. **********\"If you are a Hutu, you are guilty, automatically,\" said Eric Ntabarisha, 27, summing up the feelings of many young men in the camp. \"If you are a Hutu intellectual, you are guilty. You go to prison. That's it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/30/business/former-mobil-building-largely-vacant-90-s-gets-new-tenant-american-airlines.html": {"writer_name": "Mervyn Rothstein", "pub_date": "1996-10-30", "snippet": "American Airlines has leased 43,000 square feet at former Mobil building at 150 East 42d Street, Manhattan; ZAR Realty, partnership of David Werner and Tom Sapir, has purchased two full blockfront buildings at 260 and 261 Madison Avenue for $75 mi...", "word_count": 771, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The former Mobil Building, largely vacant in the 90's, gets a new tenant, American Airlines.", "print_headline": "The former Mobil Building, largely vacant in the 90's, gets a new tenant, American Airlines.", "body_text": " **********THE former Mobil building has picked up yet another tenant: American Airlines has leased 43,000 square feet at the 1.6 million-square-foot office building at 150 East 42d Street, which has been largely vacant for much of the 90's. **********The airline, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, will be giving up its current space in the Chrysler Building, at Lexington Avenue and 42d Street, and moving the operations housed there just across the street to the former Mobil building's fourth floor. **********Richard Bernstein of the Edward S.

The committee  asked the United States to put the charges in writing. **********If Iran is implicated in violating the international embargo against Iraq, it could also face stiff punishment, including sanctions.. **********John R. Dinger, a State Department spokesman, said today that the United States had ''compelling evidence'' that Iranians were involved in the smuggling, including members of the Revolutionary Guards, the elite troops closely tied to Iran's Islamic leaders. **********Mr. Dinger said that members of the guards provided bogus documents to ship captains, declaring  that cargos of Iraqi oil products like gasoline were loaded in Iranian, not Iraqi ports. In exchange, the guards collected large fees. **********The vessels, often tugboats pulling barges or other smaller ships, then traveled in Iran's territorial waters along the coast, allowing them to slip past the multinational fleet that patrols the Persian Gulf. **********Iran's delegate to the United Nations, Kamal Kharazi, denied that Teheran had circumvented the international sanctions against Iraq, calling the accusations ''part of Washington's anti-Iran propaganda,'' according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency. He said that, on the contrary, Iran had tightened its coastal patrols to enforce the sanctions against Iraq. **********Iran's relations with Iraq have  been troubled, with new confrontations flaring up periodically since the end of the eight-year war between the two countries in the 1980's. Today, Iraq accused Iran of sending troops into northern Iraq, apparently to strike at Iranian Kurdish guerrillas based there. **********But in its desperation to raise money Iraq has offered lucrative incentives, officials said, not only for the Revolutionary Guards, but also for ship captains and other smugglers willing to take the risk of loading oil in Iraqi ports. These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Iranians were making a greater profit on each shipment than the Iraqis. **********The charges against Iran are unlikely to affect the recent agreement between Iraq and the United Nations to sell $2 billion worth of oil twice a year to buy food and medicine, officials said. **********They acknowledged that they did not have a precise estimate of the amount of oil that may have been smuggled out of Iraq, but they insisted it was considerable. From 1992 to 1994, Iraq tried to ship oil in large tankers, but the international naval force largely choked off that route, leaving open only coastal waters. **********''It's hard to interdict any of this stuff,'' one official said. **********The United States has accused Iran of complicity in breaking the embargo on Iraq before. In February, it brought similar charges to the United Nations, but the sanctions committee did not act. Mr. Dinger said that the smuggling aboard smaller boats began in 1995 and increased significantly this year. **********The new accusations appeared to be an effort to step up pressure and embarrass Iran into stopping the shipments.

The country now imports hundreds of thousands of single men from Asia, Africa, Arab countries, Eastern Europe and even South America to work its fields and build its apartments. **********These foreign workers -- most admitted on temporary contracts, others entering illegally -- are enveloping neighborhoods, with the southern Tel Aviv slum now the largest concentration of foreigners in Israel. **********''We know the Parliament says that they should bring back the Arabs and they should kick us out,'' said Marcus Florin, a former Romanian policeman who hopes to save $2,000 before he loses his construction job. ''There is nothing in Romania. It's over, finished.'' **********No one is quite sure how many are here, but the upper estimate of 60,000 in a Tel Aviv population of 440,000 would mean that one person among every seven in the country's largest city is a foreign laborer. **********''We have a city within a city in the heart of Tel Aviv,'' said Meir Doron, a senior city official, rattling off all the statistics. ''They live sometimes three, four or five and even more to a room. There are so many foreigners that the people who used to live there have fled. It is going to become a neighborhood without any Israelis.'' **********Aside from alcohol abuse and other problems in the foreign enclaves, the country is increasingly uneasy about workers bringing their wives or marrying locally, enrolling their children in school and showing no signs of leaving. **********Noting Europe's struggles over the same issue, many Israelis see the uncontrolled influx as a threat to the country's very definition. **********Especially outspoken are the religious parties flexing their new Government muscles. **********''We were waiting for our independence to have the only Jewish state in the world,'' said Avraham Ravitz, a Parliament member from United Torah Judaism, ''not to bring people from all over who don't belong here. We are against a new situation of having a quarter of a million slaves working under terrible conditions. That is not part of the dream of establishing a Jewish homeland.'' **********The new Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a committee to find ways to slash the number of foreign workers. Its first recommendations, issued this week, include reducing legal work permits from 103,000 to 83,000 within a year, with more cutbacks to follow. **********In addition, an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 illegal workers here on expired tourist visas are to be rounded up and expelled. But few expect the tide to diminish. **********''We have become a people rich enough so that we can afford to hire foreign workers,'' said Tova Elinson, the spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry. ''More arrive every day. I can't explain how exactly, but they are coming.'' **********Israel's per capita income is about $16,000 a year, above some European countries like Spain. Part of the wealth stems from $3.2 billion in annual aid from the United States, more than any other country gets. **********In the midst of such prosperity, young Israelis do not want to work for the minimum wage in restaurants or construction. Foreign laborers, on the other hand, use a new ruse every week to sneak in. **********The Interior Ministry said a group of Nigerians had tried to enter this week with forged papers indicating that they were United Nations peacekeeping troops. For a while, busloads of Ghanaians arrived from Egypt, ostensibly bound for three-hour Red Sea cruises. They never left. A recent soccer match against a team from Turkey drew 10,000 visa applications from Turks eager to come here. **********The resources needed to track the illegal workers down and ship them home, not to mention the new burdens on the social welfare system, have suddenly rehabilitated Palestinian workers in the eyes of many Israelis. **********One recent newspaper editorial said no Palestinian with a legal work permit had ever carried out one of the deadly attacks that led Israel to cut the number of Palestinian workers from a high of about 180,000 in 1989 to around 32,000 today. **********The Clinton Administration has been pressing Israel to accept more, and there is a growing recognition here that Palestinians who can feed their families are less likely to blow themselves up on Israeli buses. Moreover, Palestinians have little desire to live among Israelis. **********''Palestinians don't create the same problems, because they go home at the end of the day,'' said Shaul Nahum, special adviser on foreign workers to the Labor Minister. **********But there have been some problems as displaced Palestinians return. A clash between Palestinian and Thai agricultural workers this summer led to one Thai man being crushed to death with a tractor. **********The country's building contractors push for more and more foreign workers, arguing that they cannot depend on Palestinian labor because the Israeli Government closes off the West Bank and Gaza Strip after any violent incident. **********Builders feel relatively immune from Government threats to force them to raise wages to make the work attractive to Israelis, knowing that building costs can fuel the kind of inflation that makes Governments fall. **********Foreign workers also feel somewhat safe from deportation, because most Israelis would not give certain jobs, like cleaning homes in wealthy Tel Aviv suburbs, to a Palestinian. **********''We have keys,'' said Rose, a Jamaican maid who has lived here four years, married a Ghanaian and had a son. ''We stay in their houses for seven or eight hours. They would never let an Arab do that.'' She did not want her last name published, because she is here on an expired tourist visa. Wives of senior immigration officials warn their maids when sweeps are imminent, Rose said, and the workers' grapevine then keeps them off the streets. **********Among those who blend in are the approximately 7,000 workers from Egypt and Jordan, since nearby Jaffa has a large population of native Arabs. The Egyptian Government has recently taken steps to cut the number, worried about economic dependency and image. **********The workers usually live in appalling conditions, some packed in bunk beds 15 to a room in half-finished buildings, their only bathrooms the cold water piped in for construction. **********The Workers' Hotline, an advocacy group, has filed hundreds of complaints but said none have made it to trial. Some employers take the passports of foreign workers when they arrive here legally and then, near the end of their contracts, expel them without pay and replace them. **********''It is a pattern of slavery,'' said Hanna Zohar, the Hotline coordinator. ''They hire security companies to deport them, and it is not done gently. There are usually beatings involved, and it's always without paying the last paychecks.'' **********In south Tel Aviv, workers said the average $800 a month they earn made it worthwhile compared with $100 or $200 a month at home. **********They come from around the globe. In the many shops advertising cut-rate telephone service, clocks display the local time in India, Ecuador and the Philippines. **********The main labor market is the old open-air central bus station, a virtual Babel at dawn when Israeli contractors hire day laborers. The workers get Saturdays off, many lining the streets to drink. **********Broken glass crunched underfoot, and the smell of urine wafted out from every alleyway. Above the street, laundry flapped from virtually every window. Occasionally an Israeli family passed through by car, gawking at the decay. **********''Of course many Israelis would prefer not having them here, but the market forces are stronger than that,'' said Mrs. Zohar of the workers' advocacy group. ''Israel was created for Jews only, and it was founded in a way that other people have no rights.

But already the bargaining has produced a torrent of leaks, threats, demands and conditions from all sides -- even from the losing Labor Party, some of whose leaders have openly hinted at their readiness to join in a government of \"national unity.\" **********Both the religious parties and the party of immigrants from Russia are demanding the housing portfolio in the new cabinet to satisfy a major demand from their separate constituencies. At least four powerful former military men have laid claim to the Defense Ministry. The current Foreign Minister, Ehud Barak of the Labor Party, has signaled that he would not mind the defense portfolio in a national-unity government, and the consrvatives Ariel Sharon, Rafael Eitan and Yitzhak Mordechai are also seeking the post. **********Mr. Sharon has hinted that if he does not receive the defense or finance posts, he might not take part in the government, and he made pointed visits in the last week to ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders to remind Mr. Netanyahu he had a  lot to do with winning the religious vote. **********Mr. Netanyahu's apparent reluctance to give either the Defense or Finance Ministries to hard-liners has been viewed as a sign of deliberate moderation. There have been hints that Mr. Netanyahu is considering Dan Meridor, a relatively moderate former Justice Minister, as Defense Minister, and Jacob Frenkel, the respected governor of the Israeli Central Bank, as Finance Minister. **********The complex bargaining stems from the fact that Mr. Netanyahu's Likud slate -- itself a coalition of three parties -- won only 32 seats in the 120-member Parliament, 29 short of a majority. That makes it necessary for him to strike bargains with at least five other parties -- three religious parties, the Russian Jewish immigrants led by Natan Sharansky, and the centrist Third Way. **********The religious parties, which won 23 seats, have been the most demanding so far. The daily Yediot Ahronot reported that they joined forces to produce an 18-page list of demands ranging from huge subsidies for housing and education for religious Jews to the Ministries of Religion, Education and Housing. At the  same time, the religious parties are fighting over which should have what portfolio. **********Mr. Sharansky's party, also keen to provide housing for its constituents, has also demanded the Housing Ministry and one other cabinet post as the price for joining the governing coalition. **********The religious agenda of the Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox parties, which includes tightening of religious control over daily life, is also drawing fire from women's groups and mainstream Likud members, as well as from Russian Jews. **********Evidently to gain more clout in the negotiations, Mr. Netanyahu has allowed hints to drop that he might consider inviting the Labor Party to join him. With  Labor's 35 seats, Mr. Netanyahu would have no need of any other partner. But for now, at least, Likud politicians see the possibility as very remote, since Labor would have more seats than Likud, and would have an effective veto over the government's policies. **********As Israel's first popularly elected Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu has the advantage over his predecessors in that his job is firm, and the only choice other politicians and parties have is either to join him or to force new elections, something few of them would want."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/29/news/kohl-wins-vote-on-unpopular-austerity-planfolo.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1996-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kohl Wins Vote on Unpopular Austerity Plan(folo)", "print_headline": "Kohl Wins Vote on Unpopular Austerity Plan(folo)", "body_text": " **********FRANKFURT\u2014                     John Schmid of the International Herald Tribune reported from Frankfurt: **********Union leaders initially supported Mr. Kohl in January when he announced a blueprint to overhaul Germany's welfare and taxes. **********To their surprise, Mr. Kohl has managed to push his reforms further than expected, even corralling the vacillating labor wing of his center-right party.

The Japanese partner, Isetan, was looking for a way to increase its profitability and the American retailer supplied Isetan with merchandising know-how, technology and access to European and American design studios and manufacturers. **********In exchange, the grateful Isetan agreed to finance the Barneys expansion in the United States, eventually shelling out roughly $400 million to finance the construction of three opulent stores -- on Madison Avenue in New York City and in Beverly Hills, Calif., and Chicago -- and lease smaller locations in premier  shopping malls from Manhasset, L.I., to Seattle. **********But as many American companies are finding out, trans-Pacific relationships are far from made in heaven. Last May, the Mitsubishi Estate Company, a Japanese real estate giant, threw Rockefeller Center into bankruptcy protection when its  partner in the trophy development, the Rockefeller family trusts, refused to pony up more than its share of a financial rescue package. **********Matsushita, a Japanese consumer electronics company, has all but severed its  ties to America's MCA, and Sony took a hit of more than $1 billion on its investment in Columbia Pictures. **********Yesterday, Barneys sought protection from Isetan in bankruptcy court. Ironically, bankruptcies were one of Barney Pressman's best sources of inventory in the days when Barneys was known as Barney's Boys Town and Mr. Pressman, the founder, sold cut-rate men's clothing. **********Like the Rockefellers and MCA, Barneys contends that its Japanese partner is  trying to change the terms of their agreement. Isetan's lawyer disagrees, and in what may be a prelude to a long war of charges and countercharges, said that Barney's, in fact, was trying to impose terms that never were agreed to. **********Isetan is being advised by Merrill Lynch & Company, while Barney's adviser is the Blackstone Group. **********Coincidentally, Isetan is managed by a team of bankers from Mitsubishi Bank,  who joined the Japanese retailer in 1993 after it got into trouble with its lenders and shareholders. Mitsubishi Bank was one of those shareholders, just as it is a large shareholder of the Mitsubishi Estate Company, which controlled Rockefeller Center. **********\"The cast of characters we dealt with at Isetan changed totally,\" said Charles W. Bunstine 2d, president and chief operating officer of Barneys. \"After 1992, we were dealing with bankers, not retailers,\" offering one reason for why  the partnership soured. **********Nonetheless, in March 1994, the new managers at Isetan agreed to the terms of Isetan's original agreements with Barney's Inc. and its subsidiaries that handled licensing, product development and other issues. Those terms, according  to Mr. Bunstine and the lawyers for Barneys, committed Isetan to restructuring all of its agreements with Barneys into an equity stake in the retailer of no more than 49 percent. **********That would involve, among other things, handing over Isetan's 50 percent stake in the Beverly Hills, Chicago and Madison Avenue stores, and renegotiating its exclusive license to use the Barneys New York name in the Far East, rights to the Barneys Japan trademark and all claims to the merchandising technology that Barneys had given it. **********\"At no point in time have we agreed that real estate is in the venture,\" said Yasuo Okamoto, a lawyer for Isetan. It may be a perception difference, but I don't know where they got that idea.\" **********Isetan, like its fellow Japanese companies that bet big on American business  trophies, had second thoughts. And no wonder. What was supposed to have been a simple $250 million real estate investment ended up costing Isetan $610 million  because it encountered problem after problem, according to Isetan. (Mr. Bunstine contended that its actual investment in real estate was between $385 million and $400 million, with the remainder going to licensing fees, royalties and other payments.) **********\"There was an idea of how much it would cost when the original agreement was  signed,\" Mr. Bunstine said. \"At Madison Avenue that happened to be dramatically  less than what the final bill was, in part because of the building that was finally selected. And the City of Beverly Hills forced Barney's and Isetan to build a parking lot underneath the store, which was not anticipated.\" **********Also, in the fall of 1991, Met Life, which had been a partner with Isetan in  the development of the floors above the Barneys store on Madison Avenue, backed  out. In November 1992, shortly after the Chicago Barneys opened, Isetan agreed to buy out Met Life's interests, and Barneys dipped into its own capital to keep construction on the Madison Avenue store going. **********Six months later, the Mitsubishi executives took over the corporate suite at  Isetan, but by December 1993, just three months after the Madison Avenue store held its celebrity-studded opening party, Isetan was forced to take out loans to finance the remainder of the building and avoid drawing on a letter of credit to finish off the Beverly Hills store, according to Mr. Bunstine. **********That helps explains why suppliers began complaining in late 1993 that Barneys, always overdue in paying its bills, was even later in its payments. With the opening of the Beverly Hills store threatened by suppliers holding up shipments, Mr. Bunstine and Bob and Gene Pressman, Barney Pressman's grandsons and the co-chief executives of the company, tried to lay the blame for the late  payments on managerial distraction, bungling and a new voicemail system. They even went so far as to publish a limited set of numbers to show that Barneys was financially healthy, a first in the secretive company's history. **********What the numbers did not show was Isetan's ever-increasing financial burden,  which made the Barneys rapid expansion something of a tight-wire act. Opening the three new stores was so stressful that Gene Pressman was angry with his brother when he mentioned potential plans for another store in San Francisco during an interview in the spring of 1994. **********But in March 1994, when the Beverly Hills store opened, Isetan could finally  heave a sigh of relief. Rent from the three stores started flowing into its coffers at the rate of roughly $2 million a month. **********Now, however, in a bit of bargaining that would probably make Barney Pressman proud, Barneys, by seeking bankruptcy protection, is trying to force Isetan to adhere to the Barneys version of their original partnership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/09/business/apple-computer-plans-to-simplify-domestic-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-11-09", "snippet": "Apple Computer Inc says that it will simplify its domestic sales structure as it tries to improve its sagging sales (S)", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "APPLE COMPUTER PLANS TO SIMPLIFY DOMESTIC SALES", "print_headline": "APPLE COMPUTER PLANS TO SIMPLIFY DOMESTIC SALES", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. said yesterday that it would simplify its domestic sales structure as it tried to improve its sagging sales.

The ad copy says: ''Scientists confirmed: Puppies don't poop or chew when asleep. Neither, for that matter, do stressed-out accountants, hard-working babies and overwrought moms and dads.'' The device, the ad claims, offers sounds to soothe all of them. **********The $2 million campaign, which runs through the middle of December, is meant to illustrate the nifty items the Sharper Image sells while sending the message that the company, which admits it had become too serious, can lighten up with the best of them. **********In defense of the Sharper Image, the age of political correctness makes advertising particularly vulnerable to misinterpretation and criticism. Martha Brown, communications manager for the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said that while the association did  not comment on specific campaigns, in general, there had been an increase in sensitivity to political correctness in advertising in recent years. ''Slighting ethnic groups and different other groups used to be O.K. and funny,'' she said. ''There is just an overall sensitivity to all of these things.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/19/world/shifting-gears-beijing-reins-in-anti-japanese-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1996-09-19", "snippet": "China's Communist Party leadership, after months of whipping up nationalist sentiment against Japan and other countries, suddenly seems to have realized that nationalism can spin out of control; Government has mobilized thousands of policemen in m...", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shifting Gears, Beijing Reins In Anti-Japanese Campaign", "print_headline": "Shifting Gears, Beijing Reins In Anti-Japanese Campaign", "body_text": " **********After months of whipping up nationalist sentiment against Japan, Britain and the United States, China's Communist Party leadership suddenly seems to have realized that nationalism could spin  out of control. **********Over the last several days, the Ministries of Public Security and State Security mobilized thousands of uniformed and plainclothes policemen in major cities to prevent demonstrations on the anniversary of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. A number of anti-Japanese dissidents who have in the past campaigned to reopen the issue of Japan's war reparations were dispatched by the police to out-of-town guest houses and others put under close watch at home. **********Students from Beijing University and other major academic centers around the country were placed under tight control after some student organizers put up posters last week calling for demonstrations, only to have them ripped down by security men. **********University authorities ''urged the faculty to persuade the students to avoid situations that might harm stability,'' one faculty member said today, and additional security details were deployed on campus to monitor bulletin boards and open meetings. **********The Japanese Embassy in Beijing's diplomatic quarter resembled an armed camp today, with more than 100 additional policemen deployed in front of and on the approaches to the compound two miles east of Tiananmen Square, where security was also tightened. **********The leadership fears, in the view of a number of Chinese, that once any demonstration begins it could lurch unpredictably, and even turn against the Government as did the 1989 demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. What started then as a stirring memorial to the former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang became a major pro-democracy uprising that paralyzed the capital for six weeks and, ultimately, was suppressed with a military assault by tanks. **********''The Government is afraid that if they let the students demonstrate against the Japanese, there might be two unemployed workers among the 10,000 demonstrators who would shout 'Food!' and 'We have to live!' and then the demonstration could be totally transformed,'' said a Chinese intellectual who asked that his name not be used. **********The mobilization followed a summer of bare-knuckled editorials in Communist Party newspapers assailing Japanese leaders for paying homage to Japan's militaristic past and, most recently, for allowing right-wing groups to raise the Japanese flag over a tiny group of disputed islands that Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls Diaoyu. **********Coming on the heels of clashes with Britain over the transfer of Hong Kong to Beijing's control, and with the United States over its support of Taiwan, the Chinese Government's verbal assault on Japan has incited strong patriotic feelings here in the Chinese capital, where spontaneous open-air lectures attracted several hundred students last week. **********As the Communist Party continues to seek a new basis for legitimacy in a post-Communist Chinese society, the official promotion of nationalistic themes, historic grievances and patriotic displays has relieved the party of its role as the most frequent target for the disaffection of millions of Chinese who are losing their jobs at bankrupt state industries, or who are struggling against poverty in interior provinces where prosperity has been slow to penetrate. **********But in the end, the Government may only be postponing the day of reckoning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/business/some-junk-bond-issues-are-outperforming-many-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1996-10-15", "snippet": "Robert Hurtado (Market Place) column, citing Wall Street professionals, says some junk bond issues may offer investors better value and more promising returns than stocks; notes guidelines for investors offered by Joesph Battipaglia, chief investm...", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some junk bond issues are outperforming many stocks.", "print_headline": "Some junk bond issues are outperforming many stocks.", "body_text": " **********EVEN with the horde of low-rated companies rushing to sell debt, some junk bond issues may offer investors better value and more promising returns than stocks, according to some Wall Street professionals who follow the securities. **********Investing in high-yield debt instruments, however, requires a practiced eye to assay whether the issuer will be capable of meeting the terms of the indenture, or legal contract between the borrowing company and the bondholders. The woeful experiences of the late 1980's, when many junk bond issuers filed for bankruptcy and countless investors paid dearly to learn why some bonds do not win investment grade ratings, should temper investors' enthusiasm for the higher yields that some of these bonds offer. **********Nevertheless, the junk bond market may provide an investment opportunity, if certain guidelines are followed. Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist of Gruntal & Company, suggests checking for these critical signposts: ***********Assess whether the issuer's cash flow is sufficient to meet the bond's interest payment schedule. ***********Scrutinize the call provisions to insure that the current price is sufficiently below that at which the issuer can redeem the bond prior to maturity. ***********Gauge the total return -- the interest rate to maturity and, where applicable, the discount price of the bond. **********''Applying these guidelines to high-yield investing can produce an enhanced return on investment while reducing risk,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. ''And because many of these junk bonds trade at a discount to the underlying assets, there exists a tangible opportunity to purchase more investment value as compared to many stocks, whose prices remain relatively high.'' **********In addition, Mr. Battipaglia pointed out, the junk bond market is currently averaging a yield of about 9.55 percent, a 300-basis-point, or three percentage points, spread over Treasury securities with a comparable maturity and 700 basis points, or seven percentage points, above the inflation rate. **********Among the junk bond issues meeting Mr. Battipaglia standards are those offered by the Calenergy Company, the Revlon Worldwide Corporation and West Point Stevens Inc. **********Calenergy, formerly the California Energy Company, was founded in 1971 and is a growing electric power company and the world's largest independent producer of geothermal power. **********Mr. Battipaglia said about 35 percent of revenues and 58 percent of operating income were expected to come after 1997 from its Asian ventures, much of which are still under construction. He said he liked Calenergy's 9.875 percent senior notes due 2003, which are priced at 103 to yield 9.26 percent. The note are callable beginning June 20, 2000, at a price of 104.94. **********The zero-coupon bond is also recommended. It converts to senior discount notes due 2004, and pays an interest rate of 10.25 percent starting Jan. 15, 1997. Callable as of Jan. 15, 1999, at a price of 105.125, the issue last traded on Friday for 103 for a yield of 9.66 percent. Both the senior and zero coupon are rated Ba-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by Standard & Poor's. **********The Revlon holding company and its consumer products operating unit have four separate junk bond issues that Mr. Battipaglia terms ''attractive'' investments, Reviewing the operating company, he finds Revlon competing for market shares against larger international rivals, including Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Avon. Although highly leveraged, Revlon is ''throwing off sufficient cash to manage debt,'' he said. **********One of the debt issues he likes is Revlon's $260 million of 9.375 percent senior notes due 2001, currently trading at a price of 102 to yield 8.82 percent, and callable in 1998. The issue is rated B-2 by Moody's and B by S.& P. **********West Point Stevens, a leading maker of bed and textile products, is benefiting from capital investments that have enabled it to become the industry's lowest-cost producer. In addition, its customers include large, high-volume merchandisers, like Wal-Mart, Kmart, J. C. Penney, Sears and Target, with the top seven accounts representing 43 percent of its $1.6 billion in 1995 sales. **********Mr. Battipaglia recommends the company's 9.375 percent senior subordinated debentures due 2005, currently priced at 101.50 to yield 9.13 percent.

Tired of chomping only on pizza and convinced she would soon graduate into poverty, Ms. Dieringer decided they all needed some quick financial muscle. A race was begun to see who could rack up the most gold credit cards before graduation. **********Talk about breezing into the winner's circle. Despite no steady income or credit history at the time, Ms. Dieringer picked up a Citibank gold Visa by listing her stock holdings -- 150 shares of RJR Nabisco and 500 shares in the Bank of Texas (both gifts from her grandfather) -- and a phony job on the application. Within a year, her perfect credit history had produced two more golden eggs -- a $10,000 Chevy Chase Visa account and an $8,000 credit line from First Card. **********Some people may be surprised that I have three gold cards, but why shouldn't I?\" Ms. Dieringer asked. \"I've had good summer jobs and saved my money. And a gold card says what it means. I've got a good credit history, and I'm good for the cash.\" **********Years ago, lenders would have left Ms. Dieringer in the dust. No more. Determined to put credit where it will be used and revolved each month, banks are recruiting the masses for their once-lofty gold-card accounts. **********\"Lenders are becoming more sophisticated in how they issue gold cards,\" said  David Robertson, president of The Nilson Report, a bank-card newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. \"It used to be that income was everything. But card holders can make a lot of money and still not pay their bills. The lenders have discovered that a consumer's good payment history is what gets his money there on time, regardless of how much cash he's bringing home.\" **********The change in policy has sparked a 90's gold rush. Through November of last year, consumers received a record 1.2 billion solicitations for gold credit cards, eclipsing the number of standard-card offers for the first time, according to Behavioral Analysis Inc., marketing consultants in Tarrytown, N.Y. **********By year-end, 20 million Americans will open gold-card accounts nearly twice the number who accepted these cards three years ago, Mr. Robertson estimated. If this rate of expansion continues, almost half of all credit card holders will have at least one gold account by 2000. **********There is one caveat to joining this stampede. Unlike gold card holders of five to eight years ago, who enjoyed a litany of free perks, today's recruits are finding fewer and fewer benefits on the average gold card. \"With more of these cards being issued, lenders have had little choice but to slice some of the perks,\" said Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a credit card tracking service in Frederick, Md. \"They're just too expensive.\" **********Visa International recently shucked its purchase security plan, which covered replacement or repair of items for 90 days. The benefit is available as an option with certain lenders. In April, AT&T Universal, one of the most popular cards, will halt its Something Extra plan -- a series of rebates that can be cashed in for free long-distance calls -- and replace it with another, unspecified program. Consumers have until August to cash in their rewards. **********While the cutbacks are annoying, they may do little to stymie demand for gold. Premium cards give credit-hungry consumers what they want: lots of easy money. Credit lines start at $5,000 and spiral beyond $50,000. Along with the cascade of cash comes a list of staples: supplemental rental car insurance, access to cash worldwide and special toll-free numbers for card-member complaints. **********If you're eager to join the gold battalion, and nab front-row service, now is a prime time to do it. To get the best deal, it helps to understand the lender's motivations. **********Your lender may not look like a warrior, but make no mistake, he's embattled. Competition is so intense among banks these days that some will do nearly anything to retain their customers. One cheap way to buy consumer loyalty is to toss out a gold card, a dual symbol of financial accomplishment and appreciation. **********After anointing you with gold, lenders hope you will behave like a regular wheeler-dealer. **********Gold card holders enjoy presenting their plastic and charge more than their standard-card counterparts -- $89 a purchase, versus $73 -- and typically carry  $587 more each month in balances, according to the American Bankers Association. **********That kind of purchasing power is tough to ignore. More and more, consumers are pressing their lenders for better deals and getting what they want. **********Christopher Flores, who owns a wireless communications company in Oakland, Calif., recently balked when his bank tried to charge a fee for his gold card. \"I called them up and told them that my other cards didn't charge a fee,\" Mr. Flores said, \"so why should they? At first they said they'd consider waiving it, and then I told them I was going to walk if they billed me for it. Funny how that was all it took.\" **********If you haven't heard from your local lender, chances are you will soon. His deal, which should arrive in the mail at least twice a week, will try to lure you with a teaser, an industry term for an interest rate below prime that's temporary but tough to resist. The rate, typically 5.9 percent, graduates considerably -- often to 18 percent or higher -- within six months. **********The gimmicks -- intended to attract large creditors and then profit from them once the rate increases -- have become financial fanfare for consumers who card-hop from one low rate to the next. The juggling strategy, endlessly frustrating to lenders, can be a financial boon for card holders, even if they carry minimal balances. **********Catherine Johnson, an art buyer in Manhattan, shucks her credit card for one  with a teaser rate and no annual fee every time she takes an expensive vacation. **********\"I'll have a bill of about $2,000 that I want to pay off over two to three months,\" she said. \"I'll drop my card that's paying 17.9 percent for one that's  charging 6.9 percent. By the time the offer expires, I would have paid the balance off.\" **********Other deals may also be enticing. To lure consumers from plain gold cards, some aggressive lenders are issuing gold cards that provide rebates on everything from long-distance phone service to cars. But these deals can be both helpful and hazardous. **********\"Our take on the gold-card market is that a consumer should be able to get a  card for free,\" said Ruth Susswein, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, Salem, Va. \"If they get a free card and collect all the benefits, fine. But if they're paying a fee to get something extra, then what they're getting had better be worth that cost.\" **********A case in point: the airline cards. Lenders have long figured that travelers  would pay for a card that allows them to rack up frequent-flier miles for every  dollar charged. The problem: It's one expensive privilege. Citibank's gold AAdvantage card, a venture with American Airlines, goes for $85 a year, while Chase Manhattan's gold British Airways card is $65. The interest rates are also  lofty, hovering at 17.6 percent on each. **********A better alternative for the occasional traveler: Old Kent Bank's Cardmiles,  which offers a free $100 certificate -- good on any airline -- for every $5,000  charged. Card holders can choose to punt the annual fee and pay 17 percent in interest or pay $38 annually in exchange for a lower variable rate, now 12 percent. **********Other deals are also worth watching. The General Motors card provides a rebate on a G.M. vehicle -- $100 for every $1,000 charged on the card, with a $7,000 maximum rebate. Spend $1,000 on the Gulf Mastercard and get $40 in Gulf gasoline or a $10 discount off your credit-card bill. One attractive deal of late: the Fisher-Price gold Visa. Spend $2,500 on that card, and you will pocket a $50 savings bond. **********While lenders argue that a small prize is better than nothing, that may not always be the case. A card's interest rate might not only swallow your prize but also begin to nibble away at your account. **********Take, for example, Chase Manhattan's Nynex card. Someone who charges $2,000 will pocket $20 in Nynex savings, but will pay about $100 in finance charges over four months if he pays a $100 minimum each month. Carrying a $2,000 balance on a card with a 12.6 percent rate, instead of the 16.6 percent regular rate on  the Chase card, would result in only $79 in finance charges. **********Jugglers would clearly make a better deal here. Transferring $10,000 to the card not only gets you $100 in Nynex savings, but also allows you to harbor a large balance at a 9 percent introductory rate. When the deal expires after one  year, it's time to head for lower interest. **********If you're carrying a dud card, don't be shy about trading it in. Robert Siegel, a partner at Andersen Worldwide, dumped a gold card because the service  was disappointing. When Mr. Siegel reported fraudulent charges, he was asked to  put it in writing. It took six weeks and two letters to get the $200 in question credited to his account. **********\"I'm spending all that money with them,\" he said. \"I expect to be treated well.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/business/l-whose-e-mail-is-it-007315.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Whose E-Mail Is It?", "print_headline": "Whose E-Mail Is It?", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Regardless of one's interpretation of \"employee rights,\" it is wrong to send  personal E-mail messages on the employer's time and equipment (\"Who's Reading Your E-Mail?

The final decisions were made this morning after weeks of heated debate within the Administration over what to do about Colombia and Mexico. **********Mexico's certification as cooperative drew immediate criticism from some members of Congress who charged that Mexico did not deserve exoneration because  it has not done enough to staunch the flood of drugs through its territory. In this election year, the Clinton Administration has been particularly sensitive to charges that it has favored Mexico because of Mexico's special status as a neighbor and equal member in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and because Washington had arranged for $12.5 billion in loans to shore up Mexico's  economy after the peso collapsed in late 1994. **********This decision also dismayed law-enforcement agencies, which felt the Clinton  Administration had rejected recommendations that Mexico at least be reprimanded because of Mexico's weak performance in combatting narcotics. **********Colombia has arrested several important drug cartel members in the last year, but officials here point to evidence of widespread corruption in the Colombian Government and its failure to reduce its role as the leading producer of processed cocaine and a leading grower of coca leaf, opium and marijuana. **********The Colombian Government angrily rejected the American action as unjust. In Bogota the Foreign Minister, Rodrigo Pardo, said, \"We consider unacceptable this interference in our internal affairs.\" **********The certifications coincided with the State Department's release today of its International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, a 598-page report on the state  of narcotics around the world in 1995, with details about what more than 140 countries have done or failed to do about drugs. The United States, the world's  foremost consumer of illegal drugs, is omitted. **********Belize and Cambodia were added this year to a list of 31 countries identified as major drug-producing or drug-transit countries. Twenty-two of these, including Mexico, were certified today as working sufficiently to solve the problem. **********But Colombia joined Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria on the list of countries judged to have failed to cooperate in the fight against narcotics. **********Lebanon, Paraguay and Pakistan also failed certification but were only warned, under a provision that lets the President waive the penalties if he decides that doing so is in the \"vital national interests\" of the United States. Colombia received such a warning last year. **********\"Some countries may find the results hard to swallow,\" said Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, \"but we believe we cannot solve problems without first being honest about them and identifying them.\" **********By punishing Colombia, the Administration registered its displeasure with President Ernesto Samper, who is accused of knowingly taking millions in campaign contributions from the Cali cocaine cartel. **********President Clinton's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, denied that the decertification was intended to force the Colombian President out of office. Mr. McCurry noted that \"President Samper is under pressure already\" from investigations at home. **********But Mr. McCurry said President Clinton was aware that \"this decision will likely have some impact on the public debate in Colombia.\" **********The certification statement acknowledged that Colombia did make some progress last year, notably the capture or surrender of six of the seven leaders of the Cali drug syndicate, one of whom later escaped. It also praised the national police of Colombia for its ambitious cocaine crop eradication program. But it said that the Government had failed to make progress in other areas and had not  increased the penalties for drug trafficking or taken steps to protect the confidentiality of information provided by the United States. **********Colombia will not suffer immediate hardship even though its flourishing economy benefits in part from drug profits. Robert S. Gelbard, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics, said that the United States assistance to Bogota consists almost entirely of counter-narcotics programs, which will continue if the Colombians want them. **********But American business executives investing in Colombia will no longer qualify for credits from the Import-Export Bank or the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The United States will also vote against any loans requested by Colombia from a half-dozen development banks, including the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, though this may not prevent such loans. **********Mr. McCurry said the decertification of Colombia could affect up to $750 million to $1 billion in Export-Import Bank commitments and $50 million in loans and $540 million in insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. **********President Clinton also retains an option to apply trade sanctions, which could close United States markets to imports of coffee, flowers and other legitimate Colombian goods, Mr. Gelbard said. **********As the first President to decertify Colombia, President Clinton scored points with Congress. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, had prepared legislation to override any waiver given Colombia this year. **********His spokesman Marc Thiessen said Senator Helms was extremely pleased that President Clinton had sent \"a strong message to Mr. Samper that his collusion with drug traffickers is unacceptable.\" If President Samper resigned, Senator Helms said, the government that replaced him in Colombia should be given a clean slate. **********By contrast, Clinton Administration officials described President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico as honest and sincere in trying to curb his country's involvement in narcotics, despite evidence of a widening role of Mexico in the production and sale of drugs and corruption in Mexican law enforcement. **********Mr. Gelbard said an important difference between Colombia and Mexico was that President Zedillo's Government was cooperating while President Samper's had tried to undermine efforts to stop narcotics. \"The test of the law is whether there is cooperation on the part of the government,\" Mr. Gelbard said. **********But Mexico's certification was criticized by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who said Mexico should have been given the same warning  that Colombia received last year. **********Mr. Thiessen said Senator Helms, too, felt \"the Administration made a mistake\" with Mexico and that he and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, would introduce a resolution in the Senate demanding that Mexico be decertified. **********Administration officials denied today that the certification process was influenced by political considerations. \"We look at what happens as a country either cooperates or fails to cooperate in the fight on drugs,\" Mr. McCurry said. **********The State Department's report on international narcotics sometimes sounded implicitly more tolerant of Colombia and critical of Mexico than the President's certification implied. It said that \"the two countries that have struggled the longest against the drug trade -- Mexico and Colombia -- are also those that have had to face the drug corruption that has crept into the uppermost reaches of Government.\" **********The report described Mexico as \"the principal transit route for cocaine entering the United States as well as a major source country for heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana.\" It also said that \"drug traffickers used their vast wealth to corrupt police and judicial officials as well as project their influence into the political sector, as recent Mexican investigations have revealed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/world/bitter-burden-on-sarajevo-invalids-of-war.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-08-01", "snippet": "Wounded and paralyzed residents of Sarajevo are struggling to restore tradition of solidarity and pluralism that existed before conflict; say they are being treated as outcasts, left in institutions, or at home without help, as city adjusts to pea...", "word_count": 933, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bitter Burden on Sarajevo: Invalids of War", "print_headline": "Bitter Burden on Sarajevo: Invalids of War", "body_text": " **********Through four years of war, the people of Sarajevo prided themselves on their solidarity. They picked up their dead from the streets, they embraced the wounded, they grieved in cathedrals, churches and mosques. **********But now, as the city adjusts to peace, that bond has worn thin, say some who were left gravely wounded or paralyzed by the war. For the most part they are treated like outcasts, left in institutions or at home without help. **********Faruk Sabanovic, 21, who was felled by a sniper on a street in central Sarajevo last year, must now use a wheelchair. From his seat, he is trying to jolt his city into understanding that it should live up to its reputation as a pluralistic society by accepting rather than excluding those permanently afflicted by the war. **********''It's strange,'' said Mr. Sabanovic, a paraplegic who slaloms along the rutted sidewalks or down the streets, going about his business in his Quickie, a state-of-the-art, lightweight wheelchair. ''I was walking normally like anybody else. A few days after I was wounded, I was meeting the same people, and they treated me differently. There's something in people's minds that makes them think because we are in wheelchairs, we are weird.'' **********A one-year conscript in the Bosnian Army who was a civilian when he was shot, Mr. Sabanovic, a former physics student, says he feels anything but weird. Life in a wheelchair can be good, he says with a soft smile. **********The shooting of Mr. Sabanovic was more dramatic than others. It was filmed by a cameraman who also captured on video a nearby United Nations peacekeeper doing nothing to help as Mr. Sabanovic lay limp on the ground. His case caught the attention of the International Rescue Committee, an American organization, which helped him seek treatment in the United States. **********Mr. Sabanovic was told by doctors in New York that he would not be able to walk again, but he received treatment at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in New Jersey, where the actor Christopher Reeve was treated after an equestrian accident left him a quadriplegic. Since then Mr. Sabanovic has become a one-person advocacy campaign for people disabled by the war. **********Nobody is quite sure how many paraplegics there are in Bosnia as a result of the war. The Rescue Committee estimates there are about 250 paraplegics, and more than a thousand people in wheelchairs in Sarajevo. Many more are scattered around Bosnia. **********About one-quarter of Sarajevo's population was wounded in the war, said Mark Bartolini, the project director of the committee here. Most have recovered and are able to resume the lives they led before. **********But those who have not recovered have received scant attention from the Government. Before the war, people like Mr. Sabanovic were kept in hospitals or even warehoused in mental institutions, a common practice in Central Europe under Communism. Attempts to break down such attitudes in the medical profession, and in society, now that there are many more paraplegics have been slow, Mr. Bartolini said. **********Financial support is meager. Wounded war veterans, who receive the most generous benefits, get a monthly stipend of about $50. They are also supposed to be provided with housing. Mr. Sabanovic, because of the year he operated a mine sweeper in the army, was awarded an apartment three months ago, but he cannot live there because it needs extensive reconstruction, including a ramp so he can get in the front door. For now, he remains in a four-bed room at the paraplegic center at Kosevo Hospital. **********Civilians disabled during the war receive much less than veterans. **********Sefika Skorupan, whose spinal cord was injured three years ago by shrapnel and was back in the paraplegic center for treatment, said she was entitled to $10 a month, a can of meat and a kilo of sugar. **********Mrs. Skorupan, 29, who keeps her upper body in shape by lifting weights, said she was luckier than most: her husband was very supportive. But other disabled women she talks to on an informal telephone network face life alone. ''One woman has not been down in the city since 1992,'' she said. ''She lives up on a hill, doesn't have a car, and her husband ignores her.'' **********Mr. Sabanovic said the last thing people in wheelchairs need is pity -- like that offered by the Government War Veterans Association, which recently held a lunch, took pictures and offered platitudes. ''Nobody cares about the problem, and like any other government, they are trying to avoid support,'' said Mr. Sabanovic. **********So he persuaded the central post office that a wheelchair ramp was needed. With $10,000 from the Rescue Committee, the ramp, Sarajevo's first wheelchair access, was completed this month. **********He has applied for funds to install wheelchair ramps as part of the reconstruction of the university's school of physics, where he was a student, and he plans to campaign for similar access as other buildings are patched together. **********His next step will be to open an information center to teach paraplegics and others in wheelchairs concepts of self-reliance that are considered basic in the West. These include how to change jobs to a career that is compatible to life in a wheelchair. Mr. Sabanovic is trying to decide, for example, whether to go back to physics, concentrate on his love of music and film, or study social services. **********In the New Jersey recuperation center, Mr. Sabanovic said, he learned that life in a wheelchair offers zest and promise. ''That's what I'm trying to make here,'' he said, spinning around so that the inscription on the back of his T-shirt became clear. It read: ''You may say I'm a dreamer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/09/business/wave-casinos-hits-mississippi-s-gulf-coast-las-vegas-operators-hope-build-biloxi.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1996-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Wave of Casinos Hits Mississippi's Gulf Coast;Las Vegas Operators Hope to Build Biloxi Into a Top-Tier Gambling Port", "print_headline": "A Wave of Casinos Hits Mississippi's Gulf Coast;Las Vegas Operators Hope to Build Biloxi Into a Top-Tier Gambling Port", "body_text": " **********Here in the South's Monte Carlo among the magnolias, casino companies are transforming the Mississippi coast from a strip of decaying motels and dilapidated mansions into the nation's hottest new gambling hub. **********Industry executives come to check out their rivals' projects, bump into each  other and then waste no time in augmenting their already ambitious plans. Four 1,000-room hotels are now being built, and a fifth is planned. Mirage Resorts, vowing to outdo all comers, announced a $200 million, 1,000-room hotel and casino last fall, raised the stakes in April to $325 million and 1,200 rooms and then upped them again in May to $475 million and 1,800 rooms -- more than any hotel in Atlantic City can boast. **********Mirage says the extravagance that succeeded in Las Vegas can triumph again in Biloxi. \"We have never gone into a market and not overbuilt,\" boasted Barry Shier, chief executive of the company's Golden Nugget division. In a golf shirt  and gold watch, he leaned over a model of his Biloxi project -- named Beau Rivage, or beautiful shore -- set up in a room at a rival Grand Casino hotel here that is also expanding. \"Here are the live oaks,\" he said, pointing. \"And we'll have magnolias, dogwoods and azaleas. Formal gardens and fountains.\" **********And that's just the landscaping indoors. **********All this and much more is coming to the steamy coastline of a city with no scheduled jet service and whose sleepy downtown still relies mostly on stop signs and blinking red lights to control traffic. **********As a backlash slows the spread of legalized gambling, the casino industry is  throwing most of its resources into states that welcome it. And Mississippi, desperate and poor, sees the business as its economic savior. It has enacted some of the most liberal gambling laws, with unlimited licenses for dockside casinos, this side of Reno. **********The casino industry is also drawn by the state's beaches and year-round golfing and fishing. \"There are only three viable gaming markets,\" said Sarah Ralston, a spokeswoman for Circus Circus Enterprises, a pioneer in turning casino hotels into family resorts. \"Las Vegas, of course. Atlantic City, of course. And now, the Gulf Coast of Mississippi.\" **********The casino companies hail the Mississippi gambling boom -- extending upstate  to Tunica County, an easy drive from Memphis -- as a testament to free markets.  Politicians here, they say, have avoided the quarrels and meddling that slowed Atlantic City's growth and helped kill plans for the world's largest casino in New Orleans. **********Like free markets everywhere, Mississippi's has winners and losers. After casino licenses were first awarded in 1992, major companies like Mirage stood by as smaller, often local operators made their mistakes. But now they are rushing in. **********Grand Casinos Inc. is expanding its two casino hotels in Biloxi and nearby Gulfport to 1,000 rooms each. Imperial Palace, which owns a major Las Vegas resort, is building another 1,000-roomer here with a 30-story tower, the tallest in the state. Circus Circus wants to be next with an equally tall 1,400-room hotel, and Boyd Gaming is noisily sniffing around. **********The risks are as visible here as the Gold Shore casino sign that towers over  a vacant, weed-grown parking lot. Steel-pipe moorings jut purposelessly out of the sea, the gambling boat they once held nowhere to be seen. **********The Gold Shore wasn't the only failure. The new Golden Nugget casino will be  on the site of the Biloxi Belle, which promised \"Old South charm and elegance\" but delivered a New South bankruptcy filing. The Palace Casino nearby is still operating but has sought bankruptcy protection. Among its handicaps: no hotel and not enough capital to compete with the big boys. \"Just like Vegas, what was  big one day is now the smaller property today,\" said Howard J. Reinhardt, the Palace Casino's general manager. **********James J. Murren, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, says that only about half the coast's current and planned casinos will survive. \"If you don't have the right location or you're poorly capitalized you don't have a chance,\" he said. He cited blunders by even the larger companies: Imperial Palace's poorly chosen site away from the gulf beaches (\"Blow it up\") and Mirage's investment of too much too soon (\"Overkill\"). **********But Mr. Murren counts on Mirage to generate about half of its $350 million in annual Biloxi revenue by drawing new visitors to the casino. **********Even though analysts say the Gulf Coast will soon become a $1 billion gambling market -- nearly half the total for the whole state -- Las Vegas, with  $5.7 billion, and Atlantic City, with $3.7 billion, will remain far larger. **********Not everybody here celebrated Mississippi's building boom. Police officials and social workers say that on the coast, as elsewhere, the growth of gambling has led to higher rates of divorce, crime and personal bankruptcy. Others in Biloxi hate to see their sleepy town bristling with hotel towers and crowded with traffic. **********Casino companies answer in economic terms. While the older, smaller casinos drew heavily on locals who gambled money that might have gone to other businesses in the area, the larger casinos want to entice overnight visitors from out of state. **********Casino executives like Mr. Shier of Mirage say they can succeed where others  have failed because their companies have more experience and money. Under Steven A. Wynn, its chief executive, Mirage led Las Vegas's comeback by building some of the world's largest hotels, featuring pirates battling on full-sized ships and a volcano with scheduled eruptions. Now, Mr. Wynn wants to do the same for Atlantic City, with a $2.5 billion plan, and for the Gulf Coast, where he plans  to open in early 1998. **********For now, out-of-state gamblers have to fly to New Orleans or Mobile, Ala., and hop a commuter plane or rent a car to reach Biloxi. Already, local officials are negotiating with the airlines to offer direct service. Casino executives predict the airlines will want to meet the demand as one resort after another opens with a burst of advertising throughout the South. \"There's no reason it couldn't become a national destination,\" said Denis O'Brien, regional manager for Grand Casinos Inc. \"I even find people from California who can pronounce Biloxi.\" **********Westerners, however, can more easily pronounce -- and visit -- Las Vegas. The Mississippi coast must content itself by drawing gamblers from the rest of the Southeast, parts of Texas and, especially in winter, the Middle West. With all the new construction, said Wade Ragas, director of the University of New Orleans Real Estate Research Center, \"There's not enough population within a day's drive to support the gambling market.\" **********Marketers must also persuade visitors that the coast offers more than cramped, cheesy riverboats. State laws have been loosened to the point where, while casinos still must float, they don't ever have to move. The newest are just vast boxes built on flotillas of barges welded together and permanently moored. At the Grand Casino in Biloxi, doors, passages and entryways from the hotel and parking lot to the casino all but erase the shoreline. **********\"That probably is our biggest challenge: making people understand that these  are casinos you would see in Las Vegas,\" Mr. O'Brien said.  \"You don't know you're on the water.\" **********Grand Casinos has prospered by concentrating its gambling operations on Indian reservations and new markets like the Mississippi coast, where it says its investments will be about as great as those of Mirage. **********Along 26 miles of beaches, the casino count so far includes eight in Biloxi,  two in Gulfport and two in the Bay St. Louis area. There is no doubt about their economic impact. The average house price rose to nearly $90,000 in 1994 from $68,500 in 1992. Total employment on the coast soared 17 percent, to 159,270 jobs at the end of 1995 from 136,250 three years earlier. **********Billboards for the Mississippi casinos begin just outside the New Orleans airport 98 miles away. New Orleans still has riverboat gambling, but construction of the world's largest casino there ceased with a bankruptcy filing in November, due in part to Mississippi competition. Michele N. Moore, a top aide to Mayor Marc Morial of New Orleans, derides the Mississippi coast as \"basically a dressed-up Howard Johnson's.\" **********Well, not exactly. The Imperial Palace Mississippi will look like what might  result if the Ming empire had extended to Las Vegas. A 1,018-room, 30-story hotel tower, the tallest building in the state, will feature Oriental motifs like gabled blue-tile roofs and calligraphic sign lettering. **********Mike Kelly, the construction manager, ducked under dangling cables as he muttered about the greater cost of building a casino on water. Even at 6 P.M., the clatter of construction continued. Mr. Kelly, proud of his reputation for making everyone scurry and sweat, said it was not even the middle of the second  shift. **********Though some Biloxi churches still scorn their new neighbors, the region's moral qualms appear to be receding. Even churches run bus trips. Margaret Murphy, playing the nickel slots at Grand Casino, came on one of two 44-passenger buses filled with retirees from St. Dominic's Church in Mobile. **********For $12, she gets the bus ride, a 77-item lunch buffet and the show. \"You can't beat that for a whole day out,\" Mrs. Murphy said. In the end, though, the  casino almost always comes out ahead. Mrs. Murphy usually bets until she's lost  $50, switching to the nickel machines from the quarter machines as her cash runs low. **********Grand Casino executives boast of conventions scheduled as far ahead as 2003.  Sybil Casso, a volunteer at Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, noted as she gathered her friends in the lobby that the Mississippi coast was host to the Southeastern Hospital Conference for the first time. **********A resident of Baton Rouge, La., who owns a Gulfport condominium, Ms. Casso has transferred her loyalties here. She helped steer the convention to the coast and boasts of seeing \"Stagestruck,\" billed as \"An Award-Winning Salute to  Broadway,\" at the Grand Casino theater in Biloxi 55 times. **********Somehow, Ms. Casso said, Mississippi has mastered the casino business while her home state couldn't. \"It's politics as usual in Louisiana,\" she said. \"It's  a shame. In Mississippi, they have done it right.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/01/world/arabs-and-israelis-arriving-for-emergency-meeting.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1996-10-01", "snippet": "Middle Eastern leaders begin arriving in Washington for emergency meeting called by Pres Clinton; photos; Israel indicates wilingness to negotiate some of issues of greatest concern to Palestinians, including West Bank troop withdrawals and liftin...", "word_count": 1056, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arabs and Israelis Arriving for Emergency Meeting", "print_headline": "Arabs and Israelis Arriving for Emergency Meeting", "body_text": " **********Middle Eastern leaders began to converge on Washington this evening for an emergency meeting called by President Clinton, as Israel indicated it was prepared to negotiate on some of the issues of greatest concern to the Palestinians, including troop withdrawal in the West Bank and lifting  travel restrictions on Palestinians. **********American officials say that they expect ''no miracles'' from the meetings, but that they want to avoid further deterioration in the Middle East peace effort, stop a descent into violence and find a way for the Israelis and Palestinians to continue their formal peace talks over the deep issues of territory and psychology that divide them. **********''We want this meeting to get the two sides to renew their involvement and their commitments and not allow the violence to derail them,'' a senior American official said. **********Because Mr. Clinton has devoted much time and energy to the Middle East, and was criticized for throwing American support too openly to former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,  who lost to Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel's election, the meeting carries significant risks for Mr. Clinton in his reelection campaign. **********Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, who arrived tonight, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, are to meet separately on Tuesday with President Clinton, and then may meet together later. **********King Hussein of Jordan will also take part in the discussions Tuesday and Wednesday, which are intended to get the Israelis and Palestinians talking seriously again about how to live together without bloodshed. **********President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt declined Mr. Clinton's invitation, preferring to stay home, skeptical about Mr. Netanyahu's intentions and concerned about a meeting that had no clear agenda set in advance. Mr. Mubarak's sent his Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, to represent him. **********Some Egyptian officials also cautioned Mr. Arafat about coming to Washington without clearer promises. But in the end Mr. Arafat could not refuse an invitation by the Americans that could, to some degree, secure his own future. **********Mr. Arafat, speaking in Luxembourg today before heading to Washington, said, ''I am not asking for the moon, I am only asking for what had been agreed upon and what had been signed to be implemented accurately and honestly.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu told reporters on the plane to Washington that he would propose that the meeting here be followed by ''continuous negotiations'' to settle some of the main issues. **********These include the redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron and how to assure the security of the Israelis who live there; an easing of the closing of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which prevents many Palestinians from traveling between the territories or crossing into Israel to work; and other security questions, including an airport planned for the Gaza Strip. **********Many of these questions had already been addressed by the previous Israeli Government in its agreements with the Palestinians. **********Before the recent violence, Mr. Netanyahu had promised President Clinton that he would withdraw Israeli troops from Hebron after the Jewish High Holy Days, according to a senior American official. The Americans want to hold him to that promise, understanding that it might require more guarantees from Mr. Arafat about the security of the settlers there. Even under the previous accord on Hebron, an Israeli garrison would remain to guard them. **********Today, too, Mr. Netanyahu said he wanted firm assurances from Mr. Arafat to refrain from the use of violence. If such a pledge of non-violence is broken, Mr. Netanyahu told reporters on his airplane to Washington, Israel would feel free to break its own pledges. And he repeated that the second entrance to an archeological tunnel running alongside Al Aksa Mosque would stay open and not be a subject for negotiation. **********It was his decision to open the tunnel that sparked the rioting last week between Palestinians and Israelis that left 70 people dead. **********Mr. Arafat had expressed reluctance about attending the sessions in Washington and had been undecided as late as Sunday. The decision for the meeting was made after long-distance diplomacy by the United States failed to have much impact on the violence that gripped Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for three days. **********A calm of sorts has returned, but there are no guarantees that it will last, whether the talks in Washington are successful or not. **********''I don't know what the result of the summit will be,'' said the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, trying to lower expectations. ''None of us do.'' **********A failure here might boost the prospects of the Republican Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, who has supported the meeting. **********Today, however, he convened his foreign-policy advisers to criticize the Clinton record on the Middle East. In a statement, Mr. Dole said the United States must demand an ''unconditional end to the violence.'' But he added: ''The Government of Prime Minister Netanyahu deserves the full support of the United States at this moment of crisis. **********''Israel has taken great risks for peace, including allowing the arming of 30,000 Palestinian police, who have used their weapons to fire on Israelis. Our friend Israel must not be asked to make concessions as a means of restoring order.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu's proposals were ''in general very positive,'' a senior American official said, suggesting that a commitment to later talks between the two sides on carrying out promises already made under the Oslo accords would be concrete enough to insure the success of the Washington meeting. The official said that a pledge on non-violence was a reasonable idea, but he saw little way to make it binding. **********The Americans also hope that the two sides will agree to a framework for negotiations on the harder issues of the so-called ''final status talks'' on Jerusalem. The tunnel entrance, opening into the Muslim quarter, was a volatile issue because it seemed to the Palestinians that the Israelis were intent on aggressively asserting sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. **********Diplomatically, there are advantages to a Washington site, officials said. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat will benefit from a neutral location, while Mr. Clinton's own needs in a campaign season can provide them political cover for compromise. **********American and Israeli officials expressed disappointment that Mr. Mubarak chose not to come, saying he can play an important stabilizing role and has great influence with all parties, including the Syrians. **********But Mr. Mubarak is angry with Mr. Netanyahu, officials said, feeling that the Israeli's promises to him of more rapid progress with the Palestinians have not been kept."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/worldbusiness/IHT-new-york-notebook-the-value-of-silence.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Malkin", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "The legend of the broadcaster Edward R.

The goal is to save $1.7 billion a year in overlapping costs. **********That is great news for stockholders of the Chase Manhattan Corporation. But bank executives acknowledge that many customers are skeptical that this big merger will benefit them. **********''This has been a populist country since before we were born that is afraid of large institutions,'' said Michael Hegarty, the Chase vice chairman in charge of its New York branches. The bank is trying to carve out an advertising image, backed by real technological prowess of an institution big enough to offer any financial product and savvy enough to get the right offering to the right customer. **********''We need to counter that by making the customers feel like the bank knows them, that we are their ally as they navigate through life,'' Mr. Hegarty said. **********As the merger becomes a reality on the streets of New York and surrounding suburbs, the bank's first challenge is to reconcile its parents' disparate images. **********''Our focus groups said the Chemical personality was down to earth, pragmatic, inclusive and very friendly,'' explained Susan Schoon, a senior vice president for marketing. ''Chase was seen as solid, having been around for a long time, with high name recognition, quality and upscale.'' **********Indeed in recent years, Chase's advertising, using Benny Goodman music, has sought more affluent clients. Chemical has emphasized a broader appeal. **********The new Chase wants to combine the mass market draw of Chemical with the more solid image of Chase. Above all, the new Chase wants to be seen as a credible source for a dizzying array of financial services, everything from customized banking to insurance and investments. And to deliver that promise, the bank is building a highly sophisticated computer system designed to offer particular services to particular groups of customers. **********''Technology is enabling us to offer a customer one-stop shopping,'' Mr. Hegarty said. This may well be reminiscent of the financial supermarkets that were trendy a decade ago.  ''Shearson and American Express had the right idea,'' he said, ''but it didn't work because they didn't have the technology to support it.'' **********To promote its image as a big bank with a personalized approach, Chase will introduce a new advertising campaign today emphasizing the variety of products and services that are available. Its new slogan is ''The right relationship is everything.'' **********''There are so many choices, it is becoming overwhelming,'' Lee Wilson, Chase's director of marketing, said. **********But its rivals in local banking are not standing still. **********''As there are fewer competitors, the competition becomes much more intense,'' said Richard D. Field, executive vice president of the Bank of New York. **********And small banks, like Greater New York Savings Bank, are counting on their nimbleness to allow them to appeal more directly to consumers. ''We have people in each of our branches,'' said Gerard C. Keegan, chairman of the savings bank, ''who can help people pick out the products they need.'' **********Indeed, it is easy for Chase to promise personal service, but it is tougher to deliver, especially for an organization that will be called on to handle 190 million teller transactions and answer 100 million phone calls a year. For example, Chase customers will have to wait another two years before a person who changes an address for a Chase credit card will find the address also changed on his mortgage, checking and investment accounts. **********But the new approach can already be seen in the way Chase told customers about how their accounts would change in the merger. In 1991, when Chemical acquired Manufacturers Hanover, it simply sent all customers the same letter with a copy of a brochure describing the changes and the new accounts. This time, Chase -- which will be dominated by Chemical executives -- sent its three million customers one of 300 computer form letters that described precisely what would happen to their accounts. **********''Last time we had thousands of phone calls asking: 'What does this mean to me?' '' Mr. Wilson said. ''We were prepared for that again, but this time there were very few calls.'' **********Chase argues that its heft will allow it to invest in technology that its competitors just cannot afford. It will spend $100 million to give every teller and banker a new high powered personal computer, allowing virtually every transaction to be entered into the computer system as it occurs. Now, 70 percent of teller transactions are just written on checks or paper deposit slips and entered into the computer at the end of the day. **********While that will enhance overall customer service by allowing the bank to stay open longer and provide more detailed information, it will also mean that tellers will have instant information about which customers the bank wants to treat particularly well and which it can handle more routinely. **********''If a customer complains about the $3 fee for a money order, and his accounts are very profitable, the banker can remove the fee,'' Mr. Stack said. ''If they aren't so profitable, they have to pay the fee.'' **********James M. McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group, an adviser to Chase and other banks, explained, ''Chase has better management information systems to make pricing and marketing decisions than most big banks.'' **********This merger is occurring a lot faster than the one that combined Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover in 1991. The branch conversion this weekend was almost exactly one year after the merger was announced and only five months after the deal was formally completed. The last Manufacturers Hanover branch did not disappear until nearly two years after the deal was struck. **********The bank learned from its experience. For example, bankers wrote a series of huge manuals then to cover every possible situation a teller or branch officer might face. Another group of training experts had to translate those tomes into understandable English so employees could interpret them. This time, the two groups worked together, and the instructions covered only the most common 20 percent of transactions. For everything else, the branch staff simply calls a ''backstop desk'' for the answers. Training time, consequently, has been slashed. **********Still, the two banks have a ways to go before they are fully combined. Indeed, the old Chase and Chemical computer systems are still running independently, reprogrammed to handle new accounts and to exchange information. All of the accounts will not be moved over to what had been the Chemical system until next spring. **********''You can do a merger in a big bang,'' Mr. Hegarty said. ''But big bangs are scary. We call our approach 'rolling thunder' to make changes incrementally.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/03/business/company-briefs-017515.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********FIRST AMERICAN CORP., Nashville, a banking company, revised its July agreement to acquire First City Bancorp.

While the bonds' sellers declared the sale a rousing success, others said that the premium would be costly to the county. **********The bonds are being issued to pay holders of Orange County notes and vendors who have been forced to wait to get repaid after the county's bankruptcy filing  nearly 18 months ago. The filing, the biggest municipal bankruptcy in history, came after the county suffered a $1.6 billion loss after making risky investments with municipal funds. **********\"Over all, its's been a huge success,\" Michael D. McCarthy, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said of yesterday's bond sale. \"The county is very happy with the results and is thrilled to be headed out of bankruptcy.\" The deal was managed by Goldman and by A. G. Edwards & Sons. **********Still, the market extracted its price. \"I think that the premium is large for an insured bond,\" said William Fitzgerald, a portfolio manager at John Nuveen &  Company, a mutual fund company. \"Clearly the market is penalizing the county for its past transgressions and for the risk that the county will act without integrity in the future.\" **********Part of the attractiveness of the bonds, in fact, was that they offered buyers a rare combination of insurance and high returns. The sale was a sign not only of market forgiveness, but also of the strides Orange County has taken in straightening out its tangled finances. **********\"It's not only the insurance but the perception that Orange County is a sound county, even with its problems,\" said Richard Visconti, a trader with W. R. Lazard Laidlaw & Mead Inc., a New York municipal bond broker. \"And basically people see this as an opportunity to pick up bonds at a better level than they normally would have.\" **********The insurance for the debt securities -- $756 million in tax-free bonds and $123 million in taxable bonds -- was provided by MBIA Inc. The insurance cost the county about $29 million. It has been estimated by some analysts that the extra yield on the bonds and the insurance would cost the county $40 million to  $45 million extra to bring the deal to market. **********The bonds also drew interest because they were backed by a unique repayment structure. Sales taxes and motor-vehicle license fees will be diverted from Orange County and given to the State of California for distribution to the bondholders. The funds will be automatically intercepted by the state and cannot be touched by the county. **********Orange County plans to emerge from bankruptcy on Wednesday, after using proceeds from yesterday's sale to pay off its remaining creditors. The bankruptcy-related debt was cut in half -- to about $800 million -- by a decision of many municipalities in Orange County to forgive repayment on money they lost in the county investment pool. **********Chris Varelas, a Salomon Brothers banker who serves as financial adviser to the county, said yesterday that county officials were pleased with the bond sale. **********\"The prices reflect the fact that we have an overall solution to the bankruptcy,\" Mr. Varelas said. \"Of course, there were buyers who refused to participate. But we knew that certain buyers wouldn't partake of this issue. But the county was fortunate that there were enough investors who realized the strength of the county's credit and the way that this deal was structured to protect Orange County bondholders from any future fiscal stress.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/15/world/prickly-creatures-but-they-pierce-english-hearts.html": {"writer_name": "Sarah Lyall", "pub_date": "1996-08-15", "snippet": "Article on British love of hedgehogs, England's only spinal mammal that has always figured affectionately in its literature; photo (M)", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prickly Creatures, but They Pierce English Hearts", "print_headline": "Prickly Creatures, but They Pierce English Hearts", "body_text": " **********Mavis Righini had always liked tortoises, but when she was suddenly entrusted with five sickly baby hedgehogs a decade ago, she found what may well be her life's calling. **********''The little runt couldn't go back to the wild,'' Mrs. Righini, a teacher's aide, said of the smallest hedgehog, called a hoglet, who was pink with a wash of delicate white prickles when it arrived. ''She was just a poor little scrap. I wanted to help her the best I could.'' **********So the hoglet, Prickles, stayed with Mrs. Righini, whose impromptu hedgehog rescue operation eventually grew into a full-fledged hospital for sick, injured, orphaned or distressed hedgehogs. **********Now about 40 animals at a time live in the modest home in South London she also shares with her husband, a shy postal worker who has just recently found himself able to physically touch the hedgehogs. (''I like all animals,'' he explained, ''in the abstract.'') **********What is interesting about Mrs. Righini is not that she built a special heated annex for her hedgehogs, or that she spends $15 a day on hedgehog food, or even that her refusal to leave the hedgehogs alone for the night has meant no vacations for eight years. **********What is interesting is how unexceptional a figure she is in Britain. If the English are a people who love animals more than they love children, as many residents suspect, then they may well love hedgehogs best of all. **********''Sometimes I think, 'You've got half the world starving, and here I am, messing around with hedgehogs,' '' said Ron May, an engineer, who runs a hedgehog-caring cooperative with a group of neighbors in Essex. He is one of some 500 volunteer carers who have registered with the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and are willing, like Mrs. Righini, to take on the sick and stunned at a moment's notice. **********The hedgehogs suffer from all manner of problems. Some have ear infections, skin conditions or broken legs that need to be amputated by the vet. Others are blind. Others have been experiencing behavioral problems -- careering down the middle of the road in broad daylight, for instance. And some, suffering from concussions or brain damage, walk around in counterclockwise circles or fall onto their backs, unable to get up. A large proportion can make it back to the wild. **********Because of their secretive nocturnal behavior, it is extremely hard to get an accurate national hedgehog count. The number could vary from one million to 3.5 million, said Dr. Pat Morris, a senior lecturer in zoology at the Royal Holloway College. **********Dr. Morris, who has been studying hedgehogs for more than 30 years, is proud of his reputation as Britain's leading hedgehog expert, in spite of some snickering in zoological circles. **********''They're sort of joke animals,'' he said ruefully. ''Things that are cute are not the sort of things from which great scientific reputations are generally made.'' **********Hedgehogs, known for being consumers of unwanted garden grubs, are the only indigenous spiny mammal in Britain and have always figured affectionately in its literature. **********In ''Alice in Wonderland,'' Alice uses a rolled-up hedgehog for a croquet ball. In Beatrix Potter's ''Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle,'' the heroine is a sweet, elderly hedgehog who works as a washerwoman. **********And in his biography of the poet Philip Larkin, Andrew Motion describes how the famously bad-tempered poet had an uncharacteristic  affection for the hedgehog who lived in his garden. (Sadly, he ended up running it over with his lawn mower, and killing it.) **********Enthusiasts say people love hedgehogs because they are so cute, with their moist little noses and their fetching resemblance to a tall turtle, if the turtle were covered with little nail-scrubbing bristles and kept its head mostly inside its shell. **********Also, they hold a soft spot in their hearts for nocturnal creatures who are most likely to be seen in a deceased form, squashed on the side of the road. Rolling into a ball, as hedgehogs do when threatened, is not a good defense against cars. **********''They're wonderful creatures, even though they're not overblessed with intelligence,'' said Anne Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the British Hedgehog Preservation Society. ''You can't really teach them to do anything, but if you put out food at the same time each night, they can work out where the food is.'' **********But she emphasized that hedgehogs are wild animals, whose mystique comes in part from their habit of appearing only at night and only in the garden's shadows. The last thing she wants people to do, she said, is take hedgehogs home, give them names like Horace or Hyacinth, and assume they'll curl up happily at the foot of the bed each night. **********''They're pretty prickly,'' she said. ''Their coat is like a bed of nails.'' **********Summer is particularly busy for  hedgehog hospitals, which see a greater number suffering from dehydration or garden accidents. **********''Often, we have to treat the people as well as the hedgehogs,'' said Sue Stocker, a founder of St. Tiggy-Winkle's Animal Hospital in Buckinghamshire, which treats some 4,000 hedgehogs a year. ''They're in shock, because one of the worst things that can happen is they put a fork in their compost heap and come up with a hedgehog on the end of it.'' **********But it is during the winter, a season hedgehogs usually sleep right through, that one of the more interesting quandaries in hedgehog care comes up. Should the hogs -- still too weak to be released into the wild -- be taught to hibernate indoors under blankets, or should they be encouraged to stay up all winter? **********''As far as hibernating goes, some do, and some don't,'' Mrs. Righini  said.

Where palm trees had shielded against the ferocious heat of the desert's edge, he could make out the roof of a house built by strangers on land that had been his. **********Like 70,000 other Mauritanians whose lives are being whittled away in dusty  refugee camps on this side of the river border, Mr. Watt lost everything he owned, including his citizenship in the country of his birth, when he was deported one night seven years ago for the simple reason that he is black. **********\"I was kicked out of my own country as if I were a rank intruder,\" said Mr. Watt, a Mauritanian Army veteran who went with a visitor from his refugee's hut  to the river bank for his first look back since he crossed into Senegal. **********\"People had told me that the Moors were taking over our land and our homes, but I chose not to listen,\" Mr. Watt said. \"I have long ago given up the things  of this world. For an old man like me, all that remains in life is God.\" **********If Africa is filled with refugee crises driven by ethnic conflicts and land pressures, what sets apart the fortunes of people like Mr. Watt is the additional question of race. **********When a conflict over grazing rights exploded into a full-blown crisis between Mauritania and Senegal, two of the continent's poorest countries, hundreds of people were killed in weeks of rioting and reprisals aimed at immigrant communities on both sides of the border. **********The attacks were unusual for Senegal, an overwhelmingly black country of seven million that had long played host to thousands of its northern neighbors,  and they quickly died down. **********But in Mauritania, a country of about two million people dominated since shortly after independence from France in 1960 by light-skinned Arabic-speaking  Moors, the crisis quickly became the excuse for the latest of many drives against a large black minority whose very existence clashes with the country's officially promoted image of itself as an Arab republic. **********Mauritania's population is divided along deep racial and caste lines, with Moors, including both black and lighter-skinned populations, constituting the majority. As many as 40 percent of the population, including almost all of those expelled, are blacks with linguistic and cultural ties with neighboring groups to the south and east. **********In addition to the Senegalese immigrants, mostly fishermen and farmers who had long worked in Mauritania's fertile south, thousands of the country's black  citizens were summarily rounded up, stripped of their papers and property, and deported by boat, land and air to Senegal, international human rights experts say. **********Since then, to the indifference of an outside world wearied by larger African crises in places like Somalia and Rwanda, Mauritania's exiled blacks have eked out a bleak existence in a score of refugee settlements strung along the length  of a river that has become a simmering fault line between north and west Africa. **********Mauritania, which has long been under attack by international human rights groups as one of the last bastions of slavery in the world, officially proclaims that any citizen living abroad is free to return home. In a speech before the Mauritanian Senate last month, Prime Minister Mohamed Ould Boubacar went even further, asserting that \"there are no Mauritanian refugees.\" **********But if refugees like Mr. Watt seem resigned to finishing their days a frustratingly unreachable stone's throw from their homeland, in camps like the one at Dagana, where hundreds of landless Mauritanians are forced to sharecrop on Senegalese plantations, younger generations still openly dream of returning home and revenge. **********\"More and more of us see our situation as being akin to the tragedy of Burundi,\" said Hamidin Sy, 55, a soft-spoken teacher. \"An injustice that goes unrepaired breeds violence. And in our country, the injustice is being perpetrated by a clique of Arabs who for two generations have been trying to force their identity on everyone else.\" **********If Mr. Sy cannot yet bring himself to advocate armed struggle, this border region is already brimming with black Mauritanians who are openly calling for an armed insurrection. **********\"People who are used to treating you like a slave can never treat you as an equal,\" said Samba Sarr, one of many younger refugees who say they are ready to  fight to recover their rights in their homeland. \"The black Mauritanian counts for nothing in his country, and the only way to change that is to fight.\" **********With attitudes like this spreading, and arms easily available throughout this area, many foreigners, from diplomats to refugee officials, say racial conflict  in Mauritania, a vast and unpoliceable country, is only a matter of time. **********Seated in a flowing blue robe on a woven mat, where he shared a hot mint tea  with visitors, Abou Hamath Sall, a rare former black senior civil servant, passes his afternoons meeting with fellow exiles, many of them youths who plot their return in a blaze of smoke and gunfire. **********\"The Moors have had a consistent strategy since independence of making Mauritania an entirely Arab country,\" Mr. Sall said. \"They have invented false coups to kill off our army officers. They manage the Civil Service admission process to keep us out, and play at openness by appointing a black figurehead here and there. **********\"It has not been easy, certainly, but this crisis has had the benefit of teaching us that we too must act as a community.

We just don't have any very big short-term expectations,\" he said, echoing the sentiments of other American business executives. **********While Vietnam's leaders set ambitious goals for growth at the congress, they  were determined to maintain central party control and to keep major industries in Government hands. **********Although declaring war on the corruption that saps the economy, they sidestepped vexing uncertainties in investment law and financing regulations that foreign businessmen say are holding them back. **********They did, however, ease the restrictions on \"social evils,\" including foreign advertising, that had sent a chill through the overseas business community. **********\"Before the congress, people were definitely worried,\" said Michael J. Scown, a lawyer with Russin & Vecchi who heads the American Chamber of Commerce here. \"There is a sense of relief now. Nothing horrible happened, so we are all happy  about that.\" **********Eugene A. Matthews, an investment consultant who heads the Ashta Capital Group, said the most important message of the congress was political stability.  Although it balked at replacing the country's three top leaders, all in their 70's, it sent a message of careful, managed political change and a steady and measured opening of the economy. **********\"Hey, you guys, this is an engine that is not going to go 100 m.p.h.,\" Mr. Matthews said. \"This is not a Ferrari. I think they're learning as they go. They're just going to take their time.\" **********Luu H. Le, the country manager for the Bank of America, views the situation from the useful perspective of a Vietnamese-American. **********\"It is a typical case of Eastern and Western value systems,\" he said.  \"For the Vietnamese, one generation, two generations, so what. But if an American does not bring in results in one month, he's in trouble.  That's the basic challenge for foreign companies. If you come in for a quick buck, forget it.\" **********Despite the difficulties, the American business presence in Vietnam has continued to grow. As many as 400 companies now operate in Vietnam, including representatives of close to 100 of the Fortune 500, Mr. Scown said. **********Two-way trade between the nations doubled over the last year, to $500 million, including $361 million in exports from the United States, principally in transportation and communications equipment. **********From just $3.3 million in 1993, American investment in Vietnam rose to $1.2 billion last year, making the United States the sixth-leading foreign investor here, still trailing Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. Most of this investment has been in transportation, light industry, agriculture and oil and gas. **********The next steps to improve business opportunities here could come from Washington, a number of American business executives said. While diplomatic relations have improved, there are still moves to be made on the economic front. **********American executives are eager for Congress to grant a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that withholds certain advantages from countries that do not allow free emigration. Such a waiver would help American exporters and infrastructure companies by giving them the kind of Federal Government financing that most of their Asian and European competitors receive. **********Over the longer term, the business leaders are pushing for a trade agreement  and ultimately for most-favored-nation status for Vietnam.  But to conclude a trade agreement the Vietnamese are faced with a list of detailed American demands.  These involve questions of market access, Government transparency and  nondiscrimination as well as such issues as intellectual property rights that will require difficult political decisions by the Vietnamese. **********Peter Rider, the chairman of a joint-venture property development company in  Hanoi called Doan Ket, took the long view, saying: \"If you look back over the past 10 years it's pretty impressive. They've come a long ways. They have a long ways to go but you can't ignore that they've just opened up enormously. **********\"For anyone who expected the congress to come out and say, here's a new mortgage law, new regulations for convertibility of the dong, a new and easier process to extend visas -- that was just unrealistic.\" **********But a Western diplomat noted that continuing economic liberalization -- including tax and tariff changes -- were all but locked in by Vietnam's commitments in joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asian  Free Trade Association and a verbal commitment to join the World Trade Organization. **********\"The message to foreign business investors is: Vietnam will not be an easy place -- a contract is still not a contract in the usual sense -- but reform is  clearly on,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/08/business/dole-aide-nominated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dole Aide Nominated", "print_headline": "Dole Aide Nominated", "body_text": " **********President Clinton nominated a top aide on Senate majority leader Bob Dole's staff today to a seat on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Yeltsin today received his first foreign visitor since his re-election in July, giving Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany a chance to size up Mr. Yeltsin's condition during a four-hour informal meeting. **********Mr. Kohl said he found Mr. Yeltsin ''cheerful and active,'' but also ''noticeably worried'' about his heart bypass surgery later this month. **********Mr. Yeltsin, 65, disclosed on Thursday that he needs the surgery, breaking months of silence by the Kremlin on his health problems. **********Several prominent politicians, most notably his national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, have since called on Mr. Yeltsin to transfer power to Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin during his recovery from surgery. **********Mr. Kohl, who is the closest to Mr. Yeltsin among the Western leaders, sought to dispel talk of a power vaccuum in the Kremlin caused by the President's illness. **********''He does not strike me as the kind of person who would allow power to be pulled out from under his chair,'' Mr. Kohl said after the meeting. **********At a government hunting lodge 60 miles northwest of Moscow, both leaders wore burgundy sweaters and big smiles. Mr. Yeltsin appeared only briefly to greet Mr. Kohl's arriving helicopter. **********''It's better to relax here and not work,'' Mr. Yeltsin told his visitor, according to the official news agency Tass. ''But we shall work and relax.'' The two men took a 30-minute boat trip on a lake after their meeting. **********Mr. Kohl said he assured Mr. Yeltsin that NATO expansion into Eastern Europe would not take place this year. However, the Western military alliance had never planned to accept new members this year, and the actual expansion may not take place for several years. **********Mr. Kohl also said that negotiations over Russia's participation in an enlarged NATO would wait until after Mr. Yeltsin recovers. **********Spokesmen for the two leaders said that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kohl discussed the President's operation, economic ties between the two countries and the war in Chechnya. They also exchanged views on the American air strikes on Iraq, which Russia has vehemently protested. **********The two men seem to enjoy each other's company. After Mr. Kohl invited Mr. Yeltsin to the German spa of Baden-Baden next year to receive a German press award, Mr. Yeltsin invited Mr. Kohl to vacation next year on Lake Baikal in Siberia. According to his spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Mr. Yeltsin promised Mr. Kohl that he would take him ''every day to the steam bath and whip you myself with birch twigs.'' **********Mr. Yeltsin, who has been seen only fleetingly since the presidential runoff on July 3, underwent tests in Moscow last month that confirmed that he would need bypass surgery to improve the flow of blood to his heart. He then retreated to Rus, a secluded hunting and fishing estate that was once the favorite preserve of Leonid I. Brezhnev when he was the Soviet leader. **********As soon as Mr. Yeltsin announced his decision to undergo surgery, Mr. Lebed urged him to transfer his responsibilities to Mr. Chernomyrdin until he recovers. **********Today Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary said the President affirmed his support for Mr. Lebed's peace initiative in Chechnya. But there was no talk of a meeting anytime soon between the two men. Mr. Lebed has been seeking one unsuccessfully for weeks to explain personally his efforts to end the conflict with secessionist rebels in Chechnya. He has suggested that certain people in the Kremlin, whom he has not identified, could be taking advantage of Mr. Yeltsin's illness to shut him out. **********The Russian Constitution calls for the Prime Minister to step in for three months if the President is incapacitated or dies. But it is basically up to the Kremlin to determine if the President is incapacitated. **********Today Anatoli B. Chubais, the President's chief of staff, said that if Mr. Yeltsin were to transfer powers to Mr. Chernomyrdin, it would be only for a short while. ''A few hours, a day, maybe two,'' he said. **********Mr. Chubais said that for now, Mr. Yeltsin was following ''a normal, working-condition schedule'' proven by the flow of official documents returning from the hunting lodge. **********Mr. Lebed's comments about Mr. Yeltsin's health mostly reflected an uneasy power struggle among Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Lebed and Mr. Chubais, who has reacted coolly to Mr. Lebed's peace proposal for Chechnya. Mr. Lebed appears worried that, if Mr. Yeltsin were to stay nominally in charge after his operation, Mr. Chubais would actually run the Kremlin. **********Bypass operations, common in the West, are still relatively rare in Russia, where only about 3,000 are performed each year. Mr. Yeltsin decided to have bypass surgery in Russia, probably at the Russian Research and Production Cardiology Center in Moscow. **********Today the human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov, 66, who, like Mr. Yeltsin, suffers from ischemia and suffered a severe heart attack in July, announced he would fly to the United States on Sunday for heart surgery. **********Doctors there, he said, would determine whether he would most benefit from a bypass or angioplasty. **********''All the Kremlin doctors told me I should go to the United States,'' Mr. Kovalyov said today, ''including Akchurin.'' Mr. Kovalyov was referring to Dr. Renat Akchurin, head of the surgery department at the Moscow cardiology center, who is considered the most likely surgeon to operate on the President. Mr. Kovalyov said Mr. Yeltsin's decision to stay in Russia had been dictated by ''political reasons,'' adding, ''And, thank God, I have none.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/business/big-bonus-seen-for-loral-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Bonus Seen For Loral Chief", "print_headline": "Big Bonus Seen For Loral Chief", "body_text": " **********The chairman and chief executive of the Loral Corporation, Bernard L.

The alleys of the downtown Muslim neighborhood of Schotches Kloof have turned to muddy streams, but the crowd pushes on toward a known drug dealer's house, chanting: ''Kill the merchant! Kill!'' **********The leader of the group and a small cadre of masked, armed men -- known as the G-Force -- approach the house and start banging on the door, demanding that the dealer come out. When the door is opened, the leader issues an ultimatum -- stop dealing and appear at the Gatesville mosque in three days to confess publicly, or face the consequences. **********The man, frightened, tries to convince them that he is no longer involved in dealing drugs. **********In recent months there have been dozens of such confrontations as worshipers at one of the Cape Town area's richest and most conservative mosques have banded together into a highly visible vigilante group, known as Pagad, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs. **********They say they are doing the job that the South African Government is failing to do: ridding their neighborhoods of crime and violence. **********And it is not just talk. On Aug. 4, one confrontation ended with the public killing of a reputed drug dealer. With police officers and journalists watching, the dealer, Rashaad Staggie, was shot and then set afire. Even when he was dead, the crowd kept kicking the body and pumping it full of bullets. **********Street justice is hardly new to South Africa. But never before has it been so organized, so populist, so middle-class and so religiously inspired. Previously, vigilante justice in the townships was the explosion of a mob to set an informer on fire, or the furtive work of small gangs of self-styled neighborhood protectors. **********Pagad, by contrast, holds huge meetings at the Gatesville mosque, drills crowds in marching tactics, collects dues and has a treasurer report to the members on its finances. **********Its open, flamboyant methods have transfixed South Africans and  fed a debate about the country's rising crime rate, the extent of police corruption, the rights of citizens to take action and the new Government's ability to govern. **********In recent weeks, the police have made arrests on both sides. One Pagad leader has been charged with sedition, the first time anyone in South Africa has faced this charge since apartheid was abandoned. And a big-time local drug lord was brought to court this month. But police officials seem befuddled by the situation, and usually stand on the perimeter of the action, with half a dozen armored vehicles at the ready. **********''We are caught in the middle,''  said a police spokesman, Superintendent John Sterrenberg. ''No matter what we do, it looks like we are taking sides.'' **********The sense of lawlessness has been enhanced by the gangsters' reaction.  Hardly intimidated by Pagad, they have held their own marches demanding police protection, brandishing guns and smoking enough crack so that journalists could get good pictures. **********Rashied Staggie, the twin brother of the dead drug dealer, was holding a meeting at the community center in the slum neighborhood of Manenberg recently, sitting on stage with his ''generals'' and preaching to an audience that included grandmothers. **********Apartheid, he said, had given people like him little choice in life. ''What could you do if you wanted to take care of your children?'' the dealer asked. **********''Smuggle!'' answered the crowd, sounding like fans at a pep rally. **********But many citizens live in fear of the growing gangsterism. Pagad's crusade originates in the dreary set of neighborhoods that apartheid forced people of mixed race to live in. Out of view from the more picturesque areas of Cape Town that were for whites only, these neighborhoods are in an area called the Cape Flats that stretches across the marshlands behind Table Mountain. **********The Flats are home to at least  three million people and most of South Africa's half million Muslims. Islam has been part of the community here for more than 300 years, since the early Dutch settlers imported slaves from the Malay Archipelago. **********Under apartheid, people of mixed race were classified above blacks and were entitled to better treatment, including in housing and jobs.  But unemployment is high -- 40 percent, by some estimates. **********Gangs have long been a part of life on the Cape Flats. But since the country's first nonracial elections in 1994,  which swept Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power,  the gangs have grown richer, bolder and more violent. **********This is in part because South Africa, no longer isolated by international sanctions, has suddenly become open to international drug dealers looking for a new market. Crack, cocaine and heroin, virtually unheard of here five years ago, are now easy to obtain. Police officials estimate that there are more than 100 gangs operating now. **********The gangsters are not without their supporters. Following the example of South American drug barons who built roads and bridges in their hometowns, some of the gang leaders have been generous. **********Sylvia Van Rooyan, 55, and a mother of six, who attended Mr. Staggie's rally, said she supported Rashied Staggie's gang, ''Hard Livings,'' because Mr. Staggie and his brother were ''caring people.'' She said the dead twin, Rashaad, had given away $7,000 at a wedding the week before he died. **********''The Government promises a lot,''  Mrs. Van Rooyan said. ''But they never fulfill their promises. Rashaad was a man of his word. He never turned away without giving a rand.'' **********Easily available by cellular phone, Rashied, a confessed killer who is nicknamed Mad Dog and spent 14 years in prison, will meet with journalists on little notice. He recently invited visitors to a condominium in the more upscale waterfront neighborhood of Sea Point, where he was surrounded by teen-agers, drinking scotch and ginger ale and watching a videotape. He says he will stop selling drugs if he gets support from the Government to live the way he does now. **********Experts say there are reasons that the Muslim population would produce a movement like Pagad. Deeply religious and conservative,  many Muslims see a new South Africa that has one of the highest crime rates in the world and is adopting liberal policies they oppose. Pornography, gambling and abortion have all been legalized and capital punishment has been rejected. **********The director of the Gatesville mosque, Sadullah Khan, says disappointment runs high among Muslims. ''People here were very active in the struggle,'' he said. ''It is still fresh in people's memories. But now I think they are very demoralized. The criminal element is so all-pervasive. And they ask themselves, was this worth the struggle? It is that kind of helplessness that leads to this kind of mass mobilization.'' **********On the night that Pagad marched in the Muslim neighborhood, the mob surrounded three houses.

Transmission companies, which had controlled the sale of gas, were forced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow others tosell gas, creating a new industry. **********This change contributed to Columbia's troubles. The system had locked itself  into long-term contracts with producers in the 1960's and 70's. When gas prices  dropped in the 1980's, Columbia had to keep paying high prices to producers, while many of its customers, who had been captive to Columbia, began to buy low-cost gas on the open market. **********Columbia filed for protection under Chapter 11 in July 1991 but was able to reorganize successfully. **********Mrs. Abbott replaces James P. Holland, who has resigned as chairman and chief executive of the transmission unit after 20 years with the company and who played a major role in the reorganization. **********Mr. Holland, who is 47, said, \"The past four years have been particularly stressful, and I look forward to spending more time with my family and exploring other business opportunities.\" **********From 1985 to 1995, Mrs. Abbott was a vice president at the Enron Corporation, which has been one of the most aggressive companies in taking advantage of the new freedoms offered in the gas business. **********Much of her effort, she said in an interview, would be focused on expanding the storage of gas in fields that the company has long owned in the Appalachians, primarily in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. **********That, she said, would give Columbia more flexibility to meet demand in the Northeast in the winter, because the fields are nearer than the current large producing fields on the Gulf Coast. She said pipelines would also be expanded to allow Columbia to serve a greater area. **********The transmission subsidiaries are the largest units of Columbia, which is based in Wilmington, Del.

Its requirements for a down payment can be as low as 3 percent of the purchase price. **********As with any generous financial gift, there are also practical considerations.For the giver whose estate exceeds the U.S. tax-free ceiling of $600,000,a gift of the maximum $10,000 per individual ($20,000 for a couple) is a legitimate way of saving their heirs a big tax bite.For the prospective home owner, a gift of up to $10,000 from each individual giver is tax-free. **********In Britain, however, such gifts carry few tax breaks.Parents can reduce the prospective death duties on their wealth by giving away any amount of cash to their children.Yet this is true for any financial gift, not only money used to buy property.Provided the parent lives for at least seven years after the gift is made, this amount is excluded from any inheritance tax bill. **********WHEN IT COMES to paying for their child's mortgage loan, British parents get no tax benefits at all, said Paul Franklin, a spokesman for the British tax office. **********\"If you have a mortgage on your main home you are entitled to tax relief on the loan interest,\" he said.\"Raising a loan to buy a property for someone else, even within the family, excludes you from this benefit.\" **********The same is true if the parents do not have a mortgage themselves. Mr. Franklin said thatthe children would only be entitled to the mortgage relief if the mortgage was in their own name and the parents gave them the cash each month to make the payment. **********The Halifax Building Society, which is Britain's largest mortgage lender, recently did research to see whether British parents could be encouraged to help their children with mortgage financing. **********\"The idea was to launch some kind of savings plan funded by parents that could eventually be converted to a mortgage,\" said David Nicholson of Halifax. \"This could then be funded by either the children or the parents.\" **********\"What we were told, in no uncertain terms, was that parents reckoned they'd paid enough bringing their kids up and that it was about time they stood on their own two feet,\" he added. **********MR. NICHOLSON said that elsewhere in Europe, parents were even less likely to help children with mortgages. **********\"In Germany and France, especially, because of the lower percentage of home owners compared to renters, such schemes are unheard of,\" he said. **********In France, as in Britain, there are a few tax breaks on financial gifts but no incentives for parents to help children buy their first home, said Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for Banque Paribas in Paris. **********If you want to share your largesse with a couple planning to be married, you might want to make your Christmas gift the first big payment in a Bridal Registry Account.Under this new plan, offered by a growing number of nongovernment lenders in the United States, as well as the FHA, the down payment for a home is funded by cash contributions from families and wedding guests as gifts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/business/2-li-makers-of-software-plan-to-merge-for-1.2-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Laurie Flynn", "pub_date": "1996-10-08", "snippet": "Computer Associates International Inc makes $1.2 billion cash bid for Cheyenne Software Inc; deal is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approval; Computer Associates, one of world's largest software companies, will be buying maker of mass ...", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 L.I.

The deal is subject to both shareholder and regulatory approval, although both companies' boards have already approved the merger, and investors appeared happy. **********Computer Associates' stock rose $1.75, to $64.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Cheyenne surged $7.7969, to $30.2656 on the American Stock Exchange. **********Cheyenne, with $250 million in revenue last year, sells software that large corporations use to manage data stored on computer networks, specializing in products for the Microsoft Corporation's fast-selling Windows NT software for corporations. The company had also recently entered the growing market for antivirus software. **********Computer Associates, with 9,000 employees worldwide, is a leading supplier of software for managing enterprise-wide computer systems. Analysts speculated that Computer Associates was seeking to broaden its position in the market for Windows NT software and gain better distribution within companies installing smaller computer networks. **********Charles B. Wang, chairman and chief executive of Computer Associates, described the two companies' product lines as ''synergistic,'' and added that Cheyenne received 95 percent of its revenue through indirect sales, while the majority of Computer Associates' sales were direct to customers. The merger would enable Computer Associates to receive half its revenues eventually through indirect sales, Mr. Wang said. **********Conveniently, both companies are based on Long Island. Mr. Wang said Computer Associates would retain all of Cheyenne's 800 employees and maintain Cheyenne's headquarters plant in Roslyn Heights, L.I. **********''It's really a very good fit,'' said Melissa Eisenstat, a software analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York. ''I look at storage management, which is the business that Cheyenne is in, as a subset of the business that Computer Associates is in -- systems management.'' **********For Computer Associates, the acquisition is just the latest in a flurry of corporate purchases, following on its $1.8 billion deal to buy a rival software maker, the Legent Corp., in August 1995 and the ASK Group Inc. in June 1994. The merger of Computer Associates and Cheyenne is the third largest in software history, trailing only Computer Associates' acquisition of Legent and the I.B.M. Corporation's $3 billion purchase of the Lotus Development Corporation last year. **********Despite the pattern of Computer Associates' past acquisitions, the Cheyenne product line has little overlap with Computer Associates', Ms. Eisenstat said. The Legent and ASK  Group deals involved mainframe-oriented software companies whose  products and sales channels had significant overlap with Computer Associates'. **********The deal comes just months after McAfee Associates Inc., the nation's largest supplier of antivirus software, attempted to acquire Cheyenne for $27.50 a share. Cheyenne's board unanimously rejected the offer, calling it a ploy to take advantage of a short-term drop in Cheyenne's stock price. That merger would have created the world's fifth-largest software company, with combined 1996 revenue of roughly $340 million. **********At the time, Cheyenne faced a string of difficult quarters that it  attributed to a product transition and seasonal downturn. **********Rumors of Computer Associates' interest in acquiring Cheyenne have been circulating for months, and analysts expressed little surprise at the announcement. Last March, trading in Cheyenne stock was halted after the CNBC stocks commentator Dan Dorfman reported unconfirmed rumors that Computer Associates had offered $35 a share for Cheyenne. **********In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Mr. Wang dismissed speculation that the two companies had been in negotiations previously, saying that he had approached Cheyenne seriously only a week ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/04/business/texaco-narrows-a-review.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-09-04", "snippet": "Texaco Inc narrows review on its corporate advertising account, which has been handled by Bates USA (S)", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texaco Narrows A Review", "print_headline": "Texaco Narrows A Review", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. said yesterday that it had narrowed a review on its corporate advertising account, which has been handled by Bates USA in New York since late 1994, to five finalists.

They constitute a minuscule but powerful village that helps make up what Londoners call \"the chattering classes,\" and many issues are devoted each week to their lives and opinions. **********The newspapers encourage these cozy self-referential habits by letting their  reporters develop their own small cults of personality. Each week, in both the tabloids and the broadsheets, celebrity writers lavishly describe the minutiae of their lives. Political columns are illustrated by photographs and pithy descriptions of columnists, as in \"Simon Heffer: the Pundit the Politicians Dread,\" who appears in The Daily Mail of London. Newspapers regularly print the  names of profile writers in larger type than the names of those profiled. **********Readers of newspapers here are by now accustomed to journalists writing about other journalists and newspapers writing about other newspapers. But Polly Toynbee, a journalist who is known for her leftist opinions but who is hardly a  household name in Britain, took the convention a step further last week when she wrote a scathing article in The Independent of London about The Daily Mail's efforts to write an article about her. **********Ms. Toynbee's piece, which took up half of The Independent's front page, described how -- by researching Ms. Toynbee's romantic relationship with a married man -- a reporter from The Mail had telephoned her family, her friends,  her colleagues and even neighbors she had never met. **********\"On Tuesday,\" she wrote, \"a man came over from No. 6, deeply worried by a call from The Mail asking detailed questions about what hours he had observed any men coming and going at my house. He suspected it was a burglar casing the joint.\" **********Ms. Toynbee wrote her article, she said, as a \"pre-emptive strike\" against The Daily Mail's \"sleaze merchants\" and their \"dirty-raincoat journalism.\" But her own story provoked the kind of hall-of-mirrors storm that London journalists love, and spawned a host of articles by other writers commenting on every aspect of Ms. Toynbee's article. **********First, The Guardian, Britain's leading Labor-friendly broadsheet newspaper, ran an article in which a number of other left-leaning women described how they  had received \"unwelcome attention\" from The Mail. Then Paul Dacre, the editor of The Mail, revealed (again in The Guardian) that while his newspaper had indeed been working on a story about Ms. Toynbee, the story had been canceled. **********Then, in his column in Londond's Sunday Telegraph, Auberon Waugh recalled the \"3,500-word diatribe\" Ms. Toynbee had written about him 10 years earlier, said she was shrill and humorless, and called her married boyfriend \"a brave man.\" **********Meanwhile, the boyfriend's wife wrote an article, too, and a number of plain  old commentators were weighing in with their opinions -- for and against Ms. Toynbee, for and against The Mail and its aggressive news-gathering, even for and against the newsworthiness of the story, which led naturally to the question: Who cares? **********Judith Woods, writing in The Scotsman, based in Edinburgh, said that the controversy was a reflection of the perilous state of the British press, \"when such prominence is given to publishing a story about a story that has not been published yet, written by a journalist who fully concedes it was a non-story to  begin with.\" **********The same view was expressed in a letter to The Independent from a regular reader -- the first time a representative of this rare breed had been heard from on this subject. **********\"I was astounded that Polly Toynbee was allowed almost half the front page of The Independent to moan about her troubles with The Daily Mail,\" wrote Linda Sansbury of Brussels. \"The methods of the tabloid press are hardly a revelation. Does Polly Toynbee really think anyone outside her immediate circle is interested?\" **********The Toynbee article has a great deal to do with competition between newspapers, of course -- with so many papers vying for readers in an increasingly cutthroat market, newspapers constantly try to elevate themselves at the expense of their rivals. Any scoop is emphasized and lavishly praised; any misstep by the competition is pointed out and crowed over. In this case, The Independent, suffering from declining circulation and severe staff and budget cuts in recent years, was taking a shot at its favorite ideological enemy, The Daily Mail. **********But Roy Greenslade, who writes about the media in The Guardian, said the story was almost embarrassing, even if Ms. Toynbee's initial contention -- that  The Daily Mail uses questionable tactics to gather news -- was a valid one. **********\"It's an absurd bit of British nonsense,\" said Mr. Greenslade. \"We have a load of columnists here who think that their lives are vastly interesting to readers, when they're just interesting to each other. We have a diverse press, but the diverse press is more interested in each other than they are in the rest of the world. I doubt if they would have run the piece if it had just been an ordinary person complaining about The Daily Mail.\" **********Mr. Greenslade said he has been strenuously resisting his editors' attempts to make him write about the Toynbee episode, even as the articles in other newspapers pile up. \"The story has run its course,\" he said, \"and there shouldn't be a lot more to say about it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/27/business/the-media-business-times-co-appointment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Times Co.

For whatever the ups and downs of the stock market, these holdings produce a steady stream of income. The comparable investment in mutual funds is the equity-income category. Its funds invest in just such high-yielding stocks. With volatility increasing and talk persistent about how long it has been since a 10 percent decline in the broad stock market, these funds make sense for the conservative. **********Among the strong performers in the category is the Stagecoach Diversified Income Fund, which was in the top 25 percent in the first two months of 1996. Robert W. Bissell, 48, chief equity investment officer for Wells Fargo Bank in Los Angeles, has been manager of the fund, now at more than $100 million in assets, since its inception in November 1992. He manages $1.5 billion, including private accounts, in the same style. **********He aims for a combination of decent yields,now 3.44 percent annually at Stagecoach Diversified Income, and capital growth. Typical of his fund and other equity-income funds are blue-chip stocks. He characterized his investment style  as buying companies with strong fundamentals when \"investor expectations are low\" -- in other words, value investing. But another thread runs through much of his portfolio: a belief in management. A couple of his biggest holdings are companies run by former Wells Fargo executives. Mr. Bissell puts a third of the portfolio in his 10 favorite stocks, including Ford Motor, Bankers Trust New York, ARCO and I.B.M., and puts the balance in 40  to 50 other issues. **********A longtime holding is Household International, the consumer finance company in Prospect Heights, Ill. From time to time, the shares of Household International rally, and Mr. Bissell trims his holdings to prevent his position  from going over 5 percent of the fund's assets. \"That's an internal collar we use, for diversification purposes, and it's the only time we sell this company,\" he said. \"It represents everything we believe in.\" **********Generally, the fund holds a stock until the price rises to what Mr. Bissell considers fair value, a more compelling opportunity arises or something causes him to reconsider his investment. **********Last year, the fund sold its stake in PNC Holdings after that bank company acquired Midlantic Bank of New Jersey. The acquisition was made with stock, which Mr. Bissell thought would dilute earnings about 10 percent in the first year. The fund realized an average gain of $5 a share, or 21 percent, on its one-year investment in PNC, the manager said. **********His buy-and-hold strategy results in little turnover, about 40 percent annually of the portfolio, and it often means that Mr. Bissell invests cash coming into the fund in long-held positions. **********A Leaner Lender **********Stagecoach began buying Household International in fall 1994, when William Aldinger, the former vice chairman of Wells Fargo, became Household's chief executive. \"We knew Bill very well, and that's what created our interest,\" Mr. Bissell said. **********Mr. Aldinger cut Household's annual expenses from nearly 60 cents on each dollar of operating revenue to 54 cents in 1995, and Mr. Bissell expects a decline to 45 cents by 1998. Household, which issues the General Motors credit card, has built up a cash reserve to help withstand a possible increase in write-offs, something industry analysts are concerned about as consumer debt and late payments rise. Household's reserve is equal to 5.4 percent of card receivables, compared with an average of 1.9 percent at other specialty-card issuers, Mr. Bissell said. **********He expects profits to reach $5.10 a share this year, up from $4.30 in 1995. Over the next two to three years, he said, earnings could grow 20 percent. The fund paid an average of $36 each for its Household shares, and although the stock is trading at nearly twice that amount, the manager still considers them a value. \"Our target price on this stock is $130 within two years,\" he said. **********Problem? No, Opportunity **********Bankers Trust New York also has new management, in the wake of a derivatives debacle last year that led to client lawsuits and a tumbling stock price. \"What  the market sees as a problem,\" he said, \"we see as a buying opportunity.\" **********The new chief executive, Frank Newman, is a former Under Secretary of the Treasury with banking experience at Bank of America and Wells Fargo. \"We think Frank is the right person to restore balance and reputation to Bankers Trust,\" Mr. Bissell said. **********Stagecoach bought its stake last fall, when Mr. Newman was hired, at an average cost of $67. Bankers Trust's profits plunged last year to $2.03 a share, sharply less than the $4 dividend, and the fear of a cut in the payout hangs over the stock. Mr. Bissell, however, expects earnings to rebound this year to $6.75 a share, an aggressive target. **********Along with playing down of derivatives, Mr. Newman reduced the company's reliance on trading for its own account. The trading made earnings volatile, which Wall Street doesn't like. **********A Better Idea? **********The last auto maker to revamp, Ford Motor is poised to be the first in performance in the last years of this decade, Mr. Bissell said. **********The company has announced plans under the rubric Ford 2000 to move to an international from a regional operational structure, reducing the number of vehicle platforms, the underlying structures, to 16 from 24, and cutting expenses 20 percent to 30 percent. Another element is a reduction in capital spending, \"which frees up a lot of cash for either a higher dividend or share repurchases,\" Mr. Bissell said. **********A frequent trader of Ford's stock, Mr. Bissell began building his most recent position about a year ago at an average cost of $27 a share. The stock is now trading in the mid-$30's, but he values it at about $40. He expects earnings, $3.58 a share last year, to edge up to $5 in 1997, a considerably more optimistic view than the consensus on Wall Street. \"We really see the 1997-99 time frame as when the earnings increases will be the most significant,\" Mr. Bissell said. **********The recent downturn in the market did not frighten Mr. Bissell, who has about 5 percent of his portfolio in cash. \"It's not a surprise to see bonds back up to 7 percent, but the reason for that weakness isn't inflation; it's the outlook for a better economy, and that should help our companies, Ford in particular,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/07/business/progress-seen-in-accounting-board-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1996-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Progress Seen In Accounting Board Dispute", "print_headline": "Progress Seen In Accounting Board Dispute", "body_text": " **********Progress is being made in resolving a fight over the makeup of the body that  picks accounting rule makers, Arthur Levitt Jr. , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday. **********But he did not give details, either in a speech at the University of Southern California in which he mentioned it or in a later interview. **********In another matter, Mr. Levitt said he expected the commission's investigation of the Nasdaq stock market to be completed this summer.

But the emerging policy differences suggest that relations between the two nations may be entering a new and possibly difficult phase in the wake of the power shifts in northern Iraq. **********Mrs. Ciller's remarks were greeted with dismay by senior Administration officials, who said they did  not reflect what Turkey has told the United States in recent meetings. **********Mr. Hussein's last attempt to assert authority in northern Iraq, which came three weeks ago when he sent troops there to support a local Kurdish faction's takeover of the region, led the United States to stage cruise missile attacks on military installations in southern Iraq. **********Mrs. Ciller did not say whether Turkey wants Mr. Hussein to send his own troops into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurds who are fighting a separatist war from bases there. No other force in Iraq, however, including Mr. Hussein's new Kurdish allies, appears to have the military power to conduct such an operation. **********If Mr. Hussein's army or another powerful military force were to conduct a major strike against Turkish separatist guerrillas in Iraq, the guerrillas would probably be forced to flee either into Turkey, where they would have to face the Turkish Army, or into neighboring Syria, where their leaders are based. **********Mrs. Ciller said that if Mr. Hussein's army or some other force could chase the separatist guerrillas out of northern Iraq, Turkey would drop its plan to create a ''security zone'' inside Iraq. **********''We have the problem that a terrorist group, the P.K.K., is operating from camps in northern Iraq,'' she said, referring to the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party. ''An average of three Turkish soldiers are being killed every day by these terrorists. That is something we cannot tolerate, and to stop this infiltration, we proposed establishing a security zone in the border area.'' **********''We have sent a delegation to Saddam to tell him that if he can impose central authority there, O.K.,'' she said in the interview, speaking in English. **********''We are still talking to him, and we are interested to see what he can do or is prepared to do,'' she continued. ''If he can establish a degree of rule there that puts an end to terrorist infiltration, that would be fine with us. If not, we will take measures to see that terrorists do not continue to operate on our borders. We defend the territorial integrity of Iraq, but the lack of authority there has been tragic for us.'' **********Washington was clearly unhappy about Mrs. Ciller's comments. **********''I have to say I'm a little surprised by those statements,'' a senior State Department official said. ''This does not accord with the discussions the United States has had with Turkey. Perhaps it is Turkey's way of signaling to the United States that it has alternatives.'' **********The official added that if it was true that Turkey was inviting Mr. Hussein to re-establish control over northern Iraq, ''it would not be a welcome development -- it would obviously make our cooperation with the Turks more difficult.'' **********But the official also said, ''There is room to be uncertain about what different officials in Turkey really think.'' **********Secretary of Defense William J. Perry met with Mrs. Ciller during his recent swing through the region, and she did not tell him of Turkey's intention to urge Mr. Hussein to re-assert his authority over the north. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to meet with her next week when they both attend the United Nations General Assembly. **********For the last five years, Iraqi forces have been barred from the northern part of the country, where the United States and its allies established a haven for Kurds after the Persian Gulf war. But the Kurdish authorities in the enclave have proven unwilling or unable to close Kurdistan Workers Party camps there. **********Last month one group of Iraqi Kurds formed an alliance with Mr. Hussein, and for the first time since 1991 Iraqi troops entered the Kurdish enclave. It is still unclear whether Mr. Hussein will assume full control of the region, but that prospect, while troubling to the United States, is encouraging to Turkey. **********Mrs. Ciller's comments today underlined a fundamental difference between Turkish and American goals in Iraq. The United States seeks to limit Mr. Hussein's power and prevent him from disrupting the flow of oil from the Middle East to Western industrial nations. **********Turkey's principal goals are to close Kurdistan Workers Party  bases in Iraq by whatever means necessary and, if possible, to end the American-led economic boycott of Iraq, which has cost Turkey billions of dollars in lost trade. **********On Thursday, the new Turkish Prime Minister, Necmettin Erbakan, broke three weeks of silence on the Iraqi crisis by asserting that he would be very happy if Kurds in northern Iraq were to reach an accord with Mr. Hussein. **********''If this happens, the area would be cleared of the P.K.K.,'' Mr. Erbakan told reporters in Ankara. ''It would be great.'' **********Asked if he thought the United States would be pleased with a solution that would increase Mr. Hussein's power, Mr. Erbakan replied: ''This is not our problem. We have no quarrel with any person in Baghdad. That is only the concern of the United States.'' **********Mr. Erbakan is the first Turkish Prime Minister from an Islamic-based political movement, but his comments and those of Mrs. Ciller reflect a strong political consensus that reaches across the Turkish political spectrum. All mainstream political leaders here, evidently supported by public opinion, are eager to crush the Kurdish separatists and to rebuild Turkey's once-lucrative trading links with Iraq. **********The leader of the Iraqi Kurdish faction that is now allied with Mr. Hussein, Massoud Barzani, visited Turkey this week for talks with Foreign Minister Ciller. She said today that Mr. Barzani was sympathetic to Turkey's demand for a crackdown on the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is known as the P.K.K. **********''We told him that he would never get what he wants from Turkey if this situation continues,'' Mrs. Ciller said. ''He said he and his people were against terrorism and against the P.K.K., and that P.K.K. operations against us from his territory were something he does not want.'' **********Mrs. Ciller also said she was  pleased at a crackdown on organizations in Western Europe that support the Kurdistan Workers Party this week. In an operation coordinated with Germany, Britain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, more than 200 police officers in Belgium swooped down on the offices of a Kurdish-language television station that officials described as a ''propaganda mouthpiece'' of the Kurdistan Workers Party. More than 60 Kurds were reportedly detained for questioning. **********Newspapers in Belgium reported that the police there believe that the Kurdish Workers Party is engaged in drug and arms smuggling, extortion and other crimes in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/17/business/growth-is-planned-by-arco-chemical.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg Newsreuters", "pub_date": "1996-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Growth Is Planned By ARCO Chemical", "print_headline": "Growth Is Planned By ARCO Chemical", "body_text": " **********The ARCO Chemical Company said today that it would build a new chemicals plant in the Netherlands to produce plastic materials and upgrade its plastic raw materials plant in Channelview, Tex. **********The company said it would build the plant in Rotterdam with an undisclosed equity partner. **********The projects will use up a significant portion of ARCO Chemical's $2.4 billion capital spending budget in the next five years, said a spokesman, Gerald Davis.

In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which ended April 30, it reported profits that if sustained for three more quarters would give it a return on equity of more than 100 percent. That's impressive in  any industry. **********But a reading of the prospectus for GKN Holding, the parent company that will issue the stock, raises a couple of questions. First, this is a company that performs best in a bull market, and does not do nearly as well when the market stalls, as it did in 1994. GKN has no history in a bear market, and the results  would probably not be pretty. **********Then there is the issue of the investigations. GKN discloses a couple of them. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's sales practices, including allegations that it failed to supervise some brokers who committed numerous violations of the securities laws. In the prospectus, GKN says it has tightened its supervisory procedures and will soon offer to settle the case, although it adds that it does not know if the S.E.C. will accept the settlement offer. **********Under GKN's offer, it would pay a $100,000 penalty and hire a consultant to review the company's procedures and recommend changes. In addition, Robert Gladstone, GKN's executive vice president and a large shareholder, would pay a penalty of $50,000 and be barred from employment in a supervisory capacity in a  brokerage firm. He could apply to have that penalty lifted in 18 months, but it  appears that he would in the meantime stay as an officer of the holding company, ostensibly not supervising anyone. **********S.E.C. officials declined to comment. GKN officials did not return telephone  calls. **********In another case, the National Association of Securities Dealers is investigating whether GKN overcharged customers by marking up the prices of securities more than is allowed under the association's rules. GKN says it does  not know what action, if any, the association will take. But it adds that the N.A.S.D. could suspend or bar the company's principals from the business, impose fines and restrict business activities. And that, it says with lawyerly understatement, could \"have a material adverse impact on the company.\" **********All of which raises the interesting question of why the company is filing to  go public with those two investigations hanging over its head. If it was confident that it would escape relatively unscathed, it might choose to wait and sell stock when the questions were removed, probably getting a better price. Of course, if the investigations end in severe penalties, that might make it impossible to sell the shares at any price. **********It is possible that GKN simply wants to get in while the bull market is raging. In this year's first quarter, it earned $2.2 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with a loss of $256,000, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. For its 1996 fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, it reported profits of $3.5 million, or 61 cents a share. **********That is just 10 times the low end of the $6 to $8 price range the company is  seeking. But investors should note that most of the profits last year came from  gains on underwriter's warrants, which the firm receives from companies it takes public. Those warrants let it buy shares later, and can be valuable if prices rise. But they are worthless if prices fall, one reason that in the previous year, a mediocre one for the stock market, GKN had profits of just $381,000, or  7 cents a share. **********GKN, based in New York, specializes in a form of blind pools, in which investors are promised that the money they invest will be used to acquire an operating company in a specified industry. But it hopes to diversify. It has already bought a discount brokerage firm in Florida and started a small money management operation. It hopes to sell stocks to institutions, something it has  not done much of in the past. **********To grow, GKN needs the capital from the offering, and it needs to pacify regulators. Investors will be asked to provide the money before they know whether the second criterion will be met."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/26/world/kabul-offers-power-share.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kabul Offers Power-Share", "print_headline": "Kabul Offers Power-Share", "body_text": " **********The Afghan Government, under siege by a militant Islamic faction, has offered to share power with another opposition faction, both sides said today. **********Representatives of the opposition faction, Hezb-i-Islami, led by former Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, have been in the Afghan capital, Kabul, for two days discussing power-sharing options with President Burhanuddin Rabbani's Government, the officials said. **********Kabul has been under attack since October by the Taliban, a militia that wants to install strict Islamic rule. **********The Government and Taliban attacked each other's positions in Kabul with rockets and bombs today, causing casualties on both sides, the Kabul radio said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/02/world/johannesburg-journal-hot-soccer-welds-a-land-together.html": {"writer_name": "Donald McNeil", "pub_date": "1996-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Johannesburg Journal;Hot Soccer Welds a Land Together", "print_headline": "Johannesburg Journal;Hot Soccer Welds a Land Together", "body_text": " **********In the first month of 1996 in South Africa, a four-year drought has been declared over, Luciano Pavarotti and Louis Farrakhan have come and gone, there was a massacre of job seekers outside a factory and the Truth Commission geared  up to investigate years of crimes committed in the name of apartheid. **********But who knew? All one has been hearing for weeks is: Bafana Bafana! **********Bafana Bafana is the nickname bestowed on South Africa's national soccer team, which is primarily black but has a white captain, by its doting fans watching the African Cup of Nations. Literally, it means \"the boys, the boys\" or even \"boy boys.\" **********There's been grumbling that this is insulting to a bunch of grown men, even if what they do is run around in polyester underwear kicking a ball.  There are  mutterings that it carries the patronizing overtones of the bad old days. As a result, there are newspaper contests: \"Win 10,000 Rand!

In the first game, the fans were relieved when it easily beat well-respected Cameroon 3-0 -- it meant that South Africa, appearing for the first time in the African Cup of Nations, the continent's biggest sports event, wouldn't embarrass the nation. **********Then, playing desultorily, it lost 1-0 to Egypt and barely beat Angola 1-0. The fans began to worry. But it had still qualified for the quarterfinals, where it won a 2-1 thriller against Algeria in a hard rain that saw two offsetting goals scored in less than 30 seconds just at the close of the game. **********Outside the stadium afterward, whole sections of the crowd were still shouting \"Shoooooes! Feesh!  Shoooooes! Feesh!\" back and forth -- the game's heroes were Mark Fish and John (Shoes) Moshoeu. **********On Wednesday night, the boys thrashed the tournament favorite, Ghana (rhymes  with \"Bafana\"), 3 to 0. South Africa has 11 official languages and, on the radio, the game seemed to be on in every one. There was dancing in the streets in Soweto. **********On Saturday, they are to play Tunisia for the championship. Tunisia is ranked only No. 6 in Africa, while Ghana was ranked No. 1. Mr. Sexwale, who will be in  Switzerland on his way to the United States, said he would leave standing orders for a victory parade through Johannesburg -- win, lose or draw. **********It's already been forgotten that the defending champions, Nigeria, aren't even here. Nigeria's leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, snubbed the contest because Mr. Mandela called for sanctions after nine dissidents were executed in Nigeria. **********This tournament is the third sports triumph in a year to help unite the races in South Africa. First there was the Springboks World Cup rugby victory last year. Rugby's traditionally Afrikaner fans were gratified to see Mr. Mandela don a green Springbok shirt. **********Today, as if in gratitude, the leading Afrikaans-language newspaper, Beeld, had a huge picture of a soccer game on its front page. More amazingly, the headline was in Zulu: \"Yebo Bafana Bafana!\" (\"Yebo,\" pronounced \"YAY-boh,\" means \"yeah.\") **********In November and December, the national cricket squad -- most of whose fans are English-speaking whites and Indians -- slowly overcame a series of eye-closing draws to soundly thump England. **********Now, as soccer -- the \"black sport\" -- has come to the forefront, many television sets in laps at cricket matches have been tuned to it, and with each  Bafana Bafana victory, there have been more whites in F.N.B. Stadium outside Soweto. This is seen as an act of courage in some quarters, but in fact, there's a lot more soccer hooliganism in England. **********One of the most endearing images of this tournament came as Mr. Mandela visited the team to wish it well.  He walked out in front of the TV cameras holding hands with Neil Tovey, the team's captain. All over Africa, black men who are friends hold hands. Uptight whites do not. **********And soccer fever is catching on in the white suburbs.

We were restating our policy.'' He added that British officials were still prepared to talk to Sinn Fein privately about the situation. **********Some officials and analysts in Dublin and Belfast said Mr. Major's statement could provoke the I.R.A. to new attacks like the series of bombings that broke the 17-month cease-fire in February. **********''Nothing is moving in the peace process now,'' said one Belfast analyst, adding that I.R.A. members were now talking about a new attack in England. **********The British Army today safely disposed of a 2,000-pound car bomb of the type used by the I.R.A., parked near the city of Armagh in Northern Ireland. No organization claimed responsibility for placing the bomb. **********Mr. Major was responding to a new set of proposals sent to him by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, and John Hume, the prominent mainstream Roman Catholic leader in the North. The proposals indicated that a restored cease-fire would be likely if Britain agreed to follow it immediately by admitting Sinn Fein to the broad-based talks under the chairmanship of former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine. Those talks, in Belfast, have been stalled. **********But Mr. Major said that first he would have to be convinced that the cease-fire was permanent, which would be tantamount to an I.R.A. declaration that its campaign of violence had ended forever. Such a guarantee, the Prime Minister said in Parliament, would then lead to a series of bilateral talks with Sinn Fein, but not to immediate agreement to let the party enter the broad-based talks, which began on June 10. **********Martin McGuinness, the second-ranking official in Sinn Fein, said on Friday that the British ''have moved the goal posts once again,'' making it ''extremely difficult for Sinn Fein to get into the peace negotiations.'' **********He said the promise of talks between Sinn Fein and British officials amounted to ''all sorts of stalls and delays.'' But he concluded in an interview with the BBC that ''we in Sinn Fein will not give up.'' **********''We will continue our peace policy,'' he said, ''because dialogue and negotiations are essential.'' **********Some officials said Mr. Major's statement did not preclude a new cease-fire and eventual admission of Sinn Fein to the talks. **********Mr. Hume and Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Minister, said the ''doors remain open'' despite Mr. Major's remarks. **********Mr. Major and Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland are to discuss the situation on Dec. 9 in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/business/business-digest-061506.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Giant Omnicom Ad Agency Agrees to Buy Ketchum The Omnicom Group agreed to buy Ketchum Communications, the 25th-largest American advertising agency, with more than $1 billion in billings.

He sent the clearest signal yet that he may block the bill, and singled out the broadcasting issue as the one section of the huge bill where he had serious objections.

The law prohibits the states where the pensions were earned from reaching beyond their borders to tax retirees. California expects to lose $25 million a year, and New York, $9 million.

Much of what happens next will depend on how he convinces the Palestinians to accept the idea that  the Israeli pledges might be for real. **********Mr. Netanyahu had the easier sell to his constituents, since the plan adopted was essentially the one he had come with. But the more important question was whether he had recognized that further equivocation was impossible, and that gaining a temporary advantage over Mr. Arafat was not the same as precluding the next explosion. Leaving Mr. Arafat defeated would clear the field for more radical, rejectionist Palestinian factions. **********Given the formidable differences and tensions in which the summit meeting began, it was hardly a negligible achievement bringing Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat face to face for several hours and drawing from them a commitment to immediate and intensive negotiations on Israeli withdrawal from Hebron. **********Mr. Netanyahu had agreed to meet Mr. Arafat only once before, and his first 100 days in office had seen almost no movement on the Palestinian-Israeli peace accords. **********But Mr. Clinton's pleas forcibly reaffirmed that this summit session was not one of those innumerable meetings, shuttles and declarations intended only to ''put the peace process back on track,'' but rather a desperate attempt to put out a fire before it turned into a conflagration. **********With the West Bank and the Gaza Strip clamped in a vise of Israeli Army armor and Israeli soldiers under orders to shoot if attacked, the potential for carnage was evident. **********The clashes in Hebron today augured another funeral, more stones, harder positions. And the efforts of the spin doctors in Washington were not likely to alter the sense among Palestinians that their chief had lost the diplomatic battle. **********Mr. Arafat's grim and angry expression as he sat alongside Mr. Netanyahu while Mr. Clinton spoke was more eloquent than any comment. **********The arrangement for continuous talks spelled out by Mr. Clinton was essentially Mr. Netanyahu's original position. The Palestinian demands for a gesture, a concession, produced nothing, not even a vague time frame for withdrawing from Hebron, let alone the firm deadline pressed upon the Israelis by Mr. Clinton. With nothing to display except his anger, Mr. Arafat canceled his scheduled news conference. **********The Palestinians had been convinced that the violence of last week, in which their casualties were many times greater than the Israelis', had finally alerted the world to their plight. They read the global demands that Israel close the disputed entrance to a tourist tunnel, the widespread recognition of their frustration, the active intervention of the United States, the United Nations resolution, as levers that would compel Mr. Netanyahu to make a concrete demonstration that he would at last move ahead on the peace. **********But it is one of the maddening features of the cyclical crises of the Middle East that the perceptions of the competing sides rarely coincide. To Mr. Netanyahu -- and as polls showed, to a large number of Israelis -- the salient aspect of the violence was that Palestinians had used the arms that Israel allotted them under their accords to kill Israeli soldiers. **********Israelis initially assailed Mr. Netanyahu for his poor judgment in opening the tunnel and in allowing frustrations among Palestinians to rise to a boiling point. But it was not long before they began to reflect indignation with the Palestinians and to perceive the tunnel as a Jewish stake to Jerusalem, and therefore never to be closed. **********A poll by the daily Maariv on Monday found that 60 percent of Israelis questioned believed that the tunnel should stay open, and 66 percent thought it had been an error to arm the Palestinians. **********Even stronger was the conviction of Mr. Netanyahu's religious and nationalist constituency that the violence had been deliberately fomented by their nemesis, Mr. Arafat, and that he could not be allowed to ''reap the fruits'' of such impudence. **********To this constituency, the cries of the Palestinians and much of the rest of the world were part of the mendacious propaganda that Israel and the Jews have endured at every stage of their history. In times of crisis, they held, Jews stand alone and must stand firm. **********While the right wing was certain to assail Mr. Netanyahu even for meeting Mr. Arafat and committing himself to a withdrawal from Hebron, there was no question that for now, Mr. Netanyahu held the political upper hand. **********The hope of those who have been impatient with Mr. Netanyahu was that he may now choose to spend some of that political capital. With the international censure now behind him, one diplomat speculated, with an apparent victory in Washington and with a greater first-hand understanding of the dangers Mr. Arafat lives with, Mr. Netanyahu may feel free to move ahead. **********There were at least suggestions from the Israeli camp that the long tete-a-tete had improved Mr. Netanyahu's image of Mr. Arafat. **********So possibly, as Mr. Clinton said, the potential for agreement was finally there. The ''continual negotiations'' that the summit meeting decreed was a technique that had worked before, at Camp David for President Jimmy Carter, and at Taba in Sinai for Shimon Peres last year when he was Israeli Foreign Minister. The idea was to seal negotiators off from the pressures of the world until they had a deal. **********This time, with tanks at the ready and Palestinian tempers at the boiling point, the fuse seemed shorter. **********That was the message of the summit meeting. Mr. Clinton said, ''I would say that the problems that exploded last week in violence are still there, the differences are still there, but I believe there is a higher level of trust than existed before these talks began.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/business/worldbusiness/IHT-paris-postpones-rail-restructuring.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-06", "snippet": "PARIS \u2014 The government said Tuesday it was postponing plans to create a company to take over the track and other infrastructure of the state railroad company SNCF..A spokesman for the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer said other planned chang", "word_count": 1188, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paris Postpones Rail Restructuring", "print_headline": "Paris Postpones Rail Restructuring", "body_text": " **********PARIS \u2014 The government said Tuesday it was postponing plans to create a company to take over the track and other infrastructure of the state railroad company SNCF. **********A spokesman for the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer said other planned changes at the company, such as splitting it into separate operations and maintenance divisions, were going ahead. **********On Monday, the SNCF president, Louis Gallois, announced an ambitious program aimed at winning back passengers and increasing the company's profitability. **********The government earlier said it would place all of SNCF's track under a new rail network in exchange for wiping out 125 billion francs ($24.42 billion) of the railroad's debt, much of it from investments in new high-speed routes. **********The agreement, which was to have gone into effect Jan. 1, was considered afactor in enabling the SNCF to restructure its operations.

Last April, 40 pounds of explosives intended for  the conservative leader blew up just yards short of his bulletproof car. Mr. Aznar climbed from the wreck largely unscathed, brushed off his clothes and walked to a nearby hospital. **********On Sunday he was tested again when he lived up to his pledge to run Spain's longtime Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, out of office. But when the final results were in, instead of celebrating a sweeping victory, Mr. Aznar, a former  tax inspector from Madrid, found himself caught in a labyrinth. **********The narrow conservative victory has disappointed many Aznar supporters and elated the Socialists, who had feared a more humiliating defeat. In the end, Mr. Aznar got 38.8 percent of the vote, only 1.4 percent more than Mr. Gonzalez, a difference of 340,000 of the more than 25 million votes cast. **********On television and in news conferences, Mr. Gonzalez has been beaming like the winner, and Mr. Aznar has looked despondent. \"Never has a defeat been so sweet,  and never has a victory been so bitter,\" a smiling Mr. Gonzalez said today. **********Twenty seats short of a parliamentary majority, Mr. Aznar, leader of the Popular Party, will have to stoop and make deals with heads of other, smaller parties. None are people whom Mr. Aznar is known to admire. Some he has scorned  openly. **********Typically, Mr. Aznar has seemed unperturbed. Announcing that he had won, he said that the country \"has begun a new chapter in its history.\" **********Spain's political shift to the right is indeed a major turnabout after 13 years under Socialist rule. But asked how Mr. Aznar was feeling, one of his aides said: \"He is fine. He's in a fine mess.\" In private, his aides concede that Spain's new era may bring much bickering and possible instability. **********When cartoonists have portrayed Spain's two principal politicians, they have  drawn the Socialist Mr. Gonzalez, a somewhat pudgy but seductive orator from Seville, as a snake charmer. Mr. Aznar, a slightly built Castilian and an awkward speaker, has been depicted as a marionette. **********Yet what binds these two very different men now is their dependence on the same well-known Spanish political figure, a Catalan. For the past 30 months, while Mr. Gonzalez was leading a minority government, he was beholden to Jordi Pujol, president of the Catalan regional government, whose party had the votes he needed in Parliament. Now it is Mr. Aznar's turn to depend on the Catalan's 16 seats to form a government. Even then he may have to turn to the Canary Islands or another small regional group. **********Mr. Pujol, a former banker, is said to savor the role of kingmaker. But so far his answer to Mr. Aznar has been no. **********In the way stands what friends call the forthright manner of Mr. Aznar and critics describe as his lack of political savvy. For the past 30 months he has been unrelenting in his criticism of Mr. Pujol's support of the Gonzalez Government. **********\"He has been attacking us for the past three years,\" said Pere Esteve, a Catalan political leader. \"This cannot be fixed in two days. The only thing that has changed since March 3 is that they have stopped insulting us.\" **********Begging for support and having to make concessions is hard for a man as proud as Mr. Aznar, according to his friends. He takes pride in his own tenacious efforts to bring young people into the party and pull it away from the far right. His friends have often heard him say that he has never asked anyone for favors, so he is not indebted to anyone. Miguel Angel Rodriguez, his press chief, said that his independence helped him survive. **********When Mr. Aznar took over the right-wing Popular Alliance in 1989 and renamed  it the Popular Party, he got a telephone call from a senior member of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy, asking him, as a Catholic politician, to issue  a public statement against abortion. \"His reply was, 'I shall, if you will seek  votes for the Popular Party in the Sunday Mass,' \" Mr. Rodriguez said. **********Even on the eve of the elections, Mr. Aznar was reported to have not made any Cabinet preparations. \"He has never promised anyone anything,\" said one of his collaborators, \"except his wife when he married her.\" **********Mr. Aznar spends his spare time largely with his wife, Ana Botella, a lawyer  like him, and their three children. He also plays a weekly game of paddle tennis with his friend Pedro Ramirez, the editor of the conservative daily newspaper El Mundo, which has dug up most of the corruption and political scandals involving  the Gonzalez administration. **********One question often asked here is why the solemn and stiff Mr. Aznar has a large following among women. **********\"He is not the classic Spanish macho and he has a lot of integrity,\" said Cristina Loring, member of a prominent Madrid publishing family. Amalia Gomez, a member of Parliament from Mr. Aznar's party, said: \"As a woman, I feel very good in this party. He has promoted many women. He believes in equality.\" **********Mr. Aznar, 43, was born in Madrid and comes from a family of conservative political journalists. A grandfather of Mr. Aznar was an important chronicler of Franco's side in the civil war and both his grandfather and his father held government jobs during the Franco dictatorship. **********This family history may be one reason why Mr. Aznar insists so often that his conservatism is modern, close to the center, with no links to the dark demons of Spain's fascist past. **********On the eve of the elections, Mr. Aznar was asked on nationwide television if  it was true that there was \"a whole Jurassic Park\" of old, hardline rightists hiding behind him, waiting to jump out after the elections. Mr. Aznar, not finding this funny, replied solemnly, \"In Spain the far right no longer exists.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/04/world/with-its-drug-binge-over-cali-seeks-salvation-in-old-values.html": {"writer_name": "Diana Schemo", "pub_date": "1996-12-04", "snippet": "Old go-go economy of Cali, Colombia, is struggling to overcome vacuum left by drug-related businesses that have been stopped cold, with most-wanted drug kingpins dead or under arrest and with Government debating bill to seize assets of drug dealer...", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Its Drug Binge Over, Cali Seeks Salvation in Old Values", "print_headline": "With Its Drug Binge Over, Cali Seeks Salvation in Old Values", "body_text": " **********The abundance of plastic surgeons still recalls the fast money that flooded this second-string city, nerve center of the world's $150 billion annual trade in illegal drugs. **********But with Colombia's most-wanted drug kingpins dead or under arrest, Cali's old go-go economy is struggling to overcome the vacuum left by drug-related businesses stopped cold. As the Colombian Congress debates a bill to seize the assets of drug dealers, kidnappers and thieves, Cali's construction industry has screeched to a halt, and apartments and buildings remain unsold at a fraction of their original asking prices. **********Because of a new law closing bars and restaurants at 1 A.M., the renowned salsa and rumba palaces have taken on a note of moderation.

The city is trying to soak up the sudden unemployment that smashing the drug cartels' traditional organizations left among unskilled laborers. He has started programs to make English mandatory in public schools, and paid tuition to private schools for 16,000 children for whom public schools had no room. **********The fear that once caused the drug dealers to be given a wide berth when they barreled down the streets has abated. Traffic disputes are less frequently settled with gunfire. Violent deaths, which peaked at 120 per year per 100,000 residents, nearly twice the national average in a country that is already one of the world's most murderous, have gone down by about 25 percent. **********''People were afraid to go out on Friday nights,'' said Oscar Echeverri, a former World Bank official who has been studying the patterns of violence in Cali for the Valle Business Committee. ''The city was literally taken over by drug dealers in 1989.'' **********Gildardo Orozcol, a taxi driver, noted that despite the generally violent atmosphere, many people went into the service of the drug dealers because they offered good-paying jobs. ''They really threw money around,'' he said. **********Mayor Guzman estimates that the drug-related businesses accounted for 25 percent of Cali's economy. The notoriety has been so pervasive, the Mayor quipped, that when he speaks at international forums, people hush up and listen. ''They're expecting a barbarian, a real savage, but I show them the other side,'' he said. **********While the Government has begun  works projects, the private sector has become more involved with government.

Visa insists that retailers that accept its credit cards must also accept the check cards. **********The suit, filed last Friday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, contends that the merchants must pay a fee for check card transactions that is almost as high as the fee on credit card transactions -- typically between 1.5 percent and 3 percent of the purchase price. **********The two chains contend that the debit cards can be used as if they were credit cards or cash cards of the type used in automated teller machines. But if they are used as cash cards, the fees paid by merchants should be 10 cents a transaction, the suit says. **********The only difference, the suit contends, is that if the purchase is handled like an A.T.M. withdrawal in which the customer enters a personal identification number, then the lower fee is charged. If the consumer simply signs a charge slip, the merchant pays the higher credit card fee. **********The lawsuit estimates that banks received $250 million in such fees last year. **********''The fees charged for Visa Check are exorbitant, fixed and maintained at supra-competitive levels only through the coercive force of the tying arrangement,'' the suit said. **********Visa, in a statement, said there was no merit to the case and defended its rule requiring merchants to honor all Visa cards equally. **********For an antitrust suit to be successful, the retailers would have to prove that credit cards and debit cards are separate markets and that Visa so dominates the credit card market it can force customers to take debit cards they otherwise do not want to accept. **********In the past, Visa has successfully defended other antitrust cases by arguing that credit cards are a small part of the much larger market for payments, which includes cash and checks. **********''Wal-Mart and Limited have a plausible argument, but it is really a jump ball case,'' said Donald I. Baker, the former head of the antitrust unit of the Justice Department. **********Banks like the debit card product because it reduces their costs of handling paper checks and, more important, they like the fees they receive from merchants. **********At the end of June, there were 38 million Visa Check cards in circulation, up 49 percent from a year earlier. There were 495 million transactions on those cards in the first half of the year, up 61 percent from a year ago.

The Pope rebuked several Catholic priests who held Government positions, and his homily at an evening Mass was drowned out by Sandinista militants shouting, \"Power to the people!\" **********Today joyous Nicaraguans, many wearing the yellow and white colors of the Vatican, paraded festively through the streets, and 150,000 jammed a downtown square to hear the Pope say Mass. Sandinista party members joined in the welcome, and no disturbances or protests were reported. **********The warm reception heightened the sense of victory surrounding John Paul's trip this week to Central America. In Nicaragua and El Salvador, he came back to countries that have achieved peace after civil wars, and where the Vatican has reimposed its control over local Catholic churches where the radical activism of liberation theology formerly held sway. **********Political violence in Guatemala has subsided, and the new President there, Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, is a Catholic after years of strong evangelical Protestant influence in the Government. **********During the service in Managua, the Pope departed spontaneously from his prepared comments to say that at the time of his last visit, Nicaragua as \"a shooting gallery for the superpowers.\" **********\"There was noise . . . it was a great dark night,\" he said, referring to the  earlier visit. \"Today we celebrated the Eucharist under the sun.\" **********The Pope praised the return of \"authentic religious freedom\" and said the country had recovered its \"sovereign, Christian, Nicaraguan\" identity. **********Chants reverberated throughout the crowd, \"Pope John Paul!

He called on Nicaraguan children to obey their parents and on the clergy to respect the church hierarchy. **********Six years ago, President Chamorro defeated Mr. Ortega in presidential elections, removing the Sandinistas from power. Most of the country lives in peace, but the devastated economy has not revived. **********Mrs. Chamorro's Government is close to the Archbishop of Managua, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, who enjoyed strong backing from the Pope John Paul during his years of confrontation with the Sandinistas. The Cardinal drew several rounds of applause from the crowd during today's Mass. **********Prominent Sandinista leaders, on the other hand, were absent. Miguel D'Escoto, a Catholic priest who served as the Sandinista foreign minister, was reported to be in the United States. **********Tuesday night, a small stick of dynamite was tossed from a passing car at a crowded church in the city of Masaya, 18 miles southeast of Managua, causing fright but no damage. **********Police are investigating 18 other bombings at churches this year, which damaged buildings but caused no injuries. A group of Sandinista party followers  were convicted in one bombing case, but Sandinista leaders have strongly denied  they are behind the attacks. **********Mr. Ortega put up a huge billboard along the Pope's route today bearing his personal welcome. Mr. Ortega himself was in Cuba today undergoing medical treatment for a heart problem. Many rank-and-file Sandinista supporters also stayed away, and the turnout was smaller by several thousands than it was in 1983. **********The Pope appeared to be buoyed by the swaying tropical music and cries of support.

The artifacts include Afro hairdos, hot pants, platform shoes and, of course, those  deft disco dance steps. **********The trend speaks to the ability of agencies to synthesize -- which is a polite way of saying to swipe from -- the popular culture, where a 70's revival  as intense as a party at Studio 54 has been under way for some time. There are midnight theater screenings of \"Saturday Night Fever,\" designer apparel based on the wardrobe Ali McGraw wore in \"Love Story,\" appreciations of so-called blaxploitation films like \"Shaft\" and \"Foxy Brown\" and the return of pulsating dance music to radio stations like WKTU-FM in New York. **********\"The 70's are back and no one can stop them!\" said Joshua Katz, senior vice president for marketing at the VH1 cable television network in New York, which is owned by Viacom Inc.

Being guilt-free is a good idea to associate with a product -- and  there's a generational space that exists between now and then that makes it safe to go back in the water.\" **********Among those taking the plunge are executives at the Pillsbury unit of Grand Metropolitan in Minneapolis who market the Old El Paso line of Mexican food products. **********The decade is \"fun, upbeat, memorable and something everybody can relate to,\" said Ken Stickevers, business team leader for Old El Paso meal products.

For instance, a television commercial  uses the 1978 song \"Disco Inferno\" by the Trammps to declare the Nissan 200SX to be \"the sports car for today's world.\" That spot, by the TBWA Chiat/Day unit of  the Omnicom Group in Venice, Calif., implies that competitive models perform like sports cars of the 70's at the gas pump. **********What next after 70's fever? \"Songs from the 80's in spots in 2000,\" Mr. Duchovic predicted. \"Maybe rap will be retro then.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/06/business/holt-ross-merges-with-dkb.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-09-06", "snippet": "DKB & Partners and Holt & Ross Inc merge to form agency, using DKB & Partners name; terms not disclosed; Gary J Davis, president and chief executive of DKB, will contininue in those roles in merged firm (S)", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Holt & Ross Merges With DKB", "print_headline": "Holt & Ross Merges With DKB", "body_text": " **********DKB & Partners, an advertising and public relations agency in Morristown, N.J., and Holt & Ross Inc., a public relations agency in Far Hills, N.J., have merged to form an agency, using the DKB & Partners name, with combined billings estimated at more than $50 million.

McCaw. **********Mr. Robbins, the chief executive of Cox Communications, oversees the nation's fifth-largest cable operator. And while he remains enthusiastic about serving Cox's 3.2 million subscribers, he really comes to life in describing the company's foray into wireless telephone service. **********Along with Sprint and two other big cable companies eager to break into the  local phone business, Cox has invested $2.1 billion for licenses to offer a new  cellular service, called personal communications services, or P.C.S. The partners -- the other two are Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast -- are spending $2 billion more to build a national network capable of reaching 144 million people. **********\"Wireless is absolutely exploding,\" Mr. Robbins said. **********Three weeks after President Clinton signed a bill uncorking competition in the telecommunications industry, the battle among local and long-distance phone  companies and cable operators has taken an unexpected turn. Rather than waging a ground war for each other's wired network, many companies now seem intent on taking their battles to the skies -- trying to infiltrate the well-protected markets of their rivals by beaming telephone or television signals directly to customers. **********\"People ask when local competition is going to happen; that's the wrong question,\" said David J. Roddy, chief telecommunications economist at Deloitte & Touche, the big accounting and consulting firm. \"The real question is: When is wireless competition going to happen? The answer is: now.\" **********Mr. Roddy said Americans spent roughly $22 billion on wireless services in 1995, and he expects that to double by the turn of the century. **********Long-distance carriers are particularly keen on catching the air wave, because they have national networks but lack direct connections to individual telephone and cable households. Late last month AT&T announced that it would invest $137.5 million in a satellite broadcasting service, DirecTV. A week later MCI paid $682 million for an orbital slot to offer its own high-powered satellite broadcasting service. And just last week, Sprint and its cable partners reorganized their alliance to focus on wireless, rather than wired services -- even changing the venture's name to Sprint Spectrum, an allusion to  the radio-frequency spectrum used by wireless services. **********Meanwhile a frenzied Federal Communications Commission auction continues in Washington for an additional round of P.C.S. licenses, with the total bids approaching $7 billion through last Friday. **********To be sure, the popularity of wireless stems partly from the fact that the business has already grown so rapidly. The cellular industry that made Mr. McCaw so rich went from almost nothing in 1980 to a $20 billion business last year. And in the last few years, refinements in digital technology have also made wireless transmission suitable for a broader range of services, including computer-precise television transmissions and high-speed data transfer. **********But the current craze also reflects a more sober business reality: Even after the telecommunications market is fully deregulated, the high cost of stringing wires or laying cables, and the expected resistance of the local cable and phone-wire monopolies to interlopers, will make it tough for long-distance carriers, local telephone companies, or cable operators to break into each other's traditional land-line markets. **********\"It is very hard to develop a wired strategy,\" said William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive of the Sprint Corporation. \"You can pursue a wireless strategy far more easily.\" **********Consider Sprint's strategy for breaking into the $90 billion local phone market. As part of its original cable alliance, Sprint's partners were supposed  to upgrade their coaxial cable television networks to begin carrying telephone traffic. Earlier this month, however, the partners dropped the wired component of the deal, in part because they feared that the schedule for renovating their  networks -- 10 million homes by the end of 1996 -- was overly ambitious. **********Some analysts said the decision stemmed from a more basic fear -- that the cable industry might never be able to compete economically for local phone customers. Already, cable companies have locked horns with regional Bell companies in negotiations over issues like how much they should pay for handing  off calls to the Bell network. **********\"I think there could still be a tremendous revenue stream from telephony,\" said Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast. \"But until all these issues shake out, it's prudent to keep your options open.\" **********Just as the cable industry has qualms about taking on the Bell companies, the Baby Bells have lagged behind in their efforts to go after the cable industry. Several of the Bells announced plans a few years ago to upgrade their copper-wire networks to carry video services. But while Bell Atlantic is still rolling out a small video service over phone lines in Dover Township, N.J., most of the other efforts have quietly disappeared. **********And though both AT&T and MCI have tried to get a direct link to households by broaching deals with cable operators like Tele-Communications or Time Warner, neither has succeeded. **********By plunging into the satellite broadcasting business, however, AT&T and MCI will eventually be able to beam 150 channels of programming directly from satellites to pizza-pan-sized dishes on rooftops. So far, direct-broadcast services have only two million subscribers in this country. But with the muscle  of AT&T and MCI, some analysts estimated that the industry would have 10 million customers by 2000. **********If anything, the local telephone business is even harder to penetrate than cable. The Baby Bells own the wires that snake into most American households. And would-be rivals like long-distance carriers face an unappetizing choice. They can either negotiate to lease capacity on the local network, try to duplicate the network or find ways to bypass it. **********\"If you want to duplicate that kind of a network, you've got to dig up streets or put up ugly telephone poles,\" said Lee Cox, the president of Air Touch Cellular, the wireless company that was spun off from Pacific Telesis, a regional Bell company. \"We're shooting an arrow straight at the target, and there are no front lawns or streets in the way.\" **********So far cellular has been too expensive to become a viable competitor to local phone service. But personal communications services may have a better shot. **********P.C.S. networks, using digital radio transmissions for voice and data communications via small hand-held devices, can serve many more customers simultaneously than current cellular networks. That fact, and the cut-throat competition as several wireless companies compete in many of the larger metropolitan markets, should result in prices much lower than cellular companies have typically offered. **********In the first P.C.S. auction, AT&T, like Sprint, was a heavy bidder for licenses, spending $1.6 billion for a potential market of 107 million people. Add that to AT&T's cellular franchises through its 1994 acquisition of McCaw Cellular, and the company has considerable ammunition in its battle to bypass the Bells. **********For their part, the Bells are also seizing on wireless as a weapon to compete for customers outside their regions. Air Touch Communications is part of a four-company alliance -- including Bell Atlantic, Nynex, and U S West -- that paid $1.1 billion for P.C.S. licenses. **********And some Baby Bells are using wireless as a stalking horse for their foray into long-distance. SBC Communications, formerly Southwestern Bell, recently filed for permission to offer long-distance service in 16 states, including New York. SBC has chosen states where it already owns cellular franchises operating under the Cellular One name -- a brand that SBC plans to use for marketing long-distance services. **********Still, not every telephone executive thinks the future is wireless. Richard C. Notebaert, the chief executive of Ameritech, has largely eschewed the costly  wireless investments of his Bell brethren. Mr. Notebaert said he was spending the bulk of Ameritech's capital resources -- $2 billion a year -- to upgrade the company's existing wired network with fiber optics for data services, and in some cases to build coaxial cable television systems alongside the phone networks. **********\"You won't know for five years whether P.C.S. was a good investment or a bad  investment,\" Mr. Notebaert said. **********Given that the telephone industry is spending $30 billion on P.C.S. and other forms of wireless communications, the next five years promise to be nerve-racking ones indeed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/01/business/dissidents-call-mesa-bid-artificially-low.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1996-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dissidents Call Mesa Bid Artificially Low", "print_headline": "Dissidents Call Mesa Bid Artificially Low", "body_text": " **********Dissident shareholders of Mesa Inc. have accused the company's board of inflicting a nearly $150 million penalty on stockholders to sell control to Richard E.

The latest skirmishing takes place in the pages of a proxy  statement, filed late on Monday, that includes the proposed deal with Mr. Rainwater and letters from the hostile investors. **********The company responded to the shareholders by noting that the dissidents, led by David Batchelder, Mesa's former president, had tried but failed to win preferential treatment of their own: a $3 million payment in return for ceasing  their hostilities. Though the Batchelder group, according to Mesa, cited the \"expenses\" related to its Mesa investments, such payments have often been termed greenmail. **********The battle for control of Mesa has pitted Mesa's chairman and chief executive, T. Boone Pickens, who once led many a profitable corporate takeover attempt, against investors who criticize Mr. Pickens's substantial compensation  at a time when the stock price has languished. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Rainwater proposal at the company's annual meeting in June. **********Mr. Pickens has argued that the Rainwater offer is the best available. **********Analysts agreed that Mr. Rainwater was allowed to invest in Mesa at a discount to its market value, because he is a friendly investor, a white knight  willing to rescue an embattled company and chief executive. **********\"I assume there were different terms available for a friendly or an unfriendly deal,\" said Sal Ilacqua, an analyst at Rothschild Inc. **********But Mr. Ilacqua is among those who give some credence to the company's view that Mr. Rainwater's offer was the best hope for a company nearly suffocating from more than $1 billion in debt. \"The deal is not that great for shareholders,\" he said. \"The question is what the alternatives were.\" **********Analysts say that the dissidents, who once owned 9.4 percent of Mesa's stock  but held less as of their most recent reports, are more likely to succeed in embarrassing Mr. Pickens than in defeating his proposed sale to Mr. Rainwater. **********Mr. Rainwater has promised to invest as much as $265 million in Mesa, sharply diluting the stakes of current shareholders unless they put up more cash. He would receive four of seven seats on the board. The company, which is based in the Dallas suburb of Irving, Tex., said it had spent months trying to find buyers for the whole company or its properties, primarily natural gas fields and production systems. **********Joel L. Reed, an aide to Mr. Batchelder and a board member, said in a letter  that the full board had received the offer from Mr. Rainwater on Feb. 27, only two days before a cease-fire agreement was to lapse and the dissidents could have nominated a new board. Mr. Rainwater's plan was accepted on Feb. 29 with just hours to go, Mr. Reed said. **********Dorn Parkinson, another dissident board member, calculated that Mr. Rainwater was buying in at a $100 million discount to current market value in a deal that  would incur another $50 million in prepayment penalties on Mesa debt. \"Our shareholders deserve better than the proposed acquisition,\" he said. **********The company responded in the proxy statement that Mr. Rainwater's gains were  a result of the recent increase in Mesa's stock price. The shares, which traded  as low as $2.625 on April 1, closed at $3.875 today, unchanged for the day.

James Koch, insisted on letting the small investor in on the deal. **********''I wanted to give the people who had made Boston Beer the leading craft brewer in American a chance,'' Mr. Koch said recently. **********In a deal announced on its bottles, a nice bit of advertising, the Boston Beer Company allowed each small investor to buy one unit of 33 shares for $495, or $15 a share. **********Given that small investors often cannot get a new stock until it is trading at levels far higher than the initial public offering price, it is no surprise that the response was enthusiastic. ''We could have done the whole deal this way,'' Mr. Koch said. **********The initiative won Boston Beer lots of applause. ''We think it's a fantastic example of how I.P.O.'s should be available to individual investors,'' said Gerri Detweiler of the National Council of Individual Investors. Small investors often get only a tenth of the shares in new issues, but Mr. Koch set aside one-quarter, or nearly a million shares. **********Sadly for the investors, Boston Beer's stock has since gone flat. It closed Friday at $11.75, leaving the buyers of the units with a 22 percent paper loss on their $15-a-share bargain. Faced with a proliferation of specialty brewers and competition from big beer makers like Anheuser-Busch, investors began to wonder just how much Boston Beer could grow and which companies could survive. And last month, the company announced that growth was slowing. **********This sounds like the story of many popular new stocks, which lose their froth at the first difficulty. Even at $15, Boston Beer stock was priced at more than 50 times its earnings per share over the previous year. ''Companies tend to go public when industry fundamentals are strong,'' said Robert S. Natale, the editor of Standard & Poor's Emerging and Special Situations newsletter. ''You had a very strong and growing market for specialty beers'' then, he said. **********But Boston Beer's small investors appear to be a devoted bunch. While such investors are often accused of selling their shares quickly, Mr. Koch estimates that two-thirds of the 30,000 people who took up his unusual offer last year still hold their shares. **********Of course, these people are not necessarily the same as the small, active traders who would scramble to find shares of Netscape Communications or the next hot new issue. Many of the small investors are Boston Beer's loyal drinkers. **********''An investor who buys based on a quality product is more likely to stick with the company and the stock, whether it's Boston Chicken or Boston Beer,'' Mr. Natale said. **********Despite small investors' demand for such offerings, other companies have not rushed to imitate Mr. Koch's democratic ideals. ''You really have to fight the whole system: the investment bankers, the S.E.C., the current regulations,'' said Mr. Koch, noting that Goldman, Sachs, one of his underwriters, refused to handle the consumer deal. ''The entire regulatory system is not set up to allow shares to be available for consumers.'' Goldman Sachs declined to comment. **********Nor was the offering cheap. Because the company had to decide on a price for this consumer offering before the regular offering price was set, the $15 that small investors paid was $5 a share less than the big guys paid. That unintentional shaving cost nearly $5 million. Mr. Koch also said the company spent more than $1 million to print 200,000 prospectuses and to return 100,000 checks when the offer was oversubscribed. **********Though small investors may be unhappy with their stock's performance, Mr. Koch's democratic deal did save them from a far worse hangover. If they had bought in the days after Boston Beer went public, they would have paid a share price in the $30's. **********''It is hard to make money on I.P.O.'s,'' said Ms. Detweiler of the investors group. ''It is harder if the only way to buy I.P.O.'s is after they have gone on the market at a higher price.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/11/business/international-business-after-5-years-of-false-starts-japan-s-economy-is-stirring.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1996-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;After 5 Years of False Starts, Japan's Economy Is Stirring", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;After 5 Years of False Starts, Japan's Economy Is Stirring", "body_text": " **********This winter has lasted five years in Japan, but there is finally talk of an economic spring. **********The stock market is up, corporate profits are rising, and there is plenty of  cash in the banks. Perhaps more important, the long economic chill has forced corporate Japan to re-examine itself and cut costs, and so now companies may be  better poised than before to compete with American and European conglomerates around the globe. **********Most corporations seem to have pretty much restructured themselves and are  able to yield profits,\" said Haruo Shimada, a professor of economics at Keio University. \"They are ready for another attack.\" **********Manufacturers are once again buying equipment, adding product lines and building new plants, and corporations such as Toyota, Hitachi and NEC are scrambling to meet demand. Companies are lifting dividends again, paying more overtime, raising salaries and even widening the narrow crack in the door to new recruits. **********Department stores that were virtually empty for years are doing so much better that they are opening branches across the country. Yasuo Matsushita, the  governor of the central bank, the Bank of Japan, even suggested recently that given the signs of recovery, interest rates could edge up. The discount rate here is now half a percent. **********And though this recovery is not so much built on American-style layoffs, most of Japan's large corporations are beginning to realize that the promise of lifetime employment is one they can no longer afford. **********\"The recession was the trigger for a historic transformation of Japan,\" said  Richard A. Werner, an economist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. **********In the last quarter of 1995, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, compared with the previous quarter. And after several years of near-zero growth, economists are forecasting growth rates of about 3 percent for 1996. Some are even putting Japan's growth rate above that of the United States  and other nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********To be sure, growth this year is still paltry compared with the frenzied pace  decades ago, when the economy expanded nearly 10 percent annually. Nobody seems  to think Japan has any chance of reliving those glory days. **********Moreover, Japan has had enough false starts in the last few years to make every citizen a skeptic, and many economists say they expect the economy to slow down again next year. Depressed property prices and more than $400 billion in sour loans still impose a costly drag on the economy. **********Some experts say that Japan is going to need far more serious reorganizing -- deregulation by the Government, layoffs from companies and greater reliance on technology and innovation by absolutely everybody -- before it can stage a real, lasting comeback. And if Japan continues to gloss over such problems as its aging population, the growth of imports, its cumbersome distribution network and its weak service industry, economic troubles could choke the country as it enters the next century. **********But for now, the psychology of recession seems to be waning, so some consumers dare to spend again -- and that in itself is helping to lift the economy. Last month, for instance, 460 Japanese left on a three-month round-the-world cruise, after doling out up to $140,000 for the package, and they beat out hundreds of other disappointed customers, who have to wait for the 1997 cruise. **********Just as the cruise passengers will spend their yen at ports all over the world, so a rebound in the Japanese economy could be a significant boon to businesses in the United States and elsewhere. Japan has the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, and it is one of America's biggest markets -- for everything from airplanes to wheat to machinery. **********As Japan's economy grows, so will the Japanese appetite for American goods, and this, in turn, could help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and help lift  the American economy. **********Once again, foreign companies are moving to or expanding in Japan, and the economy is beginning to loosen up at the edges to accommodate change and, therefore, more growth, some economists say. **********While most of the initial economic jolt is coming from a Government spending  spree and corporate investment, the revampings that many Japanese companies pursued during hard times may also be paying off at last. Japanese companies have cut costs, retooled plants and moved expensive factories overseas. **********Now, analysts say, profits for Japan's industries are expected to be up at least 18 percent for the 1995 fiscal year, which ended March 31, and much higher for 1996. More important, Japan must deal with a new technological challenge that could provide years of growth: catch up to the West. **********\"The information industry in Japan fully knows it is behind,\" said Jesper Koll, an economist with J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd. \"They recognize they are latecomers and need to catch up. And catching up to the leader is definitely one thing Japan is best at.\" **********Japan is behind the United States in using technology, and everyone acknowledges that this is a handicap. But the situation also means that Japan can have a spurt of growth as it belatedly moves to expand the use of personal computers, electronic mail and the Internet. **********Itsuji Araki, deputy general manager of executive personnel at NKK, one of Japan's largest steelmakers, used to share his job with two other managers. Every day, they would hold meetings to make decisions before writing up reports  to propose to their senior executives. **********Mr. Araki had to make a trip to his boss's office and get approval before he  could take his written proposals all the way up the line to the president. Now,  he can simultaneously send his reports to everyone, and he has taken over the job of three. **********\"Before, in order to give an explanation, I had to get prepared 100 percent,\" Mr. Araki said. \"Now, I can give a rough idea first and, for the details, use E-mail. I save time waiting in the secretary's office for the bosses.\" **********He added: \"In the restroom when I meet my boss, I say, 'I put an E-mail in for you,' and he says, 'I saw that.' \" **********It is not clear how long this recovery may last, and many economists are forecasting slower growth for 1997. But among the signs of an incipient rebound  are these: *The stock market, after tumbling in the early 1990's, has climbed to its highest level in more than four years, up about 50 percent from its nine-year low last July. ***********Corporate profits are up sharply, with forecasts for this year pegged at 30  percent growth or more. ***********Economic indicators, like growth in industrial production and construction orders, are up significantly, amid signs that the economy is being fueled by demand for goods at home, rather than demand for exports. ***********Key surveys of business confidence have turned positive. ***********A measure of stability can be seen in the stronger dollar, which makes Japanese goods cheaper for American buyers. **********The path of the yen, which has greatly affected the fortunes of Japanese exporters, has seesawed over the last 14 months from 100 yen to the dollar, to 80 yen, and back to 107 yen, where it has settled and smoothed the way for Japanese exports. **********The economic hardships, though, have been harsh on Japanese companies, and their hands have been pinned down in many ways by enormous rigidities in the economy and a culture that still makes it difficult for large corporations to dismiss employees. Yet while more change is still needed, Japanese companies have slimmed their ranks and trimmed their sails. **********Take the case of Okuma Ltd., a prominent maker of sophisticated machine tools, which had 2,300 employees at the height of the economic troubles in the early 1990's. **********In two years, the company's monthly order book fell to about $27 million, a quarter of peak levels, and Okuma knew it had to do something to survive. So in  a move that set off debate across the nation and forced its president to resign, Okuma embarked on a ruthless revamping that resulted in the layoff of nearly a third of its work force, or 700 employees. **********\"Our future prospects looked very worrisome,\" said Masahiro Kitajima, a board member at Okuma. **********Okuma started making its own parts, adding simpler, cheaper versions to its product line and broadening its variety of models to attract more sales. By reorganizing and cutting costs, it lowered its break-even point by 25 percent, reducing the level of sales it needs to cover costs and turn a profit. **********The result is that after three consecutive years of losses, Okuma says it will report a profit this fiscal year of about $14 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/04/business/trelleborg-of-sweden-seeks-rubber-company.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-04", "snippet": "Trelleborg AB seeks to buy Horda AB for 276 million Swedish kronor ($41.8 million) (S)", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trelleborg of Sweden Seeks Rubber Company", "print_headline": "Trelleborg of Sweden Seeks Rubber Company", "body_text": " **********Trelleborg A.B., a Swedish mining, metals and rubber products company, said yesterday that it wanted to buy the rubber products company Horda A.B. for 276 million kronor ($41.8 million). **********Horda shareholders with 89.7 percent of the votes in the company have accepted the offer, and Horda's board recommends the bid, Trelleborg said in a statement.

While Nicolae Ceausescu starved the people and let them freeze through hard winters, he ordered 700 architects to erect a so-called People's Palace with reception rooms the size of soccer fields and corridors as wide as streets. **********Renaissance, Rococo, Baroque, Byzantine, Transylvanian -- name it, and the style will be found somewhere in the interior, often mixed up in the same room.  Slabs of pink and white marble line many of the halls, heavily carved oak friezes decorate many of the ceilings and, on the exterior, the artificial stone (they ran out of real stone) that covers the sides and back is beginning to turn black. **********Now an international urban design competition is being held to figure out what to do with this spectacular example of totalitarian architecture, along with the miles of badly designed apartments and leveled spaces that encircle it. **********Tearing the People's Palace down or converting it into a fun fair have been considered but turned down. And even though Bucharest suffers from a severe housing shortage, local architects say the proportions of the People's Palace are all wrong to convert it into apartments. **********\"It is a gargantuan building, there is nothing you can do about that,\" said Mariana Celac, the vice president of the Society of Architects here. \"The competition is about how to make the area around it human and useful. This is like a wound in the city's body, an area of destruction and violence, and we want to heal the wound.\" **********For many Bucharest residents, the People's Palace evokes feelings of revulsion. To make room for it, in the early 1980's Mr. Ceausescu ordered the flattening of some of the city's most valued real estate. Fourteen churches and  monasteries, the Jewish quarter, examples of gracious post-Byzantine and avant-garde architecture, not to mention private homes, were demolished. **********The destruction was run like a military campaign. People recall seeing the dictator's motorcade moving along as, with a flick of a finger, he indicated the blocks he wanted torn down to make way for his palace and its surrounding web of roads and buildings. **********Then legions of architects were called in. None of them, said Nicoleta Toma,  an architect who worked on the project, were given an overall theme. Only Mr. Ceausescu and his favorite architect, Anka Petrescu, were allowed to know what the structure would look like, hence the kitschy hodgepodge interior and the severe exterior, Ms. Toma said. **********Like many architects who worked on Mr. Ceausescu's folly, Ms. Toma said she did so because it was the only job around. As a 30-year-old architect just out of university, designing for the People's Palace was a way to stay in Bucharest, she said. **********Her responsibility was to design a reception room for Mr. Ceausescu's wife, Elena, who was feared as much as her husband. **********\"It was a ridiculous assignment,\" said Ms. Toma, who has submitted a design in the competition to change what she helped create. \"She was a very ugly, very  bad woman who didn't inspire me. All my friends were joking with me, 'How could  you make such nice columns for her?' \" **********Ms. Toma said she imagined other women in leadership positions -- Margaret Thatcher, for example -- as she designed the carved cherry wood interior offset  by beige and rose tapestries. \"I never met Elena Ceausescu. She had her own favorite architect, who was always contradicting Ceausescu's architect.\" **********When the Ceausescus were toppled and executed in 1989, only 60 percent of the interior of the palace was completed. Ever since, there have been arguments over how to finish it and what to use it for. **********The gargantuan halls have been put aside for use as a conference center: Mars, the American candy company, rented one of the smaller rooms for a business meeting this month. The Romanian Parliament is supposed to move in, and the building has been renamed the Palace of the Parliament. But some politicians, particularly from the opposition parties, who hold Ceausescu in contempt, have been reluctant to give their stamp of approval and no sessions have been held there. **********In the meantime, Ms. Toma is hoping the international jury will notice her entry in the first round of judging in the competition, which is to take place in Cannes next month. The jury includes Kenneth Frampton of the United States and distinguished Italian, French and British architects, **********Ms. Toma proposes an overhead monorail to run down the three-mile road that Mr. Ceausescu built as a gateway to his folly. She envisions a glass pyramid that partly encapsulaes the building. She would move a 400-year-old bell tower from a destroyed monastery back into the palace gardens and construct a reflecting pool around it. And she has designed what she calls \"romantic medieval\" bridges to improve traffic flow between the area that was rebuilt by Ceausescu and the rest of Bucharest. **********\"I want people to no longer feel like slaves looking up at that building,\" she said. \"The challenge is how to get it back to the people.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/14/world/struggles-with-the-past.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Struggles With the Past", "print_headline": "Struggles With the Past", "body_text": " **********Nelson Mandela agreed to expand an amnesty to those who planned a bombing campaign to disrupt South Africa's first nonracial elections. **********But on the same day, an anti-apartheid colleague was formally charged with stealing donations made to help victims of apartheid. **********Articles, page 6."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/17/business/the-great-mystery-of-internet-profits.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1996-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Great Mystery of Internet Profits", "print_headline": "The Great Mystery of Internet Profits", "body_text": " **********Luring talent has not been a problem for Mike Slade, president of the Starwave Corporation. The recruits to this startup company in suburban Seattle include refugees from well-paid jobs as editors, writers and advertising executives in New York and as software engineers in Silicon Valley. They have come to be pioneers in the new medium of publishing on the Internet's World Wide Web, to build a business and, if successful, to become rich. **********\"There's a gold-rush mentality in this field,\" Mr. Slade observed. **********So far, however, the rush onto the Web by media companies has produced precious little gold. Besides entrepreneurial upstarts like Starwave, every big  newspaper, magazine and television network has made sizable investments in the last couple of years to master the new computer media. **********Even the software powerhouse Microsoft is betting that it can create a media  business on the Web with efforts ranging from a joint-venture news service with  NBC to an on-line magazine run by Michael Kinsley, former editor of The New Republic. **********Yet in a field still in its infancy, Starwave is viewed by many experts as a  bellwether, an ambitious venture whose early progress suggests how the medium will develop and perhaps become a business. **********Starwave runs the main news room and development studio behind ESPNet Sportszone, the leading sports-news site on the Web. Begun in April 1995, Sportszone -- a joint venture between Starwave and ESPN -- now attracts 230,000 visitors a day, making it one of the more heavily trafficked sites on the Web. It is also a leading recipient of advertising dollars among Web sites,  and Sportszone has added a promising stream of revenues since last August when it began charging for access to certain areas on the service. **********Digital technology enables publishers to offer information or entertainment -- content, in the vernacular of the Internet -- in a seemingly potent combination of text, graphics, audio and video. But the esthetic, commercial and audience-pulling ground rules of the new medium are still uncertain. So the media companies on the Web are nearly all struggling to find a formula for transforming costly experiments into money-making businesses. **********Indeed, for media companies, the Internet today resembles a California gold-mining town in the 1840's, where the saloon and the general store prospered while the miners went broke. It is the suppliers of network access, browsing software and other technological infrastructure that are the equivalents of the  saloon and general store. They seem to have thriving businesses while the suppliers of media content, the miners of the Internet, do not. **********But Starwave is the miner that, to date, has done the most to find and exploit the medium. Starwave is a private company and does not release figures, but insiders say Sportszone now has nearly 40,000 subscribers paying $4.95 a month or $39.95 a year. Others are following Sportszone's example. Recently, publishers including Time Warner, The Wall Street Journal, a unit of Dow Jones & Company and The New York Times Company have all said they would soon begin charging for some of their Web site information. **********\"No one knows if a real media business can be built on the Web,\" said Paul Sagan, president and editor of new media at Time Inc. \"But what Starwave has done proves there is reason to keep slugging away. They have shown you can create good content that people want to see, you can charge for ads and start to build a subscription base -- all the elements of a real business.\" **********Starwave's early success with Sportszone also suggests that special-interest  categories with large potential audiences -- \"big niches,\" analysts say -- are where opportunity lies on the Web. It has been said that the Internet affords \"infinite depths of narrowness,\" and as a subject, sports seems ideally suited to take advantage of that strength. Sportszone has 50,000 hypertext pages, 6,000 pictures, 2,500 audio clips and 1,000 video clips. Its on-screen \"front page\" is redone two dozen times a day. **********Interested in sports statistics? Sportszone has every box score for every game in professional sports going back a year. **********The real lesson to be learned from Sportzone, analysts say, is that to get people to pay for material on the Web, publishers must tap specific subjects of  passionate interest to readers. \"The way to get rich on the Web is to collect a  license fee on an obsession,\" said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a nonprofit research group. **********Deep Pockets Allow A Long-Term View **********Yet Starwave's experience also seems to point to the limits of opportunities  for consumer media on the Web, at least in the early going. In addition to ESPNet Sportszone, Starwave has Web-based services for entertainment news, family advice and outdoor pursuits. **********Its entertainment service, Mr. Showbiz, for example, is one of the company's  longer-term investments. Begun last May, the entertainment service has a full-time staff of 25 and 60 freelancers. Its irreverent blend of movie and television news and gossip has made Mr. Showbiz a leading entertainment Web site in terms of the size of its keyboard-tapping audience. But that audience is one tenth the size of Sportszone's following, so attracting advertisers has been an uphill struggle and Mr. Showbiz has not yet tried to charge subscription fees. **********Still, Starwave has invested in Mr. Showbiz and last October began Family Planet, a Web service for parents, because it believes they will eventually pay  off, especially as more and more women tap into the Internet. \"We know that it may be early for some of these services, but we're placing bets in areas that are going to be big in this media,\" said Tom Phillips, a senior vice president at Starwave, who was a co-founder of the satirical magazine Spy. **********Starwave is able to take the long view largely because of the patience and deep pockets of its owner, Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation. In less than four years, Starwave has already run through an estimated $60 million of Mr. Allen's money, according to industry executives  familiar with the company. **********Two Sports Fans Start a Sports Site **********ESPNet Sportszone is, by far, the biggest cash producer in the Starwave stable. Industry executives estimate that Sportszone generates 80 percent or so of Starwave's revenues, which could be running at an annual rate of more than $7 million by the end of the year if current growth rates continue. Still, these industry executives also estimate that Starwave's costs are running at the rate  of roughly $20 million a year -- another indication, they say, that even a promising new-media venture like Starwave is a bet on the future. **********At Starwave, there was no debate about starting a sports service. The demographics of the heavy Internet users -- men aged 18 to 34 -- overlap neatly  with the demographics of typical sports fans. And it appealed to Mr. Slade and Mr. Allen for personal reasons. Mr. Slade, a 38-year-old former Microsoft marketing executive, is a hard-core sports fan who covered sports for The Gazette Telegraph of Colorado Springs while attending Colorado College. Mr. Allen is the owner of the Portland Trailblazers basketball team. **********In fact, Mr. Slade, who grew up in Portland, Ore., got to know Mr. Allen personally after he sent him a lengthy E-mail missive in 1989, shortly after Mr. Allen bought the team, about the history and importance of the Trailblazers to the people of Portland. **********The enthusiasm for sports at Starwave was a selling point when ESPN, owned by the Walt Disney Company and The Hearst Corporation, was looking for a partner to set up a service on the Web. But what really sold ESPN on Starwave, says Richard Glover, a senior vice president of ESPN, was that Starwave had the resources and the technological skills to build a first-rate Web service. **********\"At our offices in Bristol, Conn., you'll see a lot a bright people who are passionate about sports,\" Mr. Glover said. \"But you won't see a lot of software  engineers with their hats turned backwards working all night to debug some computer program. So we decided that our environment was not the best to incubate content for this new medium.\" **********A Hybrid of Media And Programming **********In Bellevue, Starwave occupies two floors of a mirror-glass building in a suburban office park. And it can perhaps best be described as a hybrid media studio, part news room and part software developer. Of its 250 employees, 50 are software engineers, headed by Patrick Naughton, vice president of technology, who was a senior member of the Sun Microsystems team that created Java, an Internet programming language. **********Starwave executives say that its programming firepower, far more than at most other large Web services, enables it to constantly update and add new features to its site. Its reputation for technological know-how also played a big role in persuading the National Basketball Association and the Nascar auto-racing circuit to choose Starwave recently to handle their Web sites. **********The sports news room at Starwave is populated mainly by young men in their 20's and 30's, dressed in the high-tech culture's uniform of informality, jeans  and T-shirts. To explain the strengths and weaknesses of new media, Geoff Reiss, Starwave's vice president for sports publishing, talks about hiring choices. With some of Mr. Allen's money, Mr. Reiss said, he might have tried to recruit one of the baseball writers he most admires like Roger Angell of The New Yorker  or Thomas Boswell of The Washington Post. **********\"But that would be a mistake,\" Mr. Reiss said. \"This medium is not about reading long, thoughtful pieces.\" **********\"The guys I'm looking to hire,\" he added, \"are people like Rob Neyer.\" **********Just down the hall, the 29-year-old Mr. Neyer is hunched over his computer keyboard, tapping out quick items for his \"Transaction Analysis\" column. In it,  Mr. Neyer discusses the significance of each personnel move made by major league baseball teams -- players traded, injured or called up from the minor leagues. **********Mr. Neyer dropped out of college to work in as a research assistant for Bill  James, the dean of baseball-statistics experts. Later, Mr. Neyer went on to work for Stats Inc., a sports statistics service in Skokie, Ill., before joining Sportszone in March. **********Besides his daily items, Mr. Neyer writes a feature story once a week of 400  or 500 words, a brief article by newspaper standards. \"I can go longer, but anything beyond that doesn't lend itself to the on-screen format,\" he explained. **********Mitch Gelman, a soft-spoken 34-year-old, came to Starwave from a career in traditional journalism as a reporter for New York Newsday, where he was a member of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of a 1991 subway crash. After the Times Mirror Company shut down Newsday's New York edition last July, Mr. Gelman said he could have gone to work for Newsday in Long Island, but he decided to try a new career. He taught himself to use a computer mouse three weeks before he reported for work in Bellevue last September. **********When Kobe Bryant, a high school basketball star, decided to skip college and  go directly into the N.B.A., Mr. Gelman immediately called the young man's guidance counselor to write a column on the much-debated decision. Eleven Olympic hopefuls are writing journals for Sportszone on their quests to make a team and win medals. In April, a few staff members suggested regular coverage of soccer. Within days, it became a new section in Sportszone. **********\"That doesn't happen in traditional media like newspapers,\" Mr. Gelman said. **********Modest Salaries vs. A Chance for Riches **********The craft of creation, Mr. Gelman says, is a more collaborative process in new media than in print journalism, requiring reporters to work with designers and producers to present a story. Like other Starwave editors, he talks of encouraging reporters to write with \"visual punch lines,\" references to nearby pictures or video clips. **********As an eight-month veteran of the new media world, Mr. Gelman has also been struck by how much Sportszone's audience wants to participate instead of just receive information and how much computer technology can enable that participation. A mascot popularity contest during the college basketball championships brought responses from 125,000 people. **********\"Our readers want their voices heard and their votes counted,\" Mr. Gelman said. \"They want to be part of the news. That surprised me.\" **********Salaries in the news room are competitive with nearby newspapers in Seattle and Portland but not lavish, ranging from $25,000 to $60,000. In fact, there are few six-figure salaries to be found on Starwave's payroll of 250 people, says Mr. Slade, the president. And several members of the staff took sharp pay cuts by leaving their previous jobs to join Starwave but hope to become rich if the company prospers. **********The plan, Mr. Slade says, is to take Starwave public before too long, though  no timetable is set. The business model for the media side of the Internet looks uncertain and that could scare away investors. Still, there was also no shortage of skeptics beforehand for such Internet offerings as Netscape, maker of browser software, and Yahoo, a directory Web site. Yet their share prices soared and many of their employees became millionaires. **********\"People here are motivated by stock,\" Mr. Slade said. \"You could get rich.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/10/world/un-debate-on-test-ban-is-low-key.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-09-10", "snippet": "UN General Assembly begins unexpectedly smooth special session on treaty to ban nuclear weapons tests, with no procedural hurdles by India, which had blocked acceptance of accord in Geneva in August; Indian Amb Prakash Shah delivers low-key addres...", "word_count": 493, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

The frozen embryos, consisting of four cells each, would not develop further unless they were implanted into a woman's uterus. Unless their donors ask to have the embryos saved, any that have been stored for five years will be destroyed. **********The embryos are being stored in 33 clinics, which were scheduled to begin to remove them from freezing containers sometime after midnight Wednesday, allowing them to thaw, and then administering a few drops of alcohol to destroy them, officials of the Fertilization and Embryology Authority said. The embryos will then be incinerated. **********Although embryos have been destroyed before, this is the first time such a procedure has been required by law and carried out on such a large scale. The newness of it all, combined with the delicate issues involved, have inspired suggestions ranging from the ''adoption'' of the embryos to a demand that they be given ''a proper funeral.'' **********The action is ordered under the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act, which became effective on Aug. 1, 1991, and stipulated the five-year time limit. As the deadline crept up, the once-quiet debate quickly became public and dramatic. **********Some officials in the Catholic Church have referred to the event as ''a prenatal massacre.'' **********Italian doctors have offered to pay to ''adopt'' the embryos, with the intention of having them transferred to Italy and implanted there. Anti-abortion groups have appealed to Prime Minister John Major for a six-month delay. **********At a news conference on Wednesday, John Scarisbrick, a spokesman for Life Campaigns, a British anti-abortion group, called today ''a day of national shame,'' arguing that letters that went out in the past 10 weeks to the egg and sperm donors of the embryos warning of the action failed to explain other options, including offering them for adoption. **********But a spokeswoman for the Health Ministry said on Wednesday that come midnight, ''under present laws and guidance on patient consent, nothing can be done but for those embryos to be allowed to perish.'' **********She added that authorities, however, have asked the clinics ''to be reasonable about the timing,'' suggesting that the midnight ring of the clock does not have to be observed fanatically. **********The embryos scheduled for destruction are part of a total ranging from 6,000 to 10,000 that were fertilized and frozen since 1991 but whose  donors have failed to respond to inquiries about what they wished done with them. **********Of those who did respond, some  donors asked that their embryos continue to be preserved. Many opted for destruction, which was done quietly before the deadline came up, but clinics refuse to give actual numbers. **********In the United States, Dr. Joseph D. Schulman, director of the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va., a large private infertility center, said that while certain states might have laws that apply to different embryo storage situations, there is no national policy on what becomes of unclaimed embryos in the United States. **********''As a matter of policy in virtually all in-vitro fertilization centers,'' he said, ''decisions are made by the individual couples. They indicate at the time the embryos are frozen what would be done with them in the event they are no longer needed for the couple. The options include anonymous donation, which is encouraged, or destruction. If the couple is unreachable, the institution would normally try to follow their wishes as last indicated.'' **********What seems to have troubled most opponents of the law in Britain is that so many couples, perhaps as many as 650, did not respond to inquiries about what they wished to do with the embryos. Some have moved or changed addresses without informing the clinics. As a result, the Government said, about 3,300 embryos have been tagged for destruction. **********''This is the first time that, in effect, under a legal time limit, a number of embryos which many people regard as humans have to be destroyed,'' noted Harry Coen, acting editor of The Catholic Herald, in a conversation in London. **********Protesters clustered outside several churches in candlelight vigils on Wednesday as midnight approached. **********The Church of England has taken no position on the issue, leaving it up to individuals in various parishes. **********The Roman Catholic Church has opposed the move, albeit not vehemently, arguing that if the embryos must be destroyed they should at least be treated with dignity. Others,  including the Catholic Church leadership here, insist the embryos be given ''a proper funeral.'' **********''The fertilized ovum,'' Cardinal Basil Hume of Westminster said, ''should be given the unconditional respect which is morally due to the human being.'' He said in several newspaper interviews that the embryos ''shouldn't be flushed down the toilet.'' **********Other Catholics have argued that the embryos should be allowed to perish naturally. **********What is certain is that the debate will not end soon.

Instead, Daimler turned to Goldman, Sachs & Company for help revamping its A.E.G. industrial unit and later picked J. P. Morgan as lead manager to raise $500 million. **********Adding to the insult was the fact that Deutsche Bank, Europe's largest bank with more than $500 billion in assets, itself owns 24 percent of Daimler, and has been spending billions in a relentless effort to build its own London-based subsidiary, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, into a world-class investment bank capable of competing against Wall Street's best. **********''The American investment banks suddenly appeared in the Deutsche mark market,'' Mr. Kopper said in an interview at his Frankfurt office earlier this month. ''We suddenly realized that if we continued as before, we would not remain No. 1 in Europe, or even in Germany.'' **********Having led Deutsche Bank in its high-stakes plunge into British-American style global finance, a business fundamentally different from that traditionally practiced by German banks, Mr. Kopper, who is 61, said yesterday that he was pleased with his work -- and would soon quit his job. In a move that surprised bankers around the world, the bank said that Mr. Kopper would be succeeded next May by Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the board director responsible for its securities businesses. **********Deutsche Bank executives said Mr. Kopper, who is expected to be elevated to the supervisory board that oversees and advises the bank's managers, made the decision to step aside entirely voluntarily. And for all the criticism Mr. Kopper has endured for a series of foul-ups in his quest to remake Deutsche Bank, the change at the top, rather than threatening to reverse the bank's essential strategy, is, if anything, likely to accelerate it. **********Mr. Breuer, who turns 59 on Sunday and is also chairman of Deutsche Borse, the holding company for Germany's stock exchanges, is viewed, along with Mr. Kopper, as the Deutsche Bank board member most committed to the firm's rapid expansion into the international securities business. Mr. Breuer, ''more than anyone else, is helping to bring along the transformation toward an equity culture,'' a senior Deutsche Bank colleague said yesterday. **********Such a strategy, of course, entails considerable risks, particularly because the bank, for all its immense size and historic clout on the European Continent, is rushing headlong into a number of investment banking fields where it is still a novice. Moreover, Deutsche Bank is faced with the challenge of reconciling enormous cultural divisions that are now rife throughout the company, such as the gap between the bank's German management with its vast ranks bred to be solid and dependable corporate lenders and the British-American deal-oriented investment bankers who make their mark dreaming up and marketing novel financial tactics. **********The difficulties of bridging this gap help account for some of the bank's recent stumbles in global finance. Just this past weekend, for example, Deutsche Bank was forced to abort a plan to sell warrants on a pending international initial public offering for Deutsche Telekom after it belatedly realized that this would violate regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Miscues by a single executive can also cause huge damage, as Deutsche Bank learned in September when it disclosed that Peter Young, one of the star fund managers at its Morgan Grenfell asset management division, had improperly acquired big stakes in several dubious companies. The bank fired Mr. Young, but it has had to spend close to $300 million in a bid to restore confidence and cover potential customer losses. **********That blow fell after two big calamities on Deutsche Bank's home front in the last few years. In 1994, the bank lost hundreds of millions of dollars as the principal lender for Jurgen Schneider, a real estate tycoon who was said to have covered up hgue losses and is now in prison awaiting charges on bank fraud after fleeing the country for more than a year. And in a long-running scandal that began in 1993, the bank was even more embarrassed as the principal lender for Metallgesellschaft, a company that racked up huge losses through speculation in oil futures. **********In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Breuer, professorial in demeanor, brushed aside the investment banking missteps as inevitable in any rush into a new arena. The Deutsche Morgan Grenfell scandal is ''a bump on the road,'' he said, ''which causes some discomfort from the reputation point of view.'' **********And Mr. Kopper, a beefy man with an occasionally wicked sense of humor, dismissed the problems at Morgan Grenfell in characteristically blunt language. ''It is a hiccup,'' he said. ''It's an ugly one, but it's just a hiccup.'' While all risk-taking investment banks have gone through similar problems at one point or another, he added, ''it's different when it happens to us.'' He continued: ''We're Deutsche Bank. If it happens to us, then my God, it's quite an embarrassment.'' **********For all the difficulties, Mr. Breuer said that he and his colleagues were planning to shift the bank's focus even further toward investment banking. **********''We expect over time to have an earnings contribution from investment banking of from a third to a half of Deutsche Bank's worldwide revenues,'' he said. That would be up from current levels of between 10 percent and 20 percent. Mr. Breuer also said that the bank expected to pay its executives based more on results rather than just position, to reflect its greater commitment to the high-risk, high-reward investment banking approach to finance. **********As it throws its weight around, Deutsche Bank has been shaking up the close-knit investment banking world by paying big sums to hire teams of executives from leading investment banks like Goldman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and ING Group. In just a few years, it has nearly doubled its number of investment bankers to 8,000. **********In New York, Deutsche Bank hired Carter McClelland from Morgan Stanley to head its North American banking and securities operation. He hired several of his former colleagues, and created a group of technology specialists in Menlo Park, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. **********Competitors maintain that Deutsche Bank is paying compensation well over the market standard, particularly in New York, in an already buoyant market for talent. Deutsche Bank would not comment in detail, but Mr. Kopper first insisted that the bank was not paying more than its competitors, but then later conceded that any new kid on the block must pay extra to lure people ''across the street.'' Those joining the investment banking operation, Mr. McClelland said, were lured more by the challenge to build something new than by the money. **********By choosing Mr. Breuer as its new chief executive, Deutsche Bank clearly signaled its support for the costly move into global banking. ''From our side, this is a great decision,'' a top Morgan Grenfell executive said. **********Like Mr. Kopper, Mr. Breuer has been with Deutsche Bank his entire career, speaks fluent English, and has consistently backed the strategy. The shift, said Stephen M. Lewis, European banking analyst at UBS Ltd. in London, a unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, fits perfectly with Deutsche Bank's ''move more and more into investment banking.'' **********Deutsche Bank, which kept the decision secret but had certainly been planning the executive changes for several weeks, also said that Josef Ackermann, 48, who was previously chief executive of Credit Suisse, would join its managing board. Ulrich Cartellieri, 59, will leave the board next May and Ellen Schneider-Lenne, who has been ill, will resign at the end of the year. Mr. Cartellieri is expected to join Mr. Kopper on the supervisory board. **********Mr. Kopper is likely to replace F. Wilhelm Christians, 74, the current chairman of the supervisory board, who is expected to retire in May. **********In a tangible display of its financial muscle and long-term commitment to investment banking, the bank recently opened a brand new five-acre trading floor -- the largest in London -- with spaces for more than 500 traders. Packed with the latest in data and video communications gear, the trading floor was built by a former Merrill Lynch executive from New York and is staffed largely by people hired from places like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and SBC Warburg. Few Germans are in sight. **********Analysts are cautious about the bank's aggressive campaign. ''I am sure they can become one of the top 10 in lots of markets,'' said Robin Munro-Davis, who runs IBCA, a London financial research and rating firm. ''The question is, can they do it and remain profitable? The costs are very high, and there are a lot of other new entrants.'' **********Despite complaints that its stock has languished for several years under Mr. Kopper, Deutsche Bank remains undaunted about its ambitions. ''First, to remain No. 1 in Germany, and to increase our lead on competitors,'' Mr. Kopper said. ''Second, to be No. 1 in Europe, and third, to be in the top group globally. We will not be in the top five in the United States, certainly now we know that.'' **********In many ways, global investment banking represents a return to Deutsche Bank's roots. Ever since its founding in 1870, it has been a huge investor in German companies, involved in the founding of such giant industrial concerns as Mannesmann, the steelmaker. It also was active in international investing, plunging into  railroads in North America and the Middle East, and in pre-World War I trade finance from Yokohama, Japan. **********Buoyed by profits from Germany's industrial rebirth after World War II, Deutsche Bank once again looked abroad, becoming a leader in the Eurobond market. But it failed to develop the capability of Anglo-American investment banks. **********To do that, Deutsche Bank turned first to London. ''Six years ago, we had the opportunity to buy Morgan Grenfell'' for $:900 million ($1.44 billion), Mr. Breuer said, rescuing it from a takeover threat from Indosuez, the French financial group. ''We felt we could learn from the English.'' **********The takeover of Morgan Grenfell, which it initially managed at arm's length, proved to be ''a very nice financial investment,'' Mr. Kopper said, giving annual returns of more than 15 percent. **********But that was just ''a stepping-stone,'' Mr. Kopper said. In 1994, under pressure because of substantial losses to either abandon its approach or expand the business, Mr. Kopper decided to integrate Morgan Grenfell into Deutsche Bank, a move that was completed the following year. The bank says it made a modest profit on investment banking last year. **********Even though it must fight hard to fend off attacks on its home turf, the integration has gone particularly well in some European markets, Mr. Breuer said. **********But Deutsche Bank is still struggling to avoid being an also-ran outside Europe. ''The competitive landscape, quite simply, is that there are 25 to 30 banks with global aspirations,'' said Edson Mitchell, who heads Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's global markets division, and who previously ran Merrill Lynch's worldwide bond business. ''We think maybe 10 have a legitimate shot by the year 2000 or 2005.'' And, Mr. Mitchell leaves no doubt that Deutsche Bank intends to be one of the 10."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/05/business/bmw-sales-rise-8.5-aided-by-new-models.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-05", "snippet": "BMW says strong performance by new models lifted revenue 10.6 percent in first nine months of year, to $24.8 billion (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BMW Sales Rise 8.5%, Aided by New Models", "print_headline": "BMW Sales Rise 8.5%, Aided by New Models", "body_text": " **********A strong performance by new models that went on the market this year helped the sales of Bayerische Motoren Werke to rise 8.5 percent in the first nine months of 1996, the company said yesterday.

It was the first long-distance call not carried by Telefonos de Mexico S.A., or Telmex, whose 48-year monopoly concession expired on Saturday. **********To the relief of Avantel officials, the sound and video image of Benjamin Clariond, Governor of the state of Nuevo Leon, were so clear that he and Mr. Zedillo extended what was supposed to be a ceremonial hello into a wandering survey of events in the state -- including a discussion of the rainfall -- in front of more than 2,000 people at an Avantel service center on the outskirts of Mexico City. **********''It seems like that little wire really does work,'' Mr. Zedillo said. **********With the inauguration of the 3,356-mile Avantel network, an investment of nearly $900 million that links 33 of Mexico's largest cities, Mexico has managed to stay on schedule for the long-planned opening of long-distance competition. **********For the next four months Avantel will offer services to pilot business customers only through its own network. But the next leap in competition comes on Jan. 1, 1997, when Avantel and other companies will begin to provide long-distance service to Mexican homes by interconnecting with Telmex's network. **********A total of eight companies have applied to compete with Telmex. The biggest besides Avantel is a company formed by AT&T and Alfa S.A., under the name Alestra, which has pledged to invest $1 billion in five years to build up its own network. **********In coming years both Avantel and Alestra hope to seize about 20 percent of the Mexican long-distance market, which is expected to be worth about $15 billion a year, including communications and equipment, by the end of the century. **********President Zedillo's visit demonstrated that MCI and Avantel are maintaining a lead over AT&T in laying down a cable network and getting service up and running. This was the second Avantel event Mr. Zedillo had attended since September 1995. Officials from the President's office, anxious to dispel suggestions that he is engaging in favoritism, said he had not gone to inaugurate the facilities of other companies because none had finished construction work. **********Mexico began to privatize and diversify its key state-owned industries under the administration of Mr. Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The policy is one Mr. Zedillo has continued to pursue even though Mr. Salinas has fallen into disgrace among Mexicans, with his family tangled in corruption scandals, and he was forced to move into exile to Ireland. **********As part of the legal requirements of the new competition, On Friday -- one day before the deadline -- Mexico established an autonomous Federal Telecommunications Commission. Avantel officials said they expected the new commission to help free the oversight of the industry from the political pressures it faced when monitoring was handled by the Communications Ministry. **********Analysts predict Telmex will retain about 60 percent of the market. The giant company was privatized in 1990 by a group led by Mexico's Grupo Carso S.A. in partnership with SBC Communications and France Telecom. Since then, Telmex has invested about $10 billion, according to analysts, to improve its network and especially its customer service, which had a reputation for being slow and indifferent. **********Telmex sought to pre-empt some competition in recent months by offering the first-ever discounts on some long-distance service to Mexican homes. **********''Telmex is preparing for competition and they seem ready to face it,'' said Sari Mayer, Latin America telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers. **********Although Telmex's potential competitors have grumbled behind the scenes that the company's preparations for interconnection have been reluctant, MCI officials acknowledged today that the former monopoly had cooperated on the basics. **********Daniel E. Crawford, the MCI official who is head of Avantel's operations, said that Avantel would in practice be one of Telmex's biggest customers once Avantel's residential long-distance service starts next year. **********In another area of privatization, Mexico announced today that a consortium including two California energy companies won the first private license to distribute natural gas. The consortium, which includes Enova International of San Diego, Pacific Enterprises International of Los Angeles and the Mexican company Proxima, will distribute natural gas in the border city of Mexicali."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/27/business/international-business-fuji-bank-chief-steps-down-but-denies-reason-is-losses.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1996-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Fuji Bank Chief Steps Down but Denies Reason Is Losses", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Fuji Bank Chief Steps Down but Denies Reason Is Losses", "body_text": " **********The president of the Fuji Bank, one of the nation's largest financial institutions, announced his resignation today, but denied that his decision was  a result of huge loan losses at the company. **********Still, the resignation was seen as a way of assuming responsibilty for the bad-debt problems, and it puts pressure on the heads of other Japanese banks to  step down as well. **********The Fuji president, Toru Hashimoto, is not leaving the bank entirely.

To the Internal Revenue Service, it is a red flag likely to produce an audit and a long court fight. But for wealthy investors, at least for a few years, it was a remarkable way to avoid capital gains taxes. **********Since the days of industrial barons like Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller, giving a valuable asset to charity has been a reliable way to avoid taxes on the profits from that investment. These days, many well-to-do people do that by donating assets tax-free to a charitable trust that then makes donations for decades to come. **********But in the early 1990's, some clever lawyers and accountants added a twist, known as an accelerated charitable remainder trust. Like other trusts, this type accepted valuable property from the donor, who could contribute the asset to the trust without creating a capital gains tax bill, but unlike traditional trusts, this type returned the bulk of those assets to the donor, tax free, in as little as two years. **********''I call it the chutzpah trust,'' said Conrad Teitell, a prominent tax and estate lawyer and a vocal critic of the disputed technique. ''There isn't one iota of charitable intent.'' **********Uncle Sam seems to share his view: the Internal Revenue Service says it is examining the returns of 120 wealthy people in New York and Los Angeles to see whether they used such trusts in an abusive way to improperly avoid the capital gains tax. **********David W. Jones, an I.R.S. official, said the agency had received tips suggesting that the technique was most common in the New York and Los Angeles areas. A computer search generated the names of 120 taxpayers in those areas who were likely to have used the technique, and the agency will audit any of those returns that appear abusive, Mr. Jones said. **********The new trust arrangement was promoted heavily by the silk-stocking New York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in Manhattan, which is stoutly defending the concept. Jonathan G. Blattmachr, a partner, declined to comment on the I.R.S. move. ''This could relate to certain client matters, so I can't discuss that,'' Mr. Blattmachr said. ''I am constrained by ethical considerations.'' **********In setting up a traditional charitable remainder trust, taxpayers will typically require the trust to generate income for them of between 5 and 7 percent a year until their death, at which point all the assets go to a charity. The income is taxable, as long as it came from the trust's investment earnings and not from its principal. **********The I.R.S. complains that the accelerated trusts were deliberately organized so that they could not meet their obligations to their donors except by tapping into principal -- rendering such payments largely tax free. **********For example, instead of demanding a plausible 7 percent annual return, the donor might specify an 80 percent return in the first year of the trust's life. To meet that obligation, the trust would have to give back the bulk of its principal.

That could slow passage of laws to deregulate the economy or streamline Japan's bureaucracy. **********''You're looking at the prospect of gridlock,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst here. But he said the new government would not be in danger. **********The Liberal Democratic Party took a step toward a minority government today when it agreed with its two partners in the current ruling coalition to cooperate on some policy issues, such as proposing a bill to reduce the number of ministries and  agencies over five years. **********The two parties, the Social Democrats and the New Party Sakigake, made it clear that they would not remain in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats and would not cooperate on all issues. The Social Democrats, for instance, are calling for a reduction in the number of United States marines stationed in Okinawa while the Liberal Democrats want to maintain current troop levels. **********Mr. Hashimoto may attract enough independents and defectors from other parties to scrape together a majority by next Thursday, when the lower house of Parliament will meet in a special session to elect the new Prime Minister. It is certain to be him, even if his party does not have an absolute majority by then. **********It was not supposed to turn out this way. The Oct. 20 election was seen as a resounding victory for the Liberal Democrats, who ruled Japan for most of the period since World War II until falling from power after voter disgust over corruption in 1993. **********The Liberal Democrats won 239 seats in the 500-seat lower house, up from the 211 seats it held before. It would be relatively easy, it was thought, for the party to cobble together a majority and continue its conservative policies. **********The problem, however, was that the L.D.P. won so many seats that it has scared away potential partners, which fear being dominated in a coalition. ''Ironically, because the L.D.P. won a few seats too many, this government is turning out to be a weaker government,'' said Shigenori Okazaki, a political analyst for SBC Warburg Japan, a securities firm. **********The Socialists were decimated in the last election, winning only 15 seats, down from the 30 they held before. Party officials say its longtime supporters deserted the party at the polls because it had abandoned its principles by entering into the coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The new Socialist leader, Takako Doi, has thus vowed to stay out of the coalition this time. **********Mr. Hashimoto was also snubbed by the new Democratic Party, which won 52 seats. **********Mr. Hashimoto will be able to count on the cooperation of a handful of independents. There have also been some defectors from the New Frontier Party, the largest opposition party, who could eventually join the Liberal Democrats. **********Many members of the New Frontier Party are dissatisfied with the heavy-handed leadership of its chief, Ichiro Ozawa. The party seems to be in danger of disintegrating but Mr. Ozawa, a wily politician, has so far managed to hold it together."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/23/business/executive-changes-006165.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********CS FIRST BOSTON, New York, rehired John Fitzgerald from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. as a director specializing in the debt of Canadian borrowers and United States lending agencies.

But he was nervous about reporting the practice, which he figured was a violation of copyright law. ''You don't dare say anything,'' he recalled recently, ''because it's probably your job.'' **********Then, suddenly, he had no job to worry about: his entire department was laid off. The instructor, in turn, called a hot line he had seen in a computer magazine and unburdened his conscience. **********His call prompted an investigation by the Business Software Alliance, a trade group based in Washington, and led to the company's paying $150,000 to settle charges of copyright violations. **********The instructor, who insisted on anonymity because he said his actions could jeopardize his current job, was one of about 40,000 people who have called the software alliance since the line was set up four years ago. And the alliance, finding that it can benefit from employees' grudges, is getting more direct than ever. In an ad campaign that put posters at well-traveled points in Manhattan starting last month, the message, ''Report Software Piracy, 1-888-NO-PIRACY,'' is under red letters with the startling message, ''Nail Your Boss.'' **********''All it takes is one unhappy employee,'' said Bob Kruger, director of the association's enforcement program. ''There are very few companies out there that haven't made one unhappy employee.'' **********The key to keeping those calls coming is to make sure the employee is not found out by his or her employer. While going public can be hazardous to a career -- and so the number of workers who want to play Frank Serpico or Karen Silkwood is understandably small -- snitching is another story; as long as it's safe, apparently, it's satisfying. **********When Congress enacted protection for whistle-blowers nearly 20 years ago and established inspectors general in Federal agencies to investigate reports of fraud and waste, it prohibited the disclosure of an informer's identity. And under the Federal False Claims Act, whistle-blowers can receive a share of any money recovered from Government contractors. **********Many companies have also set up hot lines and promise to protect the identity of whistle-blowers. And Daniel P. Westman, a lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., who wrote the book ''Whistle-Blowing: The Law of Retaliatory Discharge'' (Bureau of National Affairs, 1991), said such procedures were only common sense. ''Any rational company that has something bad going on within it is going to want to know,'' he said. **********The next step, which the software industry found instantly promising, was appealing to the employees of its customers. The Software Publishers Association, another trade group, started an anti-piracy hot line in 1989. It gets about 30 calls a day, and one temporary worker in New York turned in three companies in a week. **********Mr. Kruger at the software alliance said he knew that the approach would work when, new to the job, he picked up the phone one day to hear: ''I'm a disgruntled employee. Is this where I call to get revenge?'' **********Illegal copying of software costs the industry $15 billion a year, according to the alliance. It says hot-line calls have led to threats of legal action against 1,500 corporate and institutional users and settlements recovering $18 million. The targets, some of which ''behaved very decently'' when notified, Mr. Kruger noted, have included Verteq Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif.; Russell Stover Candies Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., and scores of smaller companies, hospitals, nonprofit groups and even government agencies. **********Some callers are temporary employees who are given photocopies of software documentation by their employers. Some, like the computer instructor in Texas, had little to lose. At one company, an executive said he believed the whistle-blower was a data-entry worker who had been dismissed for spending too much time playing computer solitaire and dipping into data bases. **********The association is immensely protective of its callers. If it files suit -- so far, no cases have gone to trial -- it asks the court to put the whistle-blower's name under seal. ''We've never had a case where an informant or source was identified,'' Mr. Kruger said. ''I've never had anybody call back and say, 'Gee, guy, thanks a lot.' '' **********While there are Federal and state laws protecting workers from retaliation for reporting an employer's wrongdoing, one advocate said the only effective protection for an employee was total secrecy. ''Never identify yourself,'' said Donald R. Soeken, who as a social worker for the Public Health Service in the late 1970's protested the practice of giving psychiatric examinations to dissident Federal employees. ''It'll ruin your career. Call from a pay phone, and don't give your name.'' **********All of this sneaking around challenges the classic image of the whistle-blower as a righteous loner who speaks out and accepts the consequences. Mr. Soeken knows this model well: He and his wife, Katherine, interviewed 90 whistle-blowers for a study presented to Congress in 1987, and now, from his office in College Park, Md., he runs Integrity International, a whistle-blower advocacy group. **********''If you took all these people back to when they were teen-agers,'' he said, ''the whistle-blower would be the one saying, 'That's not right,' while everybody else is saying, 'Aw, come on.' This is the person who insists on having a designated driver.'' **********Mr. Kruger of the alliance said he did not care if a whistle-blower was judgmental. ''Some call us because they will bust if they don't tell somebody,'' he said. ''Some say, 'I'm offended that my company is doing this because they're making so much money.' We don't care if they are angry or not, so long as their information is accurate.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/19/business/big-insurer-promotes-president-to-chief.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-09-19", "snippet": "New York Life Insurance Co names its president, Seymour Sternberg, to succeed Harry G Hohn as chairman and chief executive officer when Hohn retires next April; Sternberg will retain his title as president; photo (M)", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Insurer Promotes President To Chief", "print_headline": "Big Insurer Promotes President To Chief", "body_text": " **********Seven years ago when Seymour Sternberg was recruited to join the New York Life Insurance Company he figured he might have a shot at some day running it. **********In July, after nearly 10 months as New York Life's No. 2 in command, he began to think he was pretty much there.

Mr. Sternberg will retain his title as president. **********Do not expect big changes. But also do not expect New York Life to look like many of its competitors, which have noticed the flat to declining market in life insurance -- depending on which statistics you use -- and started delving more deeply into other financial services. **********''Over the last 12 months we've been developing a focus on the fundamentals of our company, insurance and annuities,'' Mr. Sternberg said.

''We have a strong health care operation and we have a very strong mutual fund business and a very strong assets management business. But we see all those businesses as being really around the periphery of our fundamental business: insurance.'' **********Like some other life insurance companies, the reputation of New York Life has been tarnished by complaints of improper sales practices. Last year the company agreed to pay $250 million worth of compensation to three million policyholders and it set up a 110-member force to monitor future sales. Looking ahead, Mr. Sternberg plans to accentuate the positive and make ''a sizable investment'' in advertising and public relations. **********Counter to the industry trend, business has been good at New York Life lately. Last year, the company had earnings of $625 million on revenue of $16.7 billion, compared with earnings in 1994 of $404 million on revenue of $15.8 billion.

After earning engineering degrees at City College and Northeastern University he worked on missile development for the Raytheon Company, then signed on with a consulting company hired to develop computer systems for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. **********The insurance company recognized a bright young man and soon Mr. Sternberg was heading a computer services division of Massachusetts Mutual. He worked his way up to the executive suite, saw the way to chief executive was blocked and jumped at the chance to join New York Life. **********Three years ago he took charge of computer operations at New York Life and started moving the company into the modern age. More improvements are on the way. **********Yet for Mr. Sternberg, the computer is a tool, not his persona. ''I spend most of my day meeting with people,'' he said.

It was Aetna's fourth big layoff announcement this year. **********The company, based in Hartford, said it would lay off a total of 8,200, but some of those people would be retrained for 3,800 new positions that it will create. The decision brought the number of overall layoffs planned by Aetna this year to more than 10,800. About 1,000 jobs will be cut in Connecticut. **********Aetna's relentless downsizing -- exceeded this year only by AT&T's announcement in January that it would cut 40,000 jobs -- reflects the company's struggle to transform itself from a provider of traditional insurance and financial services into a leader in managed health care. **********In April, Aetna announced that it would spend $8.18 billion to acquire U.S. Healthcare, a major health maintenance organization concentrated in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. At that time, when many big corporations were being assailed politically and in the news media over a wave of downsizings, Aetna's chairman, Ronald E. Compton, suggested that the number of jobs lost in the merger would probably be minimal, though he allowed that ''as we streamline, there are bound to be some.'' **********Yesterday, an Aetna spokeswoman, Joyce Oberdorf, said the employees to be laid off would be offered retraining and priority in the new hiring, but it was clear that most of the new jobs would be situated far from those being dropped. **********Mr. Compton said yesterday that the sweeping reorganization would help Aetna carve out a major role in the highly competitive world of managed health care -- at a time when all H.M.O.'s are under intense pressure to prevent costs from rising. **********''Over the long term,'' he said, ''we believe this growth will result in more job opportunities.'' **********The job cuts include 7,500 in health care -- mainly from the Aetna side  -- and 700 in the life insurance, pensions and financial services unit, Aetna Retirement Services. **********The company said Aetna U.S. Healthcare, its health benefits subsidiary, would add 3,500 new positions, for a net reduction of 4,000. Retirement Services will add 300 new slots for a net loss of 400. **********In Connecticut, the 1,000 lost jobs will come on top of the elimination of 875 positions in Hartford and Middletown earlier this year. The rest of the cuts will be spread across the country in 43 offices that Aetna plans to combine in six regional centers and at roughly nine other locations. **********''Aetna paid a price far greater than most people would ever want to pay for U.S. Healthcare,'' said Mark Puccia, a managing director with Standard & Poor's, the credit rating firm. ''Now they have to justify it. They have to look for cost reductions to get their earnings up.'' **********The combination with U.S. Healthcare made Aetna the country's biggest medical benefits company, but analysts said the merger, completed in July, brought together two companies that had been far apart in methods and philosophy. **********''U.S. Healthcare had the best operating systems in the business,'' said Margo Vignola, a health care analyst with Merrill Lynch.

''They will not be reopened. That is what everyone involved had wanted, and today it's a reality.'' **********At least a half-million people have crossed the border into Rwanda on foot in the last three days.

Aid workers expected the exodus to end by Tuesday. **********The flood of returning refugees began three days ago, after Zairian rebel forces with ties to Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government encircled the Mugunga camp and attacked it, quickly routing the Hutu guerrilla army that a majority of refugees said had been essentially holding them hostage for months. **********Zairian rebels had already seized a 200-mile strip of land along the eastern border with Rwanda and Burundi, pushing out the Zairian troops, who were allies of the Hutu forces in the camps. **********The Hutu refugees arrived in Zaire in 1994, fleeing an advancing Tutsi army. Among them were 40,000 soldiers loyal to the former Hutu-led Government and tens of thousands of militiamen who helped carry out the 1994 genocide against Tutsi, in which at least 500,000 people perished. **********It was still unclear tonight where the retreating Hutu forces were or if they remained a viable fighting force. United Nations officials said the rebel soldiers had pursued them west past the town of Sake, about 18 miles from Goma. They said that the retreating Hutu fighters appeared to be moving northwest toward Masisi,  a fertile region another 27 miles away with a Hutu ethnic majority. **********Just outside the Mugunga camp, the aftermath of Friday's battle could be seen. There was a line of twelve burned-out buses and trucks on the road after an ambush by the Tutsi rebels. The convoy had apparently been carrying officers of the former Rwandan Army along with copious records. Scattered around the buses were thousands of documents belonging to the Hutu officers. **********Rebel soldiers today were collecting the papers, which some journalists had already mined for information the day before. Some documents reportedly outlined the Hutu army's plans to retake Rwanda, while others provided proof of arms deals between the Hutu guerrillas and British gun traders. **********A few miles down the road, groups of gaunt refugees who had spent the last two weeks hiding in the forest were staggering into the Mugunga camp. They were stunned to find the camp deserted. They said they had been marching for days to reach it in the belief that the militiamen would protect them. **********The refugees had abandoned the Katale camp, about 37 miles north of Goma, when it was attacked more than two weeks ago and had headed west into the forests around the Nyiragongo volcano. They said they had survived by eating berries, grass and roots and by collecting rainwater on  plastic sheeting. Still, many people in their group had died of dysentery and other illnesses, they said. **********''Many are dying,'' said Boniface Kajangwe, who had stopped walking because his feet were cut and infected. ''They are sick, tired and hungry. Some of my relatives are in the forest. I don't know if they are alive.'' **********Mr. Kajangwe said most refugees from Katale were still in the rain forest, about three days' walk from Mugunga camp. United Nations officials said they were sending a team on foot to investigate. **********Officials from Care International, the aid organization, said they had received radio transmissions on Saturday from one of their employees who is still traveling with refugees from the Katale camp. According to the employee, there are hundreds of thousands of refugees who have left the forests around the volcano, and are now in the fertile cattle country in Masisi. Some people were left behind, the employee reported. **********Aid workers said that if the reports are true, the Katale refugees are in a remote area where it would be nearly impossible to reach them by plane or car. ''If they drop off the world stage, they could very likely disappear,'' said Lockton Morrissey, a Care official. **********At the same time, there were signs that the last people on the march back into Rwanda were suffering from disease, aid workers said. There were 200 reported cases of cholera among refugees at a hospital in Gisenyi, Rwanda. About 1,200 people were also treated for dehydration along the road in Rwanda, according to Doctors Without Borders, another aid organization. **********The United Nations sent a fleet of buses and trucks into Zaire on Sunday night and today to collect about 6,000 stragglers, most of whom were old, sick or too weak to make the journey on foot. Aid workers also took about 1,700 lost children to shelters in a local school or in camps. **********Many refugees said they were  hungry, having eaten nothing but biscuits given by aid workers at way stations. Emergency rations of maize, rice and beans still had not been delivered to refugees tonight because of the Rwandan Government's bureaucratic delays in approving charitable organizations to distribute the food to villages, said Brenda Barton, a spokesman for the World Food Program. **********There were also problems in finding transportation for refugees from a transit camp near the border to more remote parts of the country, United Nations officials said. **********Despite those problems, few people were reported to have died in the exodus, officials said.

No evidence has arisen to suggest corruption by Mr. Lozano, the Mexican officials said. **********Mr. Zedillo appointed a respected jurist, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar to serve as Attorney General starting today, though the appointment must be approved by the Senate. Mr. Madrazo has been the head of the National Human Rights Commission, which is funded by the Government but has an autonomous mandate to investigate citizen complaints. **********Under Mr. Madrazo, the commission examined the June 1995 massacre of 17 opposition peasants in the state of Guerrero. The commission's report was central to exposing the role of state police and high-level state officials in the killings. **********In firing Mr. Lozano, President Zedillo removed the only member of his Cabinet from an opposition party. Mr. Lozano had been a federal deputy from the conservative National Action Party. **********However, Mr. Zedillo's decision to dismiss Mr. Lozano was based on his blunders and not his political allegiances, a senior official said. Despite mounting criticism of Mr. Lozano's performance, Mr. Zedillo had resisted dismissing him for months in an effort to preserve continuity in Mexico's notoriously corrupt and disorganized justice system. **********''The fact is that if he had been from the PRI, he would have been fired a year ago,'' the official said, referring to President Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party. **********Clinton Administration officials had been exuberant in their praise of Mr. Lozano throughout his tenure.  Today, American officials said they were taken by surprise by Mr. Lozano's firing. **********Mr. Lozano was in charge of investigating the March 1994 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate from Mr. Zedillo's party, and the September 1994 killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a prominent politician. His brother, Mario Ruiz Massieu, a former prosecutor, has been charged with graft and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation into his brother's killing. **********Polls indicate that a majority of Mexicans are convinced that larger political conspiracies were behind both killings. As time dragged on with no solution Mexicans began to doubt that President Zedillo was sincere about wanting to get to the bottom of them. Mr. Zedillo said he asked Mr. Madrazo to redouble efforts to solve these crimes. Mr. Madrazo is not a member of any political party, he said. **********Mr. Lozano and his team suffered setbacks in at least a dozen cases they handled during the last two years. In one, they failed to achieve the extradition from the United States of Mario Ruiz Massieu. **********Mr. Zedillo also removed the top civilian official in charge of the war on drugs and replaced him Gen. Jose Gutierrez Rebollo, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/business/after-the-funeral-overseeing-the-estate-brings-new-woes.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Mansnerus", "pub_date": "1996-09-29", "snippet": "Problems faced by many executors, especially relatives of deceased, in sorting out complex financial matters discussed; Joan McGarry and Jerrie Taylor recount their experience in California; photo (S)", "word_count": 2579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After the Funeral, Overseeing the Estate Brings New Woes", "print_headline": "After the Funeral, Overseeing the Estate Brings New Woes", "body_text": " **********FOR several years, Jerrie Taylor and Joan McGarry had what was possibly the worst job in California. They administered the estate of Ms. McGarry's former companion, a man who in his later years, according to Ms. Taylor, kept his business to himself, holed up in a house surrounded by old car bodies. For most of that time, she said, he did not pay taxes. **********''Gordon left something he thought was a will, but of course it wasn't,'' said Ms. Taylor, who used to work as a legal secretary and ran a dance studio in Santa Barbara. ''It was just some scribbled stuff.'' **********The ''scribbled stuff'' had at one point named Ms. McGarry to take care of the estate. And both she and Ms. Taylor knew the man's elderly mother and wanted to help her, so they offered to take charge. The probate court named them administrators. **********Night after night they rummaged through boxes of unopened mail -- some of it dating back 15 years -- in the mother's mobile home, trying to figure out his finances. Soon, the lawyer they hired was gone, having been indicted on an embezzlement charge in another case. Then, someone they didn't know showed up in town, asked Ms. Taylor to meet him at Kinko's, and explained over the copying machine that the deceased owed him thousands of dollars. A lawsuit followed, costing the estate roughly $75,000 in legal fees -- which the estate had to borrow to cover. **********Now, Ms. Taylor's advice to would-be executors is ''never, never do this.'' **********Many people, no matter how much easier their experience, say the same thing. (Dickens's ''Bleak House,'' after all, was about an estate.) Still, someone has to marshal assets, pay debts and taxes, and then distribute what is left. And that someone, especially when administering a parent or spouse's estate, generally has deep interests in making sure the job is done with loyalty and care and a minimum loss of cash. **********The tasks can take hours, weeks or even months longer than expected. Disputes can spring from nowhere, and personal relationships are tested. And for all the agony of settling the estate, the executor is legally accountable -- sometimes under penalty of being held personally liable for losses. **********''It's hard, especially when the child has to do it,'' said Michael D. Assaf, an Albany lawyer who does estate work and has confronted it on a personal level since his father died in July. ''To look through the files and see my father's handwriting and know that I'll never get a note from him again is very hard,'' he said. ''You just have to set aside the personal devastation.'' **********Almost always, a will names an executor to administer estates. If there is no will, a court appoints someone, who is called the administrator of the estate. The duties are effectively the same, though the executor carries out the terms of the will while the administrator follows the state's rules as to who gets the assets. Professionals in estate work often prefer the term ''personal representative,'' which applies to either. **********The job can be refused, and should be if the candidate does not get along well with a beneficiary -- typically, a case of adult sibling rivalry -- or cannot spare the time or is, as Mary Lou Parker, an estate lawyer in Morristown, N.J., put it, ''the sort of person who never cares if his checkbook balances.'' **********THE executor need not be a relative or lawyer or even a person: many people name banks or trust companies as executors or as co-executors with a relative. And an individual can turn over much of the work to lawyers, accountants and bankers. **********But the executor is ultimately responsible for their work. And it is the executor who usually does the small but perplexing chores like finding the duplicate car keys and having the stamp collection appraised. **********Beginning with funeral expenses, the executor must record every dime spent and collected for the estate. Most people open a checking account just for that purpose. **********As soon as is practical, the executor starts to marshal assets -- finding them, gathering account numbers and statements, setting up an inventory of personal property. Early estimates of the estate's value, along with documentation, will be crucial if there are tax complications. The executor should also determine whether there is property in two states, which means two sets of laws and, possibly, two court proceedings. **********Although the death of Mr. Assaf's father was unexpected, he had left a ''road map'' explaining where his assets and investments were. ''My father was a genius with these things,'' Mr. Assaf said. **********Many people aren't, though, and most do not heed well-worn advice to save their survivors a lot of money and trouble by putting together a good estate plan -- or even to save them from panic by making a list of accounts, investments and property. **********Mr. Assaf noted that the executor must also ''determine whether the survivors need money right away.'' **********''You have to focus on who's left behind,'' he said, ''and you can't have the surviving spouse or the heirs whom the decedent supported in his lifetime filing for bankruptcy.'' That often means collecting life insurance or death benefits quickly. **********The next step is determining whether probate is necessary. Essentially, probate is court oversight of the collection and distribution of assets, and is required only for property owned solely by the deceased. Assets that are owned jointly (often, real estate and bank accounts) or are payable to a named beneficiary (life insurance, trusts or retirement funds) almost always pass automatically to the co-owner or beneficiary. **********Most estates have both probate and nonprobate assets. Some, even very big estates, have been set up entirely in trusts and other nonprobate assets -- in which case the executor may help distribute them but otherwise has little more to do. If the probate assets are modest, the estate may qualify for expedited procedures under small-estate exceptions. In New York and New Jersey, the limit for such exceptions is $10,000. **********ADVICE on getting around the process abounds. Norman F. Dacey's ''How to Avoid Probate!'' (HarperCollins) is in its fifth edition. But estate experts point out that court costs are minor -- generally, a few hundred dollars -- if the will is uncontested. **********''People say, 'I should avoid probate, it's a terrible, onerous experience,' '' Mr. Assaf said. ''But it really isn't. If all the relatives are in agreement, it's not a problem. If they're not, it can be an absolute nightmare. **********''I did an estate in Nassau County, and these people dropped a ton of money on me,'' he said. ''I kept saying, 'The meter is running; what are you doing?' So if you have contentious relatives, do whatever you can to avoid probate. Anybody can dream up an objection to the will.'' **********To open probate, the will must be filed with the court, usually within 30 days of the death. When there is no will -- and in more than half the cases entering probate there isn't -- the court requires the death certificate and verification of the survivors' status. Either way, the court authorizes an executor or administrator to deal on the estate's behalf with the rest of the world. **********Many executors slog through probate with a lawyer and a financial adviser, whose fees, together, commonly eat up 5 to 10 percent of an estate's assets. A bank or trust company generally charges about 1 percent of the value of the assets it manages. Some lawyers work on a percentage basis, too, depending on state law. **********But ''any executor who's on the ball can negotiate an hourly fee basis, and in an estate of $100,000 or upwards will probably come out ahead,'' said Leigh W. Bauer, an estate lawyer in Philadelphia. ''You take an estate of $2 million or $3 million, and absent family fighting or crazy limited partnerships that take a lot of undoing,'' he said, ''there isn't a lot more work in administering it than there is with a small estate.'' **********But the little things can be the most troublesome; it is easier to value and sell securities than the contents of the attic. In any case, beneficiaries should be informed. **********''Everything you do can and will be second-guessed,'' said Michael J. Mullaugh, first vice president and manager of the estate settlement unit at Mellon Private Asset Management in Pittsburgh. ''You might say, 'Well, we have a 1990 Buick here that we're inclined to have sold through so-and-so's auto auction.' Somebody will say, 'No, that's not the way to sell it.' You hope, after a couple of discussions of this type, that you begin to be trusted.'' **********Jean Maffucci of Somesville, Me., estimated that she spent 150 to 200 hours over six months as co-executor of a longtime friend's estate, which was rich in art and antiques. Her friend tried to warn her, Ms. Maffucci said: ''I'd be at her house and she would say, 'I want to go over these things with you.' But I didn't want to talk about it -- she was living; she was fine.'' **********When her friend died last year, Ms. Maffucci, who lived in Westchester County at the time, collected names of people in the Oriental rug business and eventually received a six-page appraisal for $400. She asked a jeweler to inspect the diamond rings and called three liquidators for bids on selling the household goods. **********''You have to make sure you're getting top dollar because the heirs come back at you,'' she explained. ''It's their right to come back at you.'' **********Personal effects can also generate bitter fights. One of the oddest disputes concerned 15 vials of deposits in a Los Angeles sperm bank, which were given to a decedent's girlfriend in a will contested by his grown children. The girlfriend won. **********Other assets can generate more expensive fighting, especially when their value falls. **********''Say you sat on a stock for a year and its value dropped from $1 million to $100,000,'' said Charles K. Plotnick, a lawyer in Jenkintown, Pa., and co-author of ''How to Settle an Estate'' (Consumer Reports Books, 1991). ''That should be actionable.'' **********Nor can blame always be passed to a lawyer or other agent who gave bad advice. An elderly widow who hired an incompetent lawyer might not be held liable for a mess that he caused, Mr. Plotnick said, ''but what if it's a young, sharp, vital widow whose boyfriend of the moment happens to be a lawyer?'' **********Then there are the creditors. Ordinarily, settling debts begins with newspaper publication of notices that probate has begun. Depending on the state, creditors have 90 days to a year to come forward. **********A CREDITOR'S claim was the biggest jolt for Ms. Taylor and Ms. McGarry. **********''This man came down from the mountains'' in Santa Cruz County, Ms. Taylor said, and presented a letter from the deceased that promised him $4,000 a month for working on a property he owned there. ''It was like the worst movie you ever saw.'' **********The matter was dismissed for failure to file the claim in time; the court never ruled on whether it was valid. **********The most important creditor is usually the government. The Federal estate tax applies to estates with a net value exceeding $600,000, although an estate of any size can pass to the surviving spouse tax-free. The tax is levied on total assets, including jointly owned property, life insurance proceeds and interest in community property. The return and payment are due nine months after death. **********In addition, most states charge an estate tax or an inheritance tax, paid by beneficiaries. Taxes are also due on the deceased's last income and on income the estate has received. **********Back taxes can present a problem, too. Ms. Taylor and Ms. McGarry had to file and pay 10 to 15 years' worth. Ms. Parker, the Morristown lawyer, noted that elderly and ill people often had trouble with tax returns. ''Take the effort to piece together the information and make sure the person satisfied all tax obligations,'' she said. **********For Federal estate tax purposes, the filing deadline is also the deadline for exercising an important option for large estates: the disclaimer. This is available to the primary heir, usually the surviving spouse, who can turn down part of the inheritance so it can go to the next in line, often the children. Those assets are protected from estate taxes when the primary heir dies. **********''It's the thing most often overlooked,'' Mr. Bauer said. ''This limited planning that you can do after death can save you $200,000 in the first three minutes of conversation.'' **********Once tax returns are accepted by tax authorities, distributions can be calculated. Sometimes beneficiaries need earlier distributions, and in some states are entitled to them, but the executor should know the tax consequences. If the estate comes up short, the executor will have to recover money, which is why anyone receiving an early payment should be asked to sign a receipt acknowledging that they may have to return some of the money. **********Among the last expenses is the executor's fee, which is often established by state law. An executor who is the estate's principal or sole beneficiary may waive the fee rather than pay income tax on it. For others, the fee is usually small recompense. Ms. McGarry and Ms. Taylor, for example, collected theirs when the estate closed last winter, after more than four years' work. Each received $5,000. **********Estate Planning, for Executors **********Here is a a checklist of responsibilities for the executor of an estate. The list will be longer for some and shorter for others -- and can be much shorter if an estate  does not have to go through probate court. Some requirements vary according to state law. *********** Order death certificates. You will need copies for banks, the post office, insurers and others. *********** Find the will. If the will is in a safe deposit box, you may need court permission to gain access. Distribute copies to beneficiaries. *********** Consult a lawyer. Other professionals, especially tax accountants, can also be helpful before distributions are made. *********** Make notifications. Ask the post office to have all mail forwarded to executor. Notify life insurance agents, the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration, if applicable, and other potential sources of death benefits, including former employers. *********** Begin to marshal assets. Gather bank and brokerage statements from at least the previous three years. Make a preliminary estimate of the value of real estate and personal property, and of the  estate's total value. *********** Assess survivors' immediate cash needs. If the surviving spouse, for example, needs money for living expenses, you can help collect nonprobate assets like life insurance proceeds. *********** Make any payments necessary to avoid default. These often include a home mortgage, but check other loan obligations. Make sure that insurance on home and personal property is adequate. *********** Apply to probate court. The court procedures will vary depending on whether there was a will; you should register the will even if you aren't sure probate will be required. *********** Proceed with accounting. Compile a list of assets and property for the court, and obtain appraisals if necessary; record every expenditure. *********** Pay creditors. Put legal notices in newspapers. Tell creditors personally if any payments will be delayed. *********** Remember tax returns. Collect past returns; make sure there are no outstanding obligations. File current returns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/business/worldbusiness/IHT-cyberscape-new-media-race-for-the-spotlight.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Covington", "pub_date": "1996-02-12", "snippet": "While some publishers, on-line services and software companies vied for attention and market share with their multimedia offerings here, the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was demonstrating how a computer fits into a sneake...", "word_count": 4183, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CYBERSCAPE : New Media Race For the Spotlight", "print_headline": "CYBERSCAPE : New Media Race For the Spotlight", "body_text": " **********While some publishers, on-line services and software companies vied for attention and market share with their multimedia offerings here, the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was demonstrating how a computer fits into a sneaker. **********\"Multimedia had become too corporate and a bit boring,\" said Nicholas Negroponte, founder of Media Lab, who was demonstrating the computer-fitted footwear at the Milia multimedia conference. **********The shoe, made for Nike Inc. eventually might be able to communicate witha computer embedded in a wristwatch, allowing equipped users to exchange data with a handshake. **********But for the audience of new-media executives and creators, the focus was on the Internet. **********Mr. Negropontesees the Internet becoming anelectronic marketplace, with transactions conducted using electronic money. \"When all this digital cash starts floating around the Net, government treasuries will become apoplectic,\" he said. **********Largely because of concerns over security, buying goods and services over the Internet has trailed well behind advertising and subscription fees as a means of generating revenue.

America Online, the leading U.S. service with about 5 million subscribers there, is launchingAOL Europe in a venture with the German media company Bertelsmann AG and Deutsche Telekom AG. AOL Europe hopes to overtake CompuServe in Europe within two years. **********Despite the potential competition from these proliferating on-line services, traditional suppliers of CD-ROMs are confident that consumers will continue to build up multimedia libraries instead of downloading titles from on-line servers. Largely because of inferior image quality and slow data transfer, \"it will take a long time before the World Wide Web will replace CD-ROM distribution,\" said Robert Stein, co-founder of the Voyager Co., a pioneer in multimedia publishing. \"Even though people are spending more of their disposable time on-line and less on CD-ROMs, there is still a need to acquire the physical title, just like building a library of books that represent your intellectual history,\" he said. **********Simon & Schuster Inc., Macmillan Ltd., Hachette Filipacchi, and the German publisher Burda GmbH were among the traditional book publishers flocking here with multimedia titles. With 90 CD-ROMs, including several based on the \"Star Trek\" television series, Simon & Schuster, a division of Viacom Inc., has plunged into the medium. Douglas Bennett, a vice president of the publisher's new-media group, said he saw little cannibalization of the CD-ROM market by on-line services until the bandwidth, or the capacity of the wirescarrying the services, expands to provide quality similar to that from compact disks.

A girl in  a campground in Virginia's Shenandoah Mountains is rushed to the hospital after  an accident. A climber trapped by a storm on Mount Rainier in Washington is rescued. As diverse as these predicaments were, they had one thing in common: help was summoned by cellular phone. **********What was once an expensive gadget for overachieving young urban professionals is increasingly showing up in backpacks and boat lockers as prices fall and concern for personal safety rises. Like it or not -- and there are those who do  not, believing that the wilderness should be a refuge from the trappings of modernity -- the great outdoors may well be the next frontier of the cellular communications industry. **********This spring, Metacomm Cellular Partners of Cody, Wyo., began offering cellular phone service in Yellowstone National Park by way of three transmitters that the park allowed Metacomm to install. The company is betting that many of the three million annual visitors to the 2.2 million-acre park will want to be just a phone call away from home -- or help. Yosemite and Grand Teton National Parks and several other national wilderness areas had cellular coverage even earlier. **********\"It's possible the cell phone could become part of your first-aid kit,\" said  Mark Jenkins, the Rocky Mountain editor at Backpacker magazine. **********As demand from business has started to level off, cellular phone companies have designed so-called basic pricing plans for consumers, like working parents  trying to juggle schedules or women driving alone at night. **********These plans, with monthly service fees as low as $20, represent the fastest-growing segment of cellular customers today, accounting for about two-thirds of all new customers, according to Sharon Armbrust, a senior telecommunications analyst at Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif. **********About half of those sales, she said, are to people who want to carry a cellular phone primarily for security and occasional use. Sports enthusiasts and wilderness adventurers typically fit in this group, industry experts say, although people who have cellular phones for other purposes, like business, are  bringing them to outdoor activities. **********One drawback to taking the phones into remote areas is that leaving them turned on to receive calls can run down the batteries in half a day. Because there is no way to recharge them, a hiker or camper might need to carry spares. **********Ms. Armbrust believes that it will be some time before the cellular phone industry creates packages for wilderness users or, for that matter, for any particular group. With the number of cellular products sold increasing 35 percent to 40 percent annually, cellular businesses simply don't need to. \"They're just signing on people as fast as they can,\" Ms.  Armbrust said. **********Last year, she said, cellular service contracts and products totaled nearly $23 billion. **********Pricing for basic plans varies greatly among service areas and carriers. Even plans that appear inexpensive, however, can lead to high monthly bills. **********AT&T Wireless Services sells a basic plan in New York and New Jersey for $19.99 a month, or $29.99 with 30 minutes of connection time included. As with all services, calls outside the local area are billed at long-distance rates. Frequent-caller plans, aimed at business customers, cost up to $359.99 a month,  including 15 1/2 hours of connection time. **********TO sell the cellular phone service, phone retailers like AT&T often give the  phones away, or sell them at a nominal price of $1 to $20, if the customer signs a contract for cellular service. For phones that are especially lightweight or have special features, the price can run well into the hundreds of dollars. **********Metacomm, which serves Wyoming, sells a basic service plan for $23.95 a month, with no connection time included. But customers who sign a 24-month contract can get a phone at no extra charge. Otherwise, phone prices start at about $140. For business customers, the company offers a monthly service plan for $105 a month, including 5 1/2 hours of connection time. **********Taking a cellular phone into another carrier's service area typically also incurs a roaming charge, which also varies greatly. Within Yellowstone, for example, Metacomm adds a surcharge of 50 cents to 99 cents a minute to calls made by subscribers to other carriers. **********Cellular companies also are not focusing on backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts because service in remote areas can be spotty, depending on location and terrain. **********Cellular phones communicate with relay stations by way of radio frequencies,  and hills can block signals. But cellular carriers are extending coverage throughout the country, and reception in the wilderness could improve greatly in the next few years. **********Inside Yellowstone, the demand for cellular services has been high since Metacomm began testing the transmitters last fall. **********\"Within 30 seconds of having the first transmitters up, a couple of calls came through,\" said Gary Begaman, market manager for Metacomm, a Cellular One franchise based in Wayne, N.J. \"Some of the outfitters, guides and even the hunters themselves take cellular phones with them. Coverage isn't 100 percent, but if they need to, they can climb a high ridge to make a call,\" he said. The company also provided phones and limited free service to park rangers on duty. **********Mr. Jenkins of Backpacker magazine believes there is not more cellular phone  use among the magazine's readers partly because outdoor enthusiasts may be reluctant to bring technology into the wilderness. But he added that such resistance could well be worn down as cellular phones become more common in everyday life and as costs continue to fall. **********That may already be happening. The August issue of Rock and Ice, a climbing magazine, called the phones a simple, inexpensive alternative to often bulky radio equipment, but it also warned that the phones were not as reliable in remote areas. **********The wiring of the wilderness has prompted debate about technology in the wild and whether it can give hikers and climbers a false sense of security.

We preferred to do things ourselves,\" said Shim Sang Dal, senior counselor to the deputy prime minister, Han Seung Soo, who also heads the powerful Ministry of Finance and Economy. \"Korea has been quite proud that we have built our industries withoutmuch foreign presence.\" **********\"But the old strategy is not working any more. In our initial stages we worked at putting things together, but that pattern is no longer appropriate,\" Mr. Shim said. \"The crux of segyehwa is to change that mind-set.\" **********At the same time,South Korean policymakers are searching for the best ways to wean the country off high growth expectations that once served it well but are no longer sustainable, or compatible, with its current stage of development. **********Through much of 1995, South Korea's gross domestic product grew at a rate close to 10 percent annually, but it began slipping in the last quarter of the year. In the second quarter of 1996, growth had weakened to 6.7 percent, forcing the government to recast its full year estimates for 1996 growth to only 7 percent. **********But amid a popular clamor of concern about a weakening economy, analystsargue that a slowdown is actually beneficial.\"We need to realize that we have run up against the limit of a quantitative-oriented growth strategy that relies on increments of factors of production,\" said Mr. Han, the recently appointed deputy prime minister,in his first policy speech in mid-August. **********\"Proof of this can be see in our ever increasing imports of foreign labor and rising overseas investments by our domestic firms,\"he added, touching onconcerns of a \"hollowing out\" of Korean industry and the specter ofjob losses. **********Long a meticulously planned economy where the central government placed most policy decisions second to the creation and fueling of a powerful manufacturing export machine, South Korea now stands at a difficult crossroads. **********\"My concern, my worry is that we had a developmental dictatorship for so long,\" said Chung Mong Joon, a prominent independent legislator whose family controls the Hyundai Group, the country's second largest conglomerate. \"Now we have a civilian government that takes too populist a view. It's not good for the economy.\" **********At the same time,South Korea is finding that rising national wealth means it can no longer compete on low prices alone for its goods in world markets. **********Rising wage and land costs, a heavy dependence on imported resources and raw materials for its manufacturers, and domestic interest rates that are a disadvantage to borrowers trying to compete in international markets require a nationwide retooling of industry and business thinking. **********Government officials, economists and industrialistsagree that the country needs to rely more on brainpower and efficiency than brawn and de facto export subsidies although not everyone isready to abandon an emphasis on high growth. **********In the first seven months of the year, South Korea's trade deficit surged to a record $10.3 billion, nearly matching the corresponding figure of $10.6 billion for all of last year. **********Semiconductors, which now account for nearly one-fifth of all South Korean exports, have endured a 70 percent fall in prices due to a global slump in computer and high-technology industries. Government officials estimate that low computer chips prices alone account for a $7 billion to $9 billion shortfall in trade results. **********At the same time, the country's current-account deficit reached $9.29 billion in the first half of this year, eclipsing full year figures for 1995. The tourism deficit alone attributed for $1.17 billion of that deficit. Both trends were exacerbated by a strengthening of the local currency, the won, against the Japanese yen, which has especially hurt Korean exporters' competitiveness against Japanese goods. **********While many analysts argue that South Korea'sdifficulties may soon right themselves when world demand forsemiconductorsstrengthens and when the yen, inevitably,strengthens again, others argue that thedownturn confirms the need for major structural reforms. **********In the meantime, Korea's largest corporations show little sign of slowing their outward investments.

Michael Brown, the chief executive of Thomson, said his company accepted  the provisions and summed up the process as \"a fair but exhausting review.\" **********The antitrust review had been joined by seven states, including New York, Connecticut and California. They had objected that a combination of Thomson and  West, two of the biggest legal publishing powers, would reduce bidding for distribution of each state's legal records while raising costs to consumers. **********Though all legal records are public documents, states earn income by auctioning electronic versions of their court proceedings to publishers like Thomson and West, which then plug in electronic links to footnotes, page references and cross references for customers. **********The other states that took part in the settlement were Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. **********\"This settlement is a victory for all of us,\" said Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. \"Competition in the legal publishing industry helps keep costs low, improves product quality and increases innovation.\" **********To carry out the agreement, the Justice Department will simultaneously file an antitrust suit against the proposed merger and a consent decree outlining the divestitures. The proceedings will take place in Federal District Court in Washington. **********The 58 publications to be sold are owned by West and were deemed to overlap with services already provided by Thomson. Most are devoted to state legal proceedings and include a legal citation program and several state and Federal research guides. Most of the publications exist only in electronic form. **********The consent decree allows California, Washington and Wisconsin to reopen bidding on state court reports now contracted to Thomson. Thomson also agreed to license West's proprietary page reference system, Star Pagination, to competing  services. That is an important concession, because the system amounts to a kind  of research language that law librarians and researchers have learned and that they are unlikely to voluntarily give up for a competing one. **********The services to be sold account for about 4 percent of West's legal publishing income and are within the range of concessions that Thomson expected  to make, Mr. Brown said. **********Thomson, which is based in Toronto but also has a headquarters in Stamford, Conn., owns research services like the Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Company and Clark Boardman Callahan through a subsidiary, Thomson Legal Publishing. It had sales from legal research services of $368 million last year. **********West Publishing is a closely held company -- it has only 200 shareholders --  based in Eagan, Minn. It is best known for its Westlaw research service and had  $700 million in revenue from legal-affairs publishing last year, according to the Justice Department. **********The approval of the purchase is a partial setback for Lexis-Nexis Inc., the legal and current-affairs research service owned by Reed Elsevier P.L.C. of London, which is a major competitor of Thomson's. But under the terms announced  yesterday, Thomson agreed to extend for five years Lexis-Nexis's license to three nonlegal data bases owned by Thomson. **********Analysts praised Thomson for its acquisition of West when the purchase was announced in February, even though the transaction is mostly financed by debt, which will be a drag on Thomson's earnings for the next few years. Because each  company brings strengths that the other lacks, however, analysts were confident  that the venture would be profitable, and Mr. Brown has said that the cost of the purchase will be paid off in about a decade. **********The move is also Thomson's most expensive step so far away from its traditional role as a newspaper publisher, a shaky business these days, and toward the more dependable cash flows of electronic research publishing. **********Thomson has sold numerous small newspapers in recent years, and today it derives a declining portion of its revenue from printed publications. The company, whose revenue was $7.25 billion in 1995, operates primarily in the United States, Britain and Canada. **********Jamie Love of the Center for Study of Responsive Law, an organization founded by Ralph Nader, said the proposed settlement was a good one. \"The Justice Department's agreement is not a trivial accomplishment,\" he said. \"It really preserves competition in the market.\" **********The article also misidentified the publications' medium.

Morgan Investment Management, said that  \"throughout 1995, Taiwanese authorities gave the impression they were welcoming  and encouraging foreign capital, and we were very encouraged by the moves.\" **********\"But this capital gains tax stance is very disappointing to us,\" Mr. Baez added. \"We hope it will be reconsidered.\" **********Nicholas Horsley, co-manager of the Warburg Pincus Emerging Markets Fund, was less diplomatic. **********\"They rammed this through, and it was a total ambush,\" he said. \"Whoever is the Government whip in Parliament ought to be drawn and quartered.\" **********This episode adds to the list of imponderables facing those who have invested in or are considering entering Taiwan's riotous stock market, where local investors routinely turn their portfolios over once a week. **********But Mr. Horsley said that potential investors should ignore the capital gains issue, as well as the approaching election and the nature of Taiwan's future relationship with China, and focus on the fundamentals. **********\"Ignore the politics, go ahead and invest,\" he said. \"The economics are compelling.\" **********In Mr. Horsley's view, the facts worth considering are: an economy that is likely to expand at better than a 7 percent rate; high corporate earnings growth; a very low rate of inflation and a country that has the world's second-highest level of foreign reserves, after Japan. Moreover, given the magnitude of the sell-off last year and so far in 1996, stock prices seem highly attractive. **********Mr. Baez, who was not quite so bullish, conceded the latter point. **********\"On a historical basis, the market looks pretty cheap,\" he said, noting that  in recent years the average price-earnings ratio for the market has been about 30, but is now about half that. **********After acknowledging that Taiwan has \"great companies,\" Mr. Ishibashi said that for the time being he intended to stay away. **********The events of last year -- including Chinese missile tests over Taiwan as well as trial amphibious troop landings conducted by Beijing on the Chinese coast -- upset investors and Taiwan citizens alike. **********\"The overriding consideration is the elections,\" Mr. Ishibashi said. \"At some point, I will be getting into the market. But until March the market will move in a sawtooth pattern.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/business/high-tech-accounts-are-settled.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-09-16", "snippet": "Haht Software Inc names FGI Inc to handle its account; VMARK Software Inc selects Wallwork Curry to handle its account; Dell Computer Corp names Grey Interactive unit of Grey Advertising, and Digital Ink Co selects Mezzina/Brown to handle its acco...", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High-Tech Accounts Are Settled", "print_headline": "High-Tech Accounts Are Settled", "body_text": " **********Four software and high-tech marketers have made account decisions. **********Haht Software Inc. in Raleigh, N.C., named FGI Inc. in Chapel Hill, N.C., as the first agency to handle its account.

In this case, the claim is only slightly exaggerated. For merely a dollar -- make that $15 if you include delivery to some of the least accessible places on earth -- Unicef can immunize an infant against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, polio and tuberculosis. No surprise, then, that the World Bank estimates that the Expanded Program of Immunization-Plus, a package with the basic six vaccines, ''has the highest cost-effectiveness of any health measure available today.'' **********The catch is that the wide diffusion of vaccines depends on multitier pricing in which the wealthy markets bear the enormous development costs while poor markets cover only their share of the manufacturing costs. The ''State of the World's Vaccines and Immunization,'' a largely celebratory report issued yesterday by Unicef and the World Health Organization, hints at serious political and economic problems ahead in keeping Robin Hood in charge of the game. **********The focused immunization effort by W.H.O. and Unicef, begun in 1974, is a roaring success. Vaccination coverage against the six target diseases has risen from 5 percent of the world's newborns to 80 percent today, cutting childhood deaths by about three million a year. Polio will probably follow the way of smallpox into extinction within a decade, relieving developed countries of the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to immunize their own young. **********So, too, is the system for keeping costs manageable in the third world. Vaccines are bought in bulk from private manufacturers at rock-bottom  prices. A ''cold chain'' delivery network, developed over the years by Unicef and W.H.O. in coordination with local authorities, maintains vaccine quality with minimal use of high-priced foreign personnel. **********But strains are showing. Vaccine sales at high markups in rich countries, needed to sustain variable-cost pricing in poor ones, is a continuing  source of political tension. The issue made headlines in 1993 when President Clinton attacked discriminatory pricing against America, proposing as a remedy that the Federal Government act as a monopoly buyer of basic vaccines for the nation. And the new report suggests that such strains will grow. **********For one thing, some 14 vaccines have entered the market since 1980 and dozens more are in the pipeline. Research costs, the report estimates, are running from $50 million to $200 million for every  vaccine. And while most of the new vaccines are likely to prove cost-effective when the development outlays are averaged among wealthy and needy populations, nobody is rushing forward to foot the overhead. **********''We've built up the expectation that antibiotics are expensive and vaccines are cheap,'' said Amy Batson, a senior official at W.H.O. ''It's easy to justify high prices for medicines that save people, once they have a disease. It's a lot harder to underwrite the costs of prevention.'' **********For another, ownership of the ''intellectual property'' in vaccines is growing more tangled as the research effort spreads from the old-line pharmaceutical houses to universities and private labs.  This complicates the process of negotiating low or zero-royalty charges on behalf of customers who cannot possibly afford more than pennies a dose. **********Perhaps most important, the lines between rich and poor consumers are becoming blurred. Rapidly growing economies like China and Brazil have far greater capacity to absorb the overhead in creating vaccines than subsistence economies like Bhutan and Somalia. One could also argue -- as President Clinton, in effect, did -- that poor Americans have a greater moral claim to vaccines at cost than, say, middle-class citizens of Brazil. **********W.H.O. and Unicef offer a two-pronged fix. They want to divide the countries they now serve into four categories ranging from Laos and Mozambique, which will be asked to pay only a token share of vaccine costs, to Turkey and Malaysia, which will be asked to bear a substantial portion, to Russia and Mexico, which ''would be left to their own devices.'' **********Less specifically, they want decision-makers to get more serious about priorities. Vaccines that can be manufactured cheaply (like the yellow fever vaccine) should be delivered where they are needed as quickly as possible. But costs must be weighed against benefits for more expensive vaccines, like the one against Hib bacterial meningitis now widely used in the industrial countries. **********Walter Vandersmissen, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham in Belgium, agrees ''as a matter of global principle'' that most of the overhead in vaccine development should be assigned to consumers with deep pockets. But vaccine manufacturers are uneasy about opening their pricing policies to public debate, the likely consequence as the armory against infectious diseases expands along with costs and life-death choices became stark. ''Everyone likes multitier pricing as long as the price they pay is the lowest,'' Mr. Vandersmissen said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/deloitte-touche-agrees-to-a-settlement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deloitte & Touche Agrees to a Settlement", "print_headline": "Deloitte & Touche Agrees to a Settlement", "body_text": " **********The accounting and consulting firm of Deloitte & Touche has agreed to pay $65 million to settle claims it contributed to the collapse of Bonneville Pacific. **********Deloitte & Touche maintained on Tuesday that it had complied with professional standards in serving the energy company, which is now defunct, but said the settlement freed it from a potentially long and costly court battle. **********If the settlement is approved by both United States District Judge Bruce S.

Amid signs that the crisis was easing, he said the troops were intended to insure that Mr. Hussein keeps his promise not to attack American jets patrolling the skies over Iraq and to diminish any threat to Iraq's neighbors, including Kuwait. **********The State Department also announced that the Administration had delivered a second formal message to Iraq outlining the steps Mr. Hussein must take to avoid further military retaliation by the United States. The department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said ''the Iraqis now have a very clear understanding of what is required of them.'' **********While officials refused to say what was on the Administration's list of demands, the United States reiterated its insistence that Iraq do nothing to threaten American and allied jets patrolling the ''no flight'' zones in northern and southern Iraq, nor to rebuild air defenses damaged by American missiles two weeks ago. **********''The message that we conveyed to the Iraqis will remain in effect indefinitely,'' Mr. Burns said.

Perry and other senior aides, met at the White House this morning with Congressional leaders to review ''what we have accomplished in Iraq and where we are going,'' as Mr. Clinton put it. **********But in the middle of an election campaign in which Republicans have portrayed Mr. Clinton as weak and indecisive in foreign affairs, the meeting appeared to do little to smooth over the divisions about the Administration's actions. The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, expressed tempered satisfaction after the meeting, but added that there had been ''some neglect and ambiguity'' in the policy toward Iraq. **********''That's not the way you can deal with that dictator in Iraq,'' he said. **********The sharpest criticism, said people who attended the meeting, came from Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican who is a friend and adviser to the Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole. Afterward, Mr. McCain said the Administration had ''unfortunately not matched deeds with rhetoric,'' pointing out that the United States had appeared to back down a week after  Mr. Perry had warned Iraq of a ''disproportionate'' retaliation after its forces fired at American jets. **********''Saddam Hussein is far better off than he was two weeks ago,'' Mr. McCain said. ''You judge success by results.'' **********Asked about the criticism, Mr. Clinton insisted that the United States had made Mr. Hussein pay a price for his military campaign by striking his air defenses and extending the ''no flight'' zone in southern Iraq to the suburbs of Baghdad. **********''The response that we gave was one designed to improve the strategic position of the United States and our allies, to keep Saddam Hussein in a box and to limit his ability to threaten his neighbors,'' he said. **********The Clinton Administration has also been criticized for focusing American retaliation on Iraq's defenses in the south despite the fact that Baghdad's military campaign occurred in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. **********But the Administration sought today to undercut any strategic gains Mr. Hussein may have made by aiding the Kurdistan Democratic Party in its fight against its rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The State Department announced that the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., would meet with the Kurdistan Democratic Party's leader, Massoud Barzani, whose forces invited Iraq to intervene and help capture the Kurdish city of Erbil. **********Mr. Burns, the department's spokesman, said that the meeting would probably take place on Thursday in Turkey and that Mr. Pelletreau would try to persuade Mr. Barzani to abandon any alliance with Iraq and reach a peaceful settlement with the Patriotic Union. **********''Mr. Barzani's relationship with Saddam Hussein cannot be in the long-term interest of his people or of himself,'' Mr. Burns said. **********The additional American troops dispatched to Kuwait will join some 1,200 others already stationed there. The troops, from Fort Hood in Texas, will use armored equipment the United States left in place after the Persian Gulf war. **********Mr. Perry said that full force -- nearly 5,000 troops in all -- will conduct exercises in the Kuwaiti desert. He added that the United States had also sent F-117 Stealth fighters and a Patriot missile battery capable of intercepting missiles. **********Asked why the United States was sending the forces into Kuwait, Mr. Perry replied, ''We're doing it because the Kuwaiti Government feels threatened.'' Kuwait had initially balked at the deployment, after the Pentagon announced it before consulting with Kuwaiti leaders, but Mr. Perry said that the Government had been willing to accept the troops. **********Kuwait is heavily defended by American and allied air power.

But Hans Zimmer, the composer who won last year's  film-score Oscar for \"The Lion King,\" said he doubted that the enhanced CD format had anything to do with the \"Nixon\" score's nomination. **********\"The academy is made up of a lot of people who don't even know how to put a disk into a Mac or an I.B.M.,\" Mr. Zimmer said. \" 'Nixon' was nominated because it was a serious piece of work by a serious composer.\" **********Regardless of what the enhanced CD format did or not do to enhance the \"Nixon\" score, the release of a film soundtrack may help give the format a raison d'etre. Since its introduction in late 1994, the enhanced CD has remained primarily an experimental technology used by artists outside the music industry's mainstream. **********The idea for an enhanced CD, which does not contain as much multimedia content as the average CD-ROM, was conceived as a way to recapture the space for art and \"liner notes\" text that was lost when the 12-inch L.P. album cover was compressed into the 5 1/2-inch compact-disk case. These new disks, which are usually priced comparably to standard CD's, can contain music videos, interviews, drawings, still photography and other material that complements the  music. **********Though the medium is still a work in progress, major labels like Sony, Capitol, Warner Brothers and Atlantic have active enhanced-CD departments. Veteran artists looking for a new edge -- including the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Yoko Ono, Todd Rundgren and Jackson Browne -- have released enhanced products, while younger bands are recognizing the format as a way to underscore their cutting-edge cachet or convey their identities to a public not  yet familiar with them. **********But unlike these artistic embellishments, which add costs to the making of an album without necessarily adding many buyers, the release of a movie soundtrack  on enhanced CD allows the producers to recycle at least some existing material from the film-making and movie-marketing process. **********In fact, the \"Nixon\" enhanced CD is something of a spinoff from a larger endeavor, a Graphix Zone CD-ROM biographical project on Richard Nixon that began as a tie-in to the Oliver Stone film. It was during work on the CD-ROM that the  developers had the idea for enhancing the soundtrack disk. Graphix Zone's next enhanced soundtrack, a hard-rock disk produced with Philips  Media, is for \"Barb Wire,\" a Gramercy Pictures film adaptation of a cult comic-book hero. The disk is to be released this spring in advance of the movie, and the hope is that the stunts, special effects, interviews and behind-the-scenes footage will help sell the disk, which will in turn help sell  the film, said Ted Cohen, vice president of multimedia music at Philips Media, which, along with Gramercy Pictures, is owned by Philips Electronics N.V. **********Other producers see film buffs, not music lovers, as the target audience for  enhanced-CD soundtracks. **********\"This process is for those who love film and know more about the individual movie, the actors and how it was made,\" said Paul Atkinson, president of nu.millennia/records, a Los Angeles label that is developing an enhanced soundtrack for the Geena Davis pirate movie \"Cutthroat Island.\" **********Given how few people were willing to buy tickets to the movie, it is unclear  how many will care to delve digitally behind its scenes. The non-enhanced \"Cutthroat Island\" CD is already on the market, having been released in time to  accompany the movie, which opened in December. **********So far, sales of the music-only album are beneath Sound Scan's radar screen.  But those purchasing the album are receiving a mail-in coupon entitling them to  a computer disk, due in May, billed as a \"behind-the-scenes multimedia adventure.\" **********Mr. Zimmer, the \"Lion King\" composer, who said he would remain open to the idea of enhanced-CD opportunities for future projects, said that he was interested in pushing the medium beyond mere movie promotion. He said he saw an opportunity to tap into the interactive capabilities of computer disks to give the user a more creative role. **********\"A composer could supply musical fragments, allowing people to put them against a scene and see the different emotional reactions,\" Mr. Zimmer said. \"I  could give you the tools to impose your own sensibilities onto a scene. It could be a fun game.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/world/israelis-and-palestinians-open-final-stage-of-peace-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1019, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israelis and Palestinians Open Final Stage of Peace Talks", "print_headline": "Israelis and Palestinians Open Final Stage of Peace Talks", "body_text": " **********Israeli and Palestinian negotiators today formally opened the final and most  difficult stage of their search for a comprehensive peace settlement, the \"final status\" talks that require them to resolve their bitterest differences within three years. **********The meeting was timed to meet the deadline for the start of the final round of talks as set out in the Israeli-Palestinian agreements signed in September 1993 and September 1995. Those agreements declare that the final settlement must be reached by May 1999. **********In their opening speeches, the leaders of each delegation combined ringing phrases about the historic significance of the moment with distinct outlines of  the main battle lines. **********Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian team who is better known as Abu Mazen, said it was \"high time for Israel to remove any obstacle to the establishment of a Palestinian state next to Israel,\" with East Jerusalem as its capital. **********Uri Savir, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and Prime Minister Shimon Peres's senior negotiator with the Arabs, described Israel's goal as the separation of the two peoples while seeking \"cooperation in an atmosphere of mutual respect and dignity.\" At the same time, Mr. Savir said Israel's priority was its security, and that it intended to retain Jerusalem as  the undivided capital of Israel. **********One unspoken understanding was that real negotiations would not start until after the Israeli elections on May 29, and it was clear to both sides that their subsequent shape would depend on whether Mr. Peres, the Israeli architect of the process, was re-elected or not. **********Mr. Peres's opponent, Benjamin Netanyahu of the conservative Likud party, has expressed general support for the agreements reached so far, but few Israelis believe that he would stay with the blueprint mapped out by Mr. Peres and his late predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, with Yasir Arafat and his Palestine Liberation  Organization. **********The three-stage process they started at the White House in September 1993 called first for the Palestinians to take control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and second to expand self-rule to other cities and towns of the West Bank. That  has now been largely achieved. **********The most intractable and the most important issues have been saved for last:  the status of Jerusalem, the fate of some three million Palestinian refugees, the fate of Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas, the final borders between the Israelis and Palestinians, security arrangements, and vital economic questions like the sharing of water and trade. **********Members of both teams, all veterans of previous negotiations, were clearly aware of the enormous obstacles ahead. The choice of Taba, an Egyptian resort on the Red Sea adjoining Israel, was already a compromise, and the format of the talks reportedly remained unsettled. **********The Palestinians were described as wanting to break immediately into committees on each issue, which they thought would lend authority to their claims on statehood and Jerusalem. Mr. Savir reportedly preferred to start with  small and private sessions of \"conceptual brainstorming\" to devise a strategy for approaching the main issues. **********Mr. Abu Mazen voiced some of the frustrations that have accumulated among the Palestinians over Israel's failure to carry out some parts of the agreement. He  said there was still no safe-passage route between Gaza and the West Bank, prisoners and detainees had not been released on schedule, and Israeli troops had not yet withdrawn from Hebron. **********Despite some mutual sniping, both Mr. Savir and Mr. Abu Mazen spoke of a determination to bring the process to its end, and both denounced opponents who  sought to undermine it through terror. **********\"To terrorists on both sides, we say: Stop, stop, for you stand no chance to  gain your ends,\" Mr. Abu Mazen said. \"You belong to the past.\" **********Mr. Savir said, \"Conciliation and accommodation shall prevail as terrorists take their last breath.\" **********Much of the negotiation will be about an issue that is not formally on the agenda -- Palestinian statehood. Though a Palestinian state is not mentioned in  the Declaration of Principles signed in 1993, Mr. Arafat has repeatedly declared statehood to be his goal. **********That question is linked to several other key issues, including Jerusalem, borders and security. **********Jerusalem is the most emotive of the issues. Mr. Peres has declared that Jerusalem will not be divided again, and Mr. Savir has described retaining Israeli sovereignty over the city as one of his \"red lines.\" The Palestinians have been equally adamant in claiming East Jerusalem as their capital. **********On borders, the Palestinians have asked for a return to the 1967 borders, which would give them the entire West Bank, a demand that immediately leads to the issue of the Jewish settlements that have been established there and throughout the Gaza Strip. The opening Palestinian position is that those settlements should be vacated or placed under Palestinian authority; the Israelis have indicated that they want to consolidate a majority of the settlements into blocs that would be annexed to Israel. **********More difficult perhaps will be the issue of Palestinian refugees living abroad. According to Palestinian figures, they now number about three million. The Palestinians maintain that United Nations resolutions give the refugees the  right to return and claim either their former properties in Israel or compensation. **********Israel refuses to recognize the right of return and has conditioned compensation on reciprocal compensation for the property of Jews in Arab countries. In any case, it is doubtful that Israel would allow the influx of so  many Palestinians. **********If the fundamental goal of the Palestinians is statehood, the central quest of the Israelis is security. \"We shall not compromise our security,\" Mr. Savir said today. \"In this process, and in the agreements it will generate, we will insure that a peaceful solution means that not a single Israeli will live under the threat of terror or war. Life and freedom go hand in hand.\" **********The emphasis on security will guide Israel in demanding control over borders  with neighboring Arab countries, and in resisting the formation of a Palestinian army. Israel is also likely to seek some form of confederation between the West  Bank and Jordan as an alternative to full Palestinian statehood."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/26/world/zaire-war-breeds-a-human-catastrophe.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1996-10-26", "snippet": "Fighting continues between Zaire army and Tutsi rebels, crippling efforts by relief agencies to reach tens of thousands of refugees and threatening to touch off regional war; photo; map; at least 120,000 Hutu refugees who fled camps are hiding in ...", "word_count": 994, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zaire War Breeds a Human Catastrophe", "print_headline": "Zaire War Breeds a Human Catastrophe", "body_text": " **********A human disaster looms in eastern Zaire. **********Fighting between the Zairian Army and Tutsi rebels today entered a seventh day, crippling efforts by relief agencies to reach tens of thousands of refugees and threatening to touch off a regional war, diplomats and officials said. **********At least 120,000 Hutu refugees who fled 12 camps in Uvira, Zaire, are hiding in the hills and banana plantations between Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika, foraging for food and relying on unclean water, United Nations officials said. **********At least 80,000 more have reached camps near the Zairian regional capital, Bukavu, about 60 miles to the north, but the fighting has cut off food supply routes and there is only enough food for about three days, officials said. **********''That's just a pure breeding ground for epidemics and malnutrition,'' said Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Nairobi. ''We have got to be moving supplies.'' **********At the same time, Zairian Tutsi have crossed into Rwanda, telling stories of being harassed, beaten or jailed by Government soldiers. They accuse the Zairian military of a pogrom against Tutsi that reminds them of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. **********The conflict appeared to be on the brink of bubbling over into a border war as United States and European diplomats struggled today to arrange peace talks between the Zairian and Rwandan leaders. **********In Brussels the Zairian Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo, accused Rwandan troops, who are predominately Tutsi, of invading eastern Zaire and fighting alongside Tutsi kinsmen in Zaire. Rwanda has denied aiding the Zairian Tutsi but has supported their cause and has accused Zaire of persecuting Tutsi. **********''This could draw these two countries into war,'' said a diplomat in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. **********Heavy artillery fire was reported this afternoon around Uvira, where clashes on Sunday prompted the Hutu refugees from Rwanda and Burundi to flee their camps and head toward Bukavu. But details about the fighting remained hazy, with the Zairian Government barring most journalists from the country. **********The fighting is the latest among increasingly violent conflicts that began two years ago, when more than a million Hutu flooded across the border from Rwanda just ahead of advancing Tutsi-led fighters. **********Many Hutu refugees were former militiamen and soldiers who took part in the massacres of at least 500,000 Tutsi in 1994, and they brought with them a virulent hatred for Tutsi. **********Since then, hundreds have been killed in Rwanda in cross-border attacks that are thought to have originated in Hutu camps in Zaire, which also house rebels fighting the military Government in Burundi. **********Last spring the Hutu militias in Zairian camps near Goma, at the north end of Lake Kivu, began stirring up anti-Tutsi sentiment in Masisi and Rutshiro, about 40 miles to the north. Hundreds of Tutsi were killed, and the violence forced about 65,000 people to flee to Rwanda. **********In September, several politicians in South Kivu province in Zaire, including the Governor, Kimba wa Lumona, and his deputy, Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji, began a similar campaign against the Banyamulenge, ethnic Tutsi who have lived in the highlands above Lake Tanganyika since the 17th century, Tutsi refugees said. **********The army stepped up its harassment of Tutsi landowners. Finally, on Oct. 8, Mr. Lwabanji ordered the Tutsi residents to leave the country within a week or be treated as rebels. **********Around the same time, programs on Zairian state radio and television accused United Nations workers and aid agencies of arming the Tutsi. **********But the Tutsi in South Kivu were already armed and prepared last week when the Zairian Army began trying to push them out of their villages, refugees said. Interviewed in camps in Rwanda, some Zairian Tutsi leaders said they had bought arms from impoverished Zairian soldiers and smugglers. **********''After Masisi, we began to prepare ourselves for the consequences,'' said Eliasar Mudakikwa, 40, a clergyman who was arrested and deported from Uvira last month. **********''We decided to defend ourselves, to arm ourselves. There is a genocide going on. They will exterminate us.  We have been crying out there is a genocide, and no one listens to us.'' **********Several Tutsi who have crossed into Rwanda in the last two days said they had been arrested by soldiers, beaten and deported. Some said they saw Tutsi men executed by soldiers. Others said army troops had forced 37 Tutsi men and women to jump in the Ruzizi River with their hands tied behind their backs. **********One Tutsi businessman who escaped Zaire on Thursday said, ''If the international community doesn't get involved and stop this now, it will be worse, worse than in Rwanda.'' He fled with his family after he received a tip that he was about to be executed. He had spent a month confined to his house, afraid to walk the streets because of threats against Tutsi. **********So far it appears the armed Tutsi have the upper hand. They have attacked several Hutu refugee camps, seizing the villages of Kamaniola, Nyangezi and Bwegera and sending thousands of Hutu fleeing. **********Along with the 220,000 refugees who fled Uvira toward Bukavu, Peter Kessler, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said, there were 10,000 Zairian villagers from various tribes. Another 46,000 Hutu refugees have fled from three camps near Bukavu and appear to be headed west toward a camp in Chimenga. United Nations officials have been trying to persuade the refugees from Uvira to head toward Chimenga as well, Mr. Kessler said. **********Diplomats said the Zairian Tutsi seemed to be trying to empty Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire in an effort to force the Zairian Government to negotiate their claim to Zairian citizenship. **********While there is no hard evidence the Tutsi rebels are receiving support from Rwanda, diplomats said, the attacks serve Rwandan interests as well, forcing the Hutu refugees and many Hutu guerrilla groups to move away from the border and giving Rwanda a buffer zone held by Tutsi. **********''There is no smoking-gun evidence that would convince us the Rwandan Army is in Zaire,'' said one diplomat. ''But certainly there is a bond of moral support there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/22/business/olympics-stung-by-technology-s-false-starts.html": {"writer_name": "Jerry Schwartz", "pub_date": "1996-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 857, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olympics Stung By Technology's False Starts", "print_headline": "Olympics Stung By Technology's False Starts", "body_text": " **********Atlanta's Olympic organizers, who had promised the most technologically sophisticated Games ever, were scrambling today to repair their most basic information systems. **********Two days into competition, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games was still unable to feed competition results to its own Internet site or to news agencies, preventing newspapers, radio and television from publishing and broadcasting up-to-date results. **********The committee's much-promoted internal information system, \"Info 96,\" was missing large blocks of data, including any warnings about the continuing troubles in the Olympic transportation systems. **********Though they did not specify the problems, officials said most of the trouble  occurred in computer networks developed by I.B.M., which had invested $80 million to be a worldwide Olympic sponsor and the lead \"technology integrator\" of this year's Games.

Customers said that phone lines promised at Olympic venues were not always installed on time. Cellular service was spotty. **********Robert R.

They've completely undone their arguments about Lotus Notes' abilities to interface with the outside world.\" **********Late today, Olympic technology officials were organizing a manual results system that the ancient Greeks could appreciate. Results are to be transmitted by facsimile machines from outlying venues to a central office and distributed by runners. **********American and international news agencies, which had been promised a sophisticated electronic results system fed directly from Olympic computers, said the system had failed.

Customers said that phone lines promised at Olympic venues were not always installed on time. Cellular service was spotty. **********The BellSouth Corporation, another Olympic sponsor, had said it would build a cellular phone system capable of handling all Olympic traffic.

Either the deadline for initiating a common currency will slip, presenting the Germans  and the whole integration process with a damaging setback. Or, some countries will be excluded from monetary union, dividing the continent into haves, like Germany and its neighbors, and have-nots, like Italy, Spain and Greece. **********A third option -- diluting the fiscal rules for a common currency -- touches  nerves here because many Germans fear that softening the criteria will encourage inflation. Many ordinary Germans are, anyhow, opposed to the idea of abandoning  their cherished marks for European money linked to more volatile, weaker currencies. **********The debate has wide implications for all Europe, east and west. And underlying the whole issue are deep historical currents that, Chancellor Helmut  Kohl maintains, challenge Europeans to submerge their sense of nation in a united continent. **********\"If there is no momentum for continued integration, this will not only lead to a standstill, but to regression,\" Mr Kohl said. \"Nationalism has brought great suffering to our continent. Just think of the first 50 years of this century.\" **********It was emblematic of the extremes of the debate that Mr. Kohl's remarks inspired a furor among British Conservatives, who saw in them a German bullying  redolent of earlier times. **********\"The message is clear: you must all do as we say or there will be war,\" Tristan Garel-Jones, a former British Minister for Europe, said in a newspaper article. Britain is Europe's chief opponent of monetary union and closer integration. **********The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, repeated today that \"there will be no softening\" on either the timetable or the terms for insuring that Europe's varied economies are brought into conformity by 1998 in order to lay the groundwork for a single European currency. The currency, to be called the euro,  is supposed to become coinage early in the next century. **********At present, only two of the European Union members -- Ireland and Denmark --  meet the organization's standards for monetary union. Even Germany was forced to acknowledge recently that its budget deficit was still too high. **********Moreover, Mr. Kinkel indicated today -- as Chancellor Kohl suggested last weekend -- that a two-track Europe, with some nations inside the currency union  and some outside, was not to be ruled out. **********\"The decision over which countries fulfill the criteria for taking part will  be made as early as possible in 1998,\" he said. But the process toward establishing a common currency, he added, would begin \"on time on Jan. 1, 1999.\" **********By contrast, Wolfgang Schauble, a confidant of Chancellor Kohl, said in a statement on Monday that if so few European Union countries met the economic criteria -- relating to debt, inflation and public deficits -- by 1998, \"then we would have to discuss a possible delay in the start date.\" **********\"We have never left any doubt that both the criteria and the timetable must be adhered to,\" he said. \"But if in 1998 there is a conflict between timetable and criteria it must not be resolved at the expense of the criteria.\" **********These uncertainties coincide with a sense among Europeans that long traditions of economic power are under threat. Additionally, important deliberations among European leaders will begin in Italy next month at a time when, as Mr. Schauble put it, there are \"too many things coming together at the  same time.\" He mentioned monetary union, the eastward expansion of the European  Union and the basic question of how Europe-wide decisions are reached. **********\"In each of these three issues there is a lot of pessimism,\" Mr. Schauble said. \"We don't have the answers.

The company, neither admitting or denying the charge,  agreed to pay a fine of $500,000 and accept an injunction against future violations of securities laws. **********Wall Street yesterday treated the suit as a nonevent, with the company's stock rising 62.5 cents, to $50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. That price is more than 10 times the 1991 low the stock reached when its outlook appeared bleakest. **********In a statement, McDonnell Douglas said it settled with the S.E.C. \"to avoid the diversion of resources involved in contesting a matter related to historical financial statements having no impact on the company's current or future financial performance.\" **********But the evidence submitted in court by the S.E.C. included a number of issues of interest to investors, even if they did not provide reasons to buy or sell McDonnell Douglas stock right now. They provide a reminder of just how much discretion managements have in deciding what profits to report. And they show how a determined management can put out the figures it wants even when its auditor doubts they are reasonable. **********McDonnell Douglas used a style of accounting called \"percentage of completion\" for big contracts like the C-17. In such accounting, estimates are crucial. To simplify things, say it had a $2 billion contract, on which it expected to make a $200 million profit. If the contract was 50 percent complete, it could report half of the eventual profit, or $100 million. If, during the next year, it completed an additional 25 percent of the contract, and its estimate of the eventual profit remained unchanged, it would report $50 million  more in profits. **********Until mid-1990, McDonnell Douglas had been reporting profits every quarter on the C-17 contract, despite the mounting costs. A series of estimates by company  officials in early 1990 concluded that the costs of finishing the contract would range from $7.13 billion to $8.64 billion, the S.E.C. said. The cost ceiling on  the contract at the time was $6.64 billion. In other words, the company faced the possibility of a loss of up to $2 billion. **********Instead of taking the loss, McDonnell Douglas ordered efforts to cut costs and increase efficiencies. Those did not work well, but the company maintained that at the end of 1990 it thought they would, and that the small overruns it then expected would be covered by claims the company would file against the Pentagon. **********During that period, the S.E.C. said, the company's outside auditors ordered studies, which concluded that the company faced substantial overruns, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The complaint did not name the auditors, which  were Ernst & Young, nor did it say why the auditors did not force the company to recognize a loss. Presumably, they accepted the company's forecasts as reasonable. **********In fact, from 1991 through 1993, McDonnell Douglas ended up taking more than  $1 billion in losses for the C-17 cost overruns. In the past it has argued that  it could not have foreseen the losses as soon as 1990. The S.E.C. clearly does not agree, which is why at this late date it has pushed the company to agree to  a settlement and a fine if it was not willing to litigate the matter. **********This case does not break new ground in accounting. It has long been settled that companies must use reasonable estimates in producing profit figures. What it does do is provide a reminder that the S.E.C. is willing to take action if it thinks the numbers are unreasonable. **********Home Link Is Back **********Home Link, one of those amazing over-the-counter stocks, resumed trading yesterday after a 10-day vacation ordered by the S.E.C., which was worried that  investors and dealers did not have enough information about the stock. **********The stock, which had climbed from under a dollar to as high as $23 within a couple of weeks, and was at $16.25 when the S.E.C. stepped in, opened at 50 cents yesterday. But it climbed to $5 by the end of the day, for a loss of $11.25. It is traded on the bulletin board, which means it is not listed on Nasdaq or any stock exchange. **********Investors who want to know just what is going on at the company, which says it has high hopes in telecommunication services, must wait, however. The company promises to have audited financial statements next month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/business/new-hint-of-german-rate-cut-leaves-dollar-largely-steady.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-08-16", "snippet": "Dollar is steady against most leading currencies, as comments from German central bank officials reinforce perceptions that bank might soon lower interest rates (M)", "word_count": 323, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Hint of German Rate Cut Leaves Dollar Largely Steady", "print_headline": "New Hint of German Rate Cut Leaves Dollar Largely Steady", "body_text": " **********The dollar was steady against most leading currencies yesterday, as comments from German central bank officials reinforced perceptions that the bank might soon lower interest rates. **********The latest remarks came from Edgar Meister, a member of the Bundesbank's policy council.

Though the broad market more than recovered, the stocks of electric utilities did not, and analysts say fears of another rate increase will probably continue  to depress the sector. **********Utility funds, which typically have a third of their assets in electric utilities, finished the quarter virtually where they started, thanks to other holdings that acted as a bit of a buffer. Still, disappointed investors continued to pull money out of the funds as they have for much of the last year. In a sign of just how out of favor the category is, the Dreyfus Corporation announced that it would liquidate its five-year-old Edison Electric Index Fund this month. **********This industry is changing rapidly, and lots of opportunities are opening up for electric utilities, but there's no question about it -- they still follow interest rates, and when rates go up, stock prices fall,\" said Jane Collin, who  follows power companies for the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Utilities are particularly sensitive to changes in rates because they borrow heavily to finance their operations, and because they compete with bonds on yield. Along with electric companies, utility funds sometimes hold positions in telephone companies, natural-gas producers and energy transmission companies. The stocks of telephone companies have risen, spurred by the announcement last week that SBC Communications Inc. would acquire the Pacific Telesis Group for $17 billion, in a merger of Baby Bells, but analysts are not expecting much from the rest of the utility sector this year. In the long term, however, many analysts still see utilities in their usual role as safe havens, holding up when the broader market weakens. **********\"At some point, corporate earnings growth is going to diminish, and we think  there will be a point of time out there when the flow of funds will become more  defensive again,\" said Nancy M. Messer, a utilities analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. **********With their dividends now averaging 6 percent and their prices historically less volatile than those of most equities, power-company stocks appeal to risk-averse, income-hungry customers, much as bonds do. But the increase in long-term interest rates of nearly three-quarters of a percentage point last quarter dealt a blow to both investments. **********Many analysts expect the upward pressure on long-term rates, as measured by the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, to continue. \"My guess is we'll hold in  this general range, of 6.5 percent to 6.75 percent,\" said David M. Jones, chief  economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, \"but I think they'll drift slightly higher by the end of the year, to the 6.75 percent to 7 percent range.\" Despite this outlook, some investors remain committed to the group. Kevin Rogers, a branch manager in Cherry Hill, N.J., for Linsco/Private Ledger, a financial planning firm, said that he had largely eliminated long-term bonds from his conservative accounts, but that he was keeping a one-third weighting in utility funds. \"A conservative account is somebody looking for income and keeping their principal in pace with inflation,\" Mr. Rogers said, \"and utilities are one of the few areas where yields are high and there are capital gains to be had as well.\" Utilities are a classic defense against market volatility, which Mr. Rogers expects will increase in 1996. He noted that stocks of power companies rallied when investors began to flee semiconductor issues last fall. \"When the hot hand  starts to go cold, that money needs to look for a safe harbor, and utilities are always the beneficiaries,\" he said. **********That helped utility funds show an average total return of 27.7 percent last year, according to Morningstar, the fund-tracking company in Chicago. But that only lifted annualized returns to a mere 8 percent for the three years that ended on Feb. 29. **********Though utility funds try to distinguish themselves from one another, their returns were largely clustered around zero in the first quarter. The Franklin Global Utilities fund gained 1.81 percent because more than half of its $180 million in assets were deployed outside the United States and only 37 percent was committed to electric companies. The Smith Barney Utilities B fund, with nearly 90 percent of its $1.8 billion in assets invested in electric utilities,  lost 3.60 percent in the quarter. An exception was the Lindner Utility fund, which advanced 10.97 percent. Lindner's broad definition of utilities includes energy and mining companies, which prospered. At the end of February, those two groups accounted for 36 percent of the fund's assets, roughly the same portion allotted to conventional  utilities, with the balance in other industries. Some utility funds are heavily weighted in telephone company stocks. Several of  these funds rose last week after SBC made its bid for Pacific Telesis. Fidelity  Select Utilities Growth and Fidelity Utilities, which have large telephone holdings, gained about 2 percent each on the day the deal was announced."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/business/buyers-are-sought-for-28-stake-in-cofir.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-11-13", "snippet": "Carlo de Benedetti has hired investment bank, J Henry Schroder & Co, to solicit buyers for 48 percent stake in Cofir SA that is held by French company of his, Cerus (S)", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buyers Are Sought For 28% Stake in Cofir", "print_headline": "Buyers Are Sought For 28% Stake in Cofir", "body_text": " **********Carlo de Benedetti has hired an investment bank to solicit buyers for the 48 percent stake in Cofir S.A. that is held by a French company of his, Cerus.

Omohundro, who follows the fast-food industry for Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. \"They're hitting the nail on the head.\" **********But as such strategic alliances proliferate -- replacing short-term, one-shot deals -- concerns are being raised that they encourage consumerism while stimulating appetites -- especially among children -- for junk film as well as junk food. **********Some critics even worry that the plots of entertainment properties will be unduly influenced by lucrative promotional contracts, tempting, say, the creators of \"Star Wars\" to change Jabba the Hutt to Pizza Hut. **********The alliance between Disney and McDonald's, which had been expected for the last month, Disneyfies the 18,700 stores under the golden arches of McDonald's,  anointing them as Disney's primary promotional restaurant partners and transforming them into auxiliary outposts for the peddling of Disney's films, home videos, theme parks and other attractions. **********For instance, McDonald's will become the so-called presenting sponsor of a new Dinoland attraction at Disney's Animal Kingdom, which is to open in 1998 at  Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. **********\"When you put together these two huge brands, so meaningful around the world, it is all about added value, one plus one equaling nine,\" said David Green, senior vice president for marketing at McDonald's in Oak Brook, Ill. **********\"We have common goals and values,\" he added, \"which give both sets of customers a little bit more.\" **********The agreement, with an estimated value of $1 billion for the 10 years, which  begin on Jan. 1, 1997, comes as McDonald's and Disney separately sign agreements with blue-chip advertising and marketing partners like the Coca-Cola Company, Mattel Inc., the National Basketball Association and the Olympics. It follows by eight days the announcement of an unprecedented partnership linking all the Pepsico Inc. brands of soft drinks, fast foods and snacks -- from Mountain Dew to Pizza Hut to Doritos -- with the hugely popular series of \"Star Wars\" movies  produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. **********That deal, with an estimated value of more than $2 billion, includes the rerelease of the initial three \"Star Wars\" films as well as promotions pegged to additional movies featuring younger versions of characters like Darth Vader. **********\"When you think about combining the power of a company with $30 billion in annual sales and 60 million consumer transactions daily around the world with a  property like 'Star Wars' that's so universally known and so appealing to all age groups, it's a great bet,\" said Rick Rock, vice president for media and entertainment marketing at the Pepsi-Cola Company, a unit of Pepsico in Somers,  N.Y. **********Howard Roffman, vice president for licensing at Lucasfilm in San Rafael, Calif., said of Pepsico: \"Nobody controls that kind of brand power on a worldwide basis. It's a unique vision to have all their divisions behind one property.\" **********The Burger King Corporation, which has promoted films with Disney for five years, including \"The Lion King\" and \"Pocahontas\" -- it will also promote the coming Disney release \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" -- is scrambling to replace  Disney with entertainment companies like Dreamworks SKG. **********\"We're disappointed we won't be continuing our relationship with Disney,\" said Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman for Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. in Miami. \"But we're a great partner with a wonderful track record and we're talking to many studios.\" **********Burger King, which had been Lucasfilm's original fast-food partner for \"Star  Wars,\" became Disney's principal fast-food promotional outlet after Disney and McDonald's had a falling out over problems surrounding the 1990 film \"Dick Tracy.\" **********Even so, Disney, which started promotions with McDonald's with the 1987 rerelease of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" had still affiliated itself with McDonald's for promotions like a recent trivia contest involving Disney home-video titles. And they will reunite in late fall to hawk the Disney release of a live-action version of \"101 Dalmatians.\" **********For the film studios, marketing partnerships are becoming crucial in trying to draw attention to new releases, especially when schedules are overcrowded in  summer and at Christmas. That is true despite the mishaps that can befall such cross-promotions, which range from fast-food chains alienating customers by running out of popular tie-in toys to box-office flops that discourage restaurant visits. **********\"So much is involved in opening a film and selling the videos,\" said David J.

He likened it to McDonald's relationship with the Olympics, which grew this week as the company agreed, effective with the 1998 Winter Games, to sign up for the top rung of Olympic sponsorship, which is known as the Olympic Program. **********\"Entertainment and sports seem to be key factors in motivating people,\" he added, \"and McDonald's will be right there because our customers want us to be there.

June Sales Fell 1.2% As Strike Reduced Inventory", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation said today that its sales slipped 1.2 percent  in June from their levels a year earlier as consumer confidence weakened and auto dealers ran short of some models. **********Wall Street analysts said it was unclear whether G.M.'s lackluster sales results pointed to a broad slowing of the industry, but added that the results were consistent with an economy that seems to have cooled slightly in June from  its torrid pace in April and May. A number of Japanese and European auto makers  reported mixed sales results today, while the Chrysler Corporation said on Monday that its sales rose 1 percent from a strong showing in June 1995. **********General Motors sold 270,322 cars and 171,384 pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles in June. But the strength of G.M.'s sales is particularly hard  to gauge because the company drew down its inventories during a 17-day strike in March, only to face unexpectedly brisk sales in April and May. While many G.M. factory workers have been putting in a lot of overtime to catch up, dealers remain short of popular models. **********A General Motors spokesman, Dean Rotondo, said the strike was still hurting sales, partly because the company deferred new car shipments to fleets and still had not caught up with the backlog. \"I wouldn't say we're 100 percent recovered,\" he said. **********Dealers that had plenty of cars and trucks on their lots when the strike hit  said they found themselves with too few starting in late May. Michael R. Cook, a Buick and Mazda dealer in Arlington Heights, Ill., said, \"The strike didn't hurt us during the strike, and now it is starting to catch up.\" **********He has run short of his best seller, the Buick Le Sabre. \"What the people want, we don't have,\" he said. **********Sales should return to normal by mid-July when the factories are expected to  have caught up with demand, he added. G.M. needs to catch up quickly before it begins shutting factories to retool for 1997 models. **********Other auto makers reporting sales today posted mixed results. Nissan sales slipped 10.5 percent, Mazda sales slumped 27.1 percent and Mitsubishi sales fell 12.6 percent. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because  there were 25 selling days last month but 26 days in June 1995. **********But Honda said its sales rose 7 percent in June as its Passport sport utility vehicle sales rose 64.4 percent. Sales of the Civic rose 39.7 percent, while Accord sales rose 6.2 percent. And BMW, which has waiting lists for its Z3 roadster and its 5-series cars, saw sales jump 28.4 percent in June. Volkswagen  sales rose 7.3 percent. **********The Ford Motor Company and Toyota are expected to report June sales levels on Wednesday. Ford sales are expected to be flat or slightly down and today Ford announced a round of rebates intended to increase sales for a number of its 1996-model cars, trucks and mini-vans. **********Starting Wednesday, Ford will raise to $1,500 from $1,000 the rebates on the  Ford Aerostar and Windstar mini-vans and the Mercury Villager mini-van. In lieu  of a rebate, customers who finance with Ford may choose cut-rate financing of 6.9 percent on the mini-vans. Rebates will also rise to $1,000 on the Ford Taurus and Crown Victoria as well as the Mercury Sable and Mercury Grand Marquis. Ford will offer a $2,000 discount on the Bronco and a $600 discount on  the Ford Escort, Probe, Ranger and Thunderbird as well as on the Mercury Tracer  and Cougar. **********Wall Street analysts said that auto sales should finish the year relatively strong, as expected. They gave various reasons for the slowdown at G.M. **********\"The products that have been hot have stayed hot and the products that have been weak have continued to be weak, other than a few products where there has been a hangover from the strike,\" said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto industry analyst for Lehman Brothers. The Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Yukon sold especially briskly, for instance, but many large cars made by Buick and Oldsmobile sold slowly, he said. **********Ronald A. Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter, said he was not troubled by G.M.'s results. \"We were due for a slowdown anyway,\" he said, predicting that sales will generally level off in the second half of the year from their quick pace this spring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/09/business/good-publicity-as-it-turns-out-can-hurt.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1996-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 494, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Good Publicity, as It Turns Out, Can Hurt", "print_headline": "Good Publicity, as It Turns Out, Can Hurt", "body_text": " **********Good publicity can infuriate your colleagues, as Stephen M. Waters, a Morgan  Stanley managing director who resigned this week, found out. **********A fast-rising star, Mr. Waters had assembled a glittering list of titles in his eight years at the investment bank. A member of the firm's operating committee since 1992, Mr. Waters had until last month headed Morgan Stanley & Company's investment banking business in Europe, and shared responsibilities for all its activities there. **********When Mr. Waters, 49, returned to Morgan Stanley's head office in New York last month, Investment Dealers' Digest led its Jan. 22 issue with a glowing article: \"Top Morgan banker returns to bolster key client base. Waters will handle relationships; what about Perella?\" **********The article, which quoted Mr. Waters, asserted that he would \"take responsibility for the firm's investment banking clients,\" and said that this role seemed to overlap with that of Joseph R. Perella, the head of the firm's corporate finance business. **********While Mr. Waters was expected to work as an investment banker, none of his colleagues expected him to \"take responsibility\" for that whole business. Both Mr. Perella and Robert Scott, who heads the firm's investment bank, were upset at the characterization of Mr. Waters's role, their colleagues said yesterday. **********Describing the reaction to that article within the firm, one former colleague said yesterday: \"It was absolutely the death knell for him. People went ballistic. People were out to get him.\" Another senior Morgan banker said, \"Perhaps his view of what his job should be wasn't the same as what the firm thought it should be.\" And a third colleague, commenting on Mr. Waters's style,  said, \"He was ignoring the system and acting very independently.\" **********In a curt interoffice memorandum dated Tuesday, Morgan Stanley's top officers -- Richard B.

A shadowy group calling itself the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, backed by units of the Rwandan Army, stormed Zaire's eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. In short order -- with little combat -- the rebels took over the border region's major cities. **********Despite the small number of irregular forces who seized cities like Goma and Bukavu and sent a million panicked Rwandan refugees fleeing,  few can see any way for the crippled giant that Zaire has become to regain its lost lands by force. **********In both 1977, when the rebels took  Shaba Province, and this time, when they took the area bordering Rwanda and Burundi, the spectacle of Zaire's army in rout has been much the same. Drunken soldiers, long unpaid, attacked and pillaged Zairian towns, rather than beating a tactical retreat or digging into defensive positions. **********Over the weekend, large numbers of recently defeated soldiers gathered in Kisangani, about 300 miles west of Goma, racing around in stolen United Nations vehicles as they looted the provincial capital. Two other groups of Zairian troops had hijacked river barges and made their way toward the capital, Kinshasa, terrorizing towns along the way until they were intercepted on Friday by a special presidential security force. **********In the 1977 fighting and in many of the countless other rebellions and insurrections that marked Zaire's history during the cold war, foreign troops were flown in to rescue President Mobutu Sese Seko, and to assure that his country remained intact. **********This time, however, with the cold war over and with Mr. Mobutu overseas for cancer treatment, a bankrupt and discredited Government is finding that Zaire has little remaining strategic value and is suddenly all alone in the world. **********Recent events have dramatically illustrated that despite its estimated 100,000 troops, Zaire's army is no match for that of its small neighbor, Rwanda, many of whose battle-hardened forces were rebels who helped defeat the previous Rwandan Government two years ago. And the Zairian Army is probably not up to defeating the small rebel forces operating in North and South Kivu, either. **********The Zairian Government is aware that none of the foreign friends that have intervened to help rescue Mr. Mobutu in the past are likely to assist Zaire militarily to restore control. So it is trying to pressure Rwanda to force its rebel allies to withdraw by vetoing a plan for relief operations for the more than one million Rwandans who fled Rwanda two years ago and had been in camps in the border region. **********By the same token, fearing that a French proposal for an international,  military-backed aid intervention in the region may conceal plans to aid Zaire militarily -- as Paris has often done in the past -- both Rwanda and the Zairian rebels have threatened to block relief efforts if the French Army is involved. **********Diplomatic and military analysts have long said that the weakness of this country's armed forces is a pillar upon which Mr. Mobutu has built his 36-year reign. Now these same analysts and Zairians themselves openly express concern that the corruption and disorder that plague the army may hasten the undoing of Zaire. **********''The Zairian Army was when I fought it -- and it remains today -- the army of one single ethnic group and of one man,'' said Gen. Nathaniel Mbumb, the rebel leader whose fighters routed Government troops in the Shaba invasions 20 years ago. ''It has never had a mission to defend Zaire as a whole, but rather to maintain the Government's power, and it has never been able to reply to outside threats without foreign intervention.'' **********Like most people familiar with the Zairian military, General Mbumb said that to insure their allegiance to the Government, almost all of Zaire's top commanders and most of its soldiers have been recruited from Mr. Mobutu's native Equateur region in the north. **********As further insurance for his own security, if not that of the country, Mr. Mobutu -- whose titles include Field Marshal -- has divided the armed forces into a confusing collection of rival corps with training from different foreign countries. There is no coordinated top command. **********The purpose of that, diplomats say, has been to have the groups policing one other and to insure that no single group grows powerful enough to mount a coup. Only a small number of troops, outside of a well-equipped Presidential Guard, are actually given ammunition. **********As if that were not enough, the money budgeted to pay the soldiers and provide for other military needs rarely reaches them. **********After the losses to the Rwandan-backed rebels, Zaire's top army commander, Gen. Eluki Monga Aundu, held a news conference in Kinshasa last week in which he denounced the Government for ''not giving the army the means to fight a war.'' **********Many Zairians smirked at hearing his explanation. Zaire's top generals have become wealthy by pocketing money budgeted for paying troops or buying military equipment. **********In one much-discussed episode, money recently allocated for three military aircraft is said simply to have disappeared. With few roads and no airlift capacity in Zaire, which is one-third the size of the United States, the Government must move troops by leasing commercial aircraft from private companies that are said to be owned by senior officers. **********''General Eluki himself was relieved once during the Shaba war for one of the country's most notable heists,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They just stopped a train and made off with all of the troops' money. On top of that, his men were badly beaten.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/25/world/oas-rights-panel-visiting-mexico-hears-of-widespread-abuses.html": {"writer_name": "Sam Dillon", "pub_date": "1996-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 552, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "O.A.S.

Until the 10-day trip that ended today, Mexico was the only large Latin American nation that had kept out the organization's human rights commission. **********\"Mexico has been one of the countries that has been most aggressive on the issue of not accepting any kind of outside scrutiny,\" said Jose Miguel Vivanco,  executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas. **********But since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, Mexico has had to open its society to outside scrutiny on many fronts. \"This visit marks a clear evolution, a new openness,\" Mr. Vivanco said. **********A Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that there was a  lengthy debate within the Government over whether to invite the O.A.S. delegation. **********\"Finally, we felt we didn't have anything to hide,\" the official said. \"Although there may be abuses in Mexico, our policy is to foster respect for human rights.\" **********Throughout the trip, delegation members repeatedly thanked President Ernesto  Zedillo for allowing them into Mexico, even as their mere presence focused a attention on the violence that is endemic in many parts of Mexico. **********In a news conference today, Claudio Grossman, the commission's Chilean-born president, read a statement noting that the commission had observed \"the existence of great mistrust toward the police and received complaints about their inefficiency, corruption, arbitrary arrests and torture.\" Mr. Grossman also criticized the judicial system for \"inefficiency and bias,\" and lamented that none of Mexico's most notorious political killings have been solved. **********The commission split into two groups to visit the especially-troubled states  of Chiapas and Guerrero. **********In Chiapas, they heard testimony from a man who said he watched inside a church in the hamlet of Morelia in January 1994 as soldiers bludgeoned three peasant men with the butts of their rifles, occasionally dunking their bloodied  heads in a tub of water. The victims were driven away in an army truck and were  found dead a month later.

Although the Supreme Court  earlier this year concluded that Guerrero's former governor, Ruben Figueroa, an  influential figure in Mexico's ruling party, had orchestrated the massacre, he remains free. **********Several of the widows and mothers told the commissioners that the Guerrero government had made modest reparation payments, which some had interpreted as an attempt to silence them.

On that night, a multitude of workers gathered here to demand that the military Government release Juan Domingo Peron. **********The young colonel, who was in charge of labor issues for that Government, had taken up the people's cause, and when the people's widely popular hero was imprisoned, they came out to support him. **********That night in 1945, the Government, fearing riots in the plaza, gave in and freed him. **********That was the first demonstration of the power of Peronism, which led to Peron's election as President the same year and the empowerment of Argentina's working class. The anniversary has seldom passed without great fanfare. **********But the Plaza de Mayo was silent today. Few Peronists felt like cheering in an Argentina of record unemployment and increasing poverty, where their leader, President Carlos Saul Menem, has erased decades-old labor laws that guaranteed the jobs of many voters. **********Today the Peronists are in disarray. The party's long-term strategy of extreme nationalism is being abandoned, in an effort to update the economy while seeking to establish a common ideology for its widely varied members. **********''There is no reason for any true Peronist to celebrate today when you look at what Menem has done to this country,'' said Celia Benavides, 50, a seamstress, who placed flowers at Peron's tomb in the Chacarita Cemetery in western Buenos Aires. ''Poor General Peron. He's probably turning over in his grave in disgust at what Menem is doing.'' **********Since his election in 1989, Mr. Menem has dismantled many state-owned enterprises and undone much of the cradle-to-grave employment protection that was Peron's legacy. Many in the party see Mr. Menem's actions as an unfortunate but necessary betrayal of Peronist-populist ideas. **********President Menem, who last year became the first incumbent since Peron to win a second term, brought stability to a country suffering from runaway inflation by restructuring the economy, selling Government-owned businesses and attracting foreign investment. **********But in the process, thousands of Argentines who worked for inefficient private and state-owned businesses lost their jobs and, without the skills to find new ones, swelled the ranks of the unemployed. Joblessness now stands at 17 percent, and the country is in a deep recession. **********Senator Eduardo Vaca, President of the Peronist Party, said: ''We believe that this 17th of October, more than a day of remembrance, should be a day of reflection, especially on the employment problem, which is a symbol of Peronism. That is why we are going to work today, and not celebrating. We need to find ways to solve unemployment.'' **********Mr. Vaca said that most Peronists saw Mr. Menem's reforms as necessary but were asking whether they had been enacted too quickly and what effect they would have on the party in congressional elections next year. **********''To enact these reforms,'' Mr. Vaca said, ''we were forced to take a strong change of direction and make alliances with groups that were not characteristic of Peronism, like the industrial and financial sectors. Often we didn't fully assess what the impact of these changes might be.'' **********Trade unions, the traditional core of Peronist support, have responded to Mr. Menem's labor law reforms with nationwide strikes that have twice brought the country to a standstill. **********Juan Manuel Palacios, leader of the Passenger Transportation Union, which represents transit workers, said that if Mr. Menem pushed ahead with the changes, organized labor would re-evaluate its long-term support. **********The party leadership, too, has been divided, as traditionalists like Eduardo Duhalde, Governor of Buenos Aires, reject the economic changes and proclaim themselves as representing the original Peronist interests. **********Mr. Duhalde, who served as Vice President during Mr. Menem's first term, has said he plans to run for the presidency in 1999. **********Although the Peronists have enjoyed a majority in the Congress for the last six years, they face a struggle retaining control, as public discontent over Mr. Menem's actions continues to grow. **********His popularity, which rarely fell below 50 percent in the past, has plummeted to the mid-teens. Still, he has reasserted his support for the reforms. ''If the unions hold a 48-hour strike, a 48-day strike, or a 48-month strike,'' he said, ''I will not change course.'' **********The party's image has also been hurt recently by two major scandals involving people close to Mr. Menem and members of his Cabinet. The former Finance Minister, Domingo Cavallo, who was the architect of Mr. Menem's economic overhaul, accused the justice and interior ministers this week of covering up corruption and manipulating judges. And Mr. Menem's close friends, the soccer star Diego Maradona and his agent, are embroiled in a drug scandal. **********Meanwhile, the Peronists' main rivals, the Radicals, appear to be making a comeback after winning the municipal elections in Buenos Aires. The Radicals are currently in discussions with the leftist Frepaso to strike an alliance in preparation for the elections next year. **********Peronism of the past raised the living standards in Argentina, helping to create the largest middle class in Latin America. But it shut the country off from the rest of the world, flirted with fascism and created the state and private monopolies that stifled the country's competitiveness. **********Peron ruled from 1946 to 1955 with the help of his second wife, Eva, until his Government fell in a coup. He returned to office in 1973 until his death less than a year later. His third wife and vice president, Maria Estela Peron, was overthrown in 1976 at a time of hyperinflation, strikes and leftist violence. **********''Peronism as we knew it is dead,'' said Mariano Plotkin, a professor of Latin American history at Colby College, who is visiting Argentina. ''But Peronism as a political movement is still alive and well. However, what we will continue to see in this party is an identification with the populist struggle of the past even though the Peronists have now moved beyond that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/17/business/wild-day-wall-street-storm-clouds-gather-over-wall-street-theinvestors-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1996-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Investors Pull Money Out of Stock Funds", "print_headline": "A WILD DAY ON WALL STREET: STORM CLOUDS GATHER OVER WALL STREET -- THEINVESTORS; Investors Pull Money Out of Stock Funds", "body_text": " **********Mutual fund investors, shocked by a turnaround in stock prices so sharp and so sudden that in some cases it erased a year's worth of gains in a few weeks, have pulled money out of stock funds at several of the country's biggest mutual  fund companies the last two days. **********For now, most of the investors appear to be headed for the safer haven of money market funds, rather than cashing out of mutual funds entirely and stashing their money back in the bank or the mattress. While that will make it easier for fund investors to move back into stock funds once a roily market calms down, some investors clearly have been spooked by the raging volatility. **********Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, the country's two biggest mutual fund companies, each reported modest net redemptions the last two days, as did several smaller sellers of mutual funds, including Janus, Montgomery Asset Management and Charles Schwab's mutual fund marketplace. **********In addition, several fund companies reported that phone calls from investors  were coming in at a higher-than-average rate. In Valley Forge, Pa., the Vanguard Group put on alert a portion of the \"Swiss Army,\" an emergency crew of Vanguard  employees trained to handle the phones in response to market emergencies. **********While two days of net redemptions represent only a small portion of the tide  of cash that has flooded into the stock market this year, the reversal in course calls into question the theory that the fund industry has promoted over and over: that fund investors do not panic but instead view market selloffs as buying opportunities. **********At Fidelity Investments' office in Rockefeller Center yesterday, Jonathan Lee, a shipping clerk in Manhattan, did not view it as such. Since making his first-ever mutual fund investment in mid-May, buying shares in the Fidelity Growth Company fund, Mr. Lee has lost about 10 percent of his money. And by early afternoon yesterday, when stock prices had fallen even more, he said, \"I still have a little bit of confidence, but I'll be very careful before I put any more money into mutual funds.\" **********Mr. Lee added: \"This was my first experience. I should get more familiar with them before I buy any more.\" **********The fact that Mr. Lee and thousands of investors like him were not rushing to sell was comforting to some mutual fund executives. **********\"Redemptions are up slightly, but nothing that would make my eyes water,\" said R. Stephen Doyle, chairman and chief executive of Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco. \"We're getting many more calls from people simply inquiring what to do now.\" **********Mr. Doyle added that the redemptions should not be a surprise. Just as many innovations in the industry have made it easier for investors to get into funds, he said, they have also lowered the barriers to exiting. **********\"Investment advisers in particular may be more quick to do something immediately,\" Mr. Doyle said. \"They are getting paid a fee to tell you what to do with your money. If they had you invest money in a growth fund and you were up 15 percent a few weeks ago and now you're down 7 percent, you'd probably wonder what you're paying for.\" **********The fund companies that worry most about that possibility are those, like Montgomery, that sell a good portion of their fund shares through investment advisers who use mutual fund supermarkets, like the one operated by Schwab, to trade in and out of funds. Mr. Doyle said about 30 percent of his company's net  inflows came through those channels. **********But many of the companies that make their sales directly to investors also suffered redemptions this week. Vanguard had \"a modest level of outflows from stock funds,\" with most of the money being exchanged into money market funds, said John S. Woerth, a spokesman. **********At Fidelity, \"we did see a pickup today\" in equity fund redemptions, Robyn S. Tice, a spokeswoman, said. For investors switching out of stocks, \"money markets were the fund choice,\" she said, and calls came into the company's telephone banks at about 30 percent above normal rates. **********And in Denver, Janus Funds had net redemptions in all its equity funds the last two days, with most investors moving stock investments into money market or bond funds, Lorrie Weiser, a spokeswoman, said. **********So far, the net outflows have not reached levels that would force managers to liquidate holdings to cash out fleeing investors. And at least the selling by fund shareholders has been balanced by net inflows into the stock market elsewhere, including at Charles Schwab & Company's giant discount stock brokerage. **********At Schwab, investors withdrew a net $198 million from mutual funds in the first half of July, through Monday, while making $550 million in net purchases of equities in the same period, according to Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman. **********But many fund investors appear sanguine so far, in part because they have not yet lost substantial amounts. Mr. Lee, the Fidelity investor, for example, even  though he was unhappy with the performance of his venture into mutual fund investing, left Fidelity's midtown office yesterday with an armful of sales brochures for asset allocation and retirement planning. **********In the last 12 months, the amount of money invested in domestic equity funds, which primarily buy stocks of American companies, has grown by nearly 30 percent, to $1.3 trillion. On a weighted average basis, that money was invested  at about 618-level on the Standard & Poor's 500 index. **********That would mean that on average investors who bought stock mutual funds the last year are about even. **********The average masks some harsh realities, however. **********Take the Oberweis Emerging Growth fund, which in the year ended June 30 posted a gain of 37.7 percent. But after the reversal in small-cap stocks, the gain for the 12 months ended yesterday fell to 4.8 percent. **********That type of reversal could easily cause some investors to question how long  they want to stick around. **********Other funds experienced even harsher reversals. The Twentieth Century Giftrust fund, which in the year ended June 30 was up 23 percent, was down 10.4 percent in the 52 weeks ended yesterday. **********Some investors still see future buying opportunities. At Fidelity's midtown office yesterday, Sue Pelkofer of Manhattan left with an armful of fund prospectuses. \"I have one really small individial retirement account invested in mutual funds,\" she said. But the current market downturn \"doesn't scare me, because I don't think I'll be getting out anytime soon,\" she added. \"I won't retire for 20 or 30 years. I think it will come back by then.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/business/investing-it-some-stocks-that-waft-on-the-summer-breezes.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1996-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1010, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING IT;Some Stocks That Waft On the Summer Breezes", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT;Some Stocks That Waft On the Summer Breezes", "body_text": " **********EVERYONE knows you get a deal on Christmas cards the week after. And a heart-shaped box of chocolates bears a tempting price tag come the second half of February. **********With the stock market more dear these days than truffles and foie gras, can thrifty investors also profit from the off season -- by investing, for instance, in summer stocks during this snowy winter? **********It's not a bad idea,\" said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney. \"There are a variety of stocks that have seasonal characteristics.\" **********Here is the theory: From boating outfitters to ice cream makers, some companies' stocks are often hotter in summer than at other times of the year. That's because in the summer, these companies are reporting higher revenues, introducing new product lines and generally catching investors' eyes. **********Of course, many factors affect a stock's price, from general market trends to the company's specific fortunes. But, when this \"noise\" is muffled, the pattern  is often visible, analysts say. So buying such stocks when snow is the rule often means cheaper prices now, and greater profits when sold. **********Sunglass Hut, a company with 1,700 stores, makes the point, said Maureen M. McGrath, a senior analyst at Smith Barney. Last July 3, at the start of summer,  it traded at $17.50 a share. By Sept. 20, though, it had risen to $24.75. **********It is not enough, however, to find stocks with summer spikes, Mr. Acuff warned. \"You've got to determine first of all that the company fundamentally is  doing well,\" he said. In other words, don't buy an ugly stock hoping it will look better with a tan. **********Ms. McGrath follows that advice. She likes Sunglass Hut, which her firm recommends as a \"buy,\" albeit a high-risk one. The company's earnings are rising fast, from $17.3 million in 1994 to an estimated $28.5 million last year. And she says the company, a specialty retailer of nonprescription sunglasses, has an advantage that is critical in its style-conscious field: it responds quickly to  fashion changes. **********Another seasonal stock, a boating supply company named West Marine, has an even more pronounced price blip at the start of summer. \"There's always a sharp  trade-up at the very end of the second quarter,\" Ms. McGrath said. **********And the company, which sells everything from deck shoes to dinghies, is strong enough to rate a \"speculative buy\" from Smith Barney. A fast growth rate  is one reason. With 71 retail stores in 17 states, West Marine's earnings rose from $6 million in 1994 to nearly $9 million last year. Also, its merchandise is of good quality, analysts say, and it dominates its niche. **********Some companies do better during certain summers, and that may be the case this year with Authentic Fitness, which makes Speedo, Catalina, Oscar de la Renta and Cole swimsuits. The reason, said Todd Slater, an analyst at UBS Securities, is the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. **********\"Speedo is by far the brand of choice among competitive swimmers,\" Mr. Slater said. \"Every time you turn the TV on you're going to be seeing Speedo. The suits are going to be on pretty good-looking bodies. You can't pay for that kind of advertising.\" **********Then, of course, there is ice cream, where the plot thickens. While ice cream stocks naturally tend to rise with the temperature, some segments of the industry may be more promising than others. **********Dreyer's, which makes premium ice cream in the West, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic areas, has fallen a good way after its stock hit a high of $40 last August. Since then, the company has posted a net loss of $3.5 million for 1995, and on Friday its stock closed at $30.50. **********The stock, however, is now undervalued, said Joseph T. Arsenio, a senior analyst at Hambrecht & Quist. Last year's loss, he said, stemmed from a price war with Breyer's and from the low introductory prices that Dreyer's charged in  its efforts to expand into new areas. But the price war is expected to cool off  and Dreyer's expansion is slowing. In 1996, Mr. Arsenio predicted, Dreyer's can  turn that $3.5 million loss into an $11 million profit. **********But that's the market for premium ice cream. The superpremium market is another story. Many analysts advise against rushing out and scooping up Ben & Jerry's, which makes the superpremium variety among other products, whether there is a summer stock spike or not. **********\"Superpremium ice cream is essentially a flat segment,\" said Bret Jordan, an  analyst at Hancock Institutional Equity, referring to rich ice cream. \"People have become aware just how bad superpremium ice cream is for you.\" Competition for the dwindling market is strong, he added. **********ALSO, seasonal investors must avoid assuming that all summer stocks peak in the  summer. The stock of Toro, the company that makes lawn mowers, does best in the  spring, said Maureen Pettirossi, an analyst at Dain Bosworth. That is because Toro sells its products to retailers, who buy early so they can resell to consumers when the weather gets warm. **********\"If you were going to buy Toro based on its seasonal trading pattern, you would buy in the fall and sell in the spring,\" Ms. Pettirossi said. **********Nor is every company a candidate for the seasonal strategy, even if some of its products are summer staples. In big, diversified companies, such products may represent a small fraction of revenue and may not have a seasonal effect on  the stock price. Haagen-Dazs ice cream is just one part of Grand Metropolitan, which owns Pillsbury and Burger King. Similarly, Breyer's ice cream is owned by  Unilever. **********Like other investment tactics, the seasonal approach may have a short future  and some question whether such a tactic can survive the market's efficiencies. \"When something is pronounced it usually gets noticed and it gets acted upon and therefore it doesn't work anymore,\" said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********But for now, at least, some analysts see value in the summer strategy. As Jean-Michel Valette, a managing director at Hambrecht & Quist, said, \"It's better than the dartboard.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/01/business/stocks-lower-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Lower in Japan", "print_headline": "Stocks Lower in Japan", "body_text": " **********Stock prices were trading lower here today.

Vinik, manager of the largest mutual fund in the United States and probably in the world, parachuted out of Fidelity Investments on Thursday to run a smaller and more nimble portfolio for rich investors instead of managing money for the masses under relentless pressure to outperform the stock market. **********The value of the portfolio of stocks and bonds in Fidelity's $56 billion Magellan Fund, the company's flagship and the star of the 1980s, has badly lagged the stock market this year. It rose only 2.44 percent according to Lipper Analytical Services while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 10.27 percent. **********Struggling to make a fund the size of an elephant perform like the racehorse it once was, the 37-year-old Mr. Vinik made some widely questioned bets last year on technology stocks, which then fell. Early this year he had almost 20 per cent of his investors' money in long-term government bonds when interest rates suddenly jumped and slashed the bonds' value more sharply than at any time since 1987. **********Fidelity had to cut the fund's management fees to pacify investors. **********Mr. Vinik himself has also turned into a lightning rod in the press and come under investigation by securities regulators for publicly talking up technology stocks last fall and selling them on the stock market. **********The Washington Post reported the Securities and Exchange Commission was also investigating trading by him and other Fidelity managers for their own accounts, a story that was denied both by Fidelity and by the commission although The Post stood by it. **********Fidelity has also begun to lose customers to better-performing funds and in March reshuffled 26 managers but remained a punching bag in the media. For an article on Putnam Funds, the cover of a recent Fortune magazine says, \"Look Who's Beating Fidelity.\" **********The brief announcement issued Thursday by Fidelity did not allude to any of this. It announced that Mr. Vinik, who has run the Magellan Fund since July 1, 1992, would be leaving to manage money for wealthy investors and would be succeeded by Robert E. Stansky. Mr. Stansky has worked at Fidelity for 13 years and manages the Fidelity Growth Fund, which also favors technology stocks. **********Aside from a hiccup in bond prices, the only major market reaction was a rise in the stock of Intel Corp. on the bet that Mr. Stansky would sell bonds and increase his holdings of the semiconductor manufacturer. **********But among fund managers themselves, there was sympathy for the task of any Magellan manager, who can hardly shift his huge holdings in the market without affecting it. **********The consensus on Wall Street was that Mr. Vinik jumped before he was pushed and preferred the anonymous freedom of a smaller, high-risk hedge fund. **********John Reckenthaler of Morningstar Inc., which ranks mutual funds, said of Mr. Vinik's resignation, \"You have to have a peculiar mentality to want to keep this job. Running Fidelity is like being a politician, and guys like Vinik like to make money.\" **********Any Magellan manager also lives in the shadow of Peter Lynch, who is probably the most celebrated fund manager of all time. He lifted Magellan's net asset value by a phenomenal average of 29.23 percent a year from May 1977 until he resigned in May 1990, a period in which the Standard & Poor's 500 rose an average of 15.81 percent a year. **********Mr. Lynch, managing a much smaller pool of money, invested in companies he spotted in idiosyncratic ways. He bought into Hanes Hosiery, for example, after his wife reported to him that its panty hose was selling to women in new venues such as supermarkets and pharmacies. Mr. Lynch personally visited thousands of companies to look over their books, but quit the job when that schedule became too onerous after his fund grew to $12.3 billion **********Magellan quadrupled in size as small investors socked away money for retirement during the bull market days of the 1990s. However, during Mr. Vinik's tenure the fund's average annual growth in asset value slowed to 19.84 percent, narrowing the gap with the S&P 500, which grew at 13.36 percent a year. **********Magellan turned into a fund focusing mainly on macroeconomic trends and blue-chip companies. Its five largest stock holdings in March were unadventurous: Chrysler, General Motors, Caterpillar, Digital Equipment, and John Deere. **********Mr. Stansky, Mr. Vinik's successor, joined Fidelity in 1983 as a research analyst and was a research assistant who worked with Mr. Lynch at the Magellan Fund from 1984 to 1987. **********Mr. Stansky then managed the Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace Portfolio in 1984 and 1985. He had previously worked in the fixed-income unit of Kidder Peabody & Co. **********Under Mr. Stansky's current management, the Growth Company Fund ranks No. 36 of 240 growth stock funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services over the past five years. It has risen by an average of 18.24 percent a year in the five-year period. **********Magellan's results under Mr. Vinik ranked in the top tier until this year.

Hatch of Utah, who  supports the songwriters, and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who supports the broadcasters and bar owners. **********Mr. Thurmond, along with Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, has introduced legislation sought by religious broadcasters that would reduce the royalties these broadcasters pay for playing music. Mr. Hatch, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he thought that the religious broadcasters were being entirely unreasonable. **********\"You get the impression they just don't want to pay royalties,\" Senator Hatch said in an interview. He takes the position that Congress should not be in the business of setting royalty rates, and his talk is all the more surprising in that the religious broadcasting industry is overwhelmingly Republican, while the organizations representing songwriters and composers have generally been more in tune with the Democrats' policies. **********Religious broadcasting has increased steadily in recent years, especially among commercial broadcasters. Last year, the number of stations carrying at least 15 hours of religious programming a week rose 10 percent to 1,463, roughly half of them commercial stations, according to National Religious Broadcasters,  a trade association in Manassas, Va. Of those, 500 to 700 feel unfairly treated  by the royalty system, said Russell Hauth, a lobbyist for the religious broadcasting industry and a consultant to Salem Communications of Camarillo, Calif., which owns 35 stations, including WMCA and WWDJ in the New York City area. **********For decades, religious broadcasters have been fighting with the main organizations that collect royalties on behalf of songwriters and publishers --  principally the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, known as  Ascap, and Broadcast Musicians Inc., known as BMI. Until recently, their disagreements had taken place only in a special \"rate court\" under the auspices  of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. **********Now the religious broadcasters are taking their case to Congress, seeking treatment apart from other types of radio programming and asserting that the legal system has not adequately addressed their concerns. **********Broadcasters generally buy one of two kinds of licenses from Ascap and BMI -- either a blanket license that allows unlimited use of music, the type that music stations use, or a per-program license that allows a station to play a specified song, at a specified time, at a specified price. **********Blanket licenses typically cost about 1.5 percent of a station's gross revenues; per-program licenses vary depending on the size of the station and the popularity of the individual title. On a per-minute basis, blanket licenses are  much cheaper, in part because they represent a volume discount and also because  they free Ascap and BMI from bookkeeping and monitoring requirements. **********The reason that they need special treatment, religious broadcasters say, is twofold: they play too little music to justify a blanket license, but they play  too much music to use the per-program licenses that a talk station might use. **********Persuading the songwriters' organizations to offer something in between could take years of litigation and millions of dollars, Mr. Hauth, the broadcasters' lobbyist, said. **********Some religious broadcasters also contend that the fees that they pay to Ascap and BMI in fact help to support music of types that \"openly advocate conduct inconsistent with their beliefs,\" as Senator Thurmond said recently. **********The Thurmond-Brown bill would allow all radio stations to buy per-program licenses at discounted prices, which would be based on a percentage of the blanket fee equal to the portion of their programming that comes from copyrighted music. The measure would also exempt church services that are broadcast, even if the services are produced on a for-profit basis, and absolve  stations of the responsibility of divulging what copyrighted materials they are  using. **********The societies of writers and composers say the bill would put the societies in the position of having to monitor every station in the country while offering each a discounted rate. They also take umbrage at the church service exemption,  because these services often produce significant revenues for religious songwriters. **********\"The publishers of Christian music tend to be individuals who are just barely getting by,\" said Marilyn Bergman, the president of Ascap. \"This is their livelihood. To think that an individual who is running a very large company is being advantaged by this, it's hurtful to the writer.\" **********Likewise, the bar and restaurant owners are seeking a way to reduce royalties they pay Ascap and BMI for the right to play copyrighted music in their businesses. Like the religious broadcasters, the bar and restaurant owners are seeking relief through the bill. They want an exemption from fees if the music they play comes from radio, television or some other source that has paid its own licensing fee. **********The songwriters' groups collect fees wherever a profit is being made.

Copyrights held by companies expire 75 years after they are issued, and their terms would be extended to 95 years. **********The broadcasters calculate that copyright extensions have more support on Capitol Hill and the White House. The bill has stalled in the Senate, while in the House, similar language is part of a huge bill covering copyrights in cyberspace, which is also stalled. **********President Clinton, most followers of the issue believe, would be in no hurry  to sign a bill that did a favor for religious broadcasters, particularly if it came at the expense of songwriters. But if the bill also had a section on copyright terms that all of Hollywood was pushing for, his calculation might be  different. **********Ultimately, this kind of realpolitiking is where the leverage of the religious broadcasters comes from. They know how much the music, film and television industries want the term extensions , and they are willing to use this to their advantage. **********\"I don't know what our chances are, but we're committed to opposing copyright term extension,\" Mr. Hauth said. \"If our bill doesn't go through, neither does theirs.\" **********With this kind of politics at work, the likelihood as of now is that the bills will go down together."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/04/world/hungry-and-jobless-elephants-wander-the-streets.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1996-11-04", "snippet": "Plight of Thailand's elephants and their handlers echoes that of its poor farmers, whose land and livelihood are rapidly disappearing as nation modernizes; their forest habitat has all but disappeared, along with their work for logging operations;...", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hungry and Jobless, Elephants Wander the Streets", "print_headline": "Hungry and Jobless, Elephants Wander the Streets", "body_text": " **********Jobless and hungry, 18-year-old Dao has fled the parched northeastern province of Surin to become a beggar on the crowded streets of Bangkok. Her story of economic migration is a common one in Thailand today, but Dao belongs to a special subgroup of Bangkok's homeless population -- she is an elephant. **********Like about 50 other elephants who have come to the city, she spends her nights with her team of handlers in a vacant lot near a highway overpass and her afternoons wandering the hot, congested streets in search of subsistence. **********Her daily route takes her to the city's glittering new department stores and to its garish nightclub districts, where well-to-do people pay $1.60 to walk under her belly for good luck or 80 cents to buy a handful of bananas or sugar cane, which they then feed back to her to earn Buddhist merit. **********''We can see her getting fat again from all the food,'' said Saman Sendi, one of Dao's four handlers, or mahouts. ''That is the main difference: there is nothing to eat at home.'' **********But he added: ''She does not like to come to Bangkok. In the countryside it is quiet, but here she can't sleep at night because of all the noise.'' **********The plight of Thailand's elephants echoes that of its poor farmers, whose land and livelihood are rapidly disappearing as the nation modernizes. Once at the heart of the country's traditional economy and culture, the elephants, like the farmers, are increasingly left out as the cities prosper. **********The animals' forest habitat has all but disappeared, along with their most common livelihood: as musclepower for logging operations, most of which are now illegal. **********The wandering elephants of Bangkok have become an uncomfortable symbol of the growing inequities between rich and poor. While the presence of human beggars and poor vendors from the countryside is mostly tolerated here, the sight of homeless elephants has set off protests from middle-class Thais. **********''The elephant was once the symbol of the emperor,'' said one conservation official, explaining the emotional response to their hardships. ''The emperor was judged on his character and on the number of elephants he had. But nowadays the symbol of the emperor has become the symbol of a beggar. This is very sad for Thailand.'' **********The root of the problem can be summed up simply, said Richard Lair, who is writing a report for the United Nations on the status of Asia's elephants: ''They no longer have jobs.'' **********''Elephants are becoming obsolete in Thailand,'' he said, ''along with many other things.'' **********In response to public complaints, elephants were officially banned from Bangkok two years ago, but the law has had little effect. Since the police are not equipped to incarcerate or feed an elephant, the most they can do is tell its handlers to move on. **********The animal then sets off through the choking traffic for another shopping center, stopping along the way at gas stations and construction sites to drink from buckets or hoses. **********Elephant experts say that, with the animals' habitat and livelihood disappearing, the cities offer the best available refuge in the fallow months of the summer dry season, albeit an imperfect one. **********''The heat, the pollution and, especially for the younger animals, the noise and activity are terrible,'' Mr. Lair said. ''You can see that a lot of the younger elephants are just incredibly tense. They really should not be in Bangkok. But nobody has been able to come up with an alternative for them.'' **********With their forest habitat continuing to shrink and their migratory routes severed by highways, wild elephants -- some of them formerly tame animals abandoned by their owners -- increasingly compete with villagers for food. **********Reports are growing of malnourished elephants rummaging in garbage dumps or running wild in angry rampages that can kill or injure villagers. In turn, with the elephants no longer economically useful, some hungry villagers have begun hunting them for meat. **********As a result of these pressures, the population of wild elephants in Thailand has shrunk dramatically during the past 30 years, from about 30,000 to 2,000 or fewer, according to the national Livestock Department. **********Mr. Lair estimated that another 3,500 to 4,000 elephants in Thailand are domesticated, down from around 11,000 in 1965. Many of those are used in illegal logging operations or in various forms of entertainment for tourists -- or are now unemployed. **********Similar pressures are affecting most of the 38,000 to 48,000 Asian elephants -- sometimes known as Indian elephants -- who inhabit 13 Asian nations, and they have been designated an endangered species. **********In Dao's home of Surin Province, where elephants have worked, like water buffalo, as farm animals, the burden of labor has shifted. The mahouts, who have lived for generations from the work of their elephants, now devote more and more time simply to finding food for them. **********Mr. Saman -- whose father and grandfather were mahouts -- said he spent $200 to transport Dao on the eight-hour trip to Bangkok by 10-wheel truck earlier this year. **********In the city, he said, she eats nearly a quarter of a ton of fruit a day, but manages to clear about $20 each day to support herself and her handlers. **********Soon, Mr. Saman said, he will load Dao back onto a truck to head home for the Surin elephant festival, where she will roll logs and carry tourists on her back. **********She will earn enough money at the festival to feed her for about a month, Mr. Saman said, after which the search for subsistence will begin again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/05/news/pipeline-builders-see-growing-opportunities-linking-up-southeast-asia.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1996-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pipeline Builders See Growing Opportunities : Linking Up Southeast Asia", "print_headline": "Pipeline Builders See Growing Opportunities : Linking Up Southeast Asia", "body_text": " **********SINGAPORE\u2014                     Growing demand for natural gas in Southeast Asia is creating billions of dollars of opportunities for companies involved in gas pipeline construction. **********Energy ministers of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, meeting recently in Kuala Lumpur, concluded that a long-touted plan for a regional gas-transmission system could now become a reality. **********One group of international consultants has estimated that a pipeline linking all seven ASEAN members \u2014 Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam \u2014 would cost about $15 billion to complete. It would run on the seabed as well as on land, evolving largely in response to market forces as countries make increasing use of gas to fuel heavy industrial enterprises such as cement and fertilizer plants and pipe into homes for cooking. **********Companies involved in the manufacture and laying of gas pipelines in Asia include Bechtel Corp. of the United States, Bouygues Offshore of France, PT Bakrie Pipe Industries of Indonesia, NOVA Gas International Ltd. of Canada and Nippon Steel Corp. of Japan. The ASEAN energy ministers said that they had agreed to encourage the private sector to \"participate in the linking of the proposed Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipe System, which has been found to be feasible.\" **********Opening the meeting, Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said that demand for gas in the ASEAN market was forecast to rise nearly sevenfold to 150 million tons of oil equivalent a year in 2020, from 23 million tons today. As a result, there is an increasing need for a regionwide pipeline, he added. **********The only international gas pipeline in Southeast Asia now is between Malaysia and Singapore. About 150 million cubic feet of gas from fields off the east coast of peninsular Malaysia is piped to Singapore daily under a 15-year contract that expires in 2007. The gas is used for power generation. **********But Thailand and Burma have signed an agreement to pipe gas from at least two major fields in Burmese waters in the Gulf of Martaban to the shore and then overland to Thailand, where it will also be used to generate electricity. The onshore section of the pipeline will be approximately 260 kilometers (160 miles) in length and is expected to be completed by mid-1998. **********It will be \"a critical piece of natural gas transportation infrastructure that will play an important role in increasing gas utilization in Southeast Asia,\" said Harry Van Zeist, vice president Asia Pacific of NOVA Gas. NOVA and OGP Technical Services Sdn. of Malaysia this year won the engineering procurement and construction management contract for the pipeline. **********Malaysia, which is the most advanced of the ASEAN countries in making full commercial use of gas, plans to complete a transpeninsular pipeline by the year 2000, when an existing network from the northeast coast down to Singapore is extended up the west coast to the border with Thailand. **********However, other ASEAN members are developing or expanding their onshore and offshore pipeline systems to tap newfound gas reserves, lessen dependence on oil and coal, and exploit a pollution-free fuel. **********Indonesia, for example, has said it will run gas pipelines from fields in south Sumatra to Batam Island near Singapore and to Java, the country's most densely populated island and main center for industry and commerce. **********All ASEAN countries, except Singapore, have extensive gas reserves, most of them in offshore fields that are already linked to shore-based processing facilities by seabed pipelines. **********The regionwide pipeline project \"will allow ASEAN to share resources and use them efficiently,\" said Leo Moggie, Malaysia's energy minister. \"But this project can only be implemented on a segment-by-segment basis, as and when the need arises.\" **********Analysts said that development of Indonesia's giant Natuna gas field in the South China Sea was likely to hasten completion of some of the main missing links in the regional gas grid. **********The Natuna field, being developed by Indonesia's state petroleum company, Pertamina, and Exxon Corp. of the United States at an estimated cost of $42 billion, is scheduled to begin shipments of liquefied natural gas to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan by 2005. But Indonesia wants to pipe some of the gas to a large LNG plant in Sumatra that will be running short of gas for processing by then."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/16/world/dakar-journal-children-of-islam-piously-seduced-into-begging.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1996-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dakar Journal;Children of Islam, Piously Seduced Into Begging", "print_headline": "Dakar Journal;Children of Islam, Piously Seduced Into Begging", "body_text": " **********Aboure Aboridiale's daily routines are as fixed as his beatific gaze. With his morning prayer completed, the wispy-bearded young man sets out early dressed in rags for a day of begging that will end only with the dark of night. **********Mr. Aboridiale is not poor, and suffers no infirmity. In fact, what gives this son of a middle-class family the stamina to hit the cold morning pavement in bare feet, and withstand a blistering midday sun as he works this city's crowded sidewalks, is his robust youth. **********It is a youth surrendered, along with his worldly possessions and weekly earnings, to his marabout, or religious leader. For the 25-year-old devotee, this is the work of God. **********\"If you do what your marabout tells you, you draw closer to God,\" Mr. Aboridiale said, speaking softly, a blissful smile playing on his face. \"My master has taught me that when you stop chasing after the world, heaven comes to you. At my age, I have been fortunate to learn to abandon all that is material.\" **********As in any West African capital, where men and women blinded by water parasites or disfigured by polio sit with their arms outstretched in search of alms at street corners, beggars have long been a common sight here. **********But many Senegalese have watched with growing unease as thebeggars' ranks grow to include ever more hale specimens -- as many as 90,000 boys and girls, young women and men in a city of a little more than a million people, according to official estimates. **********\"The problem of begging has its roots in two phenomena,\" said Mamadou Wane, a Senegalese who has drawn up rehabilitation projects financed by Unicef for beggars. \"First, there has been the uncontrollable growth of our cities, fed by  rural poverty and drought. **********\"Then, we have cultural traditions that encourage solidarity and a religion,  Islam, in which alms-giving is a duty. It was only a matter of time before this  combination led to the abuses we see today.\" **********For Mr. Aboridiale, working 10 days without a break in shifts that begin each day at dawn, there is the hope of collecting $200 to $300, all of which, he says, goes toward paying for the projects of the spiritual leaders of Touba, the holy capital of Senegal's biggest Muslim brotherhood, the Mourides. **********In return, for faithful servants of the Mouride sect like this, there is the  promise of a retirement home in Touba. In the case of illness, the brotherhood helps out with health care. But just as important, this kind of devotion offers  the seductive promise of everlasting life. **********If the Mourides have won the respect of many nonmembers for their accent on hard work and humility, and for providing a university education for a chosen few, experts on begging here say thousands of other Senegalese fall prey to independent Muslim clerics who offer Islamic schooling to the rural poor in exchange for years of service begging. **********\"What we see most often nowadays are 4- and 5-year-old children taken away from parents who are hard pressed to feed and clothe them,\" said Abyboulaye Sy,  a retired Government social worker who has studied the phenomenon of begging in  Senegal for years. **********\"Often they spend the next 10 years or more begging, getting little of the kind of education that prepares them to make a living in this world,\" Mr. Sy said. \"Having missed out on their childhood, many of them drift into drugs or crime. At the end of the 20th century, this kind of exploitation in the guise of getting a religious education should have no place in our society.\" **********Standing near a stoplight by Dakar's downtown market in the late afternoon, Mamadou Diani, a 16-year-old with patchy hair and sore-infested skin, breathes heavy auto fumes all day as he approaches one after another of the city's battered buses. **********To passengers climbing on or off the buses, he recites one of a dozen or so elaborate Muslim blessings, shaking his tin can all the while in hope of donated coins. Now and then, a brass coin, the equivalent of a few pennies, drops into his cup. **********The young man said his parents, peanut-growing peasants in the country's arid northeast, had \"given\" him to a local marabout who assured them he would take care of their son and provide him with an Islamic education. **********After nearly four years of working the streets, Mr. Diani can read and write  Arabic scriptures, but speaks little French, the country's official language. Although his education continues in the odd hours when he is not begging, for most of his food and clothing he goes from door to door soliciting leftovers. **********\"I was warned that I should be bringing in lots of alms from the holidays, but there are hardly any coins falling into my cup,\" Mr. Diani said, adding that beatings are common for those whose earnings are judged too sparse. **********\"I haven't eaten since the morning, and I can't go home with this small amount,\" Mr. Diani said.

And today, almost 15 years after the wedding between Lady Diana Spencer and Charles, the Prince of Wales, the consummately incompatible couple announced that they had finally reached an agreement on the terms for their divorce. **********Under the agreement, announced in a joint statement by Buckingham Palace, representing Charles, and Anthony Julius, Diana's lawyer, the Princess will receive a big lump-sum payment instead of regular alimony checks. Neither side would release details of the financial settlement, but London newspapers have reported that Diana is getting about $22.5 million in cash, as well as about $600,000 a year earmarked to maintain her private office. **********She is to give up her right to be Queen of England and to be called \"Her Royal Highness.\" Queen Elizabeth II was reported to have been ready to allow Diana to retain the honorific, but Prince Charles was said to be adamant that she give it up. **********The removal of the \"Royal Highness\" title, which separates the royal family from the rest of British nobility, officially obliges Diana to curtsey to others who have it -- her ex-husband, for instance, and even her own children. But the  palace said, rather cryptically, that Princess Diana will continue to be \"regarded as a member of the royal family\" and \"will from time to time receive invitations to state and national public occasions\" at the invitation \"of the sovereign or the Government.\" **********Diana and Charles, the heir to the British throne, have been formally separated for over three years and have been trying to reach a divorce agreement since February, but negotiations have bogged down in angry demands and counter-demands. Today's statement, though, dismissed in a paragraph all those months of antagonism, asserting that the settlement was \"amicable\" and had been  \"greatly assisted by both the fairness of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales's proposals and by Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales's ready acceptance of them.\" **********The agreement gives Diana and Charles equal access to their children, Prince  William, 14, who is set to succeed his father as King of England, and his brother, Prince Harry, 11. The children spend most of the year at boarding school, and have been alternating holidays with each parent, so there seems little likelihood that the children's lives will be greatly altered. **********Diana will also be allowed to keep her apartment at Kensington Palace \"with the Queen's agreement,\" will be given access to the jets used by the royal family, and will, Buckingham Palace said, be able \"to use the state apartments at St. James's Palace for entertaining,\" as long as she asks permission first. **********Diana will be forced to vacate her offices next to her ex-husband's at St. James's Palace, but will be allotted space at Kensington Palace for new offices. And although she gets to keep all the jewelry she has amassed during her marriage, she will relinquish -- at her own request, Buckingham Palace said -- a host of honorary military titles. **********It is not clear what would happen if Diana were to remarry, but experts on the royal family believe that she would probably have to relinquish many benefits of the divorce agreement, like her home, the financing of her office and possibly the title \"Princess of Wales.\" **********The divorce will not alter Charles's right to become King of England, but if  he remarries, Church of England officials have said he might jeopardize his position of supreme governor of the church. However, the Prince has said he has  no intention of marrying again. **********Today's announcement brings to a sorry end a saga that began with hope and romance more than 15 years ago when Charles, then a somewhat awkward 32-year-old bachelor, announced that he planned to marry the shy Diana, then only 20. But afer a lavish wedding that lifted the spirits of a down-in-the-dumps nation and  was eagerly watched by tens of millions of television viewers around the world, relations between the couple began to slide into misunderstanding and hatred. **********The couple had few common interests: Charles loved horses, his garden and discussions about philosophy, while the Princess adored fancy clothes, listening to pop music on her Walkman, and telephone gossip. Moreover, it seemed that Charles was still involved with another woman -- Camilla Parker Bowles, according to British newspaper reports -- and Diana descended into depression and bulimia, making several half-hearted suicide attempts that were widely seen  as cries for help. **********After a number of years in which the couple's private unhappiness had become  clear even in their public appearances, Andrew Morton, one of a legion of British journalists who specialize in the royal family, published \"Diana: Her True Story,\" which revealed all the sordid details of the royal marriage and managed to shatter whatever myths were left. More revelations of mad, bad and bizarre behavior on both sides followed, and in December 1992 the couple announced that they had agreed to a formal separation. **********But it wasn't until this winter, after Diana gave an extraordinary television interview in which she described her bulimia and self-mutilation, admitted to adultery and painted a chilling picture of a stiff and uncaring royal family, that Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles's mother, stepped in and demanded that his  son end his marriage. **********But even though two of the Queen's other children -- Prince Andrew and Princess Anne -- have gone through divorces of their own, the end to the Prince  of Wales's marriage had no modern precedent. Unlike other couples, the two have  hardly been fighting over things like custody of the cat, who has to pay for the childrens' college educations or who gets to keep the Bob Dylan albums. **********Instead, the negotiations to end Charles and Diana's marriage have focused on a lump-sum settlement and on what sort of public role Diana -- who is far more popular than her reserved husband -- would continue to play after the end of her marriage. Conscious that a divorce would chip away her status, Diana has fought  to maintain as many of her royal trappings as possible and has pressed for a financial settlement that would allow enable her to maintain her expensive way of living. **********In its statement, Buckingham Palace left vague the question of what sort of role Diana might play in the future, saying that would be \"essentially for her to decide.\" However, it said she would have to clear any foreign trips, except those for private vacations, with the Queen (or later, with her ex-husband), and would be allowed to represent the country and the royal family only with the permission of the sovereign and the Government. **********And while the financial package is certainly generous (albeit far less than the $75 million she reportedly asked for), Diana has lost a major battle in the  requirement that she give up her \"Royal Highness\" title. **********As mother of Prince William, the heir to the throne after his father, Diana is sure to have greater status than her sister-in-law, Sarah, the Duchess of York, who recently concluded her own divorce from the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. **********Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage and an expert on  royal behavior, said that stripping the \"H.R.H.\" from Diana's title was \"without historical precedent\" and predicted that it would spur a public-opinion backlash. **********How a nation that has lapped up every detail of Charles and Diana's courtship, marriage, estrangement and separation will respond to the final chapter in their story together remains to be seen. The palace said the couple's divorce would go to court on Monday, and would be official by the end of August."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/17/business/business-digest-022845.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Copper Inquiry Broadens With Look at U.S. Company Expanding the investigations into the $1.8 billion in copper trading losses at Sumitomo, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating ties between Sumitomo and Global Minerals and Metals, a New York company that has conducted extensive trading with the Japanese giant.

But the picture she keeps in her pocket, of the daughter who disappeared almost three years ago, is still pristine, wrapped in plastic like a personal shrine. **********Miss Gomez, 23, said she left her daughter, Cintia Carolina, then 14 months old, in the care of a cousin while she went to visit her godmother nearby on the night of Aug. 28, 1993. When Miss Gomez returned a few hours later, her only child had disappeared. Relatives later told her that the cousin, who is being detained on charges of stealing the child, had sold Cintia for international adoption. **********On the strength of a court order granting her an hour's access to court files last month, Miss Gomez found a girl she thinks is her daughter who had been adopted by an American couple in December 1994. Vowing to bring her child back through the same court system that apparently sanctioned her adoption, she  is working with a lawyer from a nonprofit organization. **********On a park bench after glimpsing the records of the girl, she gazed at Cintia's picture. \"She's going to feel bad,\" Miss Gomez said. \"She's not going to know me anymore, but I want her back.\" **********With the end of the 35-year dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner and the opening of Paraguay in 1989, the number of international adoptions here has skyrocketed. In 1986, according to figures from the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, there were no adoptions of Paraguayan children by United States couples. Last year, the United States Embassy in Asuncion counted  410, making this small nation of four million the leading South American supplier of children for adoption to the United States. **********Couples pay thousands of dollars to American adoption agencies for what they  presume will be aboveboard adoptions. But an investigation of Paraguayan adoption procedures, including interviews with prosecutors, birth mothers and outside experts as well as a review of several contested cases, suggests that many babies put up for foreign adoption are sold or stolen. In many cases, experts say, a stranger, sometimes posing as an evangelist, will offer to pay a  pregnant woman's medical expenses and then claim the infant as payment. In other cases, mothers, or women posing as mothers, may sell children, usually for up to $400, or a lesser amount accompanied by radios, shirts, sweaters and other goods, said Ruben Riquelme, director of the Judicial Center for Investigations,  which is attached to the prosecutor's office. **********Experts say they do not know what share of Paraguayan adoptions are illicit,  but the incidents are common enough that the Government has tried to suspend all foreign adoptions and has begun an investigation of a judge whose signature was  found on adoption files at a lawyer's house where a stolen baby was discovered. **********Perhaps most troubling, despite numerous legal checks to prevent children from being stolen, sold or given up under coercion, the system appears to assure none of this. **********Mr. Riquelme blamed an elaborate assembly line of corruption: lawyers, nursery operators, doctors, psychologists, notaries and fake birth mothers, all  operating under the semblance of legality, overseen by a judicial system left over from the Stroessner dictatorship. **********In September, Paraguay suspended new international adoptions for a year to revise its regulations. But adoption lawyers filed so many applications just before the suspension began that adoptions continue unabated, according to figures contained in the files of the Judicial Center for Investigations. **********On March 6, Paraguay's new Supreme Court chief, Raul Sapena Burgada, removed  the two judges who had approved the vast majority of international adoptions, Sonia Tellechea de Miller and Victor Llano. He also announced an investigation of Judge Tellechea, whose signature reportedly appeared on scores of adoption files that had illegally made their way out of the courts and were discovered in a raid on an adoption lawyer's home. In the raid, an infant whose mother had reported her stolen from the Red Cross Hospital in Asuncion was found. **********The surge in foreign adoptions and tales of stolen children have raised an outcry here, stirring a backlash against the adoptions and stimulating scare stories about children being sold for prostitution or for organ transplants. Per Engebak, chief of the Americas Section of Unicef in New York, said there was no  proof such practices were actually occurring. But he said he was troubled by the absence of safeguards. **********The Embassy One More Check In the System **********The uncertainties prompted the United States Embassy here to begin interviewing biological mothers and, in case of doubt, suggesting a DNA test for proof of parentage. The practice is common in embassies in countries where international adoptions have come under suspicion, including Guatemala, El Salvador and India, and Ukraine and Georgia of the former Soviet Union. But Mark Jacobs, a United States Embassy spokesman here, said DNA tests were rarely requested, and none had resulted in rescinding adoptions. **********Sometimes, lawyers claim that biological mothers cannot be found and the embassy has, in all cases, relented and allowed the adoptions to go through, Mr. Jacobs said.\"Basically what we're trying to do is put another check in the system,\" he said. \"The bottom line for me is that the Paraguayans have called a  suspension to put their house in order.\" **********Adoption lawyers deny there is any need to steal babies, and say rather that  they are offering a better life to children who would otherwise wither in streets or orphanages. \"I would be doing this even if I weren't paid for it, because I think it's right,\" said Andres Nissim Pessolani, an adoption lawyer. **********Mr. Nissim said he sometimes pays the medical expenses of pregnant girls brought to his office, provided that he trusts the person who accompanies them,  but he denied he does so to receive the baby for adoption. \"I also give anonymous donations to many charities,\" he said. **********Mr. Riquelme, however, doubts the altruism of those who make their livings off foreign adoptions. \"Lawyers and pro-adoption people will tell you, 'We are solving social problems, the majority are not good mothers. They're merchants, really, and we're Don Quixotes,' \" Mr. Riquelme said. \"But these Don Quixotes drive around in Mercedes Benzes and talk on cellular telephones.\" **********American couples who come here are not always eager or able to investigate the source of adopted babies. Many have sought children here after being turned down for adoptions at home because of age limits on adoptive parents. Others said they were driven abroad by stories like that of Baby Jessica, whose  American birth mother changed her mind and succeeded in reclaiming her daughter  from adoptive parents. **********\"Here, you never have to worry that the mother will come after you to claim her baby back,\" said a woman who has become a friend to many adoptive parents at the Gran Hotel del Paraguay, where many of them stay. \"Most of the mothers move  around so much, and they're so poor they could never find you, anyway.\" **********Since adoption lawyers hand over the babies as soon as the foreign parents arrive, new parents grow instantly attached to the children, and by the time the tedious legal formalities are completed they think of the child as their own. By then, it may be all but impossible to admit any doubts about the adoption. **********The Mother The New Daughter Never Came Home **********As Elena Almada neared the end of her second pregnancy in July 1994, a woman  came through her neighborhood selling jams, offering friendship and help. When labor began, Mrs. Almada said the woman whisked her to the hospital, dismissing Mrs. Almada's calls for her midwife and for her sister. **********In the hospital, Mrs. Almada said, the stranger gave her cola spiked with tranquilizers to ease the pain of delivery. Instead it clouded her mind, and she struggled to understand what she saw: the jam seller was claiming to be her sister-in-law, and a man she had met only a few days before claimed to be her new daughter's father, she said. **********Two days later, the woman sent Mrs. Almada home in a taxi, promising her daughter would arrive shortly, Mrs. Almada said. The baby, Maria Liz, never came home. **********Initially, Mrs. Almada said she was told her daughter was ill. During the next few days she was given papers that, she said, she was told to sign to get her daughter back, unaware she was surrendering her for adoption. \"My breasts were very full, they hurt,\" Mrs. Almada said. \"I said, 'I'm sure my baby is hungry.' \" **********Mrs. Almada said she only realized that her daughter was being put up for adoption when Reinaldo Canale, a lawyer whom the woman had presented as a friend, drove her to the American Embassy for an interview in January 1995. **********\"Are you going to give me my baby back?\" Mrs. Almada remembers asking the consular officer who interviewed her. He showed her the papers she had signed before, and explained she had consented to an international adoption. \"I felt like he had hit me,\" she said. **********The consulate gave her the address of the Paraguayan prosecutor, but when Mrs. Almada went there the next day Mr. Canale appeared with a court psychologist to block her way, she said. The psychologist stroked Mrs. Almada's  long dark hair, and told her she was young, and should enjoy life and forget the baby, Mrs. Almada recalled. But Mrs. Almada said she was horrified, and asked: 'Don't you have children? I'm halfway crazy now without my daughter.' \" **********She said she had begged Mr. Canale to arrange a meeting where she could see her daughter. At the appointed meeting, the lawyer showed up without the girl, but with Karl F. Zerbey, the American who had come from York, Pa., with his wife, Diana B. Whitehead, to adopt the baby. **********Mrs. Almada said she tried to persuade Mr. Zerbey to give up her daughter, at one point weeping and falling to her knees as her 5-year-old son watched. \"I said: 'Give me back my baby. Don't take her away. If you do, I'll come after her.' \" **********But the mother was not sure how much Mr. Zerbey understood of her pleas in Spanish. **********The lawyer, Mrs. Almada said, directed the interpreter not to translate everything, and threatened her with jail and with removing her older child if she pursued her claim. **********Mrs. Almada tried to block her baby from leaving the country, by going to local television stations and bringing suit against Mr. Canale and others for baby trafficking. As a result, a Paraguayan criminal court issued an order barring the American couple from leaving the country with child, who was renamed India Rose Whitehead Zerbey. **********When they tried to fly home in September 1995, they were turned back. **********Mr. Canale, in court testimony, denied that he had taken Maria Liz against her mother's will and said he had found the child in a private baby nursery. In  a telephone interview, he said Mrs. Almada had signed consent forms and the adoption had been reviewed by the Supreme Court. **********The Americans  After the Return, Criminal Charges **********Ms. Whitehead, reached at her home in York, said she, her husband and the baby had left Paraguay overland the day after they were barred from flying out. **********\"The document that they provided us with stated that we could not leave the country by air, and so the following day we left by car,\" she said, although the order, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times from Mrs. Almada's lawyer, makes no such distinction. **********There are criminal charges pending against the couple now in Paraguay for violating a judicial restraining order, and Mrs. Almada and her husband are also suing the couple and their lawyer, accusing them of kidnapping their daughter. **********Ms. Whitehead said she was unaware of the charges. The couple have filed no judicial response to the charges in Paraguayan court. Ms. Whitehead said that she trusted that Mr. Canale had done nothing illegal, because he had come highly recommended from a lawyer in the United States, and because the United States Embassy had agreed to work with him. **********\"The circumstances surrounding our child's adoption were carefully scrutinized by the American Consulate, and due process was served in Paraguay,\"  she said. **********Mr. Jacobs, the embassy spokesman, said he could not comment on Maria Liz's adoption for reasons of privacy, nor discuss her birth mother's interview. \"Obviously we make an absolutely best faith effort to ensure that everything is  aboveboard, but we can't second guess the Paraguayan judiciary,\" he said. **********Ms. Whitehead said the lawyer asserted that the baby's birth mother had been  declared unfit and that the alternative to adoption was sending the child into foster care. In fact, Mrs. Almada has not been found unfit, and continues to raise the son who accompanied her to the meeting with Mr. Zerbey. **********Though Mrs. Almada did not get to see her daughter that day, she did go home  with two small photo albums. In them, her daughter wears beautiful clothes and headbands, and laughs happily with her adoptive parents. Mrs. Almada used to keep the pictures under her pillow, though she would wake up crying through the  night. Now, she has put the pictures away, but dreams of her daughter's return. **********\"She might not get accustomed right away, but with time she will,\" Mrs. Almada said. \"And the other mother cannot give her the love that I can.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/business/general-growth-properties-acquires-3-michigan-malls.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-12-10", "snippet": "General Growth Properties Inc buys three Michigan shopping malls from Forbes/Cohen Properties for $40 million in partnership units, $4 million in cash and assumption of $90 million of debt (S)", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES ACQUIRES 3 MICHIGAN MALLS", "print_headline": "GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES ACQUIRES 3 MICHIGAN MALLS", "body_text": " **********General Growth Properties Inc. said yesterday that it had bought three Michigan shopping malls from the investment group Forbes/Cohen Properties for $40 million in partnership units, $4 million in cash and the assumption of $90 million of debt.

''A week ago anyone seen carrying a stack of our papers was beaten. Now we can't print enough of them. This is the first time we have been able to distribute our paper in public. We are even making a profit.'' **********Nis, a city of 200,000, once a stronghold of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the old Communist party, has turned violently against the Belgrade Government  since the decision last week to annul the opposition victory in local elections here and in other cities. The Supreme Court ruled today to uphold a court ruling nullifying the vote. **********Eight days ago, tens of thousands of angry blue-uniformed workers began the daily street protests that have now swept the country. Students and professors have occupied all of the city's university buildings and the local ruling Socialist Party leader, whose huge frame used to dominate the evening news, has disappeared from public view and ordered the party headquarters closed. **********''We have every ill that besets Serbia here, only compounded,'' said Zoran Ziukovic, the head of the Nis opposition coalition.

He and his followers have milked City Hall for gleaming new Mercedeses, choice apartments and glittering new office towers where tenants turn their checks over to Mr. Ilic's wife, according to local business leaders. **********Mr. Ilic, who travels with a group of armed bodyguards who are also trained kick-boxers, is a close associate of Mr. Milosevic. He led the movement to nominate Mr. Milosevic for the Nobel Prize, and in a recent public appearance said he  ''thanked God'' that the Serbian nation is blessed with a ''visionary'' like Mirjana Markovic, Mr. Milosevic's wife and partner in state and party business. **********The local elections, however, proved to be the ruling party's undoing. Party workers brazenly carried sacks of marked ballots into city polling stations and stuffed them in the boxes as outraged voters watched. **********Thugs with crew cuts entered polling stations and savagely beat opposition election monitors. **********And when 17 polling stations had the tenacity to report opposition victories, the city government annulled the vote and, without releasing figures, declared the ruling party victorious. On Wednesday a third round of elections is to be held, but opposition members have promised to boycott them. **********Opposition leaders said they hesitated to mention Mr. Ilic's name at the daily rallies, which draw about 30,000 people here, because of the violence it could unleash, something they fear will play into the Government's hands. **********Vladimir Djordevic, a 52-year-old clerk, stood in a cold drizzle in the city center today as opposition leaders addressed some 20,000 people from the concrete frame of a building that was designed to be the city's first McDonald's, but was left unfinished when economic sanctions were imposed during the war. **********He said he monitored the vote for the opposition until he was attacked and badly beaten by kick-boxers and the deputy chairman of the city assembly inside a polling station. **********''I remember lying on the floor screaming 'Thieves, thieves, thieves!' as they kicked me,'' he said, ''and every time I remember that moment I vow to stand in this square until we drive them from power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/world/serbs-said-to-ship-arms-to-libya-in-effort-to-evade-un-sanctions.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1996-11-07", "snippet": "Crash of Russian transport plane near Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in August '95 has exposed reopening of arms pipeline that extends through Serbia to Libya, in violation of UN sanctions for Libya's refusal to hand over suspects in December 1988 bombing ...", "word_count": 1097, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serbs Said to Ship Arms to Libya In Effort to Evade U.N.

Sanctions", "body_text": " **********For three hours last August a lumbering Russian transport plane, its lights and instrument panels shut down in a power failure, desperately circled low over Belgrade until it crashed as it made an emergency landing at Surcin International Airport. **********Shortly after the doomed IL-76 plowed into a nearby corn field, a series of secondary explosions illuminated the night sky, eyewitnesses said. Well-armed Serbian police officers immediately cordoned off a wide area around the crash site. And when the Russian Ambassador arrived at the airport he was denied entry, although 11 Russian crew members lay dead in the wreckage. . **********Western embassies, drawing on carefully guarded intelligence sources, recently concluded that the plane was on its way to the Mediterranean island of Malta with a clandestine military cargo bound for Libya -- a violation of United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya for its refusal to extradite suspects in the December, 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland. **********Western diplomats have determined that this cargo was only one of several that have been sent covertly in the last few months to Malta and on to Libya by Serbia's Government-run arms manufacturers. **********''Libya and Yugoslavia have a long history of arms dealing,'' said a senior European military official, ''and this continued after the breakup of Yugoslavia and even during the war directed against the Muslims by the Serbs. But we had managed to get Belgrade to shut down most of this trafficking of arms. Now the pipeline is open again.'' **********American officials said they have quietly told senior Serbian officials they are ''concerned'' about the arms dealing with Tripoli and want it stopped. But Washington has stopped short of directly blaming the Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, who is now considered a key American partner in the Balkans, for the arms trafficking. **********''Sometimes,'' said a senior Western diplomat in defense of Mr. Milosevic, ''the right hand here does not always know what the left hand is doing.'' **********Serbian officials deny that they are involved in arms shipments to Libya and dispute the report, which has circulated in the opposition press in Belgrade, that weapons were aboard the Russian aircraft. **********But other Western diplomats said they thought it unlikely that the arms trade was being carried out without the direct approval of Mr. Milosevic, whose security apparatus keeps close track of arms trade inside and outside the country. **********A major Serbian arms dealer, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that he and other senior arms industry managers had flown to Tunis in July and driven overland to Tripoli for a meeting with Libyan officials. This official, however, refused to say what was discussed at the meeting or whether any arms deals had been negotiated. **********Western officials both here and in Washington, were unable to say how extensive the trafficking is or exactly what types of weapons were involved. They said that the cargo on the Russian transport was relatively innocuous and included crates of military flares to decoy heat seeking missiles, tires for military fighter planes and other spare parts. **********''We think what is being shipped is primarily spare parts for weapons, for planes, military vehicles and some small arms,'' said a European military official, ''but our intelligence on this is not as good as it should be.'' **********Belgrade has re-opened the arms trade with Libya to bolster its sagging arms industry and, perhaps, to continue the barter arrangement Belgrade had set up before the war to receive Libyan oil. **********Yugoslavia's arms industry, once one of the largest in Europe, has been badly hurt by the imposition of economic sanctions during the war and by a lack of foreign investment. **********Ties between the Libyans and Yugoslavs date back to the mid-1970's when Belgrade became a major exporter of arms to the North African nation. The Yugoslav arms industry, which sold $2 billion worth of weaponry abroad in the 1980's, did $600 million trade each year with Libya.  The arms transactions declined with the outbreak of the war in Bosnia in 1992, according to former Yugoslav army commanders. **********''Libya was a special country for the Yugoslav arms industry,'' said Lieut. Gen. Martin Spegelj, a retired officer who now lives in Zagreb. **********''The Libyans bought planes from the Soviet Union, but Yugoslavia trained all the pilots, the maintenance teams and the ground crews,'' General Spegelj said. ''We sent many Yugoslav pilots to fly for the Libyan Air Force. The Libyans bought a wide variety of weapons from Yugoslavia, including all types of infantry weapons, heavy 122-millimeter and 152-millimeter howitzers, ammunition, multiple rocket launchers, tanks and armored personnel carriers. All these transactions were secret. We had a hard time with the accounts and often received oil in exchange for the weapons.'' **********Since war erupted in Yugoslavia, the island of Malta has long been a staging area for for Libyan efforts to evade the sanctions, Western diplomats contend. **********The United Nations sanctions against Libya forbid the export of military equipment, spare parts, weapons or ammmunition. They also call on member nations to bar all flights from their territory to Libya, unless they have been approved in advance by the United Nations sanctions committee as meeting a ''significant humanitarian need.'' In New York, a diplomat said no country has reported the possible Yugoslav violations of the sanctions to the United Nations Libya sanctions committee. **********It was in Malta that two Libyan agents planted the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, according to American investigators. The attack, and refusal by the Libyans to turn the two men over for trial, resulted in sanctions being imposed on Libya. **********The use of Russian transport planes, usually hired by Serbian companies based in Cyprus, is a common arrangement made by Yugoslav arms dealers, Western diplomats said. During the war, when sanctions were in force against Belgrade, dozens of Cypriot companies, set up by senior Serbian officials and businessmen, carried out millions of dollars in illegal trade for Belgrade, according to American officials. **********The Russian plane that crashed near the Belgrade airport belonged to Spair Airlines, a company that operates out of Ekaterinenburg, Russia, airport officials said. **********The plane was carrying cargo for a Cyprus-based company called Mensus Trade, these officials said.  The company is owned by Misko Djordjevic, a Serbian businessman, according to these officials. **********A spokesman for Spair Airlines told reporters shortly after the Aug. 19 crash that the plane had been carrying sports equipment, spare tires and spare parts for sports cars, as well as signal rockets. According to reports in the Serbian press, the spokesman asserted that the cargo did not violate the sanctions, but he said it was headed for Libya."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/28/business/la-gear-cutting-jobs-in-face-of-losses.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-11-28", "snippet": "LA Gear Inc to cut 170 jobs, 55 percent of work force, consolidate office and distribution space, restructure European operations and take fourth-quarter charge of between $28 million and $33 million; William L Benford to resign as president and c...", "word_count": 211, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "L.A.

Whatever decision is taken by the consultative committee appointed by the government,the system as it exists is doomed in any case. **********Insiders say that during the first two months this year, sales at Drouot, the Paris auction house, were down 20 per cent from the similar period in 1995. **********The basic reason is that French vendors have over the past three decades been voting with their own art against their national system.First, they consigned to the Anglo-Saxon auction houses their Impressionist and Modern Masters.Then they dispatched their top-notch 18th century furniture pieces and finally their objets d'art. **********The lure of Anglo-Saxon auction houses is one that French vendors cannot resist.Unlike Drouot, where composite sales with a bit of everything in them remaincommon, they sell exclusively by category (Impressionists, Old Masters and so on), print catalogues weeks in advance and advertise worldwide thanks to their enormous turnover. **********London and New York sales are attended by the cream of world buyers, many of whom never come to Drouot.This dingy, uncomfortable, tin box in Post-Modernist style with escalators that are large enough for just one line of visitors, may do for down-market sessions but hardly for international sales. **********The stinging irony is that opening up the French market to European Union auctioneers is almost certain to spark off a spectacular renaissance on the Paris auction scene. **********France has a fantastic potential.The nation's first asset is the French public.There are more people, ranging from connoisseurs with in-depth knowledge to amateur dabblers, who are interested in art and collecting art of every form than in any other European country.Drouot sales, modest as they may be, invariably attract hosts of private buyers in startling contrast to London, where the attendance is overwhelmingly professional.In New York, private buyers play a very important role but chiefly at auctions where prices are high. At lesser sales, the New York auction scene is often a desert with two dozen professionals or so having a field day.In Paris, the large number of private players helps to create an atmosphere of eager expectancy that can make all the difference between success and failure. **********The second asset enjoyed by France is its reservoir of connoisseurship.Two of the three single greatest artisans of Sotheby's success in Impressionist and Modern masters in the course of the past three decades are French. **********One is Marc Blondeau, who was head of Sotheby's France when he left in 1987 to turn to art brokerage.The other is Michel Strauss, who started at Sotheby's in 1961 and remains a linchpin of the Impressionist and Modern Masters department. **********Hugues Joffre, who turned Sotheby's Contemporary Art Department in London into a roaring success and left the company in 1992 for Christie's, where he is currently head of Christie's Paris, is also French.In addition to his new responsibilities, the expert took over Christie's London contemporary art department in October 1993 when the previous head, Gerard Faggionato, abruptly left to become a private dealer.Mr. Joffre managed to raise its turnover from \u00a37.77 million in 1993 to \u00a316.05 million in 1995. **********Franc\u0327ois Curiel, yet another Frenchman, is Christie's key man in jewelry.He raised the worldwide jewelry turnover in 1995 to $266 million,up 40 percent from 1994. **********Last but not least, France remains Europe's richest artistic treasure house.Time capsules keep popping open, from 19th century photographic archives to objects of the distant past collected over the centuries.Within the last two years, three porcelain vessels from the Medici workshop in Florence turned up at Drouot sales. **********Two were previously unrecorded.(The total number of porcelain pieces from the Medici workshop where the secret of Chinese porcelain, stolen by Jesuit priests, was experimented with for the first time in Europe, stands under 100.)Even splendid Impressionists surface at intervals, such as a Pissarro in March.No wonder Sotheby's and Christie's are itching to get started. **********SOTHEBY'S has already its locale ready, the fine premises of the Galerie Charpentier in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore\u0301, where top-level auctions and outstanding art shows used to be held in the 1960s. **********Christie's, for its part, has been steadily building up its team. **********William Islin, who is in charge of furniture for Christie's International, is already based in Paris. **********Philippe Se\u0301galot, who established his reputation in contemporary art as the right-hand man of Mr. Blondeau in his art brokerage and consultant venture beginning in 1992, was hired as Christie's specialist for 20th century art in New York this spring.When things get under way on the Paris scene, the young Frenchman will be ready to rush in. **********Pascal Zuber, a Paris dealer and broker in Old Masters, whose integrity and very good eye are widely acknowledged, joined Christie's Paris team on April 1. **********The first step that Christie's and Sotheby's will take will be to move up to Paris the sales of French furniture, decorative objects, Old Master paintings and Old Master drawings which they currently hold in Monte Carlo. **********Their final decision will, however, be conditioned by the extent to which the French administration complies with European Union rules.If it should, for example, decide to take back with one hand what it gives with the other by limiting commercial freedom, nothing much will happen.The Paris auction system will simply enter its terminal phase and the hemorrhage of art across the Channel will accelerate. **********This might be the case if, among other things, the auction houses are not given latitude to determine the rate of the commission they charge to buyers.In France, this is currently set by law at 10.854 percent on all lots that are not classified as the work of an identified artist, such as anonymous Renaissance bronzes, Medieval champleve\u0301 enamels or a Louis XVI royal commode not graced with its cabinet maker's stamp. **********In the Anglo-Saxon world, the auction houses may do as they please.On all lots under $50,000 in New York, or \u00a330,000 in London, the rate is currently set at 15 percent, plus value-added tax on that charge, the minimum deemed necessary to make the system commercially viable. **********If the advisory commission recommends and the administration accepts true commercial freedom, the Paris auction market will take off like a rocket. **********French auction buffs will be thrilled with the idea of attending orderly auctions, in elegant locations, with proper viewing time running to several days, instead of the ridiculously short one-day lapse allowed at Drouot. **********The international public, properly served by catalogues sent out in advance and alerted by advertising, will slowly get used to coming to Paris again.As an art city, the French capital holds attractions with which London (or New York) simply does not begin to compete. **********Ifthat commercial freedom is allowed, it is safe to bet that Paris would catch up with London in French furniture, European works of art and Old Master drawings within five to seven years, courtesy of Christie's and Sotheby's. **********And if the French or the Europeans in general are wise enough to give up any thought of keeping up the absurd droit de suite (that is, the current 3 percent charged to the vendor on all works of art created by artists whose death occurred less than 70 years ago), one may even envisage in the long term a renaissance of the market for late Impressionist and 20th century masters. **********Otherwise they will all be headed for New York. **********If all that comes to pass, much of the art that is now slipping away from French hands, particularly the more modest works of art that make up the setting of daily life and underpin the living culture, will stay in France instead of being shipped across to Britain or the United States. **********Far more is at stake here than the specialists in legal matters or the revenue-obsessed Treasury officials who will be taking the fateful decisions on behalf of France can imagine.The clock is ticking.By next fall, we should know which way the cat jumps.Hold your breath."},

Throughout the bear market, however, investors remained bullish and every rally was perceived to be a buying opportunity as the economic and profit outlook remained bright. The market was continuously sliding a slope of hope until at its late 1974 low it felt as if the world was coming to an end. **********Bear markets begin when \"everything looks bright,\" when it is \"a perfect world for equities,\" and when no one can see why stocks should go down. It is therefore common for the public to be most confident near major market tops. **********But as one noted market technician pointed out: \"Bear markets never visit by appointment, ringing front doorbell during daylight hours. They come like a thief in the night, sneaking in the back door while the public sleeps the slumber of confidence.\" **********The 1973-74 bear market was a very trying experience. We misjudged everything and were totally wrong both about the direction of the stock market and in our stock selection. Even the few bears did not perform well because recurring bear-market rallies led them to cover their shorts or go long far too early. **********Today, after the uninterrupted stock market rally we had in the United States since 1990, it is hard to imagine the dire state of the brokerage and money-management industry in late 1974. Many of today's successful strategists and money managers were practically out of business, and many institutional equity portfolios had declined by over 50 percent in value. **********But what have current financial markets to do with the 1973-74 bear market? Today there are hardly any inflationary pressures, interest rates are unlikely to double the way the U.S. prime rate did between 1972 and 1974, and a lasting oil shock is only a very remote possibility. **********There are, however, other similarities not only between 1973 but also between the 1920s and today. **********As during these previous financial bubbles, there is today almost unanimous optimism about the merits of investing in equities. Since 1982 stocks have performed better than any other asset class, equity mutual funds are as popular as in the late twenties, volume is high and new issues soar on their first trading day. **********But what could go wrong? **********In a bear market, wealth is being destroyed. But since today everybody could be fully hedged thanks to all those magnificent new derivative products, the bear market has to sneak in, so to speak, without most of us noticing it. **********Today, if I had to take a guess at what would fool everybody, it would be the unshakeable notion that interest rates would decline again while corporate profits rise. **********Investors could be wrong on both counts: Interest rates may no longer fall, **********If I had to guess what would fool everybody, it would be the notion that interest rates will decline again while profits rise. **********but could rise while corporate profits actually decline. Thus optimistic expectations could be reversed and lead to a massive sell-off in financial markets. **********In order to understand this process of liquidation brought about by a profit deflation, we have to look at some of the business cycle theories: **********\u2022The underconsumption theory holds that extreme wealth disparity leads to a paradox: Those at the low end of the income scale have the desire to consume but not the ability, while those at the high end have the ability to consume but not the desire. **********Recent \"downsizing\" has boosted productivity and corporate profitability, but it has also squeezed labor compensation.As was the case in the late 1920s, wealth and income equality have recently increased.Theoretically, once the boom ends and the contraction period begins, the downturn is accompanied by deflation \u2014 of prices and well as profits \u2014 because the markets become glutted and capital spending collapses. **********\u2022The psychological theory holds that in a period of growing prosperity and rising corporate profitability, each entrepreneur is likely to overestimate the profits likely to be obtained by himself as compared with others; for instance, today every personal-computer manufacturer expects his market share to increase.Particularly prone to errors of optimism are new concepts and ideas. **********Some of the most pronounced boom and bust periods in history were caused by excessive expansion of new industries (canals, railroads, supertankers, radios, autos) or the opening of new territories (South Sea, America's western territories, Latin America).This is something that enthusiastic Internet and emerging-market investors should consider. **********\u2022The monetary overinvestment theorystates that every credit expansion must lead first to overinvestments and then to a breakdown. **********In recent years debt growth has in most countries vastly exceeded nominal growth in gross domestic product.As was the case in the late 1920s, a shift of money flows has been taking place away from productive investments and into financial assets as well as government spending and installment credits.Therefore, the \"qualitative distribution\" of credits also has deteriorated and will add to the existing monetary instability. **********\u2022The debt deflation theory holds that the economy is subjected to a vicious spiral of expansion and contraction brought about by the accumulation and liquidation of debts.According to its proponents, the overindebtedness is brought about by new opportunities to invest at a big prospective profit, such as through new inventions, new industries, development of new resources, opening of new lands or new markets.Easy money, it is felt, is the great cause of overborrowing. **********Chief culprit of the debt growth in 1920s, according to this theory, was the financing of equitieswith borrowed money, investment abroad, and the high-pressure sales tactics of investment bankers. **********In my opinion, the next decline in financial-asset prices will be of historic proportions.Equity prices will decline by at least 50 percent across the board and shake an entire generation's confidence in equities. **********What the catalyst for the decline will be, we do not know, but once financial markets collapse the profit deflation will spread and will ensure that equities will become as ridiculously cheap as was the case at the bear-market lows in 1932 and 1974.Bargains will only then be found when the public will feel like decapitating fund managers and will vow never again to touch equities or to invest in emerging markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/business/aetna-to-buy-us-healthcare-in-big-move-to-managed-care.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Eaton", "pub_date": "1996-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aetna to Buy U.S. Healthcare In Big Move to Managed Care", "print_headline": "Aetna to Buy U.S. Healthcare In Big Move to Managed Care", "body_text": " **********The Aetna Life and Casualty Company plans to spend $8.8 billion to buy U.S. Healthcare Inc., a leader in what is known as managed health care, creating the  nation's single biggest medical benefits company. **********The combined company will cover 23 million people, or one in every 12 Americans, offering everything from health and disability protection to prescriptions, mental health, vision, dental care as well as retirement services. It will be the fourth-largest company in the country operating health  maintenance organizations, which try to keep down medical costs by negotiating with doctors and hospitals for lower charges and controlling patients' access to health care services. **********It is expected to be the second- largest H.M.O. in New York City -- trailing only the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York -- and will cover more than 650,000 people in the city. **********The deal, announced yesterday, offers the strongest evidence yet that traditional health insurance, once Aetna's bread and butter, faces inexorable decline as H.M.O.'s and other forms of managed care have proven that they can be both less costly and more profitable in providing health benefits. The combined  company will retain the Aetna name. But its strategy will more closely resemble  that followed by U.S. Healthcare, an aggressive marketer concentrated in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. U.S. Healthcare specializes in a particularly low cost but restrictive form of health care plan that relies on primary physicians as gatekeepers to limit access to specialists and other kinds of expensive treatments. **********\"Strong forms of managed care, gated managed care is really coming into its own,\" said Ronald E. Compton, the chairman of Aetna, who will be chairman and chief executive of the combined company, which will be called Aetna Inc. **********U.S. Healthcare, which consumers know through its Norman Rockwell-style advertising, is seen within the health industry as one of the strongest proponents of capitation, in which doctors are paid one low fee for each patient whether that person receives treatment or not. **********U.S. Healthcare practices tough cost controls, closely monitoring the services provided by its doctors and hospitals. It penalizes those viewed as wasteful, but also rewards doctors financially for achieving higher ratings from patients, which it surveys in what is still the unusual practice of attempting to measure the quality of health care services. **********Aetna sees all this as the wave of the future, executives said. Consumer advocates agreed, but with some regret. \"For the future for health care, this is a sign of the times,\" said Glenn von Nostitz, research director for the New York City consumer advocate, Mark Green. **********The merger continues a move toward larger health care companies that are in a better position to offer lower prices to employers because they have the size to demand lower prices from doctors and hospitals. Only last year, United Healthcare acquired Metrahealth, itself the product of the merger of the health  insurance business of Metropolitan Life Insurance and Travelers Life Insurance,  to create the previous No. 1 provider of health care plans. **********In fact, the combined company will cover a total of 23 million people, 14 million of which are for health care, ranging from strictly controlled health maintenance organizations to traditional insurance plans. **********Investors in Aetna, based in Hartford, had been expecting such a purchase since the company sold its property and liability insurance units last November  in what is a continuing trend in the insurance industry to focus on one line of  business. Aetna will spend the $4 billion it raised in that sale, plus an additional $1.4 billion of cash, on the deal. It will also issue about 34.6 million new shares of common stock and 11.5 shares of preferred stock with a 6.25 percent dividend. **********U.S. Healthcare's shareholders will receive about $56.25 a share, including $34.20 of cash and fractional shares of common and preferred stock, a 23 percent premium from what the stock closed at on Friday. U.S. Healthcare's stock jumped $6 yesterday, to $51.875, on Nasdaq. **********One shareholder in particular will reap a big reward: Leonard Abramson, the founder, chairman and controlling shareholder of U.S. Healthcare, based in Blue  Bell, Pa., stands to receive almost $500 million in cash, plus 3.2 million common shares of Aetna, which he said would make him the company's largest individual holder. **********According to U.S. Healthcare's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company had 14.4 million shares outstanding of class B stock, all of which is owned by Mr. Abramson. This class of stock has super voting power, giving Mr. Abramson control of U.S. Healthcare. **********Aetna's shares fell $3.50, to $72, on the New York Stock Exchange. Because the company is issuing new stock to pay for the acquisition, the value of its current shareholders' ownership stake will be diluted by about 20 percent, Richard L. Huber, the company's vice chairman, said. \"Our goal is to earn that back in 18 months,\" he said. The company estimates that in the fourth quarter of this year, after the deal takes effect, the acquisition of U.S. Healthcare should add about $7.50 a share to Aetna's earnings on an annualized basis. **********Analysts praised the deal as good for both companies. Though Aetna paid a premium over the stock market price, \"I wouldn't characterize it as too rich,\" said Edward Keaney, an analyst with the securities firm of Volpe, Welty & Company in San Francisco. He calculated that Aetna was paying about 14 times this year's cash flow, and less than 12 times next year's cash flow, which he said was similar to what FHP International paid for Takecare Inc. in 1994. **********And Aetna officials pointed out that as a multiple of its annual earnings, U.S. Healthcare was far less expensive than some of its rivals, like Oxford Health Plans Inc. Oxford trades at 60 times its earnings of last year, while U.S. Healthcare now trades for about 21 times. **********Though U.S. Healthcare's stock has risen slightly in the last year, it has not soared along with the overall stock market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index. It has also lagged the strong performance of many other H.M.O.'s. The company's earnings remain robust, but they were lower last year than in 1994. U.S. Healthcare's gross profit margins, though still very high, fell from 20 percent to 15 percent last year. **********The reason, said Richard Simmi, a principal of Buck Consultants, a benefits consulting firm, is that employers concerned about the high cost of their workers' health care have already squeezed about as much as they can out of both employees and health care providers like doctors and hospitals. \"Now they're hitting the H.M.O.'s,\" he said. Employers are prepared to accept 10 percent or 15 percent of the premiums they pay going to the profits of H.M.O.'s, but 20 percent, he added, \"is way too much.\" **********Nevertheless, U.S. Healthcare has continued to expand at a rapid pace, especially in New Jersey, where 662,000 people are enrolled in its health plans. That is an increase of 25 percent over the last year, according to company documents. In New York, membership jumped 19 percent, to 554,000; in Pennsylvania, the company's home base, it has 905,000 members, up about 20 percent. **********And the company has been very successful in the new and growing area of providing H.M.O.'s to people on Medicare, said Mr. Keaney, the analyst at Volpe, Welty. **********This fast growth, and the management that achieved it, are what attracted Aetna. Moreover, U.S. Healthcare has one of the most advanced computer systems in the business. **********Indeed, Mr. Compton suggested that because U.S. Healthcare had been adding about 1,000 new employees a month, layoffs resulting from the merger may be minimal, though he allowed that \"as we streamline, there are bound to be some.\"  The company refused to make a more definitive estimate about job losses. **********In the short run, neither companies that buy health-care coverage from their  employees nor the workers themselves are likely to see a big change as a result  of the merger, analysts said. But over the longer haul, the deal will allow Aetna, which has many large companies as clients, to sell them the very low-cost, restrictive plans U.S. Healthcare now sells mainly to smaller businesses and individuals. **********\"I don't think that trend's quite as rapid as some people think, but it's inevitable,\" said Robert M. Mains, an analyst at the First Albany Corporation. That's particularly true in larger and more sophisticated markets, he said, \"and the New York City market is getting very sophisticated, very fast.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/24/world/world-news-briefs-burmese-activists-plan-to-meet-despite-arrests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Burmese Activists Plan To Meet Despite Arrests", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Burmese Activists Plan To Meet Despite Arrests", "body_text": " **********The country's leading democracy advocate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, said today that she would go ahead with a planned party congress this weekend despite the arrests of nearly 200 opposition politicians by the Burmese Government. **********By today, the military had detained 191 people who planned to attend the three-day conference, which begins on Sunday, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said. **********She said she expected the army to block streets leading to her home, where the conference is to be held, in its effort to stop people from attending. **********\"They are extremely nervous,\" Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi said of the military leaders. \"They know they do not have the support of the Burmese people.\" **********The meeting this weekend marks the anniversary of parliamentary elections in  1990 in which Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's movement captured 392 of 485 contested seats. **********The Government never let the parliament convene, and many of the delegates have since been killed, jailed or driven into exile. **********The United States has condemned the arrests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/business/international-business-romania-bans-currency-deals-by-foreign-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1996-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 555, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Romania Bans Currency Deals by Foreign Banks", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Romania Bans Currency Deals by Foreign Banks", "body_text": " **********The Romanian central bank stripped two more large foreign banks of their licenses to trade currencies today, shocking foreign investors here and harming  the Government's efforts to create an image of stable economic management. **********The two banks banned today from dealing on the fledgling foreign-exchange market were the Chemical Banking Corporation of New York and ABN-Amro of the Netherlands.

Ritch 3d : UN's Nuclear Watchdog Is Sharpening Its Teeth", "body_text": " **********Ahead of talks aimed at setting new powers for the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, to detect clandestine nuclear activities, John B. Ritch 3d, U.S. ambassador to United Nations organizations in Vienna, talked with Joseph Fitchett of the International Herald Tribune about the Clinton administration's view of the controversial reform. **********- **********Q. What is the purpose of trying to beef up the UN watchdog that missed Iraq's nuclear program? **********A. Until the Iraq war the IAEA performed impeccably but with sharply limited powers. The agency focused solely on preventing illicit diversion of bomb-grade materials from what we call declared nuclear facilities, meaning those that governments had listed with the agency. Everyone assumed that any secret bomb would use plutonium or highly enriched uranium from a power plant or a research facility that was known about. **********Figuratively, people worried about a crafty heist that lifted a small but deadly quantity of fissile material from beneath the agency's seals and monitoring cameras. Saddam Hussein proved this assumption false by operating declared civilian activities under effective safeguards while pursuing a secret weapons program in parallel. Some of his clandestine facilities were within eyesight of declared sites, but IAEA inspectors had no authority even to walk over and take a look. **********It's not that they were duped; their mandate was simply too narrow. So Saddam was a lesson not just for the IAEA but for the world community. **********Q. That was five years ago. Why is change taking so long? **********A. This is an enormous step \u2014 advancing from supervision of several hundred known facilities to a system that gives a complete picture of everything a country is doing that might conceivably be related to a secret bomb project. **********It's a major challenge conceptually, technologically and politically. But it offers a commensurate payoff. Confidence that secret nuclear activity is not occurring anywhere yields greater security and is also, obviously, a precondition for further nuclear disarmament. **********Q. What guarantee is there that this system would be credible? **********A. The IAEA plan depends on the fact that nuclear activity inevitably leaves telltale traces \u2014 paper trails and minute but detectable isotopes that reveal a nuclear process. Countries will present more information about their activities that are potentially nuclear-related. **********And the IAEA will go more places. It will also use new, highly sophisticated sensing technologies that can analyze infinitesimal molecules in samples from air, in water or in a plant leaf. An example: Harmless microscopic dust on the clothing of hostages held by Saddam Hussein was our first evidence of his nuclear weapons program. **********Q. If this plan is ready, what exactly is left to negotiate? **********A. What remains is political. We must finalize the agreement \u2014 and we're already close \u2014 that commits countries to cooperate with this more intrusive regime of inspections. Once this is done, presumably by December, countries will either sign and participate, or they will refuse and thus invite intense world suspicion. **********Ironically, the most resistant governments are not states that anybody suspects of bad nuclear intentions. They're nations, including Germany and Japan, that could have nuclear weapons but don't want to \u2014 but do have large civilian nuclear businesses. **********The simple truth is that their nuclear industries fear the inconvenience. So they have revived two bogeymen we first heard about 25 years ago when safeguards were invented. One is that inspections will give away industrial secrets. The other is that some countries will be penalized with unfair costs in complying. There is not a shred of evidence for either objection. **********Q. Aren't Germany and Japan objecting to what they see as a double standard that imposes inspections on their industries but disregards the same industries in the nuclear weapons states \u2014 the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia? **********A. It is true that these five countries are treated differently precisely because they already have the bomb and can't be suspected of developing one secretly. But we recognize that these countries have special responsibilities. That's why the United States has promised to accept the IAEA's proposed new reporting requirements on all U.S. commercial activities that could contribute to another country's nuclear program. **********We will also submit to all relevant domestic inspections. President Clinton is quite clear that the minor costs and intrusions pale against the imperative of preventing another Saddam. He sees this program as a bulwark against proliferation and that is why he is committed to making it happen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/cytotherapeutics-gets-big-investment-from-genentech.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-11-27", "snippet": "Genentech Inc to invest up to $50 million in Cytotherapeutics Inc to help it develop treatments for three diseases; plans initial investment of $8.3 million (S)", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CYTOTHERAPEUTICS GETS BIG INVESTMENT FROM GENENTECH", "print_headline": "CYTOTHERAPEUTICS GETS BIG INVESTMENT FROM GENENTECH", "body_text": " **********Cytotherapeutics Inc. of Providence, R.I., will receive an investment of up to $50 million from Genentech Inc. to help it develop treatments for three diseases.

In an essay she wrote for Tikkun magazine, Ms. Weiss lamented the industry's ''staggering lack of imagination'' and ''blunt insensitivity to the demands of the human spirit.'' **********Ms. Weiss, who started a Manhattan-based company called Living Monuments, recently received a patent for a new type of tombstone that she believes will make the death of a loved one more meaningful for the bereaved and, in the process, render cemeteries more interesting for future generations. **********The tombstone features a miniature 500-word biography of the deceased in 20-point type, which is sandblasted onto a rotating element like a cylinder, integrated into the design of the tombstone. **********''The moveable element increases the surface area of the monument, so that you can fit more information on it,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''The element can be any type of shape -- an oval, sphere, rectangle, cylinder.'' **********Ms. Weiss came up with a workbook she developed with the help of grief therapists that asks the bereaved to recall the personality and accomplishments of the deceased. She then edits the information into a format that can be inscribed on the movable element with a photographic masking process. This process is more flexible and less costly than conventional sandblasting, and allows the use of photographs or genealogical trees alongside the text,  Ms. Weiss said. **********Ms. Weiss, who is 36, said she thought people of her generation would be particularly interested in her invention. ''When my grandmother passed, I found I was looking at everything esthetically -- the funeral home, the cemetery,'' she said. ''I was appalled at what a commercial process this is. I think baby boomers are going to take back control of the death-care industry the way they took back control of the childbirth experience -- they are going to demand that it be more meaningful.'' **********Cemeteries of the future, in Ms. Weiss's vision, will be libraries of past lives. ''Imagine what a visit to a Civil War cemetery would be like if, instead of just names and dates, you could read life stories of everyone buried there,'' she said. ''It would be quite a history lesson.'' **********The personalized approach to death is not inexpensive, however. Ms. Weiss said one of her tombstones costs $6,000 to $9,000, whereas the average price of a tombstone is $2,000 to $3,000. Ms. Weiss received patent 5,517,791. **********Implant to Treat Heart Arrhythmia **********Implantable heart defibrillators are tiny, surgically inserted electrical devices used to shock a racing heart into a normal rhythm. Those defibrillators were designed to avert sudden deaths that can result from arrhythmia originating in the lower chambers of the heart. **********But arrhythmia can also occur in the heart's upper chambers. ''Irregular heartbeats in the upper chambers are more subtle,'' said Dr. Stan F. Obino, president of Pharmatarget, a start-up medical company in Minneapolis. ''They are not viewed as being life threatening, yet they can cause strokes or paralysis.'' **********Dr. Obino's company is developing an implantable defibrillator to counteract this type of arrhythmia, known as atrial fibrillation, which affects five million to six million people worldwide, and results in more than 1.5 million hospitalizations each year in the United States. **********The defibrillator is based on research done by Robert Arzbaecher, a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology who recently patented the technology, which he developed with the assistance of more than $1 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. **********The device, which is about the size of a pocket watch, monitors the heart's electrical signals. But when it detects an irregularity, it delivers a special drug directly into the heart, rather than an electrical jolt, to re-establish a normal rhythm. **********''Today, the patient with an acute episode of atrial fibrillation has to be hospitalized,'' Dr. Obino said.

The move, orchestrated by Jon S. Corzine, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, is expected to occur next month and would make Goldman, Wall Street's last big partnership, look more like its rivals, which have generally turned themselves into public corporations run by managing directors over the last two decades. **********The new title also would give Mr. Corzine and Goldman's other senior partners another instrument with which to manage the firm's younger, talented, and sometimes frustrated, executives. **********Goldman, with more than 8,500 employees, now has only 173 partners, and it has a fast-growing corps of senior managers pressing for a partnership. Goldman has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly because of the huge expansion of its international businesses. Young executives toil at the firm for years for the chance to become a Goldman partner, a ticket to substantial financial wealth. **********Goldman partners generally make several millions of dollars a year, although their stake in the firm and its profits grows the longer they remain active in the partnership. Often, if a successful young executive does not make partner, he leaves the firm to work for a competitor. **********Under the new plan, Goldman would appoint all its new and existing partners as managing directors this year, but would also create some 50 to 70 managing directors who would not be partners. This, people familiar with the firm explained, would allow Goldman to promote more younger executives without having to expand the partnership very much. **********The creation of the managing director title also reflects Goldman's decision to become a limited liability partnership under New York State law. That move, which is scheduled to occur on Nov. 30, would protect the firm's partners from some potential financial liabilities. It follows a similar move by Lazard Freres & Company last year.

(Toby) Thacher 2d, the inspector general who polices the state-chartered agency's $4.3 billion construction program. To do this, Mr. Thacher's office prescreens potential bidders, makes artful use of civil law to enforce its contracts and harnesses the skills of a growing community of private watchdogs called \"independent private-sector inspectors general\" -- or Ipsigs, for short. **********By combining these steps with traditional management and investigative techniques, Mr. Thacher \"appears to have created an effective means, at relatively low cost,\" to rid his agency of the threat of corruption and racketeering, notes a recent draft study by Harvard University's Kennedy School  of Government. \"It deserves careful consideration by similar institutions, public and private, facing similar threats.\" **********For example, just last month the authority reached a settlement with an asbestos removal company after an Ipsig showed that the contractor had failed to comply with state prevailing wage laws. The settlement not only compensated the  workers for lost wages and the authority for its $240,000 in investigative costs, but also provided $200,000 for the agency to hire an Ipsig to check for other contractors' cheating on wages. **********Although he operates in the public arena, Mr. Thacher believes his approach \"is totally exportable to the private sector, because it deals with solutions, not just with exposing scandals.\" To reduce corporate corruption, he said, \"you  have to reduce both the incentives to cheat and the opportunities to cheat -- and that can never be done externally. It has got to be done from within.\" **********Indeed, a small but growing number of companies -- including the Lehrer McGovern Bovis construction concern and Resource NE Inc., a large recycler in Brooklyn -- are starting to adopt concepts similar to those advocated by Mr. Thacher with the goal of tightening their own controls or improving their image  in rough-and-tumble industries. **********What's more, the applicability of the Thacher model to a publicly traded company is about to be tested in the case of the New Jersey Steel Corporation of Sayreville, N.J., a Nasdaq-traded maker of reinforcing rods used in cement construction. **********In response to an inquiry, Mr. Thacher confirmed that on Monday he sent a letter asking company executives to meet with his staff to \"address a number of  concerns relating to whether New Jersey Steel should be permitted\" to supply reinforcing rods to authority projects. Those concerns, detailed in a statement  from Mr. Thacher, include the conviction in Switzerland of three current or former employees of the company's Swiss parent, Von Roll A.G., for failing to detect that certain machine parts were being illegally exported to Iraq in 1990  and a current background check by New Jersey casino regulators into the company's past links to a reputed organized crime figure. **********Thomas W. Jackson, corporate secretary for New Jersey Steel, said yesterday that he saw \"no reason for concern by the authority\" and that he expected to be  able to reassure Mr. Thacher's staff at a meeting now scheduled for next Tuesday. **********The Thacher model is attracting attention among scholars and corruption experts at a time when corporate response to white-collar crime is beset by change. Shareholders have grown frustrated with the failure of traditional audits to detect fraud, though that is officially beyond the scope of such audits. Whistle-blowers are growing more active, thanks to the Federal False Claims Act, which gives them a share of any money recovered from corrupt government contractors. And most important, more companies are awakening to the  significance of new Federal sentencing guidelines, which reward companies that police themselves and punish those that do not. **********\"In the past, the companies were willing to take the fall in a criminal case, in exchange for leniency toward their executives,\" said John C. Coffee Jr., professor at the Columbia University School of Law, who helped frame the sentencing rules. Since those rules went into effect in 1989, he said, \"the financial penalties for the company have become so great, that the situation is  reversed. There are real financial incentives for a company to detect its own wrongdoing and turn itself in.\" **********But until now, it has been difficult to find a self-policing approach that fit into the profit-maximizing world of business and still protected the public, said Edwin H. Stier, whose law firm in Bridgewater, N.J., was a pioneer in Ipsig techniques. **********\"Where corporations have the potential of poisoning the atmosphere, destroying the life savings of millions of people, causing nuclear contamination or building unsafe schools for our children, you cannot just say, 'If we catch you, we'll punish you,' \" Mr. Stier said. \"You must force the company to police  itself.\" **********The Thacher approach grew out of the work of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, which in 1985 began a broad study of corruption in the city school construction program. The S.C.A. was created in 1989 in response to that  study, and Mr. Thacher, who had led the project for the task force, was asked to serve as its first inspector general. Mr. Thacher, 49, has spent most of his career as a prosecutor of organized crime cases in the construction industry. **********One of the ideas Mr. Thacher brought to the new agency was that of requiring  a suspect company to hire, at its own expense, some sort of trustworthy private  watchdog who would work from within the company to build up its corruption resistance but would report both to the company and to the authority. Until then, the most common use of the Ipsig concept was by the courts or by local prosecutors, who have insisted on such private watchdogs as part of corporate criminal settlements or as the price of avoiding indictment. **********Unlike a judge or prosecutor, however, the authority does not have the power  to flatly require a company to hire a private watchdog -- the company can always drop out of authority bidding. \"So it is sort of voluntary,\" Mr. Thacher said with a grin. **********Besides broadening the use of Ipsigs, Mr. Thacher relies on thorough investigations of would-be bidders. This allows him to weed out a dubious company before it is awarded a contract, and thus before the inevitable pressures to get the project rolling can deflect serious inquiries. **********If a company's background reveals a history of serious corruption problems, it may well be barred from bidding. Where a company has tried to rehabilitate itself or where less solid evidence exists, the authority may require an Ipsig.  Or it may turn to another tool in its anticorruption kit: the certification process. **********A certification is simply a legally binding promise to the authority that its specific concerns are groundless, along with an acknowledgment that the would-be bidder is making that promise to \"induce\" the authority to give it a contract. That language gives the authority legal leverage to recover all the money paid under the contract if the \"inducement\" turns out to have been fraudulent. **********As that suggests, for all the safeguards Mr. Thacher's office has designed, bad companies have slipped through. When these lapses have occurred, however, the inspector general's staff has tried to prevent recurrences and recover as much money as possible. **********Aggressive litigation and administrative sanctions have helped the authority  recover millions of dollars in damages, Mr. Thacher said. Indeed, he claims that his staff has more than paid its own way. **********To be sure, even some of Mr. Thacher's fans are skeptical that his novel use  of Ipsigs, much less his other corruption-deterring programs, will ever reach beyond the \"carrot and stick\" world of courts and government agencies. **********\"He's set up an incredible system,\" said Joseph A. Spinelli of KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm. \"It should really be a model for the whole country. But I think it requires that there be a dual reporting function, and that means some agency outside the corporation has to be involved.\" **********As it happened, however, the first major contractor who hired a private watchdog \"voluntarily\" as the price of keeping his S.C.A. work in 1991 found the approach so beneficial that he has continued it in a truly voluntary way ever since. \"A lot of it was plain common sense and good business controls,\" said Philip Schiavone, president of the E. W. Howell Company, a subsidiary of the Tokyo construction giant, the Obayashi Corporation. \"So we've implemented it across the board, on our public and private jobs.\" He added, \"We're proud of it; it gives us a marketing advantage, and a tool that protects our private clients  as well.\" **********As for Lehrer McGovern Bovis, it had a brush with Mr. Thacher's office in late 1993 and wound up borrowing part of his program to enhance its own internal controls on other New York area projects. The company, which Mr. Thacher said has an excellent record for integrity, experienced an isolated problem on a California project. **********\"We began to look at the types of questions they were asking and we incorporated them into our own prequalifying forms for all our subcontractors,\"  said Louis J. Coletti, the company's senior vice president. **********There are other signs that at least some parts of the Thacher model are being adopted in the private sector. For example, Resource NE, the Brooklyn recycler,  recently employed Jonny J. Frank of Decision Strategies, an investigative consulting firm, as an Ipsig in its campaign to gain credibility in a troubled industry and attract new investment. Mr. Frank helped Resource NE develop anticorruption programs that allowed it to be acquired earlier this month by a subsidiary of WMX Technologies, the industry giant. **********And other Ipsig specialists say that a few bankers and an insurance company have recently insisted that companies, especially those in troubled or tainted industries like garbage collection or construction, hire an Ipsig-style watchdog as a condition of getting loans or fresh capital. **********But such voluntary applications of Thacher-style measures are still rare, and are likely to remain so until companies see anticorruption programs as a positive benefit to the bottom line, and not as a defensive burden, said Neil Getnick, another of the early Ipsig lawyers. **********\"Fraud robs the bottom line, and therefore eliminating fraud maximizes profits,\" said Mr. Getnick, a former prosecutor who now practices in New York. \"What sets the S.C.A. plan apart from others is that it is designed, first and foremost, to build better schools.\" **********Or, as Toby Thacher says with mantra-like frequency, his job is \"not to catch criminals but to see that quality schools are built, on time and in budget.\" Keeping construction honest is simply a means to that end, he said. \"If we cost  more money than we can save or recover,\" he added, \"then we have failed, even if we have arrested 400 people.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/world/defendant-in-bosnian-war-crime-case-is-sent-home-gravely-ill.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1996-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Defendant in Bosnian War-Crime Case Is Sent Home, Gravely Ill", "print_headline": "Defendant in Bosnian War-Crime Case Is Sent Home, Gravely Ill", "body_text": " **********A Bosnian Serb general charged with crimes against humanity was released today from United Nations custody in The Netherlands after doctors concluded that he is terminally ill. **********The general, Djordje Djukic, a top officer in the Bosnian Serb army, was the  highest-ranking suspect being held by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in  The Hague. **********He is in a Dutch hospital suffering from pancreatic cancer, and doctors testified at a hearing on Monday that he may have only weeks to live. **********One of the tribunal's judges, Claude Jorda, said the tribunal had rejected an appeal from General Djukic's lawyers that the case against him be dropped. **********\"The trial chamber has upheld the indictment against General Djukic, but orders provisional release solely on humanitarian grounds,\" Mr. Jorda said. **********The judges ruled that General Djukic could return to his home in Belgrade. He must leave his address with the tribunal, provide updates on his medical condition and return to The Hague if his condition improves. **********General Djukic's release means the likely cancellation of what might have been a spectacular trial. He had been charged with helping to plan and direct the 30-month bombardment of Sarajevo, in which thousands were killed. **********It is unclear how much help General Djukic has given to investigators for the tribunal. **********He served as a senior logistics officer for the Bosnian Serbs, and presumably knows a great deal about Belgrade's clandestine support for the Bosnian Serb army. Some of this information could be damaging to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who at several points during the Bosnian war asserted that he had cut off all supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. **********Interrogators at The Hague also hoped to obtain information from General Djukic that would strengthen cases against their two most prominent targets, the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadjic and his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic. Lawyers for General Djukic said he did not cooperate with his interrogators, and he himself said at the time of his indictment that he would not do so. **********An American diplomat who monitors the war crimes tribunal, however, said soon after General Djukic's arrest that he was \"singing like a thrush\" in interrogation sessions. **********General Djukic was arrested by a Bosnian Government patrol on Jan. 30. At his arraignment in The Hague last month, he pleaded not guilty to war crimes. His son Aleksandr said the general had opposed plans for the indiscriminate shelling of Sarajevo, but had been outvoted in leadership councils. **********The United Nations tribunal, which is the first international body established to try war crimes cases since the end of World War II, has named 57  suspects from the former Yugoslavia, of whom 46 are Serbs. General Djukic was one of only four suspects in custody. **********One suspect, Dusan Tadic, is to go on trial next month for torture, rapes and killings he allegedly perpetrated at the Bosnian Serb detention camp at Omarska. **********This week a tribunal spokesman said that in addition to the 57 known suspects, about a half-dozen others had been secretly indicted. The spokesman, Christian Chartier, would not say when the indictments were issued, but said there were \"many possible reasons\" for keeping them secret, including the hope that the suspects might be more easily captured if they do not know they are being sought."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/05/business/utilities-rewrite-the-rate-card-small-users-wary-as-big-customers-win-discounts.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1996-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utilities Rewrite the Rate Card;Small Users Wary as Big Customers Win Discounts", "print_headline": "Utilities Rewrite the Rate Card;Small Users Wary as Big Customers Win Discounts", "body_text": " **********Richard Wilde, along with 1.4 million other residential customers of the Consumers Power Company, is seeing his electric rates rise 8.2 percent this year. **********Meanwhile, the 9,000 industrial customers of the utility, which is owned by CMS Energy and serves a large area of Michigan dotted with hundreds of plants tied to automobile and other industries, will pay 4.2 percent less for power. Indeed, for a few giants -- like General Motors, Dow Corning and Pharmacia & Upjohn -- rates have already been slashed 10 to 20 percent at many plants. **********The rate cuts are part of a broad effort to keep jobs in Michigan -- a weapon in the economic civil wars, as states and cities nationwide battle to lure, or retain, businesses. But the formula does not sit well with residential  customers, even though their increased burden -- about $42 a year on an average  bill -- is slight. **********\"If they make rates cheaper for business, more businesses will come here,\" Mr. Wilde, who retired from the Eaton Corporation in 1983, acknowledged. \"But it's not fair to the consumer.\" **********Consumer rates and industrial discounts are not directly tied to each other.  Still, such inequities have become common in states with costly power -- and may be an inevitable byproduct of the utility deregulation movement sweeping the country. That deregulation is expected to offer most users the option to bypass  the local utility and buy power from competing producers. Here is how it works now: A company asks its local utility for lower rates, threatening to take its business elsewhere unless it gets them. It's not an empty threat, for many of the biggest businesses can either build their own generating plants or persuade a local government to form a municipal system, which can buy power at bulk rates. And as more states lower the barriers to competition among utilities, finding lower-priced energy should become even easier. **********Companies may be bluffing, of course, but utilities, with huge investments in generating plants and the delivery systems built when they held ironclad monopolies on their home turf, usually decide not to risk finding out. **********As a result, they often cut rates for specific companies or whole industries. Regulators have generally held that the utilities cannot make up those losses by raising prices for consumers and small businesses. But consumer groups fear that eventually those discounts for the biggest customers will have to be made up by  rate increases for the smallest. **********For big customers, the incentive is clear. Large G.M. complexes have electric bills of as much as $25 million a year, while bills at smaller plants run about  $5 million. In Michigan, G.M. and the others were paying 4.7 to 5 cents a kilowatt-hour; with the discounts, that has dropped to 4.2 to 4.5 cents. Michigan is a prime example of the changes rippling through the utility business, trends also evident in states like California, New York, Wisconsin and Massachusetts. **********For at least five years, industrial rates have fallen faster than those for consumers. But only in the last year or two have these deep discounts for corporations started appearing as a feature of the industry's rate cards. **********In the long run, some say, open competition will mean lower rates for all, by allowing everyone to choose their electricity provider. \"Everyone will benefit,\" said Doug Rothwell, director of the Michigan Jobs Commission, a state agency set up to find ways to retain and attract businesses. **********But, he acknowledged, business customers would get the advantages earlier because they have more options to drive down costs. **********Mr. Rothwell also agreed with the argument raised by utilities and some industrial customers: that rate increases for small customers now merely balance out the rates industrial clients previously paid that subsidized lower residential rates. **********Eventually, consumers may be able to exert enough political pressure to get their rates down. For now, though, groups representing customers like Mr. Wilde, who lives with his wife in Portage, Mich., a suburb of Kalamazoo in the southwestern part of the state, are often left watching from the sidelines, able to offer only feeble opposition. **********They have found it difficult to argue against the need to keep business happy to retain and create new jobs. With many jobs lost to corporate downsizing in recent years, job creation is a high priority in state legislatures. Here in Michigan, Gov. John Engler, a Republican, has made the state's economic growth a priority since he was elected in 1990. **********Efforts have begun in Congress to draft legislation aimed at making the transition to a more competitive electric industry more equitable, but so far the issue has remained primarily one for the states to handle. **********In New York State, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation has given discounts,  mostly in the last two years, to dozens of large industrial customers, like Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant, and Church & Dwight, the maker of household goods. In the face of such deals, the state's Public Service Commission has held hearings on how to allow all customers more choices and may make an initial decision in May on how to proceed. **********The hearings have already shown, though, that legislators, regulators, industries, consumer groups and the utilities themselves all differ on whether to allow customers to buy power directly from outsiders and at what pace competition should be phased in. **********In California, the Public Service Commission has ordered that by 1998 some industrial customers be allowed to bypass local utilities. And in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Utilities has ordered utilities to draft plans that would allow all customers to buy power directly from other suppliers. **********In these states and elsewhere, corporations have been able to club governors  and legislators with the argument that they cannot build new factories or maintain existing ones if rates are not reduced to match those of states with low-cost power. In Massachusetts, for example, the Raytheon Corporation threatened to consider moving plants to other states because of high utility rates; state officials responded by pressing utilities to come up with plans to  give customers more choice. **********\"It's hard to fight back,\" said David Schaltz, a lawyer who represents the Residential Ratepayers Consortium, an association of consumer and elderly groups in Michigan. \"All business has to say is that they can't be competitive. If they use that magic word they get the discounts. We can say, 'We can't afford it,' but that doesn't carry the same weight as saying, 'We can't compete.' \" **********The danger, according to Mr. Schaltz and other consumer advocates, is that as industrial and commercial customers get lower rates, the revenue base of utilities like Consumers Power and Detroit Edison will shrink. **********And later, they fear, utilities may be forced to seek even more sizable increases from consumers, despite assurances now that they will try to absorb the revenue losses by cutting costs. **********In addition, giving some corporations deep cuts has opened a Pandora's box, leading other industrial customers to clamor for similar breaks -- and putting still more pressure on the rates of residential and small business customers. **********Those companies are \"pounding the table for them right now,\" said John W. Clark, senior vice president for communications for CMS Energy, the parent company of Consumers Power. **********William T. McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS, believes that  with large companies in pursuit of ways to cut costs, there is little the utility can do but accommodate them. **********Had discounts not been granted to major customers, he said in an interview in the corporate offices in Dearborn, the refusal could have led to the loss of supplying power to many plants. Each company granted a discount, he said, was in a position to build its own highly efficient gas-fired power plant. **********In granting the discounts, Mr. McCormick said, the utility signed the companies to long-term contracts \"to back them in so they couldn't go anywhere else.\" **********G.M., Dow Corning, and Upjohn agreed to contracts ranging from five to 10 years, guaranteeing that even if Michigan opens its utilities to competition soon, they will still have to buy electricity from Consumers Power. **********If the utility had allowed the plants to find other electricity sources, the  revenue loss could have reached $200 million to $300 million, David W. Joos, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Consumers Power, said. **********And \"if you just allow them to leave your system,\" he said, \"people will end  up paying more.\" **********By offering the discounts, the utility will lose about $65 million a year in  revenue, an amount it hopes to absorb through further cost cutting, without further rate increases. **********\"I don't expect to be going soon for a rate increase\" in addition to this year's, Mr. McCormick added. \"Not on my watch.\" **********The pressure that Consumers Power faces from industrial customers is now often felt by many utilities in other states. **********Mr. Joos recalled that a portent came in 1994 when the Menasha Corporation, a paper company in Neenah, Wis., decided to build its own gas-fired plant that generated both steam and electricity to run its paper mill in Otsego, Mich. **********Consumers Power offered the plant an attractive rate to keep its 15 megawatts on its system, but Menasha's management decided that its own plant, to be completed in January at a cost of $28 million, would be more efficient and bring down its cost of power even more. **********Thus, when G.M. contracted with the Indeck Power Equipment Company, an independent power producer in Wheeling, Ill., to build an electricity-generation plant for its Saginaw division, Mr. Joos and other Consumers Power executives felt they had to offer lower rates. **********G.M. officials did not respond to a request for an interview concerning the lower Consumers Power rates. Apart from the pressure of competition, large companies make well-financed lobbying efforts to help get their way, and their message has fallen on sympathetic ears. **********A study done for Michigan last year by the consulting firm PHH Fantus, which  helps companies select business sites, found that electric rates were as much as 30 percent higher in three Michigan cities than in some other competing states. **********During Governor Engler's tenure, though, a number of taxes on business have been cut or eliminated. The Jobs Commission was set up to spearhead a drive to bring in new businesses and retain existing industries. **********The Governor has also asked the Michigan Public Service Commission to create  a way for industrial and commercial customers to bypass local utilities and buy power from other sources by the year 2001. **********Under the Governor's proposal, new or expanding business would be able to make such choices by the beginning of next year, providing an incentive for industries to expand or move plants to Michigan. **********Residential customers would not be able to have the same rights under the Governor's proposal. **********Mr. Wilde complained that groups like the American Association of Retired Persons, in which he has been active, do not have the same influence with utilities and states as industry groups like the Association of Business Advocating Tariff Equity, or Abate, which represents 30 of the state's largest industrial companies. **********Robert A. W. Strong, a lawyer representing Abate, said the group viewed the special contracts as interim measures, needed only until Michigan put in a system under which all customers would have a choice in buying power. For now, though, \"it will be a very powerful economic tool in retaining jobs and attracting new ones,\" he said. **********With other states moving to reduce electric rates, Mr. Rothwell, the Michigan official, said that the state could not delay. \"Just cutting taxes is not enough,\" he said. \"You have to deal with the total cost of doing business in the state, and electricity costs play a role.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/02/business/outlook-96-technology-and-media-book-chains-extending-influence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 500, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA;Book Chains Extending Influence", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK '96: TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA;Book Chains Extending Influence", "body_text": " **********FOR book buyers, 1995 was the year of more superstore openings, O.

Other chains are expanding as well. **********The expansion follows a year of remarkable growth. In the third quarter last year, Barnes & Noble opened 35 superstores and posted sales of $432.3 million, up 20.4 percent from the similar period the year before. Seventy percent of those revenues were from superstores. Sales at Borders, a unit of the Kmart Corporation, were up 56.9 percent, to $148.9 million, in the quarter.

But now there is a deep sadness blowing in the hot spring winds, as though something has slipped away and can never be replaced. **********On that August day, it did not matter that Sonia Gandhi had been born Italian, or that she spoke fractured Hindi, or that her name has been linked to  a decade-old corruption scandal that tarnished her husband, the former Prime Minister, and could still destroy what remains of what was once India's ruling political dynasty. All that mattered, amid shouts of \"Sonia rule the country!\" was that the most famous and elusive of the surviving Gandhis had returned. **********The speech that day, featuring the first political utterances the 49-year-old Mrs. Gandhi ever made in public, lighted a blaze of hope in this out-of-the-way town that was never much of anything until it became the parliamentary seat for two sons of Indira Gandhi, India's Prime Minister for a total of 15 years until her assassination in 1984. First Sanjoy Gandhi, who was  killed in a plane crash in 1980, then Rajiv Gandhi, who followed his brother as  the local member of Parliament and his mother as Prime Minister, only to be assassinated in 1991, made Amethi one of the most favored towns in India. **********But the promise of August has turned to bitter disappointment, not only for Amethi but also for millions of poor people in India for whom the Gandhis, with  their populist politics and their links to India's freedom struggle, became synonymous with hope. **********After two years of hints and feints that have tantalized many Indians and infuriated others, Sonia Gandhi has decided -- for the current general election  at least, and many Indians think forever -- not to take the plunge into open politics. And many think that such a plunge might have been the only sure way the governing Congress Party -- the party of the Gandhis, the party that led India to independence in 1947, and the party that shows signs of being in deeper trouble now with many ordinary Indians than at any time in its history -- could  hang on to power. **********By resisting the siren calls of those who wanted her to contest the Amethi seat, or to have as the candidate her 25-year-old son, Rahul, Mrs. Gandhi has taken a fateful step, for the Gandhi family as much as for the Congress Party. What she has done, say many Indians who have watched her closely since a suicide bomber killed her husband during a campaign swing in the last election, is to lose or at least to jeopardize a position in which she has turned her widowhood  into a font of virtually unchallengeable, if totally informal, power and protection for the Gandhis. **********In Amethi, eyes glisten when the talks turns to \"Soniaji,\" as Mrs. Gandhi is  known. During her August trip, she challenged the competence of her husband's successor as Congress Party leader and as Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, telling the crowd that India was beset by \"a chaotic atmosphere\" that had betrayed the Gandhis' political legacy.  Her remarks seemed to suggest that Amethi could look forward to once again having a Gandhi looking after its interests, re-opening plants and hospital wards and other benefits that flowed here in the 1980's, then dried up after her husband's death. **********\"If Soniaji had run, or anybody from the Gandhi family, everything would have been different,\" said Mahendra Kumar Panday, a 26-year-old student at a teacher's college named for Indira Gandhi, one of a score of buildings in the town named for family members. What he meant was that without a Gandhi, this seat in Uttar Pradesh state, once a bedrock seat for the Congress Party, is likely to be lost to an opposition party. **********Since 1991, the Amethi seat has been held for the Congress Party by Satish Sharma, who was a pilot with Mr. Gandhi in his days at Indian Airlines, the Government-owned domestic carrier. Mr. Sharma, who has been Oil Minister in Prime Minister Rao's Government, had said for months that he would step aside for Mrs. Gandhi up to the moment nominations closed for the election, which is to be held over three voting days between April 27 and May 7, with results to be announced about May 14. **********According to friends, Mrs. Gandhi agonized over the decision, as she has since a group of politicians loyal to her husband first started pushing for her  to reclaim control of the Congress Party from Mr. Rao, 74, who was a compromise  choice for party leader after Mr. Gandhi was killed. **********The relationship between Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. Rao has fascinated Indians from  the moment that party elders, including Mr. Rao, reacted to Mr. Gandhi's killing by offering his widow the Congress Party presidency -- a post twinned with that  of Prime Minister since the 1960's. Mrs. Gandhi refused, telling friends that her only concern was grieving for her husband, seeing that his memory was properly honored, and protecting her children, Rahul and a daughter, Priyanka, who is now 23 and a kindergarten teacher in New Delhi. **********But Mrs. Gandhi soon found strains in her relations with her husband's successor, Mr. Rao. Her main grievance, friends say, was she believed that Mr. Rao had not done enough to speed the trial and conviction of Mr. Gandhi's killers, described by Indian prosecutors as Tamil separatists from Sri Lanka, and that he had not punished officials responsible for removing Mr. Gandhi's Government security guards after Mr. Gandhi was defeated in a general election in 1989. **********As tensions increased, the relationship between Mr. Rao and Mrs. Gandhi became the critical axis of Indian politics. Because at least two-thirds of the  Congress Party members of Parliament were supporters of Mr. Gandhi's, Mrs. Gandhi had the potential -- or so most Indians, including Mr. Rao, seemed to believe -- to unseat him as Prime Minister. **********But Mr. Rao also held a sword of Damocles over Mrs. Gandhi, and a balance emerged. As Prime Minister, Mr. Rao has been in a position to speed up, or delay, a legal process under which India has petitioned Swiss courts to release  Swiss bank documents said to identify the recipients of $35 million in bribes paid to Indian politicians by the Swedish arms company Bofors in the mid-1980's. According to investigative reports appearing over the years in Indian newspapers, Rajiv Gandhi was the principal beneficiary of the bribes. **********Mrs. Gandhi has made no secret of her aversion to politics. The daughter of a Turin business family who met her husband when both were students in England in  the 1960's, she is known among friends as a steely but shy woman whose passion for family has been reinforced by the violent deaths in the Gandhi family.  In a book memorializing her husband, she recalled how \"angry and resentful\" she was when Indira Gandhi pressed him to enter politics. \"It would crush him and destroy him -- of that I was certain,\" she said. **********But as the political fortunes of the Congress Party plummeted under Mr. Rao,  pressures on Mrs. Gandhi mounted. Congress Party dissidents made pilgrimages to  her home, as did a plainly reluctant Mr. Rao. Mrs. Gandhi is said to have listening silently to the pleas and counterpleas, getting up to rearrange bookshelves when she became impatient, but never revealing her hand. Although she became an Indian citizen a decade ago, and is said by women here to wear a sari as well as any Indian, many Indians, including Mr. Rao in private, have warned that the country would never accept a foreign-born leader. **********Early this month, Mrs. Gandhi made her choice. As election nominations closed, she flew to Japan to keep a commitment for the foundation she runs in her husband's name, which is financed with millions of dollars in contributions  from the Rao Government and from Indian industrialists. One friend said she was  relieved, but fearful that if Mr. Rao wins the election against the current odds, he will use his renewed authority to punish Mrs. Gandhi by expediting prosecutions in the Bofors scandal. **********\"She thinks he'll try to destroy her, and the legacy of the Gandhi family,\" the friend said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/06/business/one-type-of-bond-fund-that-may-have-crested.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1996-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One Type of Bond Fund That May Have Crested", "print_headline": "One Type of Bond Fund That May Have Crested", "body_text": " **********After five years in which hundreds of single-state municipal bond funds have  been started, mutual fund companies are quietly closing or consolidating some.

Other fund companies, like Prudential Mutual Funds and the Dreyfus Corporation, a unit of the Mellon Bank, have eliminated some state funds entirely and rolled them into big national funds -- where, the  companies say, investors can earn even higher returns. **********While the number of fund consolidations is not large, they are seen by some  as a sign that the boom in single-state funds may be ending. There may be too many small and fragmented funds to meet a declining investor appetite for municipal bonds, municipal bonds experts say. **********States like New York, Pennsylvania and California have high tax rates and issue a large number of bonds, and residents of these states can gain a tax break by buying the bonds of their own states. But some say that the mutual fund industry has aggressively marketed single-state funds that make no economic sense -- offering funds, for instance, for states where the income tax rates are so low that the after-tax returns from these funds are not competitive with other investments. In some cases, single-state funds have been offered for states where there are no state income taxes at all -- and therefore no need for a tax-sheltered investment. **********In the last few months, Dreyfus has rolled a Colorado and an Arizona fund into its national municipal bond fund. Nuveen, which has more single-state funds than any other mutual fund company, has merged 37 closed-end state funds into 16 state funds and has more consolidations in the wings. And Prudential has rolled  funds from Arizona, Georgia and Minnesota into a national fund. **********In many of these national funds, investors will get higher yields, which can  more than offset the reduction in any tax benefits from a single-state fund. **********\"For us, this consolidation was part of an overall review of our fund family,\" said Terry Hamacher , president and chief investment officer for Prudential Mutual Funds. \"Some of these funds were very small and we were having difficulty in finding a lot of good new municipal issues. We felt our shareholders would be better served being in our national municipal fund, where  the after-tax yields would be higher.\" **********Single-state municipal bond funds are being buffeted by the same forces that  are hurting the municipal bond market in general. A falling volume of securities issued by cities and towns means fewer securities to buy -- the 1995 volume of new municipal issues is about half the $300 billion issued in 1993. Investor concerns about a flat tax, which could undermine the value of tax-exempt bonds, has cut demand for municipal bonds in general. And the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., has added to investor jitters. **********\"Basically, we are faced with a lackluster market,\" said Diane Coffey, a spokeswoman for Dreyfus. \"A lot of these states don't even issue enough securities. Then, you've had competition from a bull stock market and the administrative costs of some of these funds has been high. It just made more sense to take some of these small funds and roll them into something bigger.\" **********Between 1990 and 1995, the number of single-state municipal bond funds exploded. Lipper Analytical Services reported that in 1990, there were 267 single-state municipal funds; by 1995, this had grown to 731 funds. The assets in these funds in 1990 were $46 billion, and by 1995 they had grown to $113 billion. So while assets in these funds were growing by 27 percent a year over this period, the number of funds was rising by 37 percent a year. **********\"There has been a huge glut of these funds on the market and it has been hard to separate one from another,\" said Patricia Brady, an analyst with Morningstar  Inc., which researches mutual funds. \"It got to the point that there was no reason to buy one fund over another. And a lot of those single-state funds should never have existed. For instance, there are a huge number of Florida municipal bond funds, but there are no state taxes. Those people would be better off in a national municipal bond fund.\" **********But Jon Teall, a municipal bond research coordinator at Lipper, said that it  might be too early to tell if a broad consolidation was under way. **********\"The evidence of consolidation is not compelling to me,\" Mr. Teall said. \"It  seems that all fund companies that were planning to introduce single-state funds already have, so perhaps we are seeing a topping out. The engine of growth behind these funds is showing signs of slowing, so maybe we are at the peak. Yet I'm not certain that the factors behind consolidation have really taken root and are beginning to influence events.\" **********Kathleen Flannagan, vice president for mutual fund organization at Nuveen, said the driving force behind Nuveen's single-state consolidation move was a desire to reduce the fund's administrative costs and provide higher returns to investors. In addition to consolidation that has already taken place, Nuveen plans to merge two California and two New York funds in the next few months and  will continue to look for other possible consolidations. **********Ms. Flannagan said that the cost savings to the funds from these consolidations had ranged from a few basis points -- a basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point -- to as much as 27 basis points. **********\"This is a matter of creating efficiencies for our shareholders,\" Ms. Flannagan said. \"We've taken funds that had $10 million in them and rolled them  into funds with $200 million. There are a lot of administrative costs that are fixed for any fund regardless of size -- legal, custodial and customer-related expenses -- and the only way to gain economies of scale is to join a larger fund.\" **********In some states, because of their low taxes, investments in bonds in the state become questionable when other investments can offer investors better returns on an after-tax basis. For instance, Texas and Florida have no state income taxes.  But there are currently 13 Texas municipal bond funds and 57 Florida funds. **********\"There is no reason for anyone to buy a municipal bond fund of a state where  there are no income taxes,\" Ms. Brady of Morningstar said. \"But look at the huge amount of Florida funds out there. These investors are being hoodwinked.\" **********The Norwest Corporation, which is based in Minneapolis, recently closed its Arizona fund, largely because the firm had little presence in Arizona and there  was little demand for the product, said Lee Chase, who runs the company's mutual funds. Ms. Chase, however, said that Norwest had no plans to close its Minnesota and Colorado single-state funds. **********\"It's a combination of factors,\" Ms. Chase said. \"There is the question of how much paper is available, the size of the market in the state and the marginal tax bracket of the people in the state. More mutual funds companies are slicing up a very small market in each state, so the potential for us to reach a critical mass with our fund was very low.\" **********\"We looked at the market,\" Ms. Chase added, \"and found it was very limited.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/world/britain-asks-europe-to-pay-most-of-cost-of-killing-cows.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1996-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1076, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britain Asks Europe to Pay Most of Cost of Killing Cows", "print_headline": "Britain Asks Europe to Pay Most of Cost of Killing Cows", "body_text": " **********In an effort to rebuild its shattered beef industry, Britain pressed its European partners on Monday to finance 80 percent of the cost of destroying some four million cattle during the next five years, but the European Community today seemed set to offer 70 percent. **********Britain has proposed the culling -- at a cost estimated at $700 million or more -- as part of a strategy to contain mad cow disease, coax consumers back to British beef and get the European Community to end the ban on British beef exports that it imposed last week. **********According to a draft agreement obtained this morning that is still to be negotiated in detail by farm ministers later today, the European Union endorsed  Britain's offer to destroy cattle over the age of 30 months and said it would pay a percentage of the purchase price for the animals to be slaughtered. **********Though the British had asked for an 80 percent contribution, the draft proposed 70 percent and said Britain itself should pay the costs of destroying the cattle. It also suggested that the European Union intervene on the beef markets to sustain prices for farmers throughout Europe. **********The draft agreement reaffirmed the ban on British exports of beef and beef products but said the prohibition should be reviewed in parallel with carrying out a broad package of measures, including the destruction of cattle more than 30 months old. **********As the European Union's 15 agriculture ministers considered the British proposal into the early morning hours here, though, it was apparent that the export ban would not be lifted any time soon. The ban was imposed after British  ministers said mad cow disease in cattle might be linked to cases of a fatal degenerative brain disease in humans. **********The statement sent panic waves throughout Britain and Europe, and beef sales  -- even those of non-British beef in countries including Germany and France -- plummeted as consumers suddenly perceived beef as a possible health hazard. **********The apparent determination of Europe to continue the ban for now reflected the widespread sentiment that radical measures were required both to sanitize Britain's 11 million cattle and to restore confidence in British and European beef around the world. **********\"The ban is part of the effort to restore confidence,\" a European Commission  official said. **********Britain has deeply resented the European imposition of the export ban, arguing that it was unjustified.  Its European partners, seeking to limit damage to the cause of European unity, pledged at a summit meeting in Turin, Italy, on Friday to help Britain out of the morass. **********European officials indicated that in addition to negotiations about how much  of the cost of the cattle-culling program Europe would share, Britain's European partners wanted stronger action, including much tighter controls in slaughterhouses and strict rules for the selective culling of herds in which the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, had been detected. **********Britain's plan for culling would involve mainly older dairy cows, which would be incinerated rather than slaughtered for meat products as they reached the end of milk production. Milk products have not been found to be potentially dangerous. **********Britain has also offered selective culling of younger cattle in herds suffering certain levels of the disease, but there has not been detailed discussion of its proposal or how many diseased cattle in a herd would trigger its total destruction, European officials said. **********\"The mood is, we want radical action,\" a European official said, speaking on  condition of anonymity. **********British officials said the total figure of four million older dairy cattle was derived from a proposal to cull and destroy some 15,000 head of cattle more  than 30 months old every week for the next five to six years, at a direct cost to farmers of $700 million a year. **********Officials said some European countries argued that 80 percent of the cost was far too much for the European Union to bear. **********The European Commission, the European Union's main executive body, had earlier suggested some $250 million a year as Europe's contribution. But British farm officials argued that the European Union had financed 70 percent of the costs of combatting swine fever in Germany several years ago. **********Additionally, other costs not mentioned in the British proposal on Monday would include compensation for British animals slaughtered elsewhere in Europe because of the mad cow crisis, mainly in the Netherlands, and most of all, the huge cost of buying up stocks of European beef and putting them into cold storage until the Continent has fully gotten over its fears of mad cow disease. **********German farmers have complained that the crisis has halved the market value of their beef, and many European nations argue that it will now be necessary for Europe to build a \"beef mountain\" of stored beef until the market recovers from  the mad cow disease crisis. **********It was not clear from the British proposal how many additional costs were likely to arise from the actual slaughtering and incineration of cattle, or whether Britain has the installations to destroy and dispose of so many cows without disrupting its production of beef for consumers. **********With its latest proposal, Britain is trying to secure European financial support for an approach already proposed by its own farmers: eventual destruction of cattle now more than 30 months old, which are seen as most likely to have been exposed to mad cow disease. **********Under the British proposal, dairy cattle now 30 months old or more would be slaughtered when they reach the end of their economic usefulness, when they are  around 6 years old. Then the carcasses would be incinerated. Previously, older dairy cows were used to produce various meat and bone products. **********\"These animals would normally be slaughtered anyway,\" the European official said. \"The difference is that they will be taken out of the food chain.\" **********In addition, the Europeans have suggested that beef cattle destined for consumer markets all be slaughtered before the age of 30 months, which is already true in a vast majority of cases. **********European officials said Britain's partners were pressing for a broad package  of measures that would include new regulations for butchering carcasses, the formal prohibition of meat sales from cattle now more than 30 months old and requirements that offal destined for use in other products be rendered at higher temperatures than at present. **********British officials told reporters that Britain's latest proposals went \"far beyond what the veterinarians suggested.\" **********But Germany's Agriculture Minister, Jochen Borchert, said other European countries \"are not prepared for half-hearted measures.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/21/business/futures-markets-march-wheat-contract-soars-as-company-is-caught-short.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1996-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;March Wheat Contract Soars As Company Is Caught Short", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;March Wheat Contract Soars As Company Is Caught Short", "body_text": " **********The crosscurrents of short wheat supplies and futures speculation collided in spectacular fashion at the Chicago Board of Trade today as the expiring March wheat contract jumped more than $1 a bushel higher than the previous record set  in 1974. **********Analysts said the driving force in the price surge was a major commercial grain company, which they identified as the Bunge Corporation.

And he wants to keep it based on points, rather than percentages, because he thinks that is easier for investors to understand. **********But a Dow point doesn't mean what it used to. Today, a plunge in the Dow of 250 points would represent a fall of just 4.2 percent, or less than 100 points at 1987 prices. And a decline of 400 points would represent a fall of about 6.7 percent. **********The S.E.C. thinks it is high time for those figures to be adjusted upward.

It noted that when the 250-point limit was adopted, there had only been one day since World War II -- Oct. 19, 1987 -- that would have set off the circuit breaker. But the S.E.C. said there had been 13 occasions when the Dow fell at least 4.1 percent during a day. **********The Big Board had promised new limits this fall, but officials there say that some constituencies, particularly those representing individual investors, are reluctant to agree to any change in the limits.

Earlier this year, on a very bad day that turned around, the rebound in share prices came as trading in stock index futures was halted at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by a circuit breaker. Whether the breaker helped, or whether that was a coincidence, is indeterminable. **********The argument for circuit breakers is that they can give investors time to pause and consider. It is hoped that the publicity surrounding a market halt would encourage investors to send in orders to buy stocks at bargain prices created by the plunge. **********The publicity could, on the other hand, scare investors who might conclude this was their last chance to get out, bringing in a wave of sell orders. **********In any case, reopening the stock market after such a halt -- all exchanges and Nasdaq would close together -- could take a sustained period, since new prices would need to be established for every stock. **********Until this year, the rules provided for a halt of one hour after 250 points, and two hours after 400 points. Given that the trading day lasts just six and one half hours, it is unlikely that trading could resume after the latter halt. **********But this year, those periods were cut in half, to 30 minutes and one hour. That makes it more easy to believe that the market could reopen after a 400-point drop. And there are no limits beyond that. **********In the end, the S.E.C. is likely to have its way, if it wants it badly enough.

These fees cover asset allocation, fund selection, portfolio and fund monitoring and consolidated quarterly reports, among other services. **********In Smith Barney's pioneering program, there are 76 funds from 27 approved families (though not the two largest fund groups, Fidelity and Vanguard) that can be plugged into an asset-allocation model appropriate to each investor. **********Besides providing access to brand-name  funds, the program has the advantage of aligning brokers' interests with those of clients. While brokers receive commissions when they sell the firm's own funds, their  compensation in the Trak program is based on growth in the client's assets. ''It puts the client and the broker on the same side of the table,'' Mr. Phillips said. **********The biggest drawback to the program is the 1.5 percent annual fee. The average equity fund already carries administrative and management fees of 1.5 percent of assets, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund rating service in Chicago. Adding a 1.5 percent ''wrap'' fee doubles those expenses, said Michael Mulvihill, a Morningstar analyst. On a $50,000 portfolio with no gains, he said, the wrap fee alone would cost $3,639 over five years. **********''If you have a sense of where you want to be and how you want to get there, these programs are redundant,'' said Eli Neusner, a consultant at Cerulli Associates in Boston. ''If you're fairly knowledgeable, there's no reason to be in one of these.'' **********Other Helping Hands **********A cheaper, more attractive option for some investors looking for advice may be independent financial planners and investment advisers who are paid an overall fee for their services. Indeed, their popularity has soared in the last few years: mutual fund assets managed by financial advisers grew to $45 billion in 1995, from $7 billion in 1992, Cerulli Associates said. **********The attraction for investors is that advisers ''are not affiliated with, or beholden to, any firm for their compensation,'' said Tom Seip, executive vice president in charge of Charles Schwab's retail group, which has built a thriving business serving independent advisers. **********While annual fees for independent financial advisers can range from less than 1 percent to 2 percent of assets, the average is 1 percent, Cerulli Associates said. The 1.5 percent fee charged by Smith Barney is ''too big a hurdle to clear,'' said Michael Maloon, an adviser in San Ramon, Calif. The firm for which he works, California Financial Advisors, charges 0.8 percent to 1.2 percent of assets (the bigger the assets, the lower the percentage). **********The main problem with independent financial advisers is that they tend to cater to the already well off. The minimum account size is typically $100,000, or maybe higher, although some financial planners will take accounts as small as $25,000. **********''You have to be pretty well-heeled to get the attention of someone who's decent,'' said Eric Kobren, president of Insight Management, a registered investment adviser and editor of the Fidelity Insight and Fundsnet  Insight newsletters. **********One way to find registered investment advisers with a primary focus on picking no-load funds is through Schwab. The company has done background checks on some advisers and provides a referral service, called Advisor Source, to interested investors. Schwab receives a fee from the advisers for investors who sign up with them. **********Buying Directly **********Investors who do not need or want advice have still cheaper options: either buying directly from fund companies or signing up for one of the fund networks. **********The major advantages of buying directly from fund companies are obvious: no commissions, no annual fees for advisory services on top of fund expenses, minimums that typically top out at $2,500 and easy exchanges between funds in the family. **********Investors who stick with large, diversified companies like Fidelity, Vanguard and his own T. Rowe Price should have little problem building a well-balanced, diversified portfolio, said Edward C. Bernard, president of T. Rowe Price Investment Services. **********The major drawback to buying directly is the time it can take if one wants to switch from one fund family into another. Investors must fill out forms, send in their signatures and wait for a check to be cut or for the money to be wired to another account. ''Switches can take a week or two to sort out,'' said Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor and an active investor. **********That's why he likes fund supermarkets. ''I buy funds like some people buy jelly beans,'' he said. ''If you want to buy funds from four or five fund companies, by far the best thing to do is to go to the supermarkets.'' **********The Marketplaces **********The best-known supermarkets are  Charles Schwab One Source, Fidelity Funds Network and the Jack White Mutual Fund Network. But the supermarket ranks are growing: late last month Nationsbanc Investments introduced a marketplace offering 300 no-load funds on which investors will pay no transaction fees. In May, American Express rolled out its Financial Direct program, which now offers 200 no-load funds from big fund families, also with no transaction fees. **********The advantages of fund supermarkets are low cost, wide selection and convenience. Investors can buy participating funds at the same price as if they went directly to the companies, but they can switch among fund families quickly and easily. Minimums are reasonable at $2,500 or less, and investors receive consolidated statements and a tax statement of all their holdings. **********Mr. Jacobs says supermarkets are particularly useful in providing quick access to  money market funds as a refuge from aggressive funds should the investment environment turn sour. **********Other advantages, said Mr. Seip, of Charles Schwab, are that supermarkets offer smaller funds that might otherwise be difficult to find and institutional funds that would otherwise be off limits. **********For investors who want to buy and sell funds on line, using proprietary software, both the Schwab and Fidelity supermarkets also provide 10 percent commission discounts on funds that have transaction fees. The Fidelity software, however, is geared to active traders. Jack White provides mutual fund trading through the Internet, also at a 10 percent discount. **********There are drawbacks to the supermarkets, Mr. Jacobs and others concede. One of the best known is illustrated by an event in July in which the PBHG Limited Fund opened for one day to existing customers. While customers investing directly through  the fund company were able to get in the fund, investors on the Fidelity and Schwab networks, like Mr. Jacobs, were passed by. **********Also, supermarket investors may receive their annual and quarterly reports later than direct customers of the fund companies, Mr. Kobren said. **********Moreover, not all no-load funds are available without paying a fee. The most notable holdouts among fund companies are Vanguard and T. Rowe Price. While investors can buy their funds through the networks, they will pay a commission. **********But supermarket aficionados say the commissions are nominal. A $10,000 position in a nonparticipating fund can cost as little as $35 at Jack White and Fidelity. **********Another drawback to buying directly from fund companies or the networks is the lack of personalized advice. While companies like Fidelity and Vanguard hire people licensed to sell mutual funds to handle their telephone calls, these representatives do not  provide continuing investment advice. **********Moreover, while much has been made of Vanguard's personal financial services, introduced in May, James H. Gately, senior vice president of Vanguard's individual investor group, said they were geared toward big customers. The minimum for ongoing financial advice is $500,000. **********In addition, the simplest service offered  by Vanguard -- the drafting of a financial plan for a $500 one-time fee -- will only go so far. ''We know we're not in a position to provide advice on an individual basis,'' Mr. Gately said. ''But we can provide education.'' **********Most major fund companies have developed extensive workbooks and software that guide investors through the process of building a diversified portfolio. ''We can package the intellectual aspect'' of financial advice by using computers, said Mr. Bernard, of T. Rowe Price. ''I don't think there is any evidence people investing directly are any worse off than those who have accounts managed by brokers with six months of training,'' he said. **********In the end, people who use an intermediary should make sure they get what they pay for. ''If investors think that by paying a 1 or 2 percent fee they'll find a fund that will compensate for that fee, they're dreaming,'' Mr. Mulvihill said. ''For a fee that size to be worth it, it needs to be paying for services other than choosing funds based on performance.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/15/world/russian-campaign-ends-but-tv-films-are-telling-voters-of-communisthorrors.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1996-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 900, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russian Campaign Ends but TV Films Are Telling Voters of CommunistHorrors", "print_headline": "Russian Campaign Ends but TV Films Are Telling Voters of CommunistHorrors", "body_text": " **********After a frantic flurry of last-minute political ads, the Russian presidential campaign came to an abrupt halt at midnight on Friday. **********Until the polls close on Sunday night, candidates are forbidden to make speeches or put up new posters, and all commercials on radio and television must be discontinued. **********Instead, a weeklong anti-Communist television extravaganza will reach its peak. Television has been the biggest weapon in President Boris N. Yeltsin's campaign, and he is intent on squeezing his message into every last second of the air time he virtually controls. **********\"Burnt by the Sun,\" the harrowing 1995 Oscar-winning film by Nikita Mikhalkov about Stalin's terror, will be shown at 6 P.M. election eve on ORT, Russia's largest network. **********Today's other TV highlights include \"In Order to Survive,\" a 1992 thriller about the ties between organized crime and the Communist Party, on ORT. RTR, the second largest state-controlled network, will show \"The Run,\" a movie based on Mikhail Bulgakov's novel about atrocities during the Revolution. NTV, the privately owned channel, will show a 1993 bleakly satirical film called \"Stalin's Testament.\" **********In contrast to the Communist horror movies, Mr. Yeltsin's own posters and television commercials radiate serenity and stability. But that optimism clashes with the mood of many viewers and an atmosphere of dark anxiety and alarm. **********In recent days, a bomb went off in the Moscow subway, the Deputy Mayor of Moscow was wounded in an assassination attempt, and the Mayor of Zhukovsky, a small town near Moscow, was slain. With worries about other bombs and civil unrest, security all over Moscow is iron-tight. **********The United States Embassy in Moscow issued a warning to American citizens to  \"avoid crowds\" and \"exercise caution,\" so as to not \"inadvertently become caught up in a demonstration or other activity.\" **********As they made their final pitches on Friday night, all the candidates stressed calm and quiet strength. **********Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, who has not bought any paid TV  time, took advantage of his remaining free television time to reassure viewers that he will not take the country back to Soviet rule. In one ad, shown on the St. Petersburg channel, Mr. Zyuganov staged a mock interview in which he calmly  answered questions about confiscating private property and reopening the gulag. **********\"They are just trying to scare people,\" he replied. \"All those dachas and garden plots, people got them thanks to Soviet power. We're not going to take them away; we're going to try to lower rents.\" **********A few minutes later, on ORT, the only network that reaches all across Russia, Mr. Zyuganov had a famous movie director make his final campaign pitch. **********The director, Stanislav Gavarukhin, an ardent nationalist, spoke scornfully of the pop stars, actors and directors who have campaigned for Mr. Yeltsin. \"They do it for the money,\" he said. \"Shameless to use state money in this kind  of campaign. **********The Yeltsin campaign followed, with a reply by Mr. Mikhalkov, the film director, who spoke about the \"dehumanization\" under Communist rule while the screen flicked between images of Stalin and hysterical Soviet crowds. **********The popularity of Aleksandr I. Lebed, a hero of the Afghan war and former general who is running as a law-and-order patriot, has been rising in the latest public opinion polls.  On Friday night, he was shown walking across a verdant field and speaking sternly about the \"bribery and corruption\" that have undermined economic reform and placed a \"criminal nomenklatura\" in charge of the country. **********General Lebed has been a harsh critic of Mr. Yeltsin, but behind the scenes he has been assiduously courted by the President's men, who are worried that the unpredictable ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky could make a deal with Mr. Zyuganov after the first round and hope to enlist General Lebed. **********In his hometown, Yekaterinburg, on Friday night, Mr. Yeltsin hinted that General Lebed could someday be his political heir. He told reporters that his successor is among the current crop of rivals, and then recited a Lebed campaign slogan, \"I know such a man.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin also said that in his second term he would initiate a major Cabinet shuffle and fill his team with \"new faces, fresh ideas.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin's ad campaign, vignettes of ordinary older Russians talking about themselves through a montage of old sepia-tinted family portraits, culminated this week with the finale -- Mr. Yeltsin talking about his teen-age years and his courtship, against a backdrop of old pictures and sentimental music. **********Some analysts suspect the Yeltsin campaign's all-out media blitz could backfire. **********\"Our research shows that people don't like it; they see it as burdensome,\" said Nugzar Betaneli, director of the Sociology of Parliamentarianism Institute, a public opinion research institute. His institute's latest polls suggest that Mr. Yeltsin's lead in the first round is narrowing, and that Mr. Zyuganov may pull ahead on election day. **********Mr. Zyuganov has complained bitterly that Mr. Yeltsin's blanket coverage rivals the propaganda machine of the Brezhnev era. Some Communist leaders argue  that the anti-Communist movie festival will hurt Mr. Yeltsin more than them. **********\"Such tactics will work only with those voters who cannot remember Soviet power,\" said Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the former chairman of the Soviet Parliament who is now the elder statesman of the Russian Communist Party. **********\"For the older generation, it will have a reverse effect,\" he said. \"They associate Soviet power with the victory over fascism, the first space flight, electropower stations.

was the case before corporate treasurers discovered derivatives.These days, it seems, even blue-chip corporations can take a bath.Sumitomo Corp. of Japan, which lost $1.8 trading copper futures, is the latest derivatives casualty on a list that includes some of the world's biggest businesses, such as Barings PLC, Daiwa Bank, Kashima Oil, Metallgesellschaft AG, Procter & Gamble Co. and Gibson Greetings Inc. **********Derivatives are a sometimes complex and volatile offshoot of equities.Used prudently, they can help businesses hedge against routine risks in global commodities and financial markets.To that end they limit the possible damage to corporations from fluctuations of currency and raw material prices in the various markets in which they do business. **********But some corporations play the derivatives market speculatively, hoping to pull off additional profit by gambling with cash they have earned from their core businesses.Because derivatives are highly leveraged \u2014 meaning that investors are exposed to exaggerated gains and losses relative to the amount they invest \u2014 a sudden downturn can burden a corporation with damaging debts and wipe out an individual's savings.(See \"A Cautionary Tale of Two Spinsters,\" page 17.) **********Although high-profile losses have caused companies to use derivatives more cautiously, the list of big-name losers will grow, said Tim Brown of UBS Ltd. in London: \"The likelihood that someone, somewhere, is doing something they shouldn't is quite high.Almost every year another company admits to making very heavy losses.\" **********The problem investors face is in spotting which corporations are speculating in derivatives and to what degree.Bondholders who lost $150 million in the collapse of Barings claim that the merchant bank's directors failed to inform them what risks the bank was running. **********But while each new headline-grabbing loss is inevitably followed by calls for tighter regulation, there is so far no obligation on corporations to inform investors about their investment activity. **********Attempts by accounting authorities in Europe and the United States to agree new rules on disclosure have met with resistance from corporations.Following several failed proposals, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board recently approved draft rules it hopes will be in place early next year. **********These will allow corporations to offset derivatives against other assets in their accounts provided they are used for hedging.Derivatives used speculatively will have to be included in the quarterly profit and loss account. **********Some analysts doubt the proposal will survive, not least because such disclosure could alter corporate results dramatically from one quarter to the next. **********Another problem, said Mr. Brown, is that the line between speculating and hedging is too blurred for such rules to be workable.\"Sure, there could be more disclosure on the accounting side.The difficulty is in making that data tell you something,\" he said.\"For most investors it will be nothing more than a set of big figures that say nothing about whether or not a business is handling its derivatives exposure well or not.\" **********He added that a bungled attempt at hedging can be as damaging to a corporation as naked speculation.\"Take a simplified example of an oil company investment.If you think oil prices are going to double from $15 to $30 a barrel, you'll buy the company's shares in the hope that the price hike will increase their value.If you are proved right about the price of oil but find the company hedged against a price drop by selling futures at $15 a barrel, the share price will probably fall.\" **********Anthony Belchambers, executive director of Britain's Futures and Options Association, believes the best way to protect investors is by helping corporations using derivatives understand them better.At the end of last year the FOA issued a set of guidelines for directors which it hopes will avoid the pitfalls suffered by equivalent guidelines in the United States. **********\"It is very hard for investors to get information on what risks companies are taking with their cash,\" said Mr. Belchambers. \"And the problem with guidelines suggested in the United States is that end-users are critical of them.In fact, we started looking at this problem pre-Barings and included end-users to help formulate our plan.\" Although the guidelines are designed for the British market, Mr. Belchambers said they could be applied in any country. **********Other observers caution that no matter how adept corporations are at using derivatives, it is harder than ever to prevent employees exposing them to heavy losses \u2014 as did Nicholas Leeson of Barings and Yasuo Hamanaka of Sumitomo. **********\"Companies used to safeguard their money by carefully guarding the business's check book,\"said Mr. Brown.\"The trouble with derivatives is that little or no money needs to change hands initially and information on trades is electronically stored.That makes it hard for companies to keep tabs on what employees are doing.\" **********Andrew Couch, an analyst with Guinness Flight in London, believes, however, that although a growing number of businesses are buying derivatives, most have been scared off using them speculatively by the disastrous losses of others.\"There have been no real regulatory changes,\" he said, \"but the uncontrolled use of derivatives by businesses like Barings has led to companies and banks keeping a closer eye on transactions, especially in the over-the-counter market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/02/business/citibank-joins-investment-in-masco-home-furnishings.html":

There is now no need for that incentive, said Mario Gabelli, chief investment officer of Gabelli Funds in Rye, N.Y., and portfolio manager of ABC. He added, however, that ''we may come back to this program when the markets come down sharply in a given year so that people would find a guarantee of 5 percent attractive.'' **********ABC has also shown that it can  achieve attractive returns under various market conditions, the company said in announcing its new status as an open-ended, no-load fund. **********ABC returned 7.92 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.  That performance lagged behind other domestic hybrid funds, which gained an average of 12.17 percent a year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which had an average annual return of 19.07 percent. **********Eight other funds started since the early 90's also carry guarantees. But the Kemper Retirement funds I through VI and the Smith Barney Principal Return 1998 and 2000 funds guarantee investors only a return of their principal if shares are held to maturity and dividends are reinvested. The Kemper funds have termination dates roughly 10 years after  start-up; the Smith Barney funds  have seven-  and nine-year terms. **********Like Gabelli ABC, these funds  have had returns that trail their benchmarks in the last three years, but by slightly less, Morningstar said. All are also classified as domestic hybrid funds, Morningstar's new category for funds that mix stocks and bonds, and their three-year annualized returns range from 7.28 percent for Smith Barney 2000, the only return lower than that of Gabelli ABC, to 10.02 percent for Kemper Retirement I. **********The concept of guaranteed funds hasn't been very successful, said Susan Paluch, managing editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter.  ''That more funds didn't come out and that they gathered so few assets speaks for itself,'' Ms. Paluch said.  The group together holds about $930 million. **********The Gabelli fund, with $31 million in assets, closed to new investors after its first day, guaranteeing the return for them for one year; similarly, it was only open one day a year after that to new investors. **********The fund can invest in almost any domestic stocks or bonds, while the Kemper and Smith Barney funds own a mix of zero-coupon bonds plus equities. **********The performance of the Kemper and Smith Barney funds has probably been hurt by their zero-coupon bonds, which are very volatile in reaction to interest-rate shifts, Ms. Paluch said. She noted that 1994 was a difficult year for bonds, and that this year had been rough, too. As for the Gabelli fund, it no doubt was hurt over the three years by heavy cash holdings that ranged as high as 76 percent and averaged at least 30 percent, Ms. Paluch said. **********A Midas of Funds Sells His Coins **********On Dec. 3 in Manhattan, a large group of collectors participated in the auction of the ancient coin collection of Michael F.

But did Mr. Price's famed touch for value that he has consistently shown in managing his Mutual Series funds get him top dollar for his coins? **********His collection, of gold and silver Greek and Roman coins, was assigned a presale value of $1.5 million to $2 million, but some analysts conjectured it could bring even more. **********In fact, Mr. Price collected $1.5 million for the coins, on the low side of the estimate, said Harvey Stack, whose Stack's Rare Coins conducted the auction. And that amount is very close to what Mr. Stack's son, Lawrence, an official of the auction house and a friend of Mr. Price since childhood, estimated that Mr. Price had paid for the coins over the years. **********The auction results were shaped by some adverse market conditions, Harvey Stack said. The strengthening United States dollar weakened the buying power of Asians and Europeans, traditional big buyers of ancient coins, he said. And recent excavations increased the supply of certain coins, pushing down prices. **********Several hundred investors from around the world participated in the sale, Mr. Stack said, ''one of the largest audiences that we've had for a world-class collection.'' Nonetheless, the prices paid ''didn't establish a new record,'' he said. **********Tax Information **********Scudder, Stevens & Clark has set up two automated telephone lines to give year-end tax information to shareholders of its Scudder and A.A.R.P. mutual funds. Scudder shareholders can call (800) 343-2890 for preliminary estimates of their funds' distributions; A.A.R.P. fund shareholders should call (800) 631-4636. Actual distribution amounts will be posted in the first week of January. **********The Vanguard Group has prepared a 30-page booklet titled ''Taxes and Mutual Funds,'' with information on how funds are taxed, how funds' investment strategies can affect taxes, how investors must calculate and report their taxes, and more. A free copy is available by calling 800 523-7721.

It invests in stocks of companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more and low price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios, among other value characteristics. The minimum investment for institutional shareholders is $100,000, and $10,000 for individual investors who buy either directly or through financial planners or other advisers. **********New Managers **********Don Hoelting, former chief investment officer for the trust department at Jefferson National Bank in Charlottesville, Va., took the reins as lead manager of IAI Value from Douglas Platt, who remains co-manager.

Ziaur Rahman, who became Bangladesh's military ruler in the wake of the 1975 killings only to be assassinated himself by dissident army officers in 1980, the voters will also be staking a claim for release from the demons of the past. **********This time, many Bangladeshis hope, the election will finally draw a line under the era of military dictatorship in this country of 120 million and set roots for democracy that cannot easily be pulled up. **********The hopes are dogged by fears that the past will be revived, either in the form of new street turmoil fomented by the election losers or, worse, a new takeover by army generals who have recently shown that they retain strong, if covert, links to politics. **********The anxieties persist despite what by Bangladesh standards represent major advances -- a campaign marred by only sporadic violence, and meticulous election preparations by a caretaker Government that has won plaudits from all but Mrs. Wazed and Mrs. Zia. **********The candidates, for their part, have positioned themselves to protest an unfavorable election outcome by harping on every instance, real and imagined, of partisanship in the election arrangements. **********Still, even people who were skeptics about political prospects here until recently are now hopeful. **********''Maybe this time we can do it,'' said Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, a Dhaka newspaper. Mr. Anam said a measure of the change in atmosphere was that after weeks of campaigning most Bangladeshis were worrying less about an army coup than whether the election losers will resume street protests once results are known. **********''This is not to say the possibility of a coup is totally absent,'' Mr. Anam said. ''But the feeling nowadays is that the whole political environment is totally different, that we are moving beyond coups.'' **********In voting for 300 parliamentary seats, Bangladeshis will have an unhindered political choice for only the third time in the 25 years since the civil war that created Bangladesh out of what had been Pakistan's eastern wing. The first occasion was an election in 1973 that was not much more than a crowning of Sheik Mujib and the Awami League, who led the independence struggle. **********The second chance came in a 1991 election made possible by the toppling of Gen. H. M. Ershad, who ruled for nine years after General Zia, then went to jail for corruption, only to surface anew in the current election, directing his Jatiya Party's campaign from a Dhaka prison. **********After winning the 1991 vote, Mrs. Zia's party unshackled Bangladesh from a socialist economic system begun by Sheik Mujib that had helped keep the country among the world's poorest nations. **********But the economic surge was not matched by political evolution. Locked into what amounted to a blood feud over the 1975 and 1980 assassinations, Mrs. Zia and Mrs. Wazed made the country hostage to personal enmities. A two-year opposition boycott of Parliament, from early 1994 to early 1996, led to mounting street protests and general strikes, with a loss to the economy of 150 working days. **********Public opinion, initially divided, turned increasingly against Mrs. Zia for refusing Mrs. Wazed's demand that she resign in favor of a ''neutral'' caretaker administration charged with holding a new election. **********When the Zia Government's term expired in February, it conducted what was essentially a one-party election and won 299 of 300 seats. **********With that, the bubble burst. With street violence growing, the economy paralyzed for 21 consecutive days and the army increasingly restive, Mrs. Zia finally resigned in March, with her last act a constitutional amendment providing that all future elections be held under caretaker governments. **********Power was passed to a former chief justice, Mohammed Habibur Rahman, whose title, ''chief adviser,'' makes him interim prime minister. Ultimate authority rests with President Abdur Rahman Biswas, who in normal times has only titular powers. **********The election campaign was seriously unsettled only once. Three weeks ago, Mr. Biswas, a small-town lawyer appointed President by Mrs. Zia, dismissed two powerful regional army commanders, asserting on the basis of wiretaps by army intelligence specialists that they had plotted to rig the election in favor of the Awami League. **********The army chief, Lieut. Gen. Abu Saleh Mohammed Nasim, responded by refusing to carry out the dismissals. When he followed up by ousting four generals with ties to Mrs. Zia's party and ordering two tank units to move toward Dhaka from outlying garrisons, he, too, was dismissed. He is currently under house arrest at a military barracks in Dhaka. **********With both parties committed to free-enterprise economic policies, there have been few policy differences, so party leaders have frequently turned to the past. **********Mrs. Zia, 50, has warned that supporting the Awami League could mean a turn from ''the politics of development to the politics of destruction'' and has reminded audiences that Sheik Mujib declared a one-party state, closed newspapers and suspended civil liberties. **********Mrs. Wazed, 48, who lost almost her entire family in the 1975 killings, has countered by offering election audiences an apology for ''any mistakes'' that the Awami League may have made in the past -- adding, each time, ''if there were any.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/bally-reported-to-pull-out-of-talks-on-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bally Reported to Pull Out of Talks on Sale", "print_headline": "Bally Reported to Pull Out of Talks on Sale", "body_text": " **********Convinced that it is worth more than potential suitors have been willing to pay, the Bally Entertainment Corporation has taken itself off the auction block, people with knowledge of the sale talks said yesterday. **********But one suitor, the Hilton Hotels Corporation, has expressed interest in possibly resuming the talks soon, these people said. ITT Sheraton, a unit of the ITT Corporation, also had talks with Bally. **********The sticking point is Bally's belief that its shares, which rose 50 cents yesterday, to $21.375, on the New York Stock Exchange, are worth about $30. The  stock swaps that were under discussion would have valued the shares at $25 to $26. Bally, which is based in Chicago, also wanted guarantees that its shares would not fall below a minimum price if a stock swap sent the shares of ITT or Hilton plummeting. **********None of the companies would comment on the breakdown of the talks, which was  reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. **********While the suitors apparently would not go along with the demands, Bally remained an attractive target because of its two casinos in Atlantic City, where Hilton does not have a property, and because of its Bally's Las Vegas in Nevada. **********In addition to a second casino planned for Las Vegas, the Paris, Bally has begun work on a 300-room addition to the 509-room Grand in Atlantic City. Last week, it broke ground in Atlantic City for a western theme casino attached to its Park Place property, which has a separate casino. Bally also operates a riverboat casino in New Orleans and a dockside casino in Robinsonville, Miss. **********Because Bally derives the bulk of its revenue from slot machines, unlike the  high-end gambling operations of Sheraton and Hilton, its business is considered  less volatile than that of its suitors. **********\"I can see why Bally wants a higher price, because its first-quarter results  were extremely strong, especially in Las Vegas,\" said Joseph V. Coccimiglio, a senior analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. \"Valuation is driven by a multiple of  a company's cash flow, and their cash flow numbers were higher than anticipated.\" **********Bally reported last week that cash flow increased 31 percent in the first quarter, to $76 million. Cash flow at Bally's Las Vegas rose 45 percent. The Atlantic City properties were sluggish during the quarter, which analysts attributed to the unusually severe winter. **********While Mr. Coccimiglio said he thought Bally could achieve above-average returns to shareholders on its own, he added that it would benefit from a combination.

Fundamental questions about Sumitomo's scandal remain unanswered, and while the copper transactions involved seem to stretch around the globe, the huge company has so far implicated no one but the trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, in the case. **********Rather than addressing these uncertainties, Sumitomo instead seemed to be trying to put the scandal behind it today, giving few details exactly how Mr. Hamanaka could have hidden such colossal losses over a decade of copper trading. It offered no clues to whether others might have cooperated with him or how much American financial institutions knew about Sumitomo's copper dealing. Several American banks, including Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan & Company, lent nearly $1 billion in total to Sumitomo's copper-trading operations. **********Sumitomo said the losses had grown to $2.6 billion, 44 percent beyond the $1.8 billion estimate released in June, because it had to close out complex trading positions created by Mr. Hamanaka. The company said it ended up selling supplies of copper into a market where prices began dropping after the scandal was disclosed. **********''We underestimated the costs of closing out the positions when we reported the scandal,'' Kenji Miyahara, Sumitomo's president, said at a news conference. **********The company added that since it had closed out its positions in the copper market, except for some hedged positions, it expected the revised loss figure to be final. **********As the head trader in Sumitomo's copper operations, Mr. Hamanaka apparently extended his reach far beyond the guidelines set by the company. Sumitomo said that an internal investigation was continuing, and that it had shed little light on the trading strategies involved. **********Today, it said only that Mr. Hamanaka's trades involved highly risky derivative instruments, creating intricate, ''multi-stepped'' transactions that went back as far as 1985. Sumitomo contended that Mr. Hamanaka had falsified documents, forged signatures and destroyed business records. **********It said it would file a criminal complaint and press charges with the Tokyo prosecutor's office for breach of trust, but gave no other details. Though there have been occasional sightings of Mr. Hamanaka, his whereabouts are uncertain, and Sumitomo refused today to comment on that matter. **********Japanese regulators have been slow to start an investigation into the scandal surrounding Mr. Hamanaka's trading activities. Cabinet ministry officials have said that copper-trading activities do not explicitly fall under the responsibility of any one bureau, which makes oversight and investigation difficult. **********American regulators are also looking into the scandal, and have raised concern about their inability to obtain information about Sumitomo's worldwide trading activities. **********Brooksley E. Born, the new head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the C.F.T.C. was working with the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to review the role of American banks in helping to finance Sumitomo's copper dealings. **********Though Sumitomo is said to have asked the banks how they could have extended so much credit without adequately investigating how the loans would be used, it is prepared to repay the loans, and analysts say there is little risk for the American banks. **********Sumitomo's revised loss figure represents roughly 14 times last year's earnings, and 40 percent of the company's net worth. But it has nearly $4 billion in unrealized gains in equities and real estate, and several billion in bank deposits. **********Indeed, the company said it would swallow the entire loss in the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 1997. It said it planned to charge $400 million against operating revenue, set up a special reserve fund of $1.4 billion, and sell stocks and real estate that would bring in $800 million to partly offset the losses. **********Still, Sumitomo said it would report an unconsolidated net loss of $2 billion in the first six months of this fiscal year, instead of a profit of $82 million forecast in May. For the full fiscal year, it will register a loss of about $1.4 billion, its first major loss since it was founded eight decades ago. **********Tomoyasu Kato, an analyst with the Nomura Research Institute, suggested that there could even be a slight benefit from all this: hefty tax losses that will be carried forward would reduce the company's tax liability in the future. **********If profit next year is $500 million, Mr. Kato said, ''the company will not have to pay taxes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/world/plo-forces-said-to-have-tortured-prisoner.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.L.O.

It would connect directly with the Malacca Strait, the route used by most ships traveling between East Asia and the Gulf. **********General John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said here Wednesday that \"as a seafaring nation, we have a deep interest in having the maximum freedom of movement in the seas.\" **********The general said that \"the specifics of those matters are best left to the negotiators who are involved in those issues right now.\" **********Negotiations between Indonesian and U.S. officials will resume in Jakarta on Friday, while those with Australia will continue in June. **********Analysts said that these negotiations and the visit here by General Shalikashvili, the first by the most senior officer in the U.S. armed forces, underlined the strategic importance of Indonesia. Washington has designated Indonesia as one of 10 high-priority countries or growth zones expected to emerge as major economic and political powers \u2014 and lucrative markets \u2014 in the first quarter of the 21st century. **********Indonesia is also the world's largest archipelago, with more than 17,000 islands stretching along the Equator for 5,120 kilometers (3,200 miles). **********Deepwater straits between some of these islands allow foreign warships to pass quickly and safely between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean in the north, and the Indian Ocean in the south. **********Submarines can pass the same way undetected by remaining submerged without danger of collision. **********Analysts said that for military planners of maritime powers, Indonesia's position between the Pacific and Indian oceans had become even more important after the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994. **********Before then, the Java Sea and many other large bodies of water between Indonesia's islands were treated as open seas; under the treaty, they became internal waters under Indonesia's control as an \"archipelagic state.\" In such waters that are used normally by foreign shipping, the law of innocent passage applies. Under this regime: **********Submarines are supposed to travel on the surface and fly their national flag. **********Warships are required by some countries to shut down their surveillance radars and weapons sensors, although officials said Indonesia was only asking that there should be no unauthorized broadcasting or radio contact between passing warships and land-based transmitters to prevent spying. **********Military aircraft have no rights to fly over internal waters without permission from the coastal state, which can also suspend innocent passage and close areas to foreign planes and ships on security grounds, for example if it wants to hold military exercises. **********To meet the concerns of the United States and other maritime powers on the need for unimpeded transit, Indonesia and other archipelagic states recognized by the treaty, including the Philippines, agreed to designate special sea-lanes so that foreign warships and submarines could pass through without innocent-passage restrictions. **********Tony Vincent, who heads the Australian negotiators, said that Indonesia was the first archipelagic state to designate proposed sea-lanes and open talks on them with interested parties. \"So it is setting a precedent,\" he said. **********Indonesia has proposed three north-south sea-lanes: through the Sunda and Karimata straits to the South China Sea; through the Lombok and Makassar straits to the South China Sea, and from the Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea north of Australia to the Pacific Ocean via the Molucca Sea in Indonesia. **********Mr. Vincent said that under the treaty, Australia believed that Indonesia should also designate as special sea-lanes routes that were traditionally used by international shipping, including an east-west sea-lane via the Java Sea to the Malacca Strait. **********Indonesian officials, however, said that many of the proposed additional sea-lanes were too shallow or had become too crowded with local vessels and oil and gas rigs for safe passage by foreign naval vessels, especially submerged submarines. **********Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign minister, said that by offering the three widely used north-south routes as special sea-lanes, Indonesia was trying to interpret its commitment under the treaty \"in a way that we think is reasonable.\" **********But he said that the United States and Australia were \"not very happy\" with the proposal. **********\"They want a fourth archipelagic sea-lane going east-west through the Java Sea,\" he said. \"But we have told them that the Java Sea is full of undersea cables and oil rigs. It's a very shallow sea, in many parts only 45 meters. So we are rather reluctant to make it an archipelagic sea-lane.\" **********If no agreement can be reached, Indonesia could seek to have its special sea-lanes formally designated by the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency. **********But Mr. Alatas said that Jakarta would like to have \"a good agreement with all users so that there is no question of conflict or tensions.\" He said that Indonesia's aim now was to \"convince our partners that the offer of these three sea-lane passages is a good offer and that for the rest they can use other routes on the basis of innocent passage.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/28/business/company-news-united-dominion-makes-offer-for-commercial-intertech.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;UNITED DOMINION MAKES OFFER FOR COMMERCIAL INTERTECH", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;UNITED DOMINION MAKES OFFER FOR COMMERCIAL INTERTECH", "body_text": " **********United Dominion Industries said yesterday that it had made an offer of $27 a  share in cash for the Commercial Intertech Corporation, a manufacturing company  in Youngstown, Ohio.

But the question is whether the men or the events are now in control. **********With the clashes rapidly escalating from isolated rock-throwing to full-scale gunfights across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, restoring control is no longer simply a question of separating the combatants, as military officers from both sides have repeatedly tried to do. **********Mr. Arafat needs to bring his people more than another dollop of Israeli assurances words and handshakes. And Prime Minister Netanyahu faces heavy pressure to make the concessions that he has so consistently avoided through his first 100 days in office. **********It is hard to gauge how Mr. Netanyahu perceives the crisis. He has often appeared to view the complaints of the Palestinians more as public-relations problems than as real problems, to be resolved with some pledges or even a much-ballyhooed handshake with Mr. Arafat. **********When the rioting first broke out on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu declined to interrupt his tour of European capitals, where he had gone to convince leaders of his dedication to peace. When he did cut short his tour today, however, he began urgently telephoning Mr. Arafat to seek a meeting, on the apparent presumption that such a gesture might work once again. **********But this time Mr. Arafat is not in a rush to be photographed clasping the conservative Israeli's hand. The Palestinian leader's problem is that a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu by itself may not be enough to curb the rising passions, and no meeting may be better than a futile one that might only demonstrate Mr. Arafat's lack of control. **********Mr. Arafat's hesitation reflects the expectation of more violence on Friday, when huge crowds of Palestinians are to gather for the funerals of their new ''martyrs'' and Sabbath Prayers at the mosques. **********For Mr. Netanyahu, the problem is more complex. He is under intense pressure from Americans, Europeans, Egyptians and Palestinians to make some substantive move to convince the Palestinians that he is earnest in his commitment to peace. **********The most obvious gesture -- one that even his American allies have urged on him -- would be to close the exit of the pedestrian tunnel to the Western Wall, whose opening on Tuesday set off the protests. But reversing the decision would effectively violate everything Mr. Netanyahu and his coalition of conservatives, nationalists and Orthodox Jews stand for. It would be a retreat before pressure, it would accept Muslim claims to a say in the management of the outside walls of the ancient plateau and, worst of all, it would tacitly recognize Palestinian claims to Jerusalem. **********Closing the exit, declared a senior advisor to Mr. Netanyahu, David Bar-Illan, ''would bring about the greatest disaster imaginable.'' **********''It would mean that killing, murder and war-like actions can force Israel to do something it has absolutely no reason to do,'' he said. ''It would put its very existence in the region in danger.'' **********Alternatives would be equally difficult. **********Mr. Netanyahu could agree to a date for withdrawal of troops from Hebron. But after the violent and humiliating Palestinian assault on a Jewish holy site in Nablus, a city controlled by Palestinians, Jewish religious nationalists are certain to redouble their resistance to the surrender of any Israeli control over Hebron, where a small Jewish enclave lies near a far more sacred Jewish site. **********In fact, Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing backers are certain to resist any gestures, which they would depict as bowing to pressure. To them, the violence is only proof of what they have always claimed, that granting any autonomy to the Palestinians would be tantamount to arming the enemy. **********The push from the opposing camp, including much of the outside world, is certain to be as forceful. To proponents of the peace, the clashes are proof that the process cannot be delayed or halted. As the writer Amoz Oz said in an interview, it is like trying to change hospitals midway through an operation. **********In public, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat have maintained their usual stances. The Israeli leader accused the Palestinian of incitement, while Mr. Arafat accused Mr. Netanyahu of deliberate provocation in opening a new entrance to the tunnel, which is designed to permit tourists to view archeological relics more conveniently. **********Both have a case: The tunnel is hardly the terrible desecration of Islamic holies that the Palestinians charged, or the ''bedrock of our existence'' that Mr. Netanyahu claimed. In fact, though it has been used for the past eight years, few Palestinians or Israelis even know of the tunnel. **********Yet Mr. Netanyahu had to know that opening the new entrance would fire passions, and that tensions in the Palestinian areas were so high that any spark could touch off a conflagration. And Mr. Arafat must have been aware that his calls for strikes and demonstrations could trigger an explosion. **********In either case, the violence assumed a dynamic of its own. A frustrated Palestinian policeman squeezed off a round of fire, Israelis and Palestinians passed from taunts and rocks to bullets aimed to kill, victims were transformed into martyrs. Suddenly the confrontation was out of the control of either side. **********What troubled many Israelis as they watched and waited to see where the violence would go was the growing awareness that in his first 100 days, Mr. Netanyahu had proved to be neither the dedicated conservative he was as leader of the opposition, nor the pragmatist he projected to the outside world. He appeared to be a wavering politician whose actions often seemed to be too little too late, and who never disclosed his vision of the Israeli-Palestinian peace. **********''I know what he's against, but I don't know what he is in favor of,'' said a senior British official. ''That's understandable in opposition; it is not acceptable in government.'' **********The Prime Minister, wrote another commentator, Sever Plotzker of Yediot Ahronot, ''must take control of himself.'' He and Mr. Arafat do not want to be in each other's company, but history has brought them together, and they have to work together; ''otherwise, it will be hell here,'' Mr. Plotzker wrote.

Zyuganov, as a man who stands to gain as much in defeat as he would in victory. **********The Communist challenger has not campaigned since the first round of voting on June 16, and he apparently does not plan to travel before the July 3 runoff.  Communist advisers have taken to talking less about how they would govern and more about how difficult they could make things for President Boris N. Yeltsin in their role as parliamentary obstructionists. **********Mr. Zyuganov himself contributed today to the view that the Communist Party  is searching anxiously for a new role in possible defeat by calling for a national peace accord among political rivals and a coalition government. **********He has proposed the idea before, and the coalition he suggested today consisted mostly of loyal Communists who would never be acceptable to Mr. Yeltsin. But issued ten days before the election, the statement sounded strangely like it came from a man trying to edge himself into the role of leader of the loyal opposition. **********To some degree the announcement today and the strategy that goes with it are  simply exercises in political spin control, a reach for broader appeal by a party in trouble. **********There are many who think a Communist loss next week will destroy the party in Russia for good, in part because so many of its supporters are elderly. **********But given that Mr. Yeltsin has dismissed many of his top aides, has no political party to support him, and is deeply disliked, the Communists can argue that Mr. Yeltsin's base is also in need of widening. **********\"Lets just say that Zyuganov does lose the election,\" said Aleksandr A. Prokhanov, one of Russia's principal nationalist ideologues and a leading supporter of Mr. Zyuganov. \"He will have received nearly half the votes in the country. He will not be responsible for the economic and political catastrophe facing Russia and his role in Parliament will be as a mature political leader of the most powerful faction. Is that defeat? If I were a political scholar then I  could only wish him defeat.\" **********Mr. Zyuganov proposed today the creation of a new \"Council of National Accord.\" One third of the seats would be controlled by his Communist-Nationalist coalition, another third by the current Yeltsin Government, and the last by the  Parliament -- which is itself heavily dominated by Communists. He also said that the Russian Constitution should be amended to take power from the president and  confer it on this council, not the kind of proposal one would expect from a man who expected to become president. **********\"Russia is in a serious crisis and no single political force can dominate,\" Mr. Zyuganov said at a brief news conference today at which he refused to take questions. \"At the same time the economic crisis is continuing. It can end in a  collapse.\" **********The Communists are now clearly attempting to do what most analysts feel they  should have done for the last six months: reach out to the vast group of Russians who are dissatisfied with the current Government but unable to support  the idea of a return to the past. By selling himself as a representative of those who feel disenfranchised by the reforms of the last five years, Mr. Zyuganov hopes to convince many doubters that new Communism is not anything like old Communism. **********Mr. Yeltsin did not react to the proposal, but a senior campaign aide, Vyacheslav Nikonov, told the Itar-Tass news agency it was \"an attempt to form an unconstitutional bureaucratic organ, the functions of which are not clear.\" **********Still, Mr. Zyuganov may well emerge from the elections in a position to demand some concessions. If Mr. Yeltsin does win, his Government will be required by the Constitution to resign and he will have to select a new one. **********A majority of Parliament must approve his new Government, and the current Parliament is controlled by people who when united almost always oppose Mr. Yeltsin. If a majority rejects his choice of Prime Minister three times, then Mr. Yeltsin will be required to disband Parliament and hold new elections, which would probably produce an equally strong opposition. **********\"Mr. Yeltsin can keep nominating prime ministers and disbanding Parliaments but its not going to do much for Russia,\" said Viktor Ilyukkin, one of the leaders of the Communist Party faction in Parliament. \"He is going to have to compromise.\" **********Other less ideological observers agree. They point out that even if Mr. Zyuganov loses he will receive as many as 30 million votes and that it is easier to criticize than to lead. Mr. Yeltsin now has a new supporting cast, led most publicly by retired Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, and it is not known how they will act should he win re-election. Although the president of Russia has enormous powers, it is nearly impossible to pass laws and change them without support from the Parliament. **********\"It is very difficult to rule a large nation by decrees,\" said Sergei Markov, a senior political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \"You need to have laws to create a civil society and you cannot have laws if the president and the Parliament are constantly and completely at war.\" **********The Communists are also confident that Russian democracy is doomed to failure. They are now talking about the election as a referendum on Mr. Yeltsin. And they constantly point out that more voters oppose the President than support him. The Communists feel certain that even if Mr. Zyuganov does lose he will be  in the position of the Labor Party in England -- claiming a moral high ground while not having to make difficult choices. **********\"I think we can call the first round really a victory,\" said Valentin Chikin, the editor of the Communist newspaper, Sovetskaya Rossiya. \"Remember this was a  ruined party. It was worse than starting from nothing. In three or four years he came back and he did very well.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/19/business/regulators-renew-attack-on-bad-brokers.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1996-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 688, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Regulators Renew Attack on Bad Brokers", "print_headline": "Regulators Renew Attack on Bad Brokers", "body_text": " **********In a tartly worded speech by the Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., and in a lengthy report by a number of oversight agencies, securities regulators announced yesterday a new effort to rid the securities industry of bad brokers. **********\"You only have to hire a few clowns to make the industry look like a circus,\" Mr. Levitt told a gathering of the Securities Industry Association in Palm Desert, Calif. **********At the same time, in Washington, the agency released a report showing that many firms hire problem brokers and then fail to supervise them adequately. As a result, unethical brokers can jump from one firm to the next, one step ahead of  the regulators. **********It is expected that the securities industry will be forced to follow up on the report's conclusion that much more supervision is needed to rid the industry of bad brokers, because the report was written not only by the S.E.C., but also  by a group of regulators including the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange and a number of state regulators. **********\"As long as these characters remain in the industry, they continue to hurt every firm, including your own,\" Mr. Levitt said in his speech. \"The industry is not policing its own ranks well enough.\" **********The report issued the findings of an industry \"sweep\" conducted between December 1994 and November 1995 at 101 brokerage firms. The 347 brokers picked as targets for examination were ones who were shown to have had previous problems or who had moved around to many firms. The examination found problems at about half of the branch offices that the regulators visited. **********Of this group of brokers themselves, about one-third had managed to change firms -- one person as often as six times in a year -- despite a history of disciplinary actions or customer complaints. **********The report also found that branch offices often conducted only minimal pre-employment reviews, that they frequently violated securities laws governing  \"cold calls' and that lax reviews of brokers' transactions were common. **********\"The tone at the top can make a real difference,\" Mr. Levitt said. \"It is the managers who make the choice between an honest shop and a bucket shop. It's up to supervisors to create a culture in which dishonesty is not tolerated.\" **********Michael Schlein, the S.E.C.'s chief of staff, said that the report \"is an enormous signal to the industry.\" He added, \"The entire regulatory structure --  Federal, state and self-regulatory organizations -- are all focusing resources and saying 'we are watching who you hire and how you supervise them.' \" **********James Spellman, a spokesman for the N.A.S.D., said: \"Anytime you get a report like this pinpointing problems that exist, the industry takes it very seriously. Clearly it is in no one's best interest to have bad brokers out there.\" **********Most of the focus of this report was on medium and small firms. This is the second such sweep of the industry conducted by the S.E.C. and other agencies. The first was in 1994 and focused on large brokerage firms. **********As a result of that 1994 sweep, standards in the industry were stiffened to eliminate questionable brokers' sales contests and incentives, to improve brokers' education, and to cut down on brokers' conflicts of interests. In addition, the S.E.C. has stepped up its enforcement actions against brokers who  violate securities laws. Last year, for instance, the S.E.C. brought twice as many supervisory-failure cases as it did in 1992 and 50 percent more fraud enforcement actions against broker-dealers. **********The report contained a number of recommendations aimed at making broker-dealers focus more on supervising their employees. These recommendations  included calls for more stringent hiring practices, for creating special supervisory procedures for brokers with disciplinary problems, for tying a larger portion of the compensation of a branch manager to his supervisory prowess, for more regulatory follow-up of firms that were the subject of enforcement actions, and for better training of cold calling practices. **********Mary Schapiro, head of the N.A.S.D.'s broker-regulatory unit, said yesterday  that her organization would be evaluating \"whether we need to provide more specific procedures on how firms should be supervising brokers with a disciplinary history.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/24/business/market-place-when-owners-aren-t-around-management-pays-itself-well.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1996-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;When owners aren't around, management pays itself well.", "print_headline": "Market Place;When owners aren't around, management pays itself well.", "body_text": " **********IF you're going to be a boss, it's a good idea to make sure the owners have no power over what you get paid. **********That, anyway, is one of the implications of one of the more interesting studies to come out of academia on corporate pay. It's long been known -- from formal studies as well as from anecdotal evidence -- that chief executives tend to get paid a lot when the directors setting the pay don't have much of an  ownership stake in the company. But the new research goes further, studying the  top 12 layers of management at hundreds of American companies. **********For many large companies, of course, there are no effective owners. The shares are wildly dispersed, and in practice the top management chooses the directors, who are supposed to represent the shareholders but may not do too good a job of it. **********This new study, by Steve Werner of the University of Houston and Henry L. Tosi of the University of Florida, appears to be the first to document that even in the lower rungs of management, it pays to work for a company without effective control by owners. Their study, based on data from hundreds of large companies in the 1980's, appears in the current issue of the Academy of Management Journal. **********Down at the sixth level of management, a long way from the top, the pay difference was 15.4 percent, about half the 29.5 percent premium that went to the chief executives. The differences tend to get smaller the lower down the ladder you go. Over all, even after adjusting for everything in sight, including performance, executives get 9.6 percent more if the owners are not around. **********Moreover, bonuses seem to be used differently. In the companies with control  by management, more people get bonuses, and they seem to get paid regardless of  whether the company does well. When the owners are on the scene, bonuses tend to reflect actual corporate performance. When they are not, bonuses \"may serve as a discretionary mechanism for providing higher levels of pay to managers,\" the authors conclude. The chief executives treat themselves well, but they also cut  in their underlings. **********None of this will come as a big surprise to many people in corporate life. To take one example on Wall Street, Bear Stearns, with Alan C. Greenberg on the scene, has always seemed to operate a little leaner than some of its competitors, with Mr. Greenberg acting as if people are spending his money. **********There is, of course, a third group of companies, with a large shareholder who is not directly involved in running the company. In that case, the study found,  managers make only a little more than managers at companies where the large shareholder is running the company. **********\"As a small shareholder,\" Mr. Werner said in an interview, \"it just isn't worth your while to do anything about it. It is worth it for a major shareholder.\" Perhaps that tends to keep managers more cautious, fearing that the large holder may act. **********So what are small shareholders to do if they can never hope to intimidate senior management? One choice is to just avoid companies without an owner in sight, and perhaps this effect helps to explain the fact that small companies tend to outperform large ones over long periods of time. (Smaller companies are  much more likely to have the founder, or at least a later generation of the founding family, watching closely.) **********Another tactic is to consider investing in companies where there is an active shareholder stirring the pot, someone like Michael Price, the mutual fund manager who encouraged the Chase Manhattan Bank to sell out and who last week disclosed an 8.8 percent stake in the Dial Corporation, a company with a reputation for treating its top executives quite well. **********Do companies without effective owners on the scene treat all employees better, or just managers? **********The data, Mr. Werner said, indicate that the lower levels get paid less than  at comparable companies. That is, perhaps, one of the things that leaves more money for the managers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-093858.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1996-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;People", "body_text": " **********Scott Franks, a partner at Earle Palmer Brown, Philadelphia, was promoted to the new post of general manager, assuming responsibilities from Lonny Strum, president, who left to consider opening or acquiring an agency.

The United States delegation gave in on that issue to make the agreement possible. **********In an 11th-hour deal, telephone companies, Internet access providers and free speech advocates persuaded negotiators to delete wording that would have treated even temporary computer copies automatically created to view graphics and other information from the Internet as possible violations of international copyright law. **********''These treaties we've been working on will be the cornerstone of international economic law for the information and technological age of the 21st century,'' Bruce Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks and the lead American negotiator, said at a news conference in Geneva. **********Negotiators reached the deal late last night after three weeks of talks under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations body. To make original works easily and widely available, the treaties are aimed at balancing the interests of writers, artists and other creators of copyright material against those of users and distributors of digital information. **********Once ratified, the two treaties -- one covering literary and artistic works including films and computer software, the other covering recorded music -- would grant copyright owners protection for distributing their work in digital form. As strong as United States law may be, the global nature of the Internet has given some companies pause. **********''This treaty would for the first time create international recognition of rights already in U.S. law,'' Mr. Lehman said in a telephone interview. ''If instead of going down to Egghead or Blockbuster to buy a piece of software or rent a movie, you want to download it to the computer, that's not covered'' under today's international treaties, he said.  ''If you're a big content provider and you're planning a big marketing strategy to distribute product on the Internet, you're not going to do it if there's no law. Now there will be.'' **********The United States, worried that American music, movie and software producers could be harmed because digital information can be so easily duplicated and distributed around the world, led the campaign for tightening international copyright laws. Mark Traphagen, vice president and counsel for the Software Publishers Association, said piracy costs the United States software industry $13 billion each year in lost revenue. **********''From the incidents we've seen, Internet piracy can really have a devastating effect on a company, because so many copies can be downloaded for nothing,'' Mr. Traphagen said. ''That's why this treaty is so important. We want to make sure that all these countries building information infrastructures are on board for protecting software.'' **********The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that illegal copying costs the $40 billion American music industry as much as $2 billion each year in lost revenues. While little of that piracy now occurs on the Internet, Hilary B. Rosen, the association's president, welcomed the agreement an an important bulwark against future threats. **********''I think it's a very good deal for American music lovers and Internet users and it's a very good deal for artists and record companies,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''When copyrights are strengthened, the U.S. really benefits because we are the largest exporter of music. We're completely satisfied.'' **********To reach the deal, experts said, the Clinton Administration was forced to retreat from what it had originally sought. An array of academic, scientific, consumer and technical organizations expressed concerns that attempts to extend copyright protection too rigidly in cyberspace could interfere with access to data and stifle the growth of the Internet. **********''What they came up with protects everyone involved,'' said Julian S. Millstein, a lawyer representing several Internet access providers. ''I think the treaties are very good.'' **********The Patent and Trademark Office, with strong support from Hollywood, circulated a proposal last winter that could have granted copyright holders increased rights over what are known as transitory copies, which are made automatically by computers while downloading material from the Internet. But that idea fell flat on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers objected to the proposal. During the Geneva negotiations, the American delegation revived the concept, only to provoke a blast of criticism from civil libertarians and the computer industry. **********''Before substantial pressure was brought to bear on the U.S. delegation, that delegation was trying to do an end run around Congress,'' Pamela Samuelson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said. Even though the new agreements do not contain those provisions, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sounded a cautionary note about ratification. ''I have been very interested in these treaty negotiations,'' he said in a statement. ''There have been concerns that the Administration might agree to more than Congress is able to deliver. Accordingly, I look forward to learning more about the details.'' **********But most of those closely involved in the debate appeared satisfied with the final compromise. **********''We've done a lot of good here for the Internet,'' Peter Harter, a representative of the Information Technology Association of America, told Reuters News Service."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/23/business/company-news-baxter-withdraws-bid-for-national-medical.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BAXTER WITHDRAWS BID FOR NATIONAL MEDICAL", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BAXTER WITHDRAWS BID FOR NATIONAL MEDICAL", "body_text": " **********Baxter International Inc. said yesterday that it was withdrawing its $3.8 billion offer to acquire the National Medical Care unit of W.

At least, that is, at Dodge. **********BBDO Detroit has created six spots for the redesigned 1997 Dakota, a compact pickup sold by the Chrysler Corporation's Dodge division. They show cupholders and cellular phones, not cowboys. **********All the truck makers have recently redesigned their pickups to emphasize bulging curves, rather than the traditional boxy shape. Somehow, they have made pickups downright pretty. And that has lured lawyers and other city folk used to driving cars into buying more trucks. **********Some auto makers are still hanging tough with the traditional pickup advertisement values. Ads for the  General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet S-10 Series small pickup trucks, for example, still show ''Clint Eastwood-style cowboys'' said Mac Whisner, the national manager for Chevrolet truck ads. The idea is that even small pickups continue to represent the kind of rugged independence that pickup trucks have always symbolized. **********Dodge's campaign intentionally runs counter to that positioning. ''The competitors are tending to run vehicles through mud and do all kinds of things with them,'' said Jay B. Kuhnie, Chrysler's national advertising manager for the Dodge brand. By contrast, he said, Dodge wants to make sure its ads for Dakota ''are unique within the segment,'' he said. **********BBDO Detroit, a unit of the Omnicom Group, said pickups, like sport utility vehicles, have become fashionable to drive for people who never need to haul hay -- but might load a sofa in the back to help a friend move. **********''People in this category do not do a lot of truck things in their truck,'' said Richard A. Johnson, president and chief creative officer of BBDO Detroit. Buying a pickup ''is more of a statement.'' **********Dakota TV ads are scheduled to begin Nov. 4 during Monday Night Football. They continue on National Hockey League broadcasts as well as prime-time shows like ''Seinfeld,'' ''Friends'' and other situation comedies. Chrysler plans to begin running print ads on Nov. 5, when an eight-page insert is set to appear in USA Today. **********Mr. Kuhnie said Dodge's ad spending on the 1997 Dakota would be in line with what it had spent in the past for new vehicles like the Dodge Stratus. Dodge spent about $58 million on the Stratus during its first year on the road, according to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending -- more than twice Dodge's annual advertising budget for the Dakota in recent years. **********While Dodge is breaking ground with televised truck ads that look more like car commercials, the strategy also leaves the truck ads a little dull. Viewers could almost mistake them for spots promoting mid-sized sedans. **********All the 30-second TV ads follow the pattern in recent years for various Dodge cars and trucks -- commercials open with a title card that gives the vehicle's slogan. Dakota's tag line is ''It's full of surprises.'' **********Each of the six ads then features a different attribute, most of which are those found more commonly in cars and less often in trucks. Dakota's  advertisements highlight safety features, roominess and nimbleness, cupholders and other convenient storage places, performance and the three available engines. **********One commercial oozes suburban themes. It opens by showing a baseball and glove, a child's bicycle, and then a rolling grocery cart intent on banging into the shiny red pickup. The announcer says that the Dakota resists dents. **********Print ads are packed with information about the truck's various features. Prices start at $13,235 for the smallest models, while four-wheel-drive models with a bench seat behind the front seat start at $20,470. **********''When someone comes from a car into a truck, they bring with them some wants and needs,'' Mr. Kuhnie said -- precisely the impulse the ads try to address."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/11/business/monsanto-plans-to-sell-or-spin-off-chemical-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1996-10-11", "snippet": "Monsanto Co plans to sell or spin off its chemical operations and instead concentrate on its drug biotechnology lines and popular products such as Nutrasweet and Roundup; analysts say chemical division is worth about $2.5 to $3.5 billion; graph sh...", "word_count": 707, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Monsanto Plans to Sell or Spin Off Chemical Unit", "print_headline": "Monsanto Plans to Sell or Spin Off Chemical Unit", "body_text": " **********The Monsanto Company plans to sell or spin off its chemical operations and instead concentrate on its drug biotechnology lines and popular products such as Nutrasweet and Roundup, the company said yesterday. **********Analysts have long urged this course, saying that the chemical division is worth about $2.5 to $3.5 billion. Monsanto shares, strong performers lately, added another 50 cents yesterday, closing at $41.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The action is the boldest yet by Robert B. Shapiro, who took over as chief executive last year. ''In recent years, the strategies and needs of the chemical and life sciences businesses have become quite different,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a brief statement. ''It's in the best interests of our people, our customers and our shareowners that we take appropriate steps to allow all of our businesses to reach their maximum potential.'' **********Monsanto, based in St. Louis, has long seemed like a work in progress as it bought and sold operations often only loosely related to chemicals and agriculture. In the last few years, however, its high-technology ambitions seemed clear. **********Last year, the company agreed to sell a slice of its chemical operations -- a division that makes plastics for use in cars, computers, telephones and the like -- for $580 million. Just this year, Monsanto has spent $750 million buying control of the Calgene and Agrecetus genetic engineering companies and Asgrow Agronomics, a soybean seed business. **********Even though the old feed and seed store might seem like a bastion of country tradition, gene splicing and other techniques have turned the agricultural products marketplace into a font of technological innovation. **********Among Monsanto's new products have been genetically altered varieties of soybeans and other plants that can survive spraying with Roundup, the popular weed killer. Through Calgene, Monsanto is marketing the Flavr Savr tomato, genetically altered for a longer shelf life. **********While the company might still keep and reorganize its chemical business, it would prefer making it a separate company or selling it outright. Analysts called a spinoff to shareholders the most likely option, since it was unclear who might pay Monsanto's asking price. **********''The pain-free way to go would be a spinoff of the chemical portion, without having to assign a value to it and getting a slap in the face,'' said James Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research. **********The shareholder payoff from Monsanto's plan is also uncertain. Share prices have nearly tripled since the beginning of 1995, he said, so investors already value the shares fully. **********''This was a very sleepy little company,'' Mr. Kelleher said. ''Then they put all their energy into agricultural technology and that really took off.'' **********Mr. Shapiro set no deadlines for disposing of the chemical unit, but the company stressed its determination. **********''This is not something that we think is going to stretch on for months and months,'' said A. Nicholas Filippello, the company's chief economist. Counting Monsanto's total revenues, Mr. Filippello said, it ranks third among American chemical companies, behind Du Pont and Dow Chemical. **********Monsanto's chemical products include ingredients for nylon, herbicides and some foods; fire retardants; nylon fibers for carpeting; acrylic fibers for clothing and the plastic inner layer for safety glass in cars. **********The chemical division remains Monsanto's largest unit, with 1995 sales of $3.7 billion, about the same as the year before, representing 41 percent of total revenues of almost  $9.0 billion. But its 1995 operating profits of $322 million, up from $304 million the year before, were only 33 percent of Monsanto's total of $985 million. **********Though some analysts have said that Monsanto also should or would get rid of its Searle drug unit, Mr. Filippello said that a sale was no longer under consideration. Searle has several promising drugs on the market or in testing, including arthritis and inflammation treatments. **********Monsanto's heavy investments in agricultural biotechnology have sometimes met with opposition that delayed the payoffs. A bovine hormone that increases milk production, the first genetically engineered product to raise food output of any sort, took nearly a decade to win Food and Drug Administration approval. **********But without the chemical business, Monsanto's remaining combination of drugs, agricultural products and food additives would have strong prospects in growth and profitability, most analysts say. **********''It's the kind of thing you wish your daddy had left you,'' said Leslie C.

Looking for a likely buyer for a series long out of circulation, Mr. Bleier approached the Nashville Network, known as TNN, which had never bought an old network series. Mr. Bleier pointed out that ''Dukes'' had once been a favorite with teen-age boys and young men, especially in rural areas where TNN thrives. **********''It's been a real good success story,'' said David Hall, president of Gaylord Entertainment, which owns TNN. ''We started reaching a lot younger audience. Guys in college starting taping the show. We even got fan mail from college boys.'' **********According to Mr. Bleier, TNN saw its ratings triple in the time periods -- usually twice a day -- it ran ''Dukes.'' And with that audience of young men, the show became most attractive to advertisers. **********Mr. Marchetti did an informal  analysis of how profitable ''Dukes'' might be for TNN. Starting from an estimated rights fee of $80,000 an episode (TNN got eight runs of each of the 147 episodes), and calculating that the show would maintain something close to a 1 rating (equaling about 660,000 homes), Mr. Marchetti speculated that TNN could turn a profit of as much as $33 million -- on a show that went off the air in 1985. **********''Dukes'' has done so well even CBS has noticed. The network, a unit of Westinghouse Electric, will shortly announce plans for a ''Dukes'' reunion movie. **********For Mr. Bleier, there was an added benefit: he told TNN he had another property that would do with young women what ''Dukes'' had done with young men. That's how TNN got the 356 episodes of ''Dallas.'' **********Most of the old shows with abundant episodes are used early in the evening or late at night, when they can be ''stripped'' five nights a week. The idea is to catch the channel-surfing viewer with something that supplies a happy memory. **********''It's the obverse of appointment television,'' Mr. Bleier said. ''It's convenience television. It's like going to McDonald's. You know exactly what you're going to get.'' **********But with channels clamoring for product, even short-run shows are getting a look. That's how ''V,'' a two-time NBC mini-series about aliens that was also briefly a regular series, wound up on the Sci-Fi Channel, where it scored some of the best ratings ever for that network. Mr. Bleier even sold the short-lived ''Ben Stiller Show,'' a sketch comedy series that ran for a season on Fox, to the Comedy Central channel. **********More and more, as cable channels take in more profits, they are able to pay high prices for more recent network hits. Turner Broadcasting System, for example, paid an estimated $1 million an episode for ''E.R.,'' which will begin running on cable in 1998. Some series still on the air have even benefited from having their older episodes turn up on cable. Certainly that has been true for ''Law and Order,'' the series on the NBC unit of General Electric that went from marginal success to outright hit after its reruns started running at 11 each night on A&E. **********For the most part, however, all the viewing that is going to these former network hits adds up to another pack of cannibals eating away at the audience base of the networks. **********''With all these old shows getting sold to cable channels and doing well,'' Mr. Marchetti said, ''it's a deal where everyone wins -- except the networks they played on in the first place.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/world/the-world-that-awaits-un-envoy.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1996-12-16", "snippet": "Interviews with current and former UN delegates, who comment on diplomatic world that faces Repr Bill Richardson, who will be new US envoy to world body (M)", "word_count": 963, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The World That Awaits U.N.

But those images often obscure the intensely complicated work going on not only in United Nations headquarters but also -- and usually more so -- in the missions of the 185  member nations and a host of foundations and research organizations  devoted to foreign affairs. **********Diplomacy is a quiet game, so in a city as busy and noisy as New York the United Nations is hardly noticed -- except when its diplomats fail to pay their parking tickets or rent. Yet New York is the most powerful diplomatic center in the world, and it is growing more so as nations use this base to conduct business with one other, often in secret, within the enabling orbit of the organization. **********''Most countries, including a lot of small countries, send their very best people to the United Nations,'' said Thomas R. Pickering, who represented the United States here during the early years of the Bush Administration before serving as Ambassador to India and then Russia. **********''As a result, they bring special skills -- and sometimes special capacities to make problems,'' he added. ''Here it wasn't always the size of the country that counted, but in some cases the size of the ambassador and the size of the fight.'' **********Mr. Pickering, who is now retired from the Foreign Service, is remembered here as a master of the complicated United Nations assignment. During his tenure, he had to organize backing for the war against Saddam Hussein of Iraq in 1991 while also monitoring the progress of peace efforts in El Salvador, a burgeoning international environmental movement and countless other issues. **********''He could be totally preoccupied with Iraq and yet make the ambassador of a small third-world country feel that he was the most important person around,'' another diplomat said. **********Mr. Pickering said that there were  practical as well as diplomatic reasons for casting a nation's net wide. **********''There is always a tendency on the part of big countries to overlook that fact that these international organizations are also voting bodies in some cases; that they operate the way legislatures do,'' he said. ''The bulk of the countries in the United Nations have individuals representing them with nearly full powers with respect to votes.'' **********Getting to know them personally could pay off ''down the road,'' when important issues are decided, he added. Furthermore, not a few envoys return home to become government ministers. **********He noted that the United Nations mission is the only diplomatic outpost of the United States to which several people with the rank of ambassador are assigned because there is a need for diplomats with plenipotentiary power on more than one issue at a time. This is also true of  other major nations. **********The head of a diplomatic delegation at the United Nations is known as the permanent representative. That ''perm rep,'' in United Nations slang, invariably holds the rank of ambassador within his or her country's diplomatic service -- a civilian equivalent of a military rank that  remains with its holder. Thus Madeleine K. Albright, the permanent representative of the United States and soon to be Secretary of State, holds the rank of Ambassador. Her deputy and the leading negotiator on Iraq and the Middle East, Edward W. Gnehm Jr., is also an Ambassador, as is Karl R. Inderfurth, who deals with African issues. A fourth Ambassador, Victor Marrero, handles social and economic issues. **********With the Security Council now meeting almost every day year round, the workload for one envoy of a major country would be overwhelming. Much of the work gets wide public attention, unlike diplomacy in a distant capital. **********''Multilateral diplomacy is a bit different from bilateral diplomacy,'' said Sir David Hannay, who retired last year after serving as Britain's permanent representative at the United Nations. ''You have to have a reasonable spread of specializations. You now certainly have to have military advice. And on the development side, you have to have people who know something about the environment, who know something about population control, who know something about wider development policies.'' **********Sir David said that Britain saw the United Nations as ''a great clearing house for foreign policy.'' **********''We talk to people here whom we don't talk to elsewhere because we have very fraught relations with them,'' he said. ''Also, a lot of our foreign policy involvement is now heavily multilateralized. It works through organizations like the European Union and the U.N.'' **********It is not only the United Nations assignment that is different, the envoys say. It is also New York. **********''Your life in a capital is very much tied up in relations you have and your country has with the host country,'' Mr. Pickering said. ''The life of New York is tied up, particularly for medium or small-size countries, with a whole series of ambassadors of common ilk on issues that are dealt with in a kind of international legislature.'' **********Sir David said he relished the diversity: the theater, the museums, the opportunity to meet bankers or business leaders. **********''New York has a life of its own, and it's basically a business and cultural life -- not a political life -- separate from the U.N.,'' he said. ''That's a fascinating life. **********''Washington is a company town, really,'' he said.

At issue was how to enforce similar fiscal policies -- and staunchly conservative ones, at that -- on nations that have markedly different histories and still jealously guard their autonomy. **********The result today was a compromise between Germany, whose leaders were determined to extend the rock-solid security of their beloved Deutsche mark, and most of the other countries in Europe, which wanted discretion to handle ''special'' circumstances. **********The effort to forge a common currency represents the convergence of two goals: a political drive on the parts of Germany and France to lead the way to a united Europe and an economic effort to revive confidence and growth by making it easier to do business and raise money across borders. **********The plan may or may not work in practice, and it is still possible that the whole project might ultimately collapse before it gets off the ground. But the almost universal opinion among financial experts as well as political leaders is that the Euro will probably appear on schedule on Jan. 1, 1999, and that at least eight countries led by Germany and France will be among the founding members. **********Indeed, European officials also disclosed  the official design of the new Euro notes -- brightly colored bills that are the result of excruciating efforts to avoid ''national bias.'' Indeed, the bills are so neutral that they feature no people, no words (except Euro ) and rely on images of majestic bridges and monuments that do not exist. **********Largely at the insistence of the British, who have been reluctant to join the currency union but want to be sure that they can keep Queen Elizabeth's head on the bills if they do, there will be room for individual governments to print a small ''national symbol'' on the currency they issue. **********But even the most hard-bitten currency traders now believe that the Euro is real, and the likelihood of its introduction has gone from being a weak joke just one year ago to a very strong likelihood today. **********Underlying that shift is a serious and dramatic shift in the economics of Europe itself. To an extent that would have seemed unimaginable a few years ago, most European countries have adopted fiercely conservative fiscal and monetary policies that are surprisingly in harmony with one another. Even Italy, which had been famous for Latin American levels of inflation and haphazard economics, has brought its inflation rate down to 2.6 percent and is making a serious attempt to rein in its runaway debt to qualify for the monetary union. **********''You can see the convergence of economic policy, which is really quite remarkable,'' Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt, said at a recent meeting of European central bankers. **********But it is the world's bond and currency traders who are providing the most concrete signals of the Euro's prospects, because they have methodically factored the likelihood of a common currency into their valuations on bonds sold by individual European countries. **********As recently as a year ago, for example, France was paying a significantly higher interest rate on bonds than Germany -- a reflection of concern about whether Paris could maintain the strength of the  franc. But on three-year bonds, which would come due after the Euro is scheduled to appear, that risk penalty has disappeared, according to James S. Fralick, Morgan Stanley's director of European economics. The same risk premiums have all but vanished for most of the other countries considered certain to qualify for the new monetary union. **********''A year ago, the European view was that the project was dead,'' said Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. ''All of a sudden last summer, people began to talk about it as almost inevitable.'' **********Market analysts generally believe that eight countries will almost certainly take part in the new currency at its debut on Jan. 1, 1999. Those eight are Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland, Austria and Ireland. **********Three other countries -- Britain, Sweden and Denmark -- could probably meet the financial qualifications for belonging to the union but remain skeptical and have made it clear they will almost certainly not join at the start. Meanwhile, countries that nobody expected to meet the tough fiscal criteria -- Italy, Spain and Portugal -- have begun campaigns to qualify for entry that are far more credible than anybody expected just six months ago. **********Under terms of the Maastricht treaty adopted in 1991, countries that want to be members of the monetary union must meet a series of tough benchmarks on such matters as the size of their government deficits, rate of inflation and currency stability before joining. **********At issue at the meeting today was how the new European Monetary Union would enforce fiscal discipline on countries that met the entry requirements but later started to get sloppy. **********Imagine, for example, if France's  deficit abruptly ballooned to alarming new heights and the Government increased its public borrowing so much that it threatened to undermine the stability of the Euro against other currencies. With no realistic prospect of throwing a wayward France out of the union, that might  represent a frightening plunge toward instability for Germans, who would have already swapped their trusted Deutsche marks for Euros, and would no longer have their own central bank to rely on to keep inflation under control. **********Germany initially pushed for huge fines on any country that allowed its  deficit to rise above a ceiling set at 3 percent of its gross domestic product, and to have those fines imposed automatically. Most other countries wanted more political discretion, which became a demand for members of the European Council to allow reprieves for countries that slip into recessions. **********The battle was over how clearly to defend the exceptions, and where to set the numbers. Several months ago, Germany demanded that only countries that suffered a recession where G.D.P. plunged by at least 2  percent would be eligible for exceptions, though it later relaxed that demand to declines of 1.5 percent. **********The compromise today sets stiff financial penalties -- fines of up to five-tenths of 1 percent of a country's gross domestic product -- on countries that run big deficits. But, in a carefully nuanced exercise in fudging, the plan also gives countries a chance to plead for a reprieve if their G.D.P. drops by three-quarters of a percentage point. As a trade-off to Germany for allowing more flexibility, the plan also calls on the European Council to publicly alert countries when they are liable for penalties, in hopes of shaming them into cleaning up their policies. **********Though it was clear here today that many nerves were still raw and that Europe is far from bathing in the warm water of mutual trust, officials from all sides pronounced themselves satisfied with the compromise. **********''It is more than I expected to get a year ago,'' said Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, the man generally described as the most isolated member of the European community. ''The Euro will be as hard as the hardest currencies in Europe,'' Mr. Waigel said. **********Market analysts remain skeptical, however. ''An agreement will probably lead to a weaker mark and a stronger dollar,'' said Richard Davidson, the European equity strategist for Morgan Stanley in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/24/business/wide-protests-seen-today-in-german-sick-pay-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-10-24", "snippet": "IG Metall, Germany's largest union, says big rallies are planned nationwide on Oct 24 to protest possible cuts in sick pay, after collapse of talks with employers aimed at resolving matter (S)", "word_count": 417, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wide Protests Seen Today In German Sick-Pay Dispute", "print_headline": "Wide Protests Seen Today In German Sick-Pay Dispute", "body_text": " **********IG Metall, Germany's largest union, said today that big rallies were planned nationwide on Thursday to protest possible cuts in sick pay, after the collapse of talks with employers aimed at resolving the matter. **********At the same time, Daimler-Benz A.G. and other major auto and engineering companies said they had no plans to immediately proceed with sick-pay cuts, after the employers association, Gesamtmetall, left the decision to individual companies. **********Economists said the issue was likely to be played out with one or two of the larger companies -- either in the courts or in wage negotiations. **********''Given German tradition, it is difficult to see companies in one industry having many different policies,'' said Stefan Schneider, an economist at Banque Paribas Deutschland. **********Officials of the union could not immediately be reached for comment on the expected size and specific sites of Thursday's protests.

Intel leaped 7 3/4, to 136 7/8, while Microsoft gained 1 1/2, to 88 3/8, and Philip Morris added 2 3/8, to 118 3/4. **********The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond plunged more than a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.62 percent, its highest since the post-election rally sent it down to 6.35 percent at the end of last month.

''The rallies of the last year have left people apprehensive rather than optimistic about the future. Because markets have moved so far so fast investors fear something could trigger a downdraft.'' **********Traders and analysts were able to point to several events that they thought set off the nervous selling. But it was the fact that investors were already anxious that allowed the reports to have any impact. **********''The market is still skittish from last week,'' said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Noting that the year-end is near and portfolio managers want to keep their profits, he said that investors ''are probably more disposed to precipitous action than at other times.'' **********''Even if bond yields go up for the wrong reason, stocks will respond because the linkage between stocks and bonds is very tight,'' he said. **********Melissa R. Brown, the director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities, said another factor worrying investors was the outlook for earnings. She said that the market had tended to slump ahead of earnings reports in several of the recent quarters, only to see the reports come out better than expected. **********Some traders said the selling was prompted by an article in The Wall Street Journal that said Japanese investors might slow their purchases of American bonds, a move that could send interest rates higher. Others analysts argued that a slowdown in Japanese purchases would not have a major impact. **********The declines continued despite some benign news on inflation as the Government reported that the Producer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, was up just one-tenth of 1 percent in November. And, at the same time, oil prices in the futures market fell $1.04, to $23.38 a barrel, their third consecutive decline. **********''This is the time of year when it is often sound advice to ignore the rampant noise in the financial markets,'' Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, wrote in a recent market analysis. ''Portfolio adjustments related to tax considerations, futures positions established for asset reallocations, and old-fashioned window dressing can drive up daily volatility and make a (temporary) mockery of fundamental analysis.'' **********But if yesterday's rise in interest rates continues, then the fundamentals would change. Higher rates would quickly change the outlook for the valuations of stocks, making them look more expensive.

Yesterday, they fell to $42.50, down $2.75 for the day. **********It appears that holders who fail to sell the shares by this Thursday will be hit with a sizable tax bill in 1997, a result of the company's planning a dividend of as much as $15 a share to be paid on Jan. 2. **********The settlement resolved a quarrel between Jean Bernhard Buttner, the chairman and chief executive, and her twin brother, Arnold Van Hoven Bernhard. They are the children of the company's founder, and owners of Arnold Bernhard & Company, which in turn owns 80 percent of Value Line. **********Mr. Bernhard had sued to dissolve the family company, a suit that was not disclosed by Value Line until it was reported in The New York Times in July. At the time, Mrs. Buttner called the suit ''frivolous'' and added that lawyers had told her it would be ''inappropriate to advise the public of baseless claims that might mislead the public.'' **********Had the suit succeeded, it would have left no one person owning a majority of Value Line stock, making a hostile takeover of the company at least a possibility. **********Under the settlement announced Nov. 25, however, shares in the family company owned by Mr. Bernhard and by trusts of which he is the beneficiary will be bought by the family company, giving Mrs. Buttner unquestioned control of the company. News of the resolution of the dispute, which had been thought to be a drain on management time, helped push up the price of Value Line shares from $36.25 to the peak of $49.50. **********Under terms of the settlement, Value Line is to pay a dividend of $14 or $15 a share. That will provide the family company with the money it needs to buy out Mr. Bernhard. **********Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman Brothers, warned yesterday that the terms of the dividend would create tax problems for the unwary. He noted that anyone who is listed as owning the shares on the record date, which will probably be Dec. 26, would have to pay taxes on the dividends. To avoid owning shares then, he noted, an owner will have to sell by Thursday. **********Anyone owning the shares would owe taxes on the dividend, at ordinary income tax rates. At the top marginal tax bracket, of 39.6 percent, that would be a tax of $5.94 to the Federal government, and possibly an additional amount to the state in which the shareholder lives. **********By contrast, a seller of the shares would be hit with a capital gain of 28 percent on the profits from owning the shares, possibly a much smaller amount given the fact that these shares have not  performed marvelously. However, the capital gains tax would be owed in 1996, while the dividend would be taxable in 1997. **********An individual who sold shares after the deadline, Mr. Willens said, but before the end of the year, would end up owing taxes on the dividend next year, while owing tax on any capital gain this year. That capital gain would, however, be reduced by the amount of the dividend. **********Value Line, which trades on the Nasdaq National Market, is neither a particularly liquid stock nor a great performer. Only 1,300 shares traded on Friday, and 400 yesterday. And while Thursday's high was a record, the price is not much above the $40 that the shares fetched in 1984. **********That means that investors who want to avoid the big tax bill may find it hard to find buyers without taking a big hit on price.

The Clinton Administration's military commitment to Bosnia from the beginning incorporated an explicit ''exit strategy.'' Elections in Bosnia would help forge a loosely linked nation of Muslims, Serbs and Croats. A Bosnian military, armed and trained with American help, would permit withdrawal of Western troops. **********The cable, in contrast to the Administration's Congressional testimony, predicts that Bosnia's Serbs will soon try to secede from the country, followed quickly by Bosnia's Croats. **********It says that Bosnia might have to become a ''protectorate'' of the West shielded by an American-led military contingent stationed in the country for five years or more. **********''Though such an undertaking entails massive commitments, we believe it is now one of the few options left, if the Bosnia envisioned a year ago in Dayton is to be preserved,'' said the cable, referring to the Bosnian peace agreement negotiated last year in Dayton, Ohio. The cable was made available by an American official who questions the direction of American policy toward Bosnia. **********The idea of stationing American troops in Bosnia for five more years  ''caused most people's eyebrows to stand on end,'' a top official in Washington said. The cable, a senior diplomat said, suggests ''a complete U-turn in American policy.'' **********The notion of an open-ended military commitment in Bosnia has no advocates among President Clinton's senior advisers or others in Washington who earnestly hope that the fragile arrangement envisaged in the Dayton peace plan will somehow hang together. **********But on the front lines of Western efforts to stabilize Bosnia, some European and American officials contend that the only way to prevent the country from being partitioned by nationalist forces may be for outsiders to oversee the Government until moderate political organizations gain strength. **********The cable, sent to Washington 10 days before last month's elections in Bosnia, accurately predicted that Bosnian Serb hard-liners would retain power in half of the country. It asserted that such a triumph would ''signal the death of joint institutions'' in Bosnia. **********The American Ambassador to Bosnia, John Menzies, said in an interview that the predictions in the cable were wrong. ''No one in this embassy thinks these things will happen,'' he said. ''These represent extremes.'' **********Rather than an authorized report to the State Department, he said, the cable was merely the beginning of list of dire and unlikely possibilities, prepared by a junior political officer for discussion among the embassy staff. **********''I had not even seen it or commented on it,'' the Ambassador said. **********It was sent through a series of mistakes, he said. Somehow it went from the author's desk to the embassy's communication center. Such a cable should have been edited and initialed by the Ambassador, his deputy and the chief of the embassy political section before being sent on to the State Department. Although it bore none of those initials, it was dispatched to Washington. **********One of the first senior officials to read the cable in Washington was at the White House when it showed up on his computer screen. He said he was familiar with the pessimism it contained but was surprised that the predictions had found their way into an official communication. **********He called the State Department and was told that it was trying retrieve all of the copies. **********That was not possible, however, because while paper copies had been distributed inside the State Department, the contents of the cable were being sent electronically via computers around Washington, and beyond. Electronic communication had taken over. **********''It used to be the only way to contact an embassy was with a telegram,'' said a top American diplomat.

The new revenue sources would be used mainly to build much-needed housing and buymodern  equipment and weapons. **********\"It really depends on how desperate and how creative we get,\" Mr. Camilion said. **********From 1983 to 1995, military spending fell from a high of $587 million to $132 million a year. The bulk of the cuts came during the current administration of President Carlos Saul Menem, who took office in 1989 and was re-elected in 1995. Mr. Menem has eliminated mandatory military service and drastically cut the number of troops. **********In that period, the number of generals was reduced from 80 to 37, other military officers from 6,600 to 5,000, and troops from 100,000 to 20,000. Despite bitter complaints from senior military officers that they need more money to increase military wages, which have not kept pace with other Government salaries, Mr. Menem has refused, saying the Government must stick to a strict austerity plan. **********Today, the Argentine military is an entirely volunteer professional force, and many military experts have said they doubt that it will ever seek political  power again, especially after its devastating loss to Britain in the war over the Falklands in 1983. **********For many Argentines, seeing the armed forces struggle to make ends meet is a  welcome change, after years of military dictatorship in which at least 10,000 people were killed or disappeared, the economy was grossly mismanaged and public funds were squandered. **********\"We applaud the process of change that the armed forces are undergoing in which they no longer enjoy a situation of privilege but receive the same treatment as other segments of society,\" said Martin Abregu, director of the Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights group here. \"This is evident in their fights with the Economy Ministry about pay hikes in which the ministry  has won every time.\" **********But some military officers and analysts argue that Mr. Menem's cuts have gone too deep and left the armed forces unprepared and ill-equipped to respond to potential foreign threats. Several senior military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said their men were not prepared for action because there was not enough money to train troops, pilots and seamen for combat and to  maintain equipment. **********For instance, the officers said that budget cuts had brought a sharp reduction in the flying hours air force pilots and that only 50 percent of them were ready to fly, compared with 95 percent two years ago. **********In addition, there have been at least 36 military aviation accidents, most of which were fatal, since 1986 because of lack of airplane maintenance, old equipment and a decrease in flying time, according to a study by Rosenda Fraga,  a military expert who runs a research center here. **********\"Some people in the Economy Ministry think that in case of an armed conflict  or a war that it will be enough for Argentina to rent an army from the other countries in the region,\" said Horacio Jaunarena, a member of Congress who was Defense Minister under Mr. Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin. \"Our country is among those with the lowest defense budgets in the region.\" **********Mr. Camilion, the Defense Minister, acknowledged that the Argentine military's level of readiness had declined under the cuts but said the armed forces could respond to \"a general threat in the abstract,\" which he said was sufficient because Argentina is at peace with its neighbors. **********\"Were we confronted with the possibility of a military conflict with Brazil,  we may be in deep waters,\" he said. \"But it's a fact that we are not confronted  with that risk.\" **********The Defense Ministry said it was buying a new advanced radar system and was purchasing Sea Hawk jet fighters from the United States to replace the 60 planes lost in the Falklands war. **********Meanwhile, the military's entrepreneurial efforts are expanding. In recent months, senior officers have been forced to leave grand buildings and move into  the Ministry of Defense to consolidate operations and begin leasing the buildings. **********The Jumbo supermarket chain is paying the military about $100,000 a month to  lease the land at the Patricios army base here, a deal that military accountants say should yield $25 million over 20 years. **********M P & M Communications, a public relations company representing the Jumbo supermarket chain, said that negotiations with the army to lease space on the base were straightforward and that military personnel were honest businessmen. A spokesman for the company said that the army was well connected politically and  that it persuaded the Buenos Aires City Council to pass the zoning change that was necessary to build the shopping center. **********The military is also close to signing an agreement to lease land at the Domeq Garcia shipyard in Buenos Aires to an Italian company that wants to build a shopping center. **********The General Avalos Army Base in the northern province of Corrientes has received permission from the ministry to lease 7,400 acres to local farmers to cultivate crops. The base has already leased 1,700 acres in which farmers are growing rice, corn, soybeans and other vegetables. Under an agreement with the farmers, the military keeps a percentage of the crop sales. **********The air force holds amateur car races on its airstrips in Monte Caseros, in the province of Corrientes, that are well attended by the public, and the navy holds professional car races on its landing strip in Punta Indio, south of Buenos Aires. **********Among other money-making activities, the navy has been offering private boat  tours of Patagonia, and about 80 percent of the cargo on naval ships traveling north and south is commercial. In addition, the navy provides boat repair services for fishing boats in the Punta Belgrano port near Buenos Aires, and demand is also growing in the rural northwestern provinces for military trucks to transport private cargo. **********But lost somewhere between the budget cuts and new military enterprises are the men and women in uniform who are paid far below their counterparts in other  government jobs. Many enlisted personnel have second jobs, moonlighting as security officers or taxi drivers. **********\"I do not feel that people treat me with respect because I'm a military man as they did in the past,\" said Sgt. Sergio Garcia, 42. \"But that's really not important because nowadays the problem is making ends meet.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/21/news/fire-raises-fears-about-safety-lapses-in-eurotunnel.html": {"writer_name": "Barry James", "pub_date": "1996-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 967, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fire Raises Fears About Safety Lapses In Eurotunnel", "print_headline": "Fire Raises Fears About Safety Lapses In Eurotunnel", "body_text": " **********PARIS\u2014                     Despite assurances from the Eurotunnel consortium that rescue work went according to plan following a major train fire under the English channel, investigators Wednesday focused on apparently major safety lapses that could have had disastrous consequences had the train been carrying hundreds of passengers. **********The blaze wrecked track and equipment along an 800-meter stretch of the Channel tunnel and forced a halt in passenger services until at least Monday. Eurostar, the French-Belgian-British company that operates trains from Paris to London, said damage was far worse than at first reported. **********The fire broke out Monday night in a truck being carried along the 51-kilometer rail link between Calais and Folkestone aboard an open-sided wagon. It took fire fighters from France and Britain 14 hours to extinguish the blaze more than 17 kilometers from the French entrance to the tunnel. **********The heat was so intense that it buckled track, welded wheels to rails and destroyed communications and railway infrastructure. British and French safety experts must now examine the condition of the damaged tunnel's massive concrete vaults and linings before authorizing a resumption of traffic along a parallel shaft. **********The Franco-British Eurotunnel consortium, which operates the tunnel, said it spent $171 million on safety before the facility opened two and a half years ago, and holds regular exercises involving staff and emergency services from both France and Britain. **********But despite reassurances from the company that the rescue of the 34 people aboard the train had gone smoothly, the fire raised questions about the tunnel's safety procedures, experts said. An intergovernmental inquiry and an internal Eurotunnel inquiry sought answers to these questions, among others: **********Why did the train stop in the tunnel instead of proceeding to the open at Folkestone, where there are major facilities for dealing with fires? Emile Grard, the senior engineer, said he ordered the second operator to take the train out of the tunnel but it was inexplicably stopped by its emergency brakes. **********Why was Mr. Grard unable to automatically uncouple the wagon containing the burning truck and take the locomotive and passenger coach to safety? After security guards saw smoke billowing from the truck even before the train entered the tunnel, why was it not possible to stop it immediately? Why did the tunnel fill with noxious smoke, despite assurances that ventilators were designed to keep smoke and fumes away from passenger areas? **********Why were passengers on the train instructed to wait in their seats for up to 15 minutes as their coach filled with smoke, instead of going immediately to the service tunnel, which has a higher air pressure designed to keep out fumes? Why was breathing apparatus not available on the train? **********Questions were also being asked about the design of the shuttle wagons that carry trucks under the English channel. To save weight, the wagons have a lattice-work construction rather than being totally enclosed. \"It is the equivalent of the design of a blowtorch,\" said Mike Fordham, the assistant secretary general of the British Fire Brigades Union, which had earlier warned it considered the wagons dangerous. **********The wagons used to shuttle passenger cars under the channel are fully enclosed. Eurotunnel said that if fire broke out on a passenger shuttle, the flames would be doused with halon gas and fire doors would resist any spread of a fire for at least 30 minutes \u2014 enough time to get the train out of the tunnel. **********Investigators were also asking what would have happened had the train carried hundreds of car passengers instead of a relative handful.

Perry said today that the United States would be willing to include American troops in a peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights if they were requested. **********The Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, said later that a multinational force on the strategic plateau on the Israeli-Syrian border would help reassure  Israelis, but he emphasized, \"We have never asked for American soldiers to defend our lives.\" **********The comments of Mr. Perry and Mr. Peres generally adhered to previously stated positions, but they stirred new interest because of the negotiations between Syria and Israel that began near Washington late last month. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher will visit Damascus and Jerusalem to assess the talks' progress. **********Neither Mr. Perry nor Mr. Peres indicated whether an American presence on the Golan had been discussed with Syria. **********The central issue between Syria and Israel is the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. One question is how to assure the security of Israel if it withdraws from territory that offers both a geographic buffer and an observation post. **********The notion of having American forces take over Golan monitoring functions has often been raised. The position of the United States has been that it would consider a request, while Israel has said it would not object to an American force to monitor a peace, though it would not want the Americans to serve as a military tripwire or as a first line of defense. **********Speaking with reporters after his meeting with Prime Minister Peres, Mr. Perry said, \"If the peace agreement between Israel and Syria is reached, which we hope and believe will happen, and if that calls for a peace monitoring force  in the Golan Heights, and if both Israel and Syria request the U.S. to participate in that, we are prepared to do that.\" **********Mr. Peres, speaking later at a luncheon, compared what the Americans might do in the Golan to their role in the monitoring force that has been in the Sinai Desert since 1979. There, troops from the United States, Fiji and Colombia maintain a 2,400-strong peacekeeping force, while American civilians man monitoring stations. **********In recent weeks, the Israeli press has speculated about the possibility of a  formal alliance between the United States and Israel, an idea that reportedly interests Mr. Peres, but is resisted by the Israeli military, which fears that it would lose its freedom of action. There was no indication whether this was discussed during Mr. Perry's visit. **********Mr. Peres, who launched a new initiative toward Syria immediately on taking office in November, after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, expressed satisfaction with the start of talks with Syria. He said he thought President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had \"reached this conclusion that the best bet for the future is a contractual peace with Israel, and that is also our position.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/09/business/be-a-novel-start-up-can-offer-software-to-apple-beyond-conventional-systems.html": {"writer_name": "Denise Caruso", "pub_date": "1996-09-09", "snippet": "Technology column describes how Jean-Louis Gassee and his Be Inc could offer Apple Computer Inc relatively risk-free bridge between its tarnished past and potentially brighter future; Be Inc has developed software that is first operating system to...", "word_count": 1110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Be, a novel start-up, can offer software to Apple beyond conventional systems.", "print_headline": "Be, a novel start-up, can offer software to Apple beyond conventional systems.", "body_text": " **********INSIDE the beleaguered Apple Computer Inc., a comment is often heard about the appointment earlier this year of Gilbert F. Amelio as chairman and president: ''Thank God there's finally some adult supervision around here.'' **********But seven months after Mr. Amelio's rise to power at the troubled computer maker, it is clear that simply putting a grown-up in charge is not enough to provide the tectonic shift that Apple now needs. **********Such a shift may first require Mr. Amelio and his team to acquire a sense of humor and a sense of irony, because the company's deliverance could conceivably be propelled by Jean-Louis Gassee, who was Apple's president for product development and research before falling from grace and leaving the company six years ago. **********Mr. Gassee, forced out because of differences with John Sculley, then Apple's chief executive, said he founded his current company, Be Inc., ''the day after I left Apple'' in 1990. Now, Silicon Valley is buzzing with rumors that Mr. Gassee may soon be reunited with his former employer -- either as a business partner or through an outright acquisition of Be by Apple. **********Mr. Gassee founded Be to develop an inexpensive, totally modern computer system, one that would use the most up-to-date software and hardware available, without concern for what the computer industry calls legacy systems. **********Legacy systems are the Brownie cameras of the industry -- the millions of older computer systems used in offices and homes today that employ outdated, yet still functional technology. Though legacy systems like Windows software or Motorola 68000 chip Macintoshes give companies like Microsoft and Apple their market power, they have also become impediments to progress, because any new software must usually be compatible with older technology, as well. **********Mr. Gassee's Be operating system, introduced as part of his Be Box computer last year, was not so constrained. To begin with, it was designed to work with the Power PC processor chip -- itself a break from legacy systems because the chip, jointly developed by Apple, Motorola and I.B.M., was intended to cut into Intel's dominance of PC hardware. **********And the Be software was the first operating system to be designed from scratch with a technique called object-oriented programming, which allows key modules of the software code to be used and reused as the basic building blocks of the system. **********One result of this approach is a much faster and more reliable computer. Not incidentally, such an object-based system is also a boon to software developers, who can use the basic modules to build application programs much more quickly. The approach also results in smaller applications, which are faster and take up less space on a user's hard disk than comparable Windows or Macintosh applications. **********Other Be innovations allow a computer to do many tasks at once that require a lot of horsepower, such as video editing or displaying multiple windows of digital video. **********Neither Apple nor Microsoft-based machines come close to Be's capabilities. But Mr. Gassee concedes that Microsoft's dominance of the office-productivity software market and conventional retail sales channels means that ''it is simply not possible to compete'' with Microsoft in that area. **********Yet there is growing demand for a new generation of high-performance software tools to ease the creation of digital media and World Wide Web sites. And the developers of these tools want to distribute their products over the Internet, rather than through retail channels that favor large, existing software vendors like Microsoft. **********If Be is to move beyond legacy systems, Mr. Gassee said, shifting its focus to this new generation will be the means. More than 700 companies have signed on to write Be software, he said, many of them small operations with innovative ideas for digital-media applications. **********By January, he expects to see at least 100 programs completed for the Be Box. Perhaps 10 of these will actually reach the market, he figures. And ideally, Mr. Gassee says, one of them will catch on as the ''tractor app'' -- the application that pulls the Be platform into full public view. **********A wonderful outcome in theory. And no doubt highly appealing to Mr. Amelio, who is trying to pull Apple out of its funk. But still, why would Apple risk alienating its remaining installed base -- 10 million Macintosh computers, compared with more than 100 million Microsoft machines -- with an unproved operating system with no applications? **********The most practical reason is that Apple's long-promised Copland operating system, now known as MacOS 8, won't be ready until at least the middle of 1997, if ever. And even if Apple does manage to shove Copland out the door in 12 months, which most industry analysts doubt, it will still be dragging its legacy behind it. **********Apple needs to move fast and decisively into the markets that Be is aiming for. Mr. Gassee could offer Apple a relatively risk-free bridge between its tarnished past and this potentially brighter future. At the Macworld Expo in August, Mr. Gassee demonstrated the Be operating system running on a Power PC-based Macintosh clone from Power Computing -- a machine that, of course, can also run conventional Macintosh software applications. **********Apple's engineers worked hard to help Mr. Gassee's fledgling company move the Be software to the Power Macintosh. And many people, both in and outside Apple, say the company must scrap Copland and adopt the Be operating system as its new software platform. **********Mr. Gassee declined to directly address the rumors about a Be acquisition or licensing deal. So did Heidi Roizen, vice president in charge of Apple's relations with outside software developers. **********''Apple will only be successful if we pick the winners,'' Ms. Roizen said, ''and I don't have a religious attachment to our own internal products. That said, these are much more complex decisions than who's got the coolest demo, or the issue of performance alone.'' **********Even those who compete with Apple say that some kind of deal between Be and Apple would be the right move. ''Be is an amazing product,'' said Mike Rosenfelt, vice president for marketing of Power Computing, the fast-growing new Macintosh clone company. ''And Apple needs to make a transition to a modern architecture. Everyone loses if they don't do that quickly and relatively easily.'' **********Some recent news reports indicate that Mr. Amelio is considering ways that his company might work more closely with Microsoft. That may be fine for milking the last few years of profit out of both companies' legacy systems. But Apple's best hope for the future is to break from its past and renew itself as a technology innovator for the next generation of personal computers. **********With Be, Apple may have the opportunity, for the first time since it announced the Macintosh in 1984, to make that break. What is Mr. Amelio waiting for?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/business/late-shoppers-taking-a-risk-on-catalogues.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-12-10", "snippet": "Apparel catalogue companies that typically do large share of their business during holiday season are short on some goods, putting pressure on shoppers to order early; low inventory levels, cold weather and new demand for clothing have contributed...", "word_count": 954, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Late Shoppers Taking a Risk On Catalogues", "print_headline": "Late Shoppers Taking a Risk On Catalogues", "body_text": " **********Don't count on getting that Gore Tex hat for your brother-in-law from L. L. Bean this Christmas. Lands' End, too, has a bit of bad news about its slippers. Would you like a Victoria's Secret red silk pajama top? Perhaps you had better consider it in green. **********Apparel catalogue companies that typically do the lion's share of their business during the holidays, are finding themselves shorter on goods than they have been in at least three years, the companies and analysts said yesterday. Shoppers may find they won't be able to get what they want if they don't order this week. **********Low inventory levels, the cold weather, and a new demand for clothing have all contributed to the early shortage. ''We wish that 'first time fills' were higher than they are,'' said Charlotte Lacomb, a spokeswoman for Lands' End. The term refers to merchandise that is available when a shopper calls, rather than on back order from a supplier or out of stock for the season. ''We hate to disappoint,'' she said. **********Lands' End, as well as L. L. Bean and Talbots, conceded that they have been struggling with shortages this year. Although catalogue companies selling housewares also appear to be struggling a bit, the clothing catalogue companies appear to be getting tapped out first. Those companies, like the rest of the retail apparel industry, had poor sales last year, and planned this year's inventories accordingly. Indeed, Lands' End, the catalogue merchant in Dodgeville, Wis., started the season with its lowest levels of inventory in several years: $207 million worth of goods, down from $260 million last year. **********But, ever tricked by the guileful ways of shoppers, many catalogue merchants are being deluged with orders for synthetic fleece pullovers, fluffy nightgowns and hats for all occasions. **********''I have been hearing over the past couple weeks that back orders in apparel are very high,'' Debra O'Shea, an analyst at Barrington Research in Chicago, said. ''The last couple of years have been so dismal, and everyone was running with very low inventories. But this may cost people some sales this year, and it is bad news for the late shopper.'' **********Also, many catalogue companies were able to send out more books this year, as paper prices fell. Last year, a sharp rise in paper prices and postal rates trimmed mailings. **********Whether early sales are good or bad for the catalogue companies depends on the perspective. On the one hand, after two extremely tough holiday seasons, companies are thrilled to be moving so much merchandise, which could result in great earnings news. But demands that go unfilled represent lost sales. **********Further, companies risk angering customers accustomed to getting whatever they want at the last minute, thanks to express delivery. Those customers may not think of that company the next time. **********''It is always a fine balance,' said Catharine Hartnett, a spokeswoman at L. L. Bean, the mail order company in Freeport, Me., where back orders have been rising. ''Last year was not a good year for most apparel retailers and L. L. Bean was no exception. We do our best to have things in stock and sometimes that is just not good enough.'' **********Ms. Hartnett said the first two Mondays in December were typically the company's busiest days of the season. She said she expected the company to sell out of many offerings, particularly clothing, by today. **********The most popular items appear to be outerwear and all things made of fleece. But one order went completely unfilled when L. L. Bean was called on Sunday for a ''cardinal'' blanket, a hat, a pair of moccasins, a silk undershirt and a Stellar Scope. At Lands' End, a similar hat and a pair of slippers were also unavailable. When an order was called in yesterday for four items from the Victoria's Secret catalogue, including such standard items as a lace nightdress and a flannel robe, none of the four were available in the color requested, and some were sold out until 1997. **********However, at some companies, the situation was mixed. Despite shortages of many products at Victoria's Secret, which is owned by the Limited, overall back orders are below  historical averages, a spokeswoman said. J. Crew, which also has many items on back order, said that the company was still doing better than last year in this area. **********Because there are five fewer shopping days this holiday season, or perhaps simply because people found their closets wanting, the madness began in October, merchants said. ''Lands' End had a terrific, blowout third quarter,'' Mark Marcon, an analyst at Cleary Gull Reiland & McDevitt in Green Bay, Wis., said. ''Nobody could have expected the combination of apparel coming back the way it did.'' **********To deal with the problem, L. L. Bean has aggressively trained its sales staff to steer customers toward alternatives if they ask for an item that is out of stock. This requires some smooth selling -- if someone wants a sky blue wool sweater, how can they be convinced that a navy turtleneck will suit them just fine? **********Lands' End, well known for its helpful-neighbor-in-a-pinch approach to retailing, has even been offering customers more expensive merchandise, similar to the item they requested, for the same price. **********Talbots has an even better way of dealing with low inventories. ''We are experiencing some of the inventory issues out there,'' a company spokeswoman said. ''But we are in kind of a unique position because we can easily move inventory between our stores and catalogue.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/23/business/company-news-asarco-will-take-charge-and-cease-some-operations.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ASARCO WILL TAKE CHARGE AND CEASE SOME OPERATIONS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ASARCO WILL TAKE CHARGE AND CEASE SOME OPERATIONS", "body_text": " **********Asarco Inc., one of the world's largest copper producers, said yesterday that it would take a $79.5 million after-tax fourth-quarter charge and cease its lead refining operations in Omaha.

But supply-siders are alive and well in the least likely of places: Ukraine. **********Indeed, Ukraine's Government is trying to convince its Western bankers at the International Monetary Fund and other institutions to countenance huge tax cuts to turn around the republic's benighted, post-Communist economy. And strikingly, it has the backing of some high-powered  economists who rarely fraternize with the free-lunch crowd. ''Ukraine may be the one country where lower tax rates really would produce more revenue,'' allows Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development. **********As in the rest of the former Soviet empire, the collapse of Communism in Ukraine decentralized political power. But unlike what happened in, say, Poland or the Czech Republic, the government bureaucracy in Ukraine kept a heavy thumb on enterprises. To do business legally in Ukraine is to run a long gantlet of high taxes, heavy-handed regulations and very sticky palms. **********It's no surprise, then, that once stripped of guaranteed markets at home and elsewhere in the old Soviet Union, the ''official'' economy imploded. Daniel Kaufmann, a visiting scholar at Harvard who formerly headed the World Bank's team in Ukraine, estimates that output from legal economic activities has shrunk by nearly two-thirds since 1989. **********Shrinkage begets shrinkage, as an ever-smaller tax base is weighed down by the nation's heavy social obligations. Budget deficits make it increasingly difficult to contain inflation. Today, there is just one worker in the official economy to support each pensioner, and payroll taxes -- by no means the only tax on enterprises -- run an incredible 52 percent. ''No business can survive in this environment,'' Mr. Sachs concludes. **********But plenty do survive by operating out of reach of regulators and tax collectors. Using electricity consumption to estimate output because it is one of the few reliable indicators, Mr. Kaufmann estimates that the unofficial economy is now actually bigger than the official one. **********That, of course, is bad news: an economy in which contact with the government is mostly under the table is hardly ready for prime time. But it is good news, too, since it implies that living standards are higher than the official statistics say. What's more, it suggests that given a little running room Ukrainians are no slouches at business. **********The economic predicament is apparently understood by President Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's most popular -- and most skillful -- politician. At least for the moment, free market types led by Vice Prime Minister Viktor Pynzenyk are winning the internal battle with the old apparachiks, who have saddled the country with the reputation of being the most corrupt of the former Soviet republics. Mr. Kuchma has signed on to bold reforms suggested by Western advisers who include Anders Aslund of the Carnegie Foundation; Georges de Menil, director of the Department et Laboratoire d'Economie Theorique et Applique (a graduate school in Paris), and Mr. Sachs. **********At the core of those reforms are sweeping cuts in taxes and deregulation designed to lure the underground economy to the surface. The 52 percent payroll tax would be cut to 15 percent, and the revenues would be entirely devoted to covering existing pension obligations. Employers would be obliged to collect an additional 10 percent in wages from workers, which would go into individual accounts managed by private international investment advisers -- a plan not unlike Chile's privatized social security system. **********There is reason for cautious optimism. A March 1996 survey conducted for Mr. Kaufmann suggests that roughly 40 percent of the underground economy would go legitimate within three years and another 40 percent within six years, provided the reforms proved ''credible.'' Mr. Kaufmann emphasizes that credibility turns as much on deregulation as tax cuts, requiring an enduring commitment to preventing the paper-pushers from perpetuating the bad old ways. **********The toughest sell here is the international community, which is needed to provide hard currency to ease the transition. America is on board, at least in part because Ukraine cooperated in dumping its nuclear weapons. But Western Europe and Japan are having trouble focusing on any economic problem beyond their own borders. And the International Monetary Fund is conditioned to making a balanced budget Job One. That priority creates a Catch 22 that is inconsistent, at least initially, with cutting taxes. **********But that may be too shortsighted. With Ukraine's reformers operating on a short leash, the failure to support their leap now could set back the reform effort indefinitely."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/03/business/new-power-macintosh-line-of-computers-is-displayed.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-03", "snippet": "Apple Computer Inc displays a Power Macintosh line of computers based on Power PC 604e chip; line offers speeds of as much as 200 megahertz and all models now include 8X-speed CD-ROM drives; line includes Apple's first multiprocessing desktop mode...", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW POWER MACINTOSH LINE OF COMPUTERS IS DISPLAYED", "print_headline": "NEW POWER MACINTOSH LINE OF COMPUTERS IS DISPLAYED", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. yesterday displayed a Power Macintosh line of computers based on the Power PC 604e chip.

Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America, the industry association that sponsored the conference with the American Society of Magazine Editors. ''This is a good year.'' **********The magazine community has reason to be reasonably upbeat. While the number of ad pages has declined in the last year, the amount that magazines are earning for each page has increased, according to the Publishers Information Bureau -- though the bureau does not account for ad-page discounts. Through September, total magazine advertising revenue was $7.8 billion, the bureau reported, up 8.5 percent from the comparable period last year. **********In 1995, the number of new magazines rose to 838, nearly a fourfold jump from the 234 magazines that hit the newsstands a decade ago, according to Samir Husni's Guide to New Consumer Magazines. And the survival rate of new magazines has increased: 3 out of 10 are still around after four years of publishing, compared with 2 out of 10 in 1985. **********Indeed, most speakers at the conference were very high on the industry's prospects. Michael Ovitz, the president of the Walt Disney Company, devoted the bulk of his speech to describing potential technological breakthroughs, such as ''electronic paper,'' but he also sang the praises of print and confessed to being a magazine junkie. **********''What consumers respond to is not technology,'' Mr. Ovitz said. ''While technology may enhance convenience or even provide novelty, the reader ultimately craves content.'' **********From a purely business perspective, a panel of investment bankers on ''The View from Wall Street'' were positively bullish about magazines as an investment. John Suhler, the president of Veronis, Suhler & Associates, said magazines had picked up the market share lost by newspapers. **********He also noted that the total media industry is trading at about 10-and-a-half to 12-and-a-half times its operating cash flow -- or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- and that much of the private equity now available has been earmarked for magazines. **********Steven Rattner, managing director at Lazard Freres & Company, said that magazines were attractive to investors because of their high ''proprietary'' content and expertise at targeting specific audiences. **********And Wilma Jordan, the co-chairwoman of the Jordan, Edminston Group, talked about magazines as low-capital businesses with little risk of obsolescence, resistance to foreign competition, high profit margins and attractive earnings multiples. **********Mr. Suhler, though, warned that the outlook was less positive for smaller publishers -- who, he said, should be seeking alliances with larger media companies to get more financial heft -- and that media companies can no longer afford to hold onto trophy properties that are underperforming. ''It's too damn competitive,'' Mr. Suhler said. ''Everything's got to work.'' **********While the bulk of the conference was devoted to the nuts and bolts of magazine publishing, there was also a strong emphasis on political topics. Among the speakers featured at the conference were Edward J. Rollins, the political consultant; Steve Forbes, the former Presidential candidate who is also editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine, and Peggy Noonan, the political writer. **********But because the Presidential race has turned out to be less than scintillating, perhaps the most intriguing contribution came from Joe Klein, a Newsweek columnist, and had nothing to do with politics. In response to a question from the audience about how he had handled his novel, ''Primary Colors,'' Mr. Klein was largely unrepentant about having denied being the author, Anonymous. **********''I was working in a grand literary tradition that has existed since the day after the Day One,'' Mr. Klein said. ''My not telling the truth about being the author of 'Primary Colors' really had nothing to do with my performance as a journalist.'' **********Then, perhaps protesting too much, Mr. Klein continued: ''The world didn't need to know who Anonymous was, writing this book anonymously didn't hurt anybody, there was no big issue at stake. The state of journalism hasn't been affected -- either positively or negatively -- by what I did.'' **********Except for a dinner in their honor hosted by the American Society of Magazine Editors, the 60-some editors in attendance were mixed in with their business-side counterparts for most of the conference. Still, it was easy to pick the editors out in the crowd. **********They were the ones too cool to wear the complimentary white conference T-shirts or carry their complimentary black tote bags, the ones too busy to stay to the end. They were also the ones gossiping most about how much effort Mr. Ovitz had spent to impress them. **********According to several increasingly inflated versions, Mr. Ovitz flew in on his private jet the night before his speech with about 11 members of his support staff, rewrote and rehearsed his speech a number of times after showing it to some top people at Disney Publishing and spent $250,000 on his presentation, which included two videos, an explosion in a briefcase and TelePrompters like the ones used at the Presidential conventions. **********John Dreyer, Disney's vice president of corporate communications, said those reports were greatly exaggerated. He said that Mr. Ovitz only brought two people with him, practiced his speech twice and that people from Disney's publications merely helped ''tweak'' the speech in a couple of places. As to whether Mr. Ovitz spent even close to the amount of money estimated, Mr. Dreyer laughed and said, ''Not a chance.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-omnicom-unit-wins-25-clio-awards.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Omnicom Unit Wins 25 Clio Awards", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Omnicom Unit Wins 25 Clio Awards", "body_text": " **********For the second consecutive year, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco has won the most awards at the Clio Awards ceremony. **********At the 37th annual Clio ceremonies, held last week in San Francisco, Goodby,  Silverstein, which is owned by the Omnicom Group, won 25 Clios -- 3 golds, 7 silvers and 15 certificates.

But now, a misdialed fax machine may raise questions about the independence of that investigation. **********At issue: why did Mr. Lynch quickly forward to Mattel officials a letter he received from a lawyer suing the company that suggested areas in which he should concentrate his inquiry? **********The curious chain of events was set off on Monday when Mr. Lynch received a  fax from Joel M. Kozberg, a plaintiff's lawyer who represents Michelle Greenwald, a former senior vice president for marketing at Mattel who filed a lawsuit in 1995 against the the company for wrongful termination. In that action, Ms. Greenwald, who now works for the Walt Disney Company, also accused Mattel of inflating its earnings through accounting gimmicks. **********The company has flatly denied her charges. In April, the audit committee of Mattel's board hired Mr. Lynch, who is now a partner in the New York law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, to conduct an independent review of Ms. Greenwald's allegations. **********Mr. Kozberg, the plaintiff's lawyer, said Mr. Lynch had requested an interview with Ms. Greenwald as part of his inquiry. In response, Mr. Kozberg reiterated in his letter the allegations made in Ms. Greenwald's lawsuit and provided suggestions for areas of inquiry. The lawyer said he sent the letter to Mr. Lynch because he was concerned, among other things, about the impartiality of aspects of the investigation and to draw Mr. Lynch's attention to documents recently released by the company as part of pretrial discovery that he believed  bolstered his client's claims. **********Just a few hours after receiving the letter, Mr. Lynch faxed it on to Mattel, where it quickly ended up on the desk of John W. Amerman, the company's chief executive. Ms. Greenwald has contended that Mr. Amerman financially benefited from the reported accounting scheme, a charge he has adamantly rejected. **********Mr. Kozberg said his letter to Mr. Lynch, along with a memo from Mr. Amerman  to an independent Mattel director who heads its audit committee, were sent back  to him by a medical center in Florida. The center received the information from  Mattel when someone apparently misdialed a fax. The center, in turn, faxed the information back to the first phone number that appeared on the letter -- Mr. Kozberg's. **********\"It appears that Gary Lynch immediately passed my letter on to his client directly upon its receipt.\" said Mr. Kozberg, who is in Los Angeles. \"So the question is why is he or someone else passing my letter on to John Amerman, who  is alleged to be directly involved in the practices Michelle Greenwald is complaining about.\" **********For his part, Mr. Lynch acknowledged sending the letter to Mattel. But he said there was nothing inappropriate about that. He added that little in Mr. Kozberg's letter was new and that all the information was based on company documents. **********\"To the extent that there was anything new in the letter, a reasonable way to investigate it would be to ask the company for responses to the allegations,\" Mr. Lynch said. **********But some experts in corporate ethics and investigations said that generally speaking lawyers undertaking independent corporate investigations had to tread carefully to maintain both the appearance and spirit of impartiality. **********\"There is nothing intrinsically wrong with some point of contact between the  investigator and the company,\" said Howard Anderson, a Washington lawyer who specializes in internal corporate investigations. \"But there has to be a good reason to be sending them information rather than giving them a heads-up on litigation. You are not supposed to be an advocate for either side.\" **********Barbara Ley Toffler, a former professor at the Harvard Business School, said  she would be disturbed if an independent investigator forwarded a letter that included allegations to a corporate client without first examining it. **********\"It's something that should not happen,\" said Ms. Toffler, who is the head of a consulting service at Arthur Andersen & Company that advises companies on ethics. **********Glenn Bozarth, a spokesman for Mattel, said Ms. Greenwald's lawyers were simply questioning Mr. Lynch's independence as part of a continuing legal war of attrition. He also dismissed the allegations in Mr. Kozberg's letter as old. **********\"Ms. Greenwald and her attorneys are obviously trying to pre-empt a thorough  and independent review and trying to harm this company and it shareholders solely for their personal gain,\" Mr. Bozarth said. **********Mr. Bozarth declined to discuss how the letter got to Mr. Amerman, other than to say that it was circulated to a few individuals. He said Mr. Lynch, in transmitting the letter to Mattel, had not sent along accompanying questions about it. **********\"In our view, it was sent to us for further follow-up,\" he said. **********Mr. Bozarth said that Mattel expected that Mr. Lynch might complete his investigation shortly but could not predict a date."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/business/earnings-at-deere-climbed-by-13.3-in-third-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-08-14", "snippet": "Deere & Co says earnings rose 13.3 percent in third quarter; company earned $204.4 million, up from $180.1 million in the quarter a year earlier; revenue rose 9 percent, to $2.91 billion, from $2.67 billiion in quarter a year ago; agricultural equ...", "word_count": 397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Earnings at Deere Climbed By 13.3% in Third Quarter", "print_headline": "Earnings at Deere Climbed By 13.3% in Third Quarter", "body_text": " **********Deere & Company said today that earnings rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter, bolstered by strong demand for agriculture equipment. **********The company, based in Moline, Ill., earned $204.4 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $180.1 million, or 69 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********The earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations of 77 cents a share, according to First Call, and prompted a rally in Deere shares.

Inside the wrapper, however, is a special weekend business section that represents the first steps in The Austin American-Statesman's experiment in tailoring the familiar daily paper to the tastes, and someday maybe even the pocketbook, of every reader. **********Dr. Pennington -- he is an orthopedic surgeon -- is one of nearly 23,000 subscribers to The American-Statesman's Weekly Business Review, a financial news supplement that carries the market reports and stock tables the paper dropped from its weekend editions in a money-saving move last year. **********Because few people read the stock tables, The American-Statesman concluded, it would be cheaper to print and deliver a special section of business news and features only for those who requested it. **********From such modest beginnings, the editors of the newspaper, a publication of Cox Enterprises, and those at a handful of other papers hope that one day they may acclimate subscribers to buying a different sort of newspaper service, one that offers varying content according to price. **********According to this thinking, the basic subscription rate would still buy the same multipart paper, with sections devoted to the local news, sports, basic business news and so on, that people are used to today. For an extra 25 or 50 cents a week, however, subscribers would get additional sections devoted to material that is not available in the basic edition, just as cable systems offer premium channels to subscribers who pay higher fees. **********The Nashville Tennessean, a Gannett Company newspaper, has already taken this next step, selling a premium weekly supplement, called World News Extra, to about 4,000 subscribers for an additional 50 cents a week. And if some people will seek out extra business news and pay for expanded world news, some editors and their publishers wonder, might others not be willing to pay an extra 25 or 50 cents a week for an enlarged sports section, or one on gardening, or child rearing, or Hollywood entertainment? **********After all, newspapers already pay for a torrent of material they have no room for -- articles, opinion columns, photographs and features that flow into their newsrooms from news services every day. Like Dr. Pennington's business section, the thinking goes, this highly perishable information could be turned into new weekly sections that earn extra money from subscription fees, as well as from advertisers attracted by the prospect of reaching a targeted audience. **********''When we started this, we saw it as an opportunity to save on the cost of newsprint, but we also see it as an opportunity to go in some new directions,'' Richard Oppel, editor of The American-Statesman, said. ''People are used to paying different rates for cable, and maybe they will do it for their newspaper, too.'' **********The venture is only the latest push in the newspaper industry's efforts to enlarge the number of outlets for the news and information it gathers. **********Papers have developed Internet Web pages, daily fax-delivered editions and even phone services that offer everything from the latest sports scores to crossword puzzle clues for a fee. **********Newspapers have also been printing zoned editions for a generation. For example, The St. Petersburg Times in Florida, which is owned by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism studies center, publishes three different front sections and 10 different local news sections every weekday. And magazines, with the advantage of mail delivery, have been customizing their editions by geographic region or even Congressional district for years. **********But tailored newspaper delivery, also called microzoning or demographic zoning, takes these ideas that much further, to zoning by reader interest. **********''I think there will be a market for the cable television model, but it will be for stuff we are not currently providing readers in the regular papers,'' said Walker Lundy, editor of The St. Paul Pioneer Press, which started a Saturday business section, Market Week, after dropping stock market reports from its Saturday and Sunday papers earlier this year. **********Shortly afterward, Mr. Lundy's main competition, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, began a similar product. Both are delivered only to home subscribers who request them. And at the moment, both are free. **********''We can't say, 'Here's the stuff we've been giving you, but now we want to charge for it,' '' Mr. Lundy said, ''just as a restaurant can't start charging for napkins and plates.'' **********Mr. Lundy said his paper was thinking of expanding such microzoning to other sections, though this thinking was not far enough along to be discussed publicly. **********Microzoning began as an an attack on the problem of the stock tables, those dense pages of tiny print, called agate, that list company stock prices. Few readers bother to read those tables -- as few as 10 percent, in some cities -- yet investors who do read the stock tables say they cannot do without them. **********With newsprint prices rising sharply last year, The American-Statesman decided to eliminate the tables from the Saturday and Sunday papers and instead offer the special Saturday supplement to home-delivery customers on request. The section is not included in street-sale papers. **********For Mr. Oppel and his predecessors at The American-Statesman who developed the idea, the mathematics of this trade-off were simple. Removing six pages of stock market reports from the Saturday paper and four pages from Sunday's issue  saved the 280,000 circulation daily 11.5 tons of newsprint a week. Publishing the 23,000 copies of Weekly Business Review -- consisting of those stock tables plus syndicated market news and analysis obtained at no extra cost from the paper's news services -- consumes about 1.8 tons of paper. The savings: more than 500 tons of newsprint a year, worth at least $350,000. **********Because of the flexibility and efficiency of modern presses, the expenses of printing even a limited run of the weekly section do not put a dent in the savings, Mr. Oppel said. **********Advertisers, meanwhile, have proved eager to buy space in a weekly whose distribution is limited to the sort of people who follow the markets, Todd Mahler, the section's advertising director, said. Brokers, financial planners and luxury car dealers are regular buyers of space, he said. **********The Tennessean began its World News Extra in 1994 and added its own Weekly Market Review in October 1995. The Star Tribune, a Cowles Media Company property, and the Pioneer Press, a Knight-Ridder Inc. publication, followed suit last summer. **********The business sections were a natural first step, Tim J. McGuire, editor of The Star Tribune, said. He and others predicted that an expanded sports section, with hard-to-find news like overseas soccer scores and expanded college and local high school coverage, would probably be the next venture. **********Dr. Pennington, for one, said he would be ready to pay for his weekly business section were it not free.  ''Nobody has time to watch the daily changes in the market, but the weekly section gives me everything I need.'' the surgeon said. ''I would pay a little extra if I had to.'' **********For Mr. Oppel, these questions are not just about opportunities to make money or save money, but also about keeping readers. With tiered pricing, a subscriber could just buy a basic paper and leave the extras to others. **********''A lot of us are worried about whether newspapers are pricing themselves out of the market for the middle-class and lower middle-class readers who have been the traditional core of newspaper readership,'' he said. ''Newspapers should be the center of common experience and a common narrative in our communities. And if we become elite publications, for only the top levels of society, then I think we lose profoundly, and democracy loses, too.'' **********Clearly, selling ''basic or premium'' to newspaper readers will be a tricky task, these editors acknowledge. Beyond the importance of coming up with material that is sufficiently different from a paper's usual fare to merit the extra cost to subscribers, papers that try to sell an enriched mix of articles and pictures are doing so just as other providers are providing more and more information free over the Internet. **********Sid Worob, a Houston wholesale paper and packaging sales executive, said he likes the Austin paper's special section ''because it comes on a weekend, when I have some time to read and because it has a lot of extra features in it. But I would not pay for it. There are too many other places to get the same information.'' **********Simply distributing the special sections also takes some adjustments. The American-Statesman pays its delivery contractors an extra 6 cents for each Weekly Business Review and has trained them to match the number of sections with the number of yellow bags they are issued each Saturday morning. Adding more sections would only add to the complexity, and the cost. **********''I think that the cable TV model has some possibilities, but you have to factor in the realization that tailored distribution is not easy,'' David Green, managing editor of The Tennessean, said. ''The fact that the stock market thing is working in Austin and here shows that there is obviously some promise, but that does not mean that next year there are going to be papers spinning off 15 different sections.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/17/business/two-directors-of-archer-not-running-for-re-election.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1996-09-17", "snippet": "Archer Daniels Midland Co says two former officers of company will step down as directors; planned resignations of John Daniels and Ralph Bruce are latest response to criticism of insider domination of board; company says majority of board will no...", "word_count": 595, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Directors of Archer Not Running for Re-election", "print_headline": "Two Directors of Archer Not Running for Re-election", "body_text": " **********In the latest response to criticism of insider domination of the company's board, the Archer Daniels Midland Company said yesterday that two former officers of the company would step down as directors. **********Archer Daniels, the grain giant based in Decatur, Ill., said in a preliminary proxy statement that John Daniels, a former chairman, and Ralph Bruce, a former executive vice president, would not run for re-election at the company's annual meeting next month. **********The planned resignations are the latest in a series that have been announced by Archer Daniels in the last year. The company contends that as a result of the actions a majority of the board will be independent directors. But some critics contend that the number will be far fewer; many members of the board have close family, personal or business ties to Dwayne O. Andreas, the chairman and chief executive of the company. **********Eight of Archer's 17 directors will step down, and 3 new directors will be added, reducing the board to 12 members. Recommendations for such a change were presented in a report by a corporate governance committee formed at the last annual meeting in October. **********The company's board came under sharp criticism last year, after the public disclosure of a Federal investigation into allegations of price-fixing at Archer Daniels in the market for lysine, a feed additive. Institutional investors have said that the directors were failing to treat the investigation seriously, in large part because of their close ties to management. **********Since then, the investigation, known as Operation Harvest King, has put increased pressure on Archer Daniels. Last month, three giant feed companies agreed to settle criminal charges of price-fixing and testify against Archer Daniels and other participants in the conspiracy. The three producers of lysine agreed to pay $20 million in fines and plead guilty or no contest to a criminal charge stemming from their participation in a scheme to set prices in the $600 million market for the feed additive. **********Prosecutors had told Archer Daniels that the company and two executives -- Michael D. Andreas, the vice chairman and son of Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, the head of corn processing -- could expect to be indicted as soon as today. But, people with knowledge of the situation said, those planned indictments are now on hold for as much as a week as the Government and Archer Daniels attempt to hammer out a settlement for the company. **********To date, four senior managers of Archer Daniels -- including Michael  Andreas -- have agreed to step down from the board. Two other directors resigned because of a new rule that except for the chairman board members not be allowed to run for re-election once they reach the age of 70. **********Despite its attempts to appease investor demand for outside directors, Dwayne Andreas included a letter to shareholders with the proxy stating that in essence outside directors do not matter much. **********Mr. Andreas wrote that an academic study last March found that stock of companies performed better only as the proportion of outside directors rose to 40 percent, and after that little change was noted. That sentiment carried over to the board's recommendations on shareholder resolutions: it opposed a resolution calling for a stricter definition of outside independent directors. **********Three grand juries are investigating accusations that senior Archer Daniels executives conspired with competitors to fix prices for several additives, including lysine, high-fructose corn syrup and citric acid.

Whitacre, a former senior executive at Archer Daniels, agreed to work for several years as a secret Government informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/09/business/company-news-adflex-buys-a-division-of-xyratex-for-56-million.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ADFLEX BUYS A DIVISION OF XYRATEX FOR $56 MILLION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ADFLEX BUYS A DIVISION OF XYRATEX FOR $56 MILLION", "body_text": " **********Adflex Solutions Inc. said yesterday that it had acquired a division of Xyratex Ltd. which supplies interconnect products for computers.

The judge would be tied up for 2,000 years just to try all these cases.\" **********Mr. York said that Philip Morris would ask for a rehearing before the full Florida appeals court, and take the case to the Florida Supreme Court if necessary. **********Opinion varied whether the tobacco companies could win further Florida appeals. **********\"I think it's a given that the Florida Supreme Court will hear this, and they are very conservative,\" Mr. Black said. \"I don't think this is going to come to  trial.\" **********But Mr. Rosenblatt said that \"in my educated guess, the State Supreme Court will decline the appeal, because they accept jurisdiction under very limited circumstances.\" **********The Florida Supreme Court has denied previous tobacco-case appeals, he said,  adding that it was possible the case could go to trial late this year. **********If it does, it could reach a courtroom before a giant class-action case brought in New Orleans by a consortium of nearly 60 law firms that represent plaintiffs. That case, its scale aside, seeks damages only for the effects of addition, not for tobacco-related illness. **********Mr. York said the ruling limiting the lawsuit to Florida was \"in a sense a partial victory, but a statewide class is no more workable than a nationwide class.\" **********And Roy D. Burry, a securities analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said, \"Given the large number of people who might be part of the class, this is hardly a victory for the tobacco companies if it comes to trial in Florida.\" **********Mr. Burry added that \"in the end, I think Engle will come to nothing,\" saying that \"in the meantime, it will limit the performance of tobacco stocks in general and Philip Morris in particular.\" **********The Engle case was brought in May 1994 by Mr. Rosenblatt and his wife, Susan, who are lawyers in Miami, on behalf of Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician, and six other plaintiffs who said they suffered illnesses due to their addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/10/world/quayle-gets-cool-welcome-in-russia.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1996-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 771, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quayle Gets Cool Welcome in Russia", "print_headline": "Quayle Gets Cool Welcome in Russia", "body_text": " **********On his first trip to Russia, former Vice President Dan Quayle discovered that the friendship between this country and the United States is beginning to fray. **********Mr. Quayle, who now lectures and writes a syndicated column, delivered a buoyant speech today about democracy and the future of nuclear security to the Russian Academy of Sciences. But his elderly, distinguished audience of mostly sociologists and historians wanted to teach him a thing or two about international relations. **********You can't tell Russia what its position should be on the NATO issue,\" Grigory L. Bondarevsky, a political scientist, chided. Even though Mr. Quayle had not raised the issue of NATO expansion, Mr. Bondarevsky was one of several specialists who complained about it. **********The political scientist also took Mr. Quayle to task for the United States military aid to Pakistan, for not doing enough to stop Islamic terrorism, and for raising the issue of democracy in Russia while \"failing to bring it up in your relations with China.\" **********\"I was not expecting it,\" Mr. Quayle said afterward. \"I welcomed it. It showed me that there are some very sensitive political issues here.\" **********Mr. Quayle, who said he wanted to acquaint himself with Russia's political climate and gather material for his speeches and columns, arrived in Moscow on Monday for four days of private meetings with Russian politicians and leading public figures, under the auspices of the American University in Moscow. **********But his encounter at the Russian Academy of Sciences gave him a strong dose of the new, somewhat sour mood infecting Russian society. **********\"His speech wasn't too bad,\" Mr. Bondarevsky said grudgingly after the meeting. \"But it was a little simple. It was all right as a campaign speech, but not for here. We expect a higher standard.\" **********In his speech, Mr. Quayle argued that a return to a socialist economy in Russia would only result in \"shared poverty,\" while free market reform would eventually lead to \"greater prosperity.\" **********But Mr. Quayle also offered a brash new proposal for resolving security issues, suggesting that the \"six powers\" of the world -- the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, China and India -- form a new kind of security council to discuss nuclear safety and ways to stop the spread of chemical, biological and atomic weapons. **********Mr. Quayle told his audience, \"This does not mean that the United Nations should be replaced, nor will it prevent any country of acting in its own interest, but it will provide a more effective forum for discussing these crucial issues.\" **********In an interview later, he explained that given the tensions between Russia and the West over expanding NATO to include some of the former Warsaw Pact countries, his plan could help ease Russia's concerns over exclusion. **********\"It gets people thinking about nuclear arrangements and international relationships Russia could and should have,\" he said. \"I wanted to talk about ways to include Russia and emphasize its importance.\" **********American officials in Moscow said they had not previously heard of Mr. Quayle's proposal, and found it \"baffling\" because \"it could lead to a duplication of effort.\" **********But some Russians found it encouraging. \"It's not a bad idea,\" said Sergei Rogov, director of the Institute for USA and Canada studies. **********Mr. Quayle said the six-power security group was an idea he had flirted with  while Vice President, but had not advanced publicly because it was not favored by the Bush Administration.

Big airplane deals are often announced and reanounced, and today the Chinese confirmed an order originally made known two years ago for three larger long-haul A340 jumbo jets, also from Airbus Industrie. Details were not fully disclosed tonight. **********These and earlier inroads by Airbus Industrie, a French-German-British-Spanish consortium, make it the Boeing Company's biggest competitor in China, long an almost captive market for American plane makers. **********Today's Airbus order came a month after China's Trade Minister, Wu Yi, postponed a visit to the United States, where plane manufacturers had hoped for  up to $4 billion in new orders. **********The commercial aircraft business is one that the United States has long dominated; it supports both high-paying manufacturing jobs and advanced technology development. As such, it not only has considerable economic importance, but often assumes a high degree of political significance, as it has in the relationship between the United States and China. **********Asia is the fastest-growing market for passenger aircraft, and Boeing and the other American plane manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, have been  coming under intensifying competition from Airbus. **********The Chinese Government has taken advantage of the competition and has made no secret of its strategy of using aircraft orders as a carrot and a stick in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Mrs. Wu, the Trade Minister, put off her trip to the United States, and the announcement of orders, many of which had been expected to go to Boeing, after the Administration refused her a meeting with President Clinton and refused to delay its consideration of sanctions against China for allowing factories to produce pirated American video cassettes and compact disks. **********One Administration official said tonight in Washington that the Airbus decision would not cause the United States to change its trade policy toward China, or drop its consideration of sanctions. **********\"It appears from reports that much of this involves agreements previously reached,\" the official said of today's order. The official added that \"it would  be improper to draw any conclusions one way or another\" about the deal's effects on the overall relationship between China and the United States. **********Cindy Smith, a Boeing spokeswoman, said: \"We're disappointed in China's decision to purchase Airbus aircraft. But more importantly, the order underscores the need for the United States to move beyond the annual debate of most-favored-nation status for China and to create a long-term stable trading relationship. Boeing supports the Clinton Administration in its efforts to normalize trade between the United States and China. Establishing normal trade with China will lead to job creation and economic gain.\" **********Ron Woodard, president of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said the Airbus order was \"precipitated not because of the strength of our competition or the quality of their product,\" Reuters reported. \"Rather, it is precipitated by  what I believe are ill-founded political considerations,\" he added. **********But Mr. Li did not escape pressure on human rights in Paris. **********French newspapers greeted his arrival with satirical cartoons, and protesters denounced the visit as a sign of European willingness to sacrifice principle for profit. A small rally near the Eiffel Tower demanded that China release political prisoners and end what demonstrators called \"the oppression of Tibet.\" **********For security reasons, the French police kept a tight lid on the Chinese delegation's movements. The Chinese Prime Minister originally intended to go on  to the Netherlands and Luxembourg this weekend, but canceled those visits, saying he was short of time. A visit he made to Germany two years ago was marked by many protests. **********Mr. Li's visit to France also produced a three-year wheat deal, a $460 million French-financed expansion of a car factory in Wuhan that produces Citroen cars for the Chinese market and a $50 million gas-liquefaction plant for Shanghai. An agreement was also reached giving French ships unrestricted access  to Chinese ports. **********But the results amounted to far less than the $10 billion or so in trade deals that the French had hoped for after agreeing two years ago to stop selling arms to Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province. **********Taiwan bought 60 Mirage jet fighters worth about $2.6 billion from France in  1992, on top of a $4.8 billion purchase of 16 naval frigates the previous year,  and Beijing responded by banning Chinese orders from France. **********But now a new, conservative administration under President Jacques Chirac is  eager to establish France as a potential supplier of modern technology to China, and one less squeamish than the United States about doing business with countries that do not live up to Western standards on human rights. **********The French deny a double standard, but are glad to have the business. **********\"Will we sacrifice human rights for trade?\" asked Foreign Minister de Charette before Mr. Li's visit began. \"That's out of the question.\" But Jean-Pierre Desgeorges, president of a French-Chinese industrial trade group, said he did not plan to raise the question of human rights during the visit at all. \"I'm a businessman,\" he said. **********Still, French officials said the signing of the plane deal tonight was delayed for two hours by a disagreement over Mr. Juppe's plan to bring up human rights during his dinner speech. In the end, Mr. Juppe did not touch on the subject, The Associated Press reported, but the two sides refused to exchange toasts. **********For some French intellectuals, however, Mr. Li's presence spoke for itself. **********\"Mr. Li recovers his lost honor today,\" an essay in Tuesday's issue of Le Monde said. \"But do those who govern us realize they are sacrificing theirs, and ours as well?\" **********Le Monde said the essay was written by \"several senior officials who have filled posts in Asia,\" but published under a pseudonym. **********About 50 supporters of Amnesty International stretched a white banner across  the Champs-Elysees reading: \"Li Peng ignores human rights. We don't.\" French policemen quickly removed it, and barred demonstrators from approaching the Chinese Embassy on Avenue Georges V. **********With unemployment in France at 11.8 percent, and in Germany at 10.8 percent,  both countries have been outdoing each other in soliciting job-generating trade  orders from Asia's largest market. It is especially important for the aircraft industry, which President Chirac regards as crucial for maintaining European technological competitiveness with the United States in world trade. Mr. Chirac  planned to have lunch with Mr. Li on Thursday. **********Jacques Rummelhardt, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said, \"France, as the world's fourth-largest exporter, doesn't have the position in China that it should have.\" **********On Saturday Mr. Li is to visit the plant near Toulouse where the Airbus planes are made. Airbus Industrie received more orders for new planes than Boeing did in 1994, but last year secured only 106 orders, worth $7 billion, compared with Boeing's 346 orders, worth $31 billion. **********French Foreign Ministry officials said negotiations were continuing on a possible purchase of 28 electric locomotives from the Alsthom group, an aluminum plant and other projects before Mr. Li returns to China on Saturday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/01/business/strike-cuts-circulation-at-2-detroit-papers.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1996-10-01", "snippet": "Circulation at two striking Detroit newspapers has declined by more than 30 percent since workers went on strike in July 1995; both newspaper management and union officials see figures as victories for their sides; Detroit Free Press and Detroit N...", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strike Cuts Circulation at 2 Detroit Papers", "print_headline": "Strike Cuts Circulation at 2 Detroit Papers", "body_text": " **********Circulation at the two striking Detroit newspapers has declined by more than 30 percent since workers went on strike in July 1995, according to the first audited subscriber figures since the strike, released yesterday. **********Both the newspaper management and the union officials contended that the numbers, for the first quarter of 1996, were victories for their sides. **********For the period ended March 31, The Detroit Free Press, the morning newspaper owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., had a average daily circulation of 251,438, a 32 percent decline compared with the corresponding period last year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. For The Detroit News, the evening newspaper owned by the Gannett Company, circulation declined by 34 percent over the same period, to 225,260. **********Circulation for the newspapers' combined Sunday issue, published under a joint operating agreement, fell 29 percent, to 769,594, during the most recent quarter compared with last year. **********Not all of the decline can be attributed to the strike, however. Like most newspapers, the Detroit papers have been losing subscribers for years. The audit figures, for example, show that The Free Press has lost 222,191 readers since the first quarter of 1992, and The News has lost 184,156 readers since then. **********According to the editors of both papers, the numbers for the most recent quarter show that the 14-month-old strike has not crippled them the way the unions contend. ''Obviously if we lose, for the moment at least, 30 percent of circulation, that has a huge impact, but equally obvious is the fact that 60 to 70 percent of the community has opted to buy these newspapers,'' said Robert G. McGruder, executive editor of The Free Press. **********The editor and publisher of The Detroit News, Robert H. Giles, said  the newspapers have been gaining circulation since the audit. ''The numbers don't really reflect what the circulation of these two newspapers is right now. Circulation has been increasing week by week over the past several months and will continue to grow,'' Mr. Giles said. **********Union officials maintained that the numbers told a different story. Gary W. Horton, a regional director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that the newspapers continued to lose advertising, which drives revenue, as circulation remained significantly below pre- strike levels and as the six striking unions, which represent about 2,500 workers, continued to boycott businesses advertising in the papers. Mr. Horton said, ''We think they are in bad trouble, and the largest advertising period of the year is coming up and we will continue to try to get advertisers to pull out, and so we see it being a very, very bad year for them again.'' **********Mr. McGruder noted that at The Free Press, advertising revenue has rebounded to 85 to 90 percent of what it was before the strike. But Mr. Horton said the newspapers have had to cut ad rates because of the circulation decline. **********''They are doing reasonably well on the Sunday paper but their daily advertising is not going well,'' Mr. Horton said, adding that he doubted either paper could achieve 90 percent of prestrike advertising revenue ''when we have, I think, 1,400 advertisers who are not advertising.'' **********The unions struck on July 13, 1995, over wages and the company's right to offer buyouts to 100 unionized production and distribution workers over three years and to 500 more workers by 2004. **********The Audit Bureau of Circulations did not report circulation for the second, third and fourth quarters of 1995 because of the strike. **********Newspapers across the country have been paying close attention to the strike, as consolidation continues throughout the industry. The country's daily newspapers have slashed some 6,000 jobs in the last two years without a major labor dispute."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/23/business/avant-in-153-million-stock-deal-for-meta-software.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-23", "snippet": "Avant Corp, maker of computer design software, agrees to buy Meta-Software Inc for about $153 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AVANT IN $153 MILLION STOCK DEAL FOR META-SOFTWARE", "print_headline": "AVANT IN $153 MILLION STOCK DEAL FOR META-SOFTWARE", "body_text": " **********The Avant Corporation, a maker of computer design software, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Meta-Software Inc. of Campbell, Calif., for about $153 million in stock.

As the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda begins genocide trials in Arusha, Tanzania, Mr. Akayesu is the first man in the dock. **********He has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges, including genocide, murder and crimes against humanity. **********Mr. Akayesu, a 43-year-old Hutu, is not the highest official in the former Rwanda Government to face charges. Nor is he considered to be the main architect of the horror that racked this Central African country from April to June 1994, in which at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed. **********But to the people who survived Mr. Akayesu's reign of terror, it hardly matters. They say he wielded absolute power in this commune, going to extraordinary lengths to hunt down and kill Tutsi. **********''He was giving the orders and he was writing the names of people who were supposed to be killed,'' said Emmanuel Ndavisaba, a 39-year-old Tutsi farmer who survived. ''Doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers. Many, many, many people died because of Akayesu.'' **********Survivors said Mr. Akayesu exhorted Hutu militia members to hack thousands of Tutsi to death with hammers and machetes and to dump their bodies in mass graves just 50 yards from his office. Searching out Tutsi intellectuals, he tortured Hutu men and women who tried to hide people from the killers, they said. **********As the violence got under way in early April 1994, Mr. Akayesu, a former teacher, also rushed from place to place to deliver incendiary speeches to Hutu, witnesses said. **********''Akayesu said go and kill the Tutsi men, because they are the ones who make children, and if you come across a woman who is pregnant, rip the baby from her belly,'' said Bernadette Ntakirutinka, a 60-year-old Hutu who said she was tortured because she hid Tutsi. ''He said they have to go to each and every house, and kill them one by one.'' **********$(As the trial opened on Thursday, a defense lawyer said he would ask for a postponement, arguing that he had not had the resources to prepare an adequate defense, The Associated Press reported. The court is to rule on the request on Friday.$) **********What happened in Taba opens a window on the inner workings of the mass killing throughout Rwanda in 1994. The Hutu militias -- known as the interhamwe -- were not the majority here, but they had the full backing of local politicians like Mr. Akayesu, survivors said. **********When the killings started, many of Taba's Tutsi flocked to the town hall to see Mr. Akayesu, believing he would stop the carnage, survivors said. Instead, they added, most of the people who sought refuge at his offices were slain in the parking lot while he watched, the survivors said. **********''When the killings started, the people believed the enemy was the interhamwe, the militia,'' said Ephrem Karangwa, the current Mayor of Taba. ''Mr. Akayesu gathered all the villagers and told them that the common enemy was no longer the interhamwe, but the Tutsi.'' **********As a prominent Tutsi and a police investigator, Mr. Karangwa was among the first to be selected as targets by Mr. Akayesu's militia. **********Running from killers who burned his house to the ground, Mr. Karangwa said, he witnessed the deaths of his three brothers at the hands of Mr. Akayesu and the militia. Mr. Karangwa, who was hiding in a banana field nearby, later escaped by bribing a policeman to hide him. **********In addition to being mayor, Mr. Akayesu was the local head of the Democratic Republican Party, a Hutu party that opposed the Government of former President Juvenal Habyarimana, also a Hutu. **********On April 6, 1994, Mr. Habyarimana died in a suspicious plane crash after signing a power-sharing agreement with Tutsi rebels, who had been fighting a civil war with the Hutu-led Government since 1991. Hutu hard-liners seized control of the country that day and gave the militia the go-ahead to begin killing Tutsi civilians. **********Still, the mass killing did not start until 12 days later in Taba, which is in the central prefecture of Gitarama. At first, survivors said, Mr. Akayesu refused to allow the militia to operate in his township and even imprisoned some militia leaders. **********Then on April 18, after a meeting of local mayors in Gitarama, they said Mr. Akayesu abruptly changed his stance and became a vocal supporter of genocide. That night, a group of militiamen in Taba killed a prominent Tutsi teacher, Sylvere Karera. The next morning, Mr. Akayesu held a town meeting that turned out to be a turning point for the community, residents said. **********Instead of calling for peace, as many people had expected, the Mayor condoned the killing of Mr. Karera and called on Hutu to begin killing ''accomplices'' to the Tutsi rebels, residents recalled. He specifically named three prominent Tutsi for death, they said. One of them was Mr. Karangwa. **********For the next two days, survivors said, Mr. Akayesu was a one-man scourge. Dressed in a military uniform and armed with a pistol, they said he led gangs of killers in search of Tutsi families and gave speeches in which he promised land to Hutu who killed Tutsi. **********In the indictment, he is charged with torturing people accused of harboring Tutsi, of ordering the slaying of eight Tutsi men who fled to the town hall, and of overseeing the killings of five schoolteachers in the parking lot. He is also accused of personally shooting to death one of Mr. Karangwa's brothers. **********At Mr. Akayesu's urging, the militia set up roadblocks and killed scores of people every day for weeks, according to survivors. Some people, they said, were reduced to paying the militia for bullets to avoid being killed by machete. **********Mr. Akayesu fled Rwanda at the end of June 1994, just before a Tutsi rebel army rolled into Gitarama. He escaped to Zaire, then went to Zambia, where the authorities arrested him in Lusaka in October 1995. The tribunal indicted him in February, and he was extradited to Tanzania to stand trial. **********Mrs. Ntakirutinka, 60, said she was tortured on the evening of April 19. A Hutu who was married to a Tutsi, Mrs. Ntakirutinka had hidden three Tutsi women and some children in her home. **********She said Mr. Akayesu showed up at 9 P.M. that night with several men. They dragged her out to the road, beat her, forced her face down on the ground, stood on her neck and wrenched her arms behind her back. **********Later they threatened to run over her with a car, unless she told where her Tutsi friends were hiding. She refused. Her friends escaped out the back of her house, but were later captured and killed. **********Mrs. Ntakirutinka, whose husband and two grandchildren were killed, said she had decided to help the Tutsi women after hearing Mr. Akayesu's speech that morning. **********''I was born among human beings,'' she said.

Mostly Abu", "body_text": " **********To address an Iraqi properly, it is a good idea to know more than his name. **********Take Salam, a 39-year-old driver. Since his first-born son is named Ali, he is properly called Abu Ali, or the father of Ali, following a custom that stands on its head the Russian approach, under which Boris N. Yeltsin, as the son of Nikolai, becomes Boris Nikolayevich. **********But in Iraq, that is only the beginning. **********Before Ali was born, Salam was called Abu Ahmed, meaning the father of Ahmed, even though he was not a father at all. His childless friend Khalid was and still is known as Abu Walid. And by the time he reaches his late teens, young Ali will become Abu Hussein. **********Confused? You might well be, especially if you have not been a regular listener of one of Iraq's most popular radio programs, which has been broadcast for 26 years under the title ''Your Name Is Your Address.'' **********''It took me years and years to finally begin to feel that I understand how the system works,'' said Zuheir al-Qaissi, the host of the program, who added proudly, ''Iraqis love the kunia.'' **********In its simplest version, the kunia, an Arabic word that is impossible to translate, remains part of many Arab societies. A Palestinian or Syrian man tends to be known to close friends as the Abu of his eldest son; their wives, in turn, are known as Um. In Egypt, where wealthier city dwellers now shun the practice, Abu and Um still resonate in the conversations of the poor. **********And because it is often presumed that a Palestinian man will name his first son after his father, a son of Mohammed might be addressed in turn as Abu Mohammed even before that grandson is born. **********But Iraqis, scholars say, have come to apply the kunia far more extensively than anyone else, and ordinary Iraqis can cite the pairings by rote. Many lie rooted in Islamic history, both familiar and oblique. **********From the time he is 20 or so, for instance, every Mohammed is also Abu Jassim, because the Prophet Mohammed's son was called Jassim. Every Ali is Abu Hussein because the Prophet's son-in-law, Ali, named his son Hussein. **********Every Omar will be called Abu Khattab after the Prophet Mohammed's companion, the second caliph, Omar bin al-Khattab. And every Tariq is known as Abu Ziyad, after Tariq ibn Ziyad, the great Muslim conqueror of Spain. **********What is now Baghdad stood for more than 500 years as the capital of the Islamic empire, from the 8th century to the 13th, a reason that Mr. Qaissi, the radio host, who is also a prominent philologist, and other experts here cite as explanation for the fact that names with religious roots remain unusually common. **********But the kunia in fact dates back even to the pre-Islamic tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, according to Sheik Jalal al-Hanafi, a religious leader who is the author of the eight-volume Glossary of the Colloquial Language of Baghdad. **********''The Arab tribes regarded it as socially inappropriate to call men or women directly by unvarnished first names,'' Sheik Hanafi said, ''and Iraq has maintained many of those tribal traditions.'' **********The practice has become so deeply rooted that Iraqis even use synonyms or play word games to create kunias for names with no religious meaning. **********A man whose name is Hussam, a classical word for sword, might be called Abu Saif, based on the more colloquial word for the weapon. A man called Assad, or lion, might be  called Abu Sarhan, using the more poetic word for the beast. **********In the hands of Iraqis, even modern names that mean little or nothing at all can be transformed with minor reshuffling, so that Faris, for example, becomes Abu al-Fawares. Because Iraq remains a male-dominated society, the kunias assigned to Iraqi women tend to be less elaborate, even though it still considered particularly unseemly for a stranger to address a woman by her first name. **********A namesake of the Prophet's daughter, Fatima, would be known as Um Zahra, a name by which Fatima was also known. But more commonly, women are known according to the names of their eldest sons, even if their first-born children are girls. **********''In a society with strong family ties, it is important for an Iraqi to be identified as the father or the mother of somebody,'' Sheik Hanafi said in a conversation in the court of Al Khulafa mosque in the heart of Baghdad. ''It is a matter of traditions,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/09/world/britons-losing-taste-for-the-royals.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1996-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 841, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britons Losing Taste for 'the Royals'", "print_headline": "Britons Losing Taste for 'the Royals'", "body_text": " **********The letter to the editor in The Independent last Tuesday attacked the Prince  of Wales in no uncertain terms. It said the person \"likely to be our next monarch\" was a hypocrite: a man who \"spoke his marriage vows before millions of  people and shortly afterwards committed adultery.\" A man who professes worry about the environment yet drives \"a large gas guzzling motor car.\" And who \"claims concern about wildlife while killing animals for sport.\" **********The letter ended on a plaintive, almost poignant note: \"How can anyone reasonably be expected to have respect for him and the institution he represents? The Prince of Wales has badly let down those like myself who would,  on balance, sooner have the monarchy than any of the alternatives likely to be on offer.\" **********After four years of undignified, sometimes scandalous behavior on the part of younger members of the House of Windsor, ordinary Britons are questioning the role of the monarchy in national life more than at any time this century. Perhaps the time has come, many are saying, to cut back on the power and perks of \"the royals.\" **********Most Britons are a long way from turning into republicans. But polls suggest  that increasing numbers are beginning to think the once unthinkable; a decade ago, the question \"Do you think the country would be worse off without the royals?\" brought a cascade of affirmative replies, a ratio of 15 to 1. By last month, that ratio had dropped to 2 to 1. **********More worrisome for the royal family is the fact that while the elder members, like the Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth II, rank high in public esteem, the younger ones, especially the heir, Prince Charles, do not. (His approval rating  was 41 percent in last month's poll, taken for The Independent on Sunday, compared to 74 percent for the Queen.) **********And with nothing but negative publicity looming on the horizon, there is little prospect that those ratings will be rising anytime soon. Former lovers of both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York are reliably reported to be trying to peddle their stories for large sums. And the divorce negotiations between Prince Charles and Princess Diana hit the headlines every other day. **********What is most remarkable about the national debate, considering that any discussion of the monarchy soon strikes at the heart of Britain's unwritten but  nonetheless powerful constitution, is that it is happening in newspaper columns, radio interviews, and conversations in pubs and over dinner tables, but not in the great debating club known as Parliament. **********On Thursday afternoon, the Prime Minister's \"question time,\" a 15-minute free-for-all in which John Major takes questions from any quarter about any topic, was devoted to the peace process in Northern Ireland, stiffer sentences for violent criminals, a possible cut in interest rates, visas for Hong Kong residents, and how much the national lottery will actually pay the lowest winners. While these are all matters that register on the national consciousness they do not compare to to the obsession with what is going on in Buckingham Palace. **********Some members of Parliament point out that there is a strong convention against mentioning the Queen in the House of Commons -- strictly speaking, it is against invoking the Queen's view to bolster or attack an argument -- and that this seems to act as a general taboo against making pronouncements about royalty in the chamber. **********But there is nothing to prevent a full-fledged debate if the Government and the opposition leadership choose to have one. This was the gist of a ruling on Tuesday by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd, when a frustrated left-leaning Labor back-bencher asked if there were any rules to prevent one. **********It is extremely unlikely that either Mr. Major or Tony Blair, the Labor leader, will embrace the idea. Mr. Major's Conservatives are so overwhelmingly in favor of the monarchy that the mere idea of debating it would strike most as heretical. And the Labor Party, which is on record as favoring the elimination of hereditary peers in the House of Lords, sees no gain in picking a fight on an issue that might brand it as a bunch of radical republicans out of step with middle England. **********\"The majority of people in this country support the monarchy,\" noted Peter Mandelson, a Labor M.P. and major party strategist. \"It's bad politics to put yourself on the wrong side of that argument. There is no serious republican movement.\" **********The point was driven home last week when a member of the Labor shadow cabinet, Ron Davies, criticized Prince Charles in a BBC interview, saying he was not fit to become king and deriding him as someone who talked to plants one moment and indulged in blood sports the next. Mr. Blair ordered Mr. Davies, who  would become Welsh secretary in a Labor Government, to issue an immediate apology, which he did. Labor spokespeople said it was the personal nature of his remarks, rather than the republican sentiment, that caused umbrage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/12/world/spies-can-t-even-trust-the-other-side-anymore.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Weiner", "pub_date": "1996-11-12", "snippet": "US arrests 50-year-old former Soviet spy, Vladimir Galkin, for allegedly trying to steal secrets about Star Wars anti-missile program five years ago; arrest on October 29 at Kennedy International Airport has infuriated Kremlin and raised likelihoo...", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spies Can't Even Trust the Other Side Anymore", "print_headline": "Spies Can't Even Trust the Other Side Anymore", "body_text": " **********In the cold war, spying was a game with unwritten rules. American and Soviet spies did not kill one another. An American arrested for espionage in Moscow was shipped home, not to the gulag. **********And since the cold war ended and the two spy services began gingerly collaborating on things like counterterrorism, bygones have mostly been bygones. Once someone hung up his cloak and sheathed his dagger, he was out of the game for good. **********But then a 50-year-old retired Russian spy -- who was relaxed enough to note his former profession on his visa application -- walked off a jet at Kennedy International Airport and into the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********The former spy, Vladimir Galkin, stands accused of trying to steal secrets about the ''Star Wars'' program five years ago. His arrest on Oct. 29 has infuriated the Kremlin  and raised the likelihood that Russia may grab some happily retired C.I.A. man in retaliation. **********The F.B.I.'s spycatchers are not saying much about the case, although several counterintelligence experts, including a retired top official of the bureau, Phil Parker, said they could not recall one quite like it. **********But the Russian foreign intelligence service is saying plenty. **********''A dirty trick,'' its spokeswoman, Tatyana Samolis, said in one of several angry statements from the formerly fearsome spy service once known as the K.G.B. The arrest broke ''the unwritten practice of civilized relations between special services,'' she said, adding: ''The U.S. authorities responsible for this provocative act have not yet put their cloaks and daggers away. Former U.S. intelligence agents who visit Russia will not thank the F.B.I. for this.'' **********The facts, as best they can be determined, fit the pattern of a post-cold-war tale of intrigue, or an intriguing farce. **********In 1992, after the great iceberg of the Soviet Union broke up, Mr. Galkin ended an undistinguished career as a spy, highlighted by his expulsion from Portugal in 1986. He had been a member of the K.G.B.'s Directorate T, which stole foreign technology secrets. In that job, he had a meeting in 1991 on Cyprus with an American computer wizard named Subrahmanyam M. Kota, then an employee of Data General Corporation. **********And at that meeting, according to court documents and the F.B.I., Mr. Galkin offered Mr. Kota $10,000 for each of three sensitive reports from  symposiums on ''Star Wars'' programs and other military projects. **********Mr. Kota was paid to steal secrets for his Soviet handler, Mr. Galkin. But after Mr. Galkin retired, in October 1992, Mr. Kota had the misfortune to meet with a man who asked him if he was interested in ''renewing his relationship'' with the K.G.B. Unfortunately for Mr. Kota, that man worked for the F.B.I. **********Two years went by before Mr. Kota realized he was caught up in a sting. In 1994, he was charged with conspiring to steal and sell a secret formula -- not for weapons, but for a microorganism made from genetically engineered hamster ovaries and used to increase human production of red blood cells. Mr. Kota, faced with the damning evidence of his own words and deeds, pleaded guilty. **********The case also led to the indictment in Boston of a scientist named Aluru J. Prasad, on charges of trying to steal military secrets for Russia in cahoots with Mr. Kota and his masters in Moscow. **********The evidence at his trial showed that Mr. Prasad was an incompetent spy, spending thousands of dollars on invariably futile attempts to steal things like the secret ingredients used to paint ''Stealth'' warplanes. The Federal judge in the case declared a mistrial in August after ruling that there was scant evidence to prove an overarching conspiracy. A retrial is scheduled for Dec. 9. **********Unfortunately for Mr. Galkin and his plans for retirement from the great game of espionage, he was identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, implicated by sworn statements filed by Mr. Kota as part of his guilty plea. **********So when Mr. Galkin -- now a businessman with a joint Russian-American company called Knowledge Express -- applied on Oct. 14 for a visa to visit the United States and duly listed his prior employment, the F.B.I. took notice. A warrant for his arrest was issued on Oct. 24, the day his visa application was granted. **********Nothing in the warrant states that Mr. Galkin is still a spy. But when he stepped off his flight at Kennedy five days later, en route to a law enforcement conference as part of an official Russian delegation, he found himself dealing more directly with the law than he had planned. **********His arrest set off considerable muttering among his fellow former K.G.B. officers. ''There exist certain rules of this game, a gentleman's agreement,'' Nikolai Leonov, a retired top K.G.B. official, said in an interview published on Sunday in  The Moscow Tribune, an English-language newspaper. ''Let us remain gentlemen. Let us stick to the rules and follow our codes of honor.'' **********Those rules, it appears, have been undergoing some revision since the cold war ended. **********''When I was in Moscow, we worked to define the rules of that game,'' Thomas R. Pickering, United States Ambassador to Russia until he stepped down on Nov. 1, said last week after Mr. Galkin's arrest.

Conclusions are often reached by interpreting conflicting data and resorting to the logic of a ''high probability'' of being right. The public hates that uncertainty, especially when seeking definitive answers to questions that might affect people's health or the environment. Scientists also wish the uncertainty wasn't there. **********So, too, do business executives. They must listen to the same equivocation about the possible effects of products or processes and then say, ''Let's go with it'' or ''Let's go back to the drawing board.'' **********When ''let's go with it'' turns out to be the wrong decision -- when the high probability turns out to be not high enough -- there is hell to pay. And lots of people, both suppliers and users, may pay it. **********For a product with trivial benefits, the correct answer is to act only when there is virtual certainty of no adverse effects. But when potential gains are substantial, as with an important new drug or a breakthrough consumer product, the delays in waiting for virtual certainty can be just as unconscionable as proceeding without addressing the risks. **********Over the years, regulatory processes and internal company controls have struck a reasonable balance between progress and risk. But regulatory approval of a product does not necessarily mean public acceptance if opposition groups mount campaigns against it. There are vast opportunities for better serving the public if the advocates on both sides -- the product suppliers and those who propose to represent the public -- discuss the issues, sometimes even before the regulatory process begins. They can examine the benefits and the limitations of science,  what is known and what is not knowable. Of course, producers shouldn't use those limitations as an excuse for failures, and opponents shouldn't use them to say ''gotcha.'' **********Scorched-earth combativeness by either group no longer assures success. Both sides are now too skilled in their advocacy to gain much advantage. But those same skills, applied collaboratively to real public advocacy, would pay dividends. **********Some business people argue that discussions during a product's development stage give the potential opposition an early opportunity to marshal its forces. A telling cartoon once showed a painter on a billboard, writing ''Introducing the New. . . . '' Before the painter could finish naming the product, opponents waiting on the ground unfurled their own incomplete banner: ''Ban the. . . . '' But there is much to be gained by painting from the same brush, by learning from each other without assuming evil intent. **********Companies are not foolish; they know that to be successful, their products must perform and give value. They must also take into early account the views of those who ultimately must approve. **********Few pharmaceutical companies, for example, would embark on a several-year clinical trial toward Food and Drug Administration approval of a new drug without consulting the F.D.A. about the scope of the trial. Likewise, consumer products companies would be unwise to introduce unfamiliar technology without market testing. It is not a long stretch, then, for business to ask for the views of the ''shadow approvers,'' those who may rise later in opposition, with the results as potentially devastating as the failure to receive regulatory or user approval. **********In the past, these requests did not prove very profitable. As a recent chief executive of a leading science-based company, I well remember asking a vocal opponent of agricultural biotechnology to come learn about our programs some seven or eight years into their development, a few years before we were ready to submit the data to the Environmental Protection Agency for approval. **********''Very promising work,'' she said, ''but it needs more research so we can all feel comfortable.'' **********I asked her how many more years of tests she thought would be needed. **********''Oh, about 15 or so,'' she said. **********''And why is that?'' I asked, stunned by her answer. **********A smiling nod was my only clue to the real agenda: stopping the programs regardless of what she heard. **********Recently, however, there have been promising signs that some companies and consumer advocates are recognizing that hardened viewpoints no longer make sense. The public has become more confused and less trusting of opinions on all sides. The time is ripe for detente -- a recognition that maybe, just maybe, there are insights to be gained from listening carefully to each other's views, that flexibility doesn't necessarily mean caving in. **********In some industries, particularly those in consumer products, some fledgling efforts at collaboration are  under way. But progress has been painfully slow as motives are still often treated with much distrust. **********Collaboration, however, works to everyone's advantage. There is much to be gained from mutual understanding of the frailties and benefits of science -- from understanding the gaps in the data, but agreeing on the chasms of need that science can help fill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/01/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-agency-switch-for-keds-account.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Agency Switch For Keds Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Agency Switch For Keds Account", "body_text": " **********The Stride Rite Corporation has unexpectedly ended its relationship with Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York on the account of its Keds brand of casual footwear after almost two years.

Morgan Government Bond Index. For the first five months of the year, Italy posted a total return in local currency of 9.4 percent. This was followed by Spain, with a 6.7 percent return so far this year, and Sweden with 4.6 percent. **********The major markets, by contrast, fared less well. In the United States, the return declined 2.6 percent, and Japan and Germany eked out gains of less than 1 percent. **********There have been two elements to the rally in the peripheral European markets, which is driven by so-called \"hot\" money seeking maximum return. **********One is a conviction that the European Union will form a monetary union by the end of the decade and that even countries not immediately eligible for membership will follow orthodox policies that will make them eligible. **********This policy convergence translates into lower economic and financial risk and, in turn, means that investors will be willing to accept less of a premium relative to the benchmark German interest rates. **********So far this year the spread, or difference, between yields on Italian bonds and German 10-year government paper has dropped to 315 basis points from 472 basis points in January. In Spain, the spread has dropped to 269 basis points from 360, and in Sweden it has fallen to 194 from 229. **********The second element is the exchange rate. If, as has often been the case, Italian bond purchases had been made by borrowing Deutsche marks, the 9.4 percent gain would have widened to 19.6 percent, the Morgan report showed. The comparable gain in Sweden would have been 9.9 percent, and in Spain, 7.2 percent. **********Did these currencies gain against the Deutsche mark because the hot money was moving into the bond markets, or was money moving out of the Deutsche mark because of disillusionment with Germany? There is no obvious answer, other than to note that the German currency this year is down almost across the board, with the exception of South Africa, Switzerland, Finland and Belgium. **********But with the Bundesbank stating that the mark's decline in Europe has run its course and with industrialists in Italy and Britain beginning to complain that their currency appreciations are impeding competitiveness, there is some doubt as to whether the mark can sink any further. **********Investors in the peripheral European markets have good reason to remain there because for the moment they are earning higher current income than is available elsewhere. **********But what nags analysts is the worry about what happens when \u2014 and if \u2014 these relatively thin bond and currency markets are hit by sales as the hot money decides to move out at the same time. **********\"While our economic views still support\" investments in the European high-yielding bonds and currencies, \"the massive move into some of these trades by the investment community has greatly raised the risk of profit-taking,\" said Jan Loeys, a Morgan analyst. **********He advised \"lowering overall risk and shifting exposures away from positions that are most vulnerable to profit-taking\" by reducing positions and focusing on shorter-term paper. **********Michael Dell, an analyst at UBS, also advised caution, noting that \"the European spread markets are becoming increasingly dependent on fundamental domestic influences to drive outperformance rather than cyclical factors related to rallying core markets or favorable currency conditions.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/16/world/world-news-briefs-sudan-lifts-flight-ban-on-food-to-rebel-area.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Sudan Lifts Flight Ban On Food to Rebel Area", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Sudan Lifts Flight Ban On Food to Rebel Area", "body_text": " **********The Government of the Sudan has agreed to allow the World Food Program to fly a C-130 cargo plane over its territory for the rest of this month to drop emergency food supplies in a southern province where half a million people are in danger of starvation. **********The province, Bahr el Ghazal, is under the control of rebels, and the Sudan had feared the planes could be used to supply them with weapons. **********Sylvana Foa, the United Nations spokeswoman, said today that the Sudan had lifted its 10-month-old ban for July, a critical month when home-grown food supplies are at their lowest.

Yet it also sounded  a conciliatory tone by asking Taiwan residents to hold on to the notion of \"one  China\" that both Communist and Nationalist authorities have embraced since their civil war ended in 1949 with the Nationalists fleeing to Taiwan. **********\"Neither changes in the way in which Taiwan leaders are produced nor their result can change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China's territory,\" the agency reported. \"We place our hopes on the Taiwan people and ardently call on all Chinese, including Taiwan compatriots, to join hands and make unremitting efforts to oppose separatism and 'Taiwan independence.' \" **********The agency also asserted that China's efforts to affect the voting had succeeded, noting pointedly that the 21 percent won by the Democratic Progressive Party, the most anti-mainland of all parties, was a drop from the 41 percent it won in local elections in 1993 and the 33 percent it won in an election in 1995. **********\"China's opposition to separatism and 'Taiwan independence' has demonstrated  the Chinese people's firm determination to safeguard their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and thus dealt a heavy blow to the 'Taiwan independence' and separatist forces,\" the report said. **********Having worked hard to discredit Mr. Lee and intimidate voters during the campaign by holding war games off the coast of Taiwan, Beijing appeared to achieve the opposite of its intended result. Many Taiwan voters rallied to Mr. Lee, they said, precisely because China threatened him so blatantly. **********Although Mr. Lee's victory might appear to be a humiliating embarrassment for Beijing, its restrained response suggested that the election itself, while not likely to spur China into military conflict, would also not necessarily cause a  retreat from its confrontational stand either. **********Instead, analysts and diplomats said, the issue of paramount concern for China's leaders is how Mr. Lee acts in the coming days and weeks. **********\"What Lee does now is critical,\" said Tai Ming Cheung, a China analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong. \"They are going to watch him very carefully.\" **********If Mr. Lee responds with conciliation, and tones down his efforts to elevate  Taiwan's international stature, then China's leaders may step back and be willing to resume meetings about opening direct mail and travel routes between Taiwan and mainland China, he said. **********But if Mr. Lee snubs Beijing and presses even harder what it sees as moves toward greater independence, Mr. Cheung and others said, Chinese leaders may well take military action. **********\"If Lee does the very things Beijing has told him not to, Beijing will feel it has to cross over from a show of force to use of force,\" Mr. Cheung said. **********Before the voting was complete, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen voiced China's hard line, blaming the current tension with Taiwan on \"foreign forces\" and those in Taiwan advocating independence, and warning that military action was still an option. **********\"We have never undertaken to give up the use of force,\" the New China News Agency quoted Mr. Qian as saying. \"This is not directed against the Taiwan compatriots, but against foreign forces attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs and make intrusions, and those on the island trying to bring about 'Taiwan independence.' \" **********Mr. Qian, speaking at a meeting on Hong Kong's hand-over to China next year,  reiterated China's position that it would offer Taiwan autonomy under the same \"one country, two systems\" formula that was drawn up for Hong Kong, which will be a British colony for only 15 more months. **********Mr. Qian's reference to \"foreign forces\" was clearly pointed at the United States, which has dispatched two aircraft carrier battle groups to the western Pacific near Taiwan. **********While Beijing's leaders might worry that news of a direct election of Taiwan's President would encourage mainlanders to question why they cannot chose their own leaders, democracy is clearly not as much of a concern as independence. **********\"They've never objected to the election itself,\" said a European diplomat. \"It's Lee's push toward independence that caused this whole crisis, from their point of view.\" **********Even though Taiwan has lived separately from China since 1949, Beijing sees the possibility of Taiwan's asserting itself as setting a dangerous example for  other parts of mainland China. **********\"They see it not just as an issue of Taiwan, but of China's future,\" said Mr. Cheung. \"If the same thing can happen in Tibet and Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,  that's the end of China in their minds.\" **********The New China News Agency report took a more optimistic approach. **********\"The call for ending the state of hostility and developing the relations across the Taiwan Strait is increasingly surging on Taiwan Island,\" the report said. \"The facts show that the broad masses of the people in Taiwan demand stability and cast aside 'Taiwan independence.' \""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/17/business/rig-count-up-to-707.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rig Count Up to 707", "print_headline": "Rig Count Up to 707", "body_text": " **********The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States jumped by 12 this week, to 707, Baker Hughes Inc. said today.

And to top it off, it can't even decide which way to jump. In a single day, Wednesday, the Dow industrials dropped 78 points,  then thought better of it and ended with a gain of 53. It was, in fact, the first time that \"circuit breakers\" -- put in place after the '87 crash to cool traders off if they sent the Dow up or down 50 points -- kicked in from both sides. Could it be that stock prices, weary of these lofty heights, want to ease off a bit -- but just can't, with all that money pouring into mutual funds? It was reported last week that $23 billion went into equity mutual funds in April,  the second-highest ever. **********SETTLING **********But What Is a Derivative? It's somehow fitting that when Bankers Trust and Procter & Gamble settled their  noisy derivatives spat last week, it was a mystery who got how much. The whole issue, after all, was whether P.&G. really understood the derivatives it was buying. (Does anyone really understand them?) And now confusion continues, with  Procter & Gamble saying the bank has forgiven 83 percent of a $200 million debt, while the bank's side puts it at 74 percent. It seemed clear, though, that Procter & Gamble did well -- that Bankers Trust got edgy about going to trial this month after disclosure of those notorious \"Business Week tapes,\" on which traders boasted about how clueless P.&G. was. **********HEALTH CARE **********The Taming of H.M.O.'s In the brisk new world of managed care, horror stories abound of lives plunged into disarray at a clerk's keystroke. But managed care is upon us, of course, for a good reason: the business of healing had turned into its own horror story. So last week, with nearly six million New Yorkers already in H.M.O.'s, Gov. George Pataki made a mighty attempt at a compromise that would protect patients. And it is a compromise: for claims disputes, H.M.O.'s would have to offer an appeals process run by professionals, not clerks. Critics of the plan, though, would have preferred independent arbiters. \"When consumers use their appeal rights,\" said one consumer advocate, \"their H.M.O. will be both judge and jury.\" **********PACKAGE TOURS? **********Speak Up if You're Breakable It's a question, really, of self-worth.

That question may soon arise, as United Parcel Service -- tearing its corporate hair at the thought of its costly planes just sitting there all weekend -- weighs the notion of carrying charter passengers on off days. Just open the huge cargo doors, slide in a platform of seats, and off they go. (Bathrooms, though, would have to be permanent, cutting into cargo  space.) Other airlines have trouble ferrying charter groups, because they want to fly on already-tight weekends, but for U.P.S. the fit seems perfect.

Listen to this: the market value of Zenith Electronics leaped from $400 million to $1.45 billion in just a week, as  the stock went from $6 to nearly $23 before settling at a still-heady $ tk. Yes, that Zenith -- the one that makes most of its televisions in Mexico and has been plagued by shrinking sales.

And if the price is big too, well, heck, buyers have bigger things on our minds.The prices are indeed big, as are the profit margins: while just one vehicle in nine sold last year was a sport utility, they accounted for half of Detroit's profits. Those profits, though, may start to ease as competition heats up. There's Toyota's RAV 4, the Lexus LX 450, and redesigned Pathfinders and Wranglers. And last week Ford showed off its monster nine-passenger Expedition, which might cost up to $36,000. The industry's heading for 48 models and what one Chrysler official says will be a \"real dogfight.\" If you're in some puny sedan, duck! **********LAWSUITS **********Another Queen in Distress Starting as a $12-a-week office boy, Harry Helmsley scaled the heights of New York real estate, building an empire once worth $5 billion. So it's almost a blessing that now -- 87, ailing and forgetful -- he's missing the nasty feuds that might reduce the empire to dust. For in his absence, his partners say, Leona Helmsley is draining the life out of Helmsley-Spear. Mr. Helmsley had agreed that on his death those partners, Alvin Schwartz and Irving Schneider, could buy the firm at a bargain price.

Water, like truth, is pure and simple, a literal oasis in the mad swirl of \"new  age\" drinks -- flavored teas, bubbling juices, glow-in-the-dark sodas. But just  as truth was \"rarely pure and never simple\" after Oscar Wilde had his way with it, now water is in peril too. Figuring, presumably, that our jittery society wasn't caffeinated enough already, some folks in the Midwest have started selling caffeinated water -- coffee without the coffee. Some sleepy souls actually make their orange juice with it -- or, doubling the kick, even making coffee with it. And its name? Water Joe. Get it? \"Joe\"? Old slang for coffee? Oh, have a sip. All will be clear. TOBACCO WARS **********A President's Swift Kick Most skirmishing in the Great Tobacco Wars is ponderous, drawn-out stuff -- vast teams of lawyers endlessly circling one other. But on Tuesday President Clinton  tried to rise above the legal slog, making a direct appeal to cigarette makers.  \"You in the tobacco business,\" he said at a New Jersey high school, \"now surely  see the clear emerging consensus in America that advertising billboards and promotions should not appeal to children.\" If statistics hold, 3,000 teen-agers  started smoking that very day, and smoking will kill 1,000 of them. And \"a 1-in-3 chance,\" the President said, \"is a lousy bargain.\" His speech was part of Kick Butts Day, organized by Mark Green, New York City's public advocate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/clinton-s-chinese-counterpart-a-weak-old-panda.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1996-11-25", "snippet": "Failure of Pres Clinton's meeting with Chinese Pres Jiang Zemin, Manila, to resolve substantive issues seen reflecting paralyzing Chinese leadership transition and Jiang's lack of power; China's rulers remain absorbed in domestic politics despite ...", "word_count": 972, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton's Chinese Counterpart: A Weak Old Panda?", "print_headline": "Clinton's Chinese Counterpart: A Weak Old Panda?", "body_text": " **********President Clinton can certainly sympathize with Jiang Zemin. **********The 70-year-old Chinese President and Communist Party boss has no mandate at home to chart any new course in foreign or domestic policy and his ability to lead China into the next century is an open question. His critics call him ''the panda'' and his staff complains that he never initiates policies, he just responds to pressure. **********Mr. Clinton, who just emerged from a re-election campaign where the same questions were raised about his leadership and where some Republicans disparaged him as ''Bubba,'' might have had a sense of ''I've been there'' this weekend in Manila as he saw the Chinese leadership stall on the substantive issues that divide the two nations. **********With a new chapter opening in United States-China relations, Mr. Clinton's 85-minute discussion in Manila today with President Jiang affirmed, if nothing else, that China is in the midst of a paralyzing leadership transition in which Mr. Jiang's power remains weak and may not be consolidated until late next year, if then. **********Though Mr. Clinton has sent every conceivable signal that a new consensus in Congress for assisting China's economic and technological development may be sustainable, China's rulers remain absorbed in domestic politics. With a Communist Party congress scheduled next fall, Mr. Jiang is, in essence, running to stay in office before an exclusive electorate that consists of a few hundred members of the Communist Party and military hierarchies. **********No Chinese leader in his shoes could be expected to undertake any bold new initiatives with an American President. **********During months of diplomacy leading up to the meeting today, Mr. Clinton sent emissaries to push and cajole. He suggested amending United States trade laws to cement China's trade privileges in the American market, and he shared intelligence on Iran's nuclear program to try to convince Beijing to stop doing business with Teheran. **********China sent the message back that it is not ready to take down the market barriers necessary to enter the World Trade Organization, although Mr. Jiang signaled today that he might be willing to do something on that issue. **********Beijing refused to make any pledge to stop selling nuclear and missile technology to Iran, and it was adamant that it would continue to imprison anyone who speaks against the Government at home, as it did with the former student leader Wang Dan, who got an 11-year sentence just three weeks ago. **********It may be possible for China to make progress on these fronts in the future. But As Mr. Jiang knows all too well, to make progress on these fronts requires a carefully prepared consensus among powerful institutions, including the Chinese military, major state industries, regional leaders and party factions. **********When these stars are not in alignment, Mr. Jiang is left the hapless job of temporizing. **********While Mr. Clinton looks at 1997 as a clean slate on which he would like to write a more constructive text, Mr. Jiang looks at the next 12 months like a barefoot man facing a bed of coals. **********Before the end of next year, Mr. Jiang must show his skill in managing Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1. This will include a perilous choice between confrontation or accommodation with the pro-democracy forces that have flourished among the six million residents of the British colony. **********Then, as part of the preparations for the 15th congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Jiang must orchestrate major personnel changes in the seven-man Politburo, including the retirement of the hard-line Prime Minister Li Peng. **********It is at the party congress that Mr. Jiang is hoping for an unequivocal mandate to succeed Deng Xiaoping. **********Even if he gets the mandate, Mr. Jiang could still turn out to be the weakest leader to rule Communist China in the four and half decades since the Communists came to power. **********And, strangely, a number of Chinese seem content with that. **********''Someone once said to me that Jiang Zemin is a nothing,'' said a member of one of China's most prominent families and a Communist Party stalwart, adding that he replied by saying: ''That is what we need -- a nothing, because he must work within the system. He must consult with the other leaders, like Qiao Shi, the chairman of the National People's Congress, and Prime Minister Li Peng, and he must consult with the military.'' **********''We need a leader who has no ideas,'' the official continued, ''because he will get his ideas and his advice from within the system.'' **********In this way, he said, ''China needs a leader like Bill Clinton. Clinton was a nothing in 1992, just like Jiang Zemin, but look at Clinton now. He knows how to work within the system; he consults with the leaders of Congress and the military and then he makes his decisions.'' **********Mr. Jiang might not find the analysis flattering, but its seems clear that as time passes and Mr. Deng, 92, slips deeper into Parkinson's disease, the collective leadership of Communist Party elders and Mr. Jiang's contemporaries find him a comfortable leader because he tries to accommodate all factions. **********That may not be a prescription for progress in United States-China relations, but it is a prescription for staying in office. **********And though he has been almost desperate over the last two years to convince Mr. Clinton to fete him with a state visit, Mr. Jiang can now undoubtedly see the risks of traveling to Washington with an empty briefcase and facing an onslaught of protesters who would take the opportunity to remind him how unpopular Chinese policies are on religious persecution in Tibet and on the harsh  treatment of political dissidents. **********For Mr. Clinton, too, there are risks in giving too much ''face'' to a Chinese leader who might crack down on Hong Kong's pro-democracy party after Chinese troops move in, and who might greet Vice President Al Gore in Beijing next spring by throwing dissidents into jail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/12/business/hit-film-helps-news-corp-post-7-increase-in-operating-profit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-11-12", "snippet": "News Corp says its first-quarter revenues rose 6.7 percent, to $2.47 billion, from year ago quarter; says net earnings of $222 million were down from $227 million, but that 1995 quarter included gain of $17 million from abnormal items, and most re...", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hit Film Helps News Corp.

''If the management of Chateau is able to thwart an all-cash offer for all the shares, then any REIT with any significant number of operating partnership units would be dramatically less valuable.'' **********Operating partnership units, known in real estate circles as O.P. units, are the vehicles many real estate moguls have used to avoid high taxes when they transform their bricks and mortar into more liquid assets like stocks. **********Converting their interests in the private partnerships through which they own their holdings into a public corporation via a traditional REIT would result in a rather large tax liability. So owners may opt to set up an ''umbrella partnership'' REIT. **********Using that structure, owners convert their stakes into operating partnership units, which are usually exchangeable for shares in the umbrella REIT on a one-for-one basis. According to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, 68 publicly traded REIT's are umbrella REIT's; along with Chateau, they include Taubman Centers Inc., Irvine Apartment Communities L.P. and Prime Retail Inc. **********The operating partnership units confer no voting rights, but their holders dodge capital-gains taxes. And because most holders are also senior executives and board members, they are hardly disenfranchised by the arrangement. **********But what happens when management's interests diverge from those of shareholders? Manufactured Home's bid for Chateau raises precisely that question with significant implications for the other 67 publicly traded umbrella REIT's. **********Chateau's management, led by the chairman, John A. Boll, owns 59 percent of the company through operating partnership units. While analysts say Manufactured Home's bid is the best offer so far for shareholders, it could cause big taxes for Mr. Boll and his associates should they elect to sell their operating partnership units for cash. **********Manufactured Home has provided an alternative option -- trading 1.15 of its shares or operating units for a share or operating unit of Chateau -- that would allow Mr. Boll and his management team a way to stave off the Internal Revenue Service. **********But the alternate offer comes at a cost: At current prices, 1.15 shares of Manufactured Home are worth $22.43, or about 14 percent less than the all-cash option. **********In fact, management would be better off under a competing offer from Sun Communities Inc., which proposes an exchange of shares and operating partnership units worth $25.76 at current prices. **********Management would also fare better in a proposed merger with ROC Communities Inc., the proposal that started the current frenzy. Each share of Chateau would be exchanged for a share or operating unit of a new company representing the merged operations of ROC and Chateau, whose shares closed yesterday at $26.125. **********But analysts and investors say the $26 in cash offered by Manufactured Home is clearly the best deal so far for shareholders. Therein lies the quandary for Mr. Boll and C. G. Kellogg, Chateau's president and chief executive. **********A portfolio manager at a large institutional investment firm that has owned big stakes in all four  publicly traded mobile-home REIT's said he was surprised only that it had taken so long for the potential conflict inherent in effectively having two classes of ownership to appear. **********''Historically, REIT's had a negative connotation of management self-dealing, and when the latest round of REIT formation began a few years ago, there were warning signs that the O.P. unit structure would revive those old connotations,'' said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his company prohibits him from speaking publicly about investments. ''They were creating two different and potentially unequal animals.'' **********Chateau has said it is considering all the offers and raised the prospect that Manufactured Home's offer might violate the company's articles of incorporation, which prohibit anyone from owning more than 7 percent of its stock. Mr. Zell contends that the provision, which is common among REIT's, is intended to protect Chateau's tax-exempt status, not to serve as a ''poison pill'' defense against takeovers. **********A spokeswoman for Mr. Kellogg said he was travelling and in any case could not comment on Mr. Zell's charges of conflicting interests. ''We're obligated not to respond to anything until the board of directors makes a decision,'' she said. **********But others have compared Mr. Zell to the pot that called the kettle black. After all, he holds 3,436,408 operating partnership units in Equity Residential Properties Trust, representing an 8 percent stake in that apartment-complex REIT, and 2,201,460 operating partnership units in Manufactured Home, also representing a stake of 8 percent. **********''If someone came along and made an offer for one of my companies, I certainly am not going to use my status as an O.P. holder to preclude my common shareholders from getting a good deal,'' Mr. Zell said. **********Meanwhile, Chateau's management has hired a second investment bank to advise it -- and perhaps to ease another potentially uncomfortable situation. **********Chateau's original bankers are from Merrill Lynch & Company, which helped the company go public in 1993 and helped it devise the proposed merger with ROC. Merrill also happens to be the marketing agent for, and a partner in, four real estate investment funds totaling $2.2 billion and managed by -- you guessed it -- Mr. Zell. **********To be sure, Merrill's involvement with Chateau predated Mr. Zell's interest. But in what seems to be an effort to avoid any appearance of conflicts between its banker and its banker's other client, Chateau has also retained Goldman, Sachs & Company, which was Mr. Zell's nemesis in the bitter, high-profile battle for control of Rockefeller Center. **********Goldman won that fight and ended up owning a big piece of the New York City landmark through its Whitehall Real Estate Fund. The investment bank got its toe in the door doing advisory work and financings for the publicly held REIT that used to own the center. **********Some wonder whether the fight for Chateau will end the same way. People familiar with the situation say its management is toying with taking the company private, and it would cost upward of $63.4 million to buy the outstanding common shares. **********No doubt Mr. Boll and his executives would welcome some outside help with financing, and no doubt Goldman would be happy to oblige."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/16/business/oracle-s-low-cost-computer-gets-support.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 413, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oracle's Low-Cost Computer Gets Support", "print_headline": "Oracle's Low-Cost Computer Gets Support", "body_text": " **********The Oracle Corporation, continuing its crusade for a low-cost \"network computer,\" today released a list of nearly two dozen manufacturers and technology partners that have agreed to produce such machines. **********Network computers are envisioned as a simpler, less costly alternative to personal computers.

Milken,  the former junk-bond financier. They hope to \"do well by doing good,\" as Mr. Ellison puts it, by playing the educational-products market. **********As described by Oracle, a leader in corporate data base software, this is an  $833 billion worldwide market opportunity. But as it turns out, that number, compiled from various sources by Oracle, counts all the costs of providing education -- salaries, books, supplies, administration -- to schools and universities, government and corporations. **********Presumably, edutainment would be a small subset. A report on the United States education market, published by the Software Publishers Association, found that for the 1993-94 school year, the latest data compiled, a total of $2.6 billion was spent in grades kindergarten to 12 for products and services that included personal computers, educational software and courseware, computer supplies and telecommunications connections. **********And the association projects an increase to just $4.5 billion by 1999. Nonetheless, a new batch of players is joining the education software field, where the veterans include Wolfram Research, whose Mathematica program revolutionized the way mathematics is taught in many schools; Broderbund Software Inc., and the Learning Company. **********Like some of these established players, the new entrants mean to combine education with entertainment. One example is a company called Lightspan Partners of Carlsbad, Calif., which has backers like Microsoft and the cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc., and a management that includes Hollywood screenwriters and animators, as well as education-software executives. **********Similarly, the first investment for Mr. Ellison's Education Technology was to buy shares in the toy company Hasbro Inc. **********\"The Hasbro characters, in an educational context, have enduring value,\" Mr.  Ellison said. \"Mr. Potato Head might be able to teach you arithmetic.\" **********But Mr. Ellison is banking on far more than Mr. Potato Head to make education a profit center. \"If we can get the price down low enough, and I think we can, we see every kid having a network computer at home and at school -- as common as telephones and televisions -- by the year 2000,\" he says. \"I don't know whether  that's realistic, though; it make take until 2005.\" **********This forecast may seem incredible, considering that most of the nation's schools struggle to pay teachers a competitive salary. And even if they could put a network computer on every school desk, few schools yet have the multiple phone lines in every classroom that such machines would require. **********Some steps are being taken to correct this situation. Earlier this year, some 100,000 volunteers installed network cabling in 4,000 schools around the nation  as part of a continuing program called Net Day 96. But there are some education  technology experts who wonder whether the effort is worth the time and trouble. **********The best of the educational software available today is excellent, according  to Judah L. Schwartz, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a professor of education and a co-director of the Educational Technology Center at Harvard University. **********As for the rest of it, Professor Schwartz says, \"The metaphor of the Augean stables is wonderfully appropriate.\" (In Greek mythology, one of Hercules' tasks was to clean the stables of King Augeas, where celestial horse muck was being produced at a faster rate than Hercules could shovel it.) **********But no matter how low the quality, or how high the cost, economics may yet drive technology into the schools, since much of the cost of education is those  pesky salaries for teachers -- whose labor many people see as a natural target for automation. **********The cost of higher education has tripled over the last decade, mostly because of teacher salaries, according to Robert Heterick, the president of Educom, a consortium of colleges and universities that works to integrate technology into  education. **********\"Today you're looking at a highly personal, human-mediated environment,\" Mr.  Heterick said. \"The potential to remove the human mediation in some areas and replace it with automation -- smart, computer-based, network-based systems -- is tremendous. It's gotta happen.\" **********The likeliest candidates include courses like basic math, English and science, which enroll some 50 percent of a university's students and are at the  core of any K-12 curriculum. \"If I could get a small piece of that market,\" he says, \"there's huge potential out there.\" **********Educators like Professor Schwartz are not so enthusiastic. **********\"If you think of education as a production-line function, to train the next generation of 'proles' in the Orwellian sense, then you're right,\" he says. \"It  is a big market. But the object of schooling is not simply to transmit knowledge. It's to get students to participate in the making of knowledge.

Does he trust Yasir Arafat? Will he divide Jerusalem? Will he allow Jewish settlements to expand in the West Bank? **********Give up the Golan?\" he repeated. \"I put the question differently. Should we give up the chance for peace with Syria and Lebanon? To this I say, No!\" The students responded with a rousing \"No!\" **********\"Likud says we hold Arafat's hand,\" he continued. \"Look, he's the first Palestinian to fight terrorism.\" **********\"Whose hand are they going to hold?\" he demanded, launching into a litany of  the militant Islamic groups still waging terror against Israel, \"Hamas? Islamic  Jihad? Hezbollah?\" \"No!\" chanted the youths. **********On Jerusalem, which the opposition Likud Party claims in its campaign that Mr. Peres intends to divide with the Arabs, Mr. Peres turned fiery: \"What right  does Likud have to say that? It's a gimmick, it's disgraceful, as if half the nation wants to divide Jerusalem! Of course not!\" **********\"David Ben-Gurion made Jerusalem the capital of the state of Israel!\" he said, almost shouting. \"Who could divide it? Jerusalem will always be the unified capital of Israel!\" **********Mr. Peres clearly relished the contact and the constant cheers and shouts. \"We're so proud of you, we love you,\" he said in parting, to which the youths chanted, \"Four more years! Four more years!\" **********Upstairs in the same sports complex, several hundred new immigrants from Russia were waiting over cakes and soft drinks. \"Dobryi den, dorogiye druzia,\" Mr. Peres began in Russian -- \"Good day, dear friends\" -- rousing a satisfied rumble from the crowd. An interpreter repeated the words in Hebrew, setting up the punch line. \"They don't speak Russian,\" Mr. Peres said in a theatrical aside, still in Russian. \"They're goys.\" **********The ironic reversal of the suspicions harbored among some native-born Israelis about the Jewishness of the Russian immigrants was well appreciated. **********It was also appreciated two days earlier, in Rishon LeZiyyon, a similarly nondescript city on the coastal plain where Mr. Peres made a virtually identical campaign stop -- a bread-and-salt greeting from local politicians, a meeting with residents and students, a session with new immigrants, a brief news conference. The schedule had been roughly the same before that in the northern town of Acre, and before that in Beersheba, in the Negev. **********Constrained by the intense security that has settled over the Prime Minister  since the assassination last November of his predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, Mr. Peres has had to forgo malls, markets and most other spontaneous appearances in  his campaign for the May 29 national election. **********In fact, warnings that Islamic guerrillas were plotting major attacks before  the election prompted both Labor and Likud to scrap mass rallies planned for next week, confirming the campaign as one of the quietest in Israeli history. Only one major event remains before the vote -- a televised debate on Sunday between Mr. Peres and his Likud challenger, Benjamin Netanyahu. **********In Petah Tiqva, as in most similar stops, the street outside the sports complex was sealed to passers-by, and those who wanted to attend were asked to arrive at least an hour in advance to be cleared through metal detectors. As a result, many of those who came were either already Peres supporters, or too young to vote. **********The tight security has denied Mr. Peres the sort of immediate contact with \"the streets\" that form the main images of a campaign. But Israeli campaign rules bar television and radio from broadcasting the face or the voice of a candidate in the last 21 days before the vote, so few voters are conscious of any unusual distance from Mr. Peres. **********More important, the controlled settings have enabled Mr. Peres to maintain a  prime ministerial demeanor, which appears to fit far better with his air of an old-world gentleman than working the crowds. **********They have also allowed him to concentrate on selected targets. He has spent considerable time with Israeli Arabs, seeking to soothe their anger over the Israeli military offensive in Lebanon last month and the restrictions preventing thousands of Palestinian laborers from traveling to jobs in Israel. He has also  spent time with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who swung the election  to Labor in 1992 but could go the other way this time. **********As the campaign has come down to the homestretch, both Mr. Peres and Mr. Netanyahu have concentrated increasingly on \"the Russians,\" as the new immigrants are generally called. Speaking through a Russian interpreter here, Mr. Peres ran down the list of skills that the immigrants had brought to Israel -- medical, technical, cultural, musical. \"We have more orchestras than listeners,\" he quipped. **********Explaining his vision of an Israeli-Palestinian peace, he said that any effort to extend control over Arab lands \"would only create a Chechnya,\" a reference to the war in Chechnya over its fight to gain independence from Russia. From there he moved on to his favorite image: \"Politics is like a kitchen. You can make an omelet from eggs, but you can't make eggs from an omelet. I suggest we not make an omelet out of Judea and Samaria.\" **********The reference was to the West Bank, and the idea was that if Likud won, it would hold on to the land and try to perpetuate a chronically unstable situation. \"Labor says, let's separate and live in peace,\" Mr. Peres declared. **********However, the questions from the floor, in Petah Tiqva as in Rishon LeZiyyon and at other stops, were not about peace, but about housing, loans and other problems facing the immigrants. **********It was with the students that he seemed most exuberant. Though most of those  in the audience today were under the voting age of 18, Labor presumably counted  on them to spread their enthusiasm to their homes and streets. In general, youths have been the central focus of Mr. Peres's campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-miscellany.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Miscellany", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Miscellany", "body_text": " *********** Publishers Information Bureau, New York, reported magazine advertising pages in December rose 1.5 percent from December 1994, to 18,367.

Intriago is one of the nation's most trusted chroniclers of the war on money laundering. Through his Money Laundering Alert, the 54-year-old lawyer has befriended leaders of the crackdown on financial skulduggery by drug  lords and tax evaders, citing them in his newsletter, inviting them to speak at  his conferences and gossiping with them on the phone. **********His editorial board of advisers is a roster of former top American Government officials and bank regulators, including Jo Ann S. Barefoot, a former Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, and Robert E. Powis, a former Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary. He himself once served as special counsel on organized crime to then-Gov. Reubin O. Askew of Florida, and he prosecuted white-collar criminals as an assistant United States attorney in Miami. His expertise on money laundering has made him an oft-quoted source in newspapers. **********But now, Mr. Intriago finds himself in an uncomfortable position for such a  high-profile authority on money laundering: defending his close relationship with Orlando Castro Llanes, a banker who is now under investigation for money laundering in both the United States and his native Venezuela, and who was charged late last year by the Venezuelan authorities with bank fraud, embezzlement and conspiracy. **********[Mr. Castro, his son and grandson were taken into custody on Wednesday morning by the Dade County, Fla., authorities, acting on behalf of District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, on charges of grand larceny, according to Richard Sharpstein, a lawyer acting for Mr. Castro. He said the New York authorities were seeking his clients' extradition to New York. Mr. Morgenthau's office said only that it would make an announcement on Thursday.] **********In addition, the Federal Reserve Board is investigating Mr. Castro, along with several Venezuelan banks and companies that his family formerly controlled, including Banco Progreso and Banco Republica, according to a former Customs official and other people who were questioned recently by the Fed, the District  Attorney's office and foreign officials. But the Fed delayed a civil action that it had planned to announce with Mr. Morgenthau. It declined to comment. **********Mr. Castro, who is in his mid-60's, was the original backer for Mr. Intriago's company, Alert International Inc. of Miami, and has been his law client for 16 years. In recent years, that has involved Mr. Intriago's defending his client against the inquiries of investigators. After American Customs agents subpoenaed and froze several of Banco Progreso's accounts at the midtown Manhattan branch of BankAmerica International for suspected money laundering in  March 1991, Mr. Intriago persuaded a Federal court to halt the investigation and unfreeze the accounts. **********Mr. Morgenthau's office and Customs Service investigators are looking into the circumstances under which the investigation was stopped. **********By his own admission, Mr. Intriago chose not to go to the authorities in 1993 and 1994 with material that his own investigator said contained evidence strongly suggesting large-scale money laundering at Mr. Castro's Banco Progreso. But Mr. Intriago, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, dismissed the investigator's conclusions and said the material showed no such thing. **********The evidence had been gathered by Richard Lucas, a former I.R.S. agent specializing in accounting fraud and money laundering. He had been hired by Mr.  Intriago to unearth information that would help Mr. Castro in the wake of the Customs Service inquiry in New York, as well as to look into a possible smear campaign against him. **********As part of that investigation, Mr. Lucas documented what he considered to be  suspicious transfers of as much as $3 billion to and from Progreso accounts at the New York office of Banco Atlantico, a bank based in Madrid, between 1991 and 1994. An investigator provided The New York Times with copies of Mr. Lucas's records, which he said he had obtained in Caracas. **********\"The Manhattan District Attorney is looking into those accounts,\" said Sheila M. Donovan, a senior executive at Banco Atlantico, adding, \"We are cooperating.\" **********In a letter from his own lawyer, Parker D. Thomson, Mr. Intriago justified his decision not to disclose Mr. Lucas's findings to American authorities on the grounds that they were an \"attorney work product, privileged and confidential.\"  Besides, he added, he had determined that Mr. Lucas's \"conclusions are fundamentally flawed\" and therefore did not amount to evidence of wrongdoing. **********Mr. Intriago also said that Mr. Lucas had been accused of \"appropriating\" the records belonging to Mr. Castro and \"selling\" them to Thor L. Halvorssen, a Venezuelan businessman who was the country's antidrug czar with the rank of ambassador from 1989 to 1994. Mr. Halvorssen gave them to American investigators, according to the letter. Mr. Lucas has maintained that the records are the property of the Government of Venezuela because it has taken over the bank. **********In an interview arranged by Mr. Intriago in Miami late in March, Mr. Castro,  dressed in a designer blouson jacket and silk necktie, dismissed the Venezuelan  charges against him and the American investigations as the fruits of a political conspiracy by his enemies. Chief among them, he said, is Mr. Halvorssen, with whom he has been feuding ever since the two men were on opposite sides of a corporate takeover battle in Venezuela five years ago. **********Mr. Intriago makes no apologies for his dealings with Mr. Castro. \"I would be the first to run away from any linkage to anyone who would not meet my standards of integrity,\" he said in an interview. He said Mr. Castro had been persecuted in Venezuela because he was born in Cuba. His enemies in the Venezuelan Government, he said. \"have been trying for years to destroy this man. He's not one of them. He's like the Jew to the Nazis.\" **********A multibillion-dollar illegal industry, money laundering disguises the proceeds of drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises by funneling them through a maze of financial conduits. As governments have enacted new laws and banking regulations to curtail the practice, launderers have become increasingly sophisticated about avoiding detection. **********Mr. Intriago met Mr. Castro in 1980 after a long career in government. The Venezuelan banker soon became his client, and Mr. Intriago socialized with his family, even vacationing with his son, Orlando Castro Castro. **********The friendship helped both men in their business careers. When Mr. Intriago decided to start his newsletter in 1989, Mr. Castro provided $80,000 for a 15 percent interest in the partnership, while Mr. Intriago invested about $20,000.  Three years later, the partnership bought Mr. Castro's share for an undisclosed  sum, according to Mr. Intriago's lawyer. **********Since he started Money Laundering Alert, Mr. Intriago has built a circulation of several hundred subscribers, mostly in government and banking. The newsletter has not written about Mr. Castro. **********Mr. Castro has profited from the friendship, too. Mr. Intriago, who has been  a big contributor to the Democratic Party, got the help of Charles (Bud) Stack,  the Florida fund raiser for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, to set up a White House meeting with President Clinton for Mr. Castro. Mr. Castro and his supporters in Caracas have used a photograph of that occasion, which has been reproduced in Venezuelan newspapers, to back their contention that Mr. Castro has friends in high places. **********Mr. Intriago's defense of his activities as the exercise of his professional  responsibilities has plenty of support in the legal community. \"The government is now much more willing to believe that lawyers for the people and institutions under investigation are attempting to obstruct justice when in fact they are just trying to represent their clients in good faith,\" said Aaron R. Marcu, a partner at Howard Darby & Levin, a New York law firm, who specializes in white-collar defense law. **********Mr. Castro's problems worsened at the end of 1994. The Venezuelan Government  had to intervene to prevent the collapse of the nation's banking system. This led to its seizure of Banco Progreso in December 1994 and the departure of Mr. Castro and his family for Miami. Ten months later, in October 1995, Mr. Castro was charged in Caracas in absentia with bank fraud, embezzlement and conspiracy. A senior Venezuelan official said his Government will seek Mr. Castro's extradition from Miami. **********There are further Venezuelan Government charges pending against Mr. Castro, including some relating to the possible misappropriation of more than $300 million of public money used to prop up Banco Progreso, according to Joaquim F.  Chaffardet, a deputy and chief investigator for Venezuela's Solicitor General. **********In this country, some of the most damning evidence against Mr. Castro originated, paradoxically, in Mr. Intriago's effort to clear him of suspicion by hiring Philip Manuel Resource Group of private investigators, for which Mr. Lucas worked. **********Mr. Lucas's analysis of the records suggested money-laundering took place through Banco Progreso's extraordinarily active account at Banco Atlantico in New York. These are the main points of his report: ***********The transactions lacked economic sense. Many of the banks and money changers funneling money to Banco Progreso's account at Banco Atlantico's New York office could have been done much more cheaply by other means. For example, several Venezuelan banks that used this route, including Banco Latino, the most active mover of funds, had their own offices in the United States. ***********Records of the sources and destination of the funds were kept only in Caracas and were not available to American authorities. ***********The volume of the transactions was out of proportion to Banco Progreso's size -- an estimated $3 billion over three years for the No. 12 bank in Venezuela. ***********The bank statements are in code, with many transactions difficult to decipher. ***********Ordinarily, any foreign bank doing that volume of business in the United States would open an American office. Yet Banco Progreso never attempted to do so. ***********Mr. Castro was neither an officer nor a director of this bank, an apparent attempt to isolate him from its activities, even though he was generally understood to control the bank. **********Venezuelan authorities say they are aware of Mr. Lucas's reports, but they did not comment on whether they are using them as evidence in their investigation. **********Mr. Intriago, in his lawyer's letter, contended Mr. Lucas's analysis was faulty because it failed to take account of the flight out of the troubled Venezuelan currency into the dollar. **********[Late on Wednesday, Mr. Intriago said Mr. Lucas \"never argued that the matter should be taken to the authorities,\" and added that he himself had never before  seen all the conclusions that Mr. Lucas had drawn.] **********Mr. Castro and Mr. Halvorssen have sued each other in Federal court in Florida, with Mr. Castro contending that Mr. Halvorssen has defamed him, and Mr. Halvorssen saying that Mr. Castro arranged to have him incarcerated and beaten in Caracas. Mr. Halvorssen denied he is carrying out a vendetta against Mr. Castro. **********For his part, Mr. Intriago has his defenders. **********\"I know him to be an extremely competent attorney, and he has built the best  newsletter in that field,\" said Tom V. Cash, a managing director at the Miami office of Kroll Associates, a firm of private investigators. **********G. Robert Blakey, a former Justice Department official who is on Alert's board, recalled how he and Mr. Intriago drafted Florida's anti-racketeering law, known as RICO. **********As Mr. Intriago \"was doing this, he got very interested in RICO, and then in  money laundering,\" Mr. Blakey said. \"I would be shocked if he was caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1996-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " **********Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, N.J., to Lowe Direct, New York, a unit of the Lowe Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Cos., to handle consumer direct marketing for Fosamax, a treatment for osteoporosis.

Lord Sterling warned of at least 1,000 job losses in the companies' combined work force of 5,500 as the two lines merged into what would be known at P&O Stena Line. **********The first of those cuts will see the new line's combined fleet of 14 ferries \u2014 eight from P&O and six from Stena \u2014 trimmed by two by the end of the year, with an estimated job loss of as many as 400 from that move alone. Company officials said they would probably pull still more ships out of service next year. **********While costs will be cut, both companies denied they had any plans to increase fares. **********\"This merger is an attack on costs,\" said P&O's managing director, Sir Bruce MacPhail. \"Rates are expected to stay low.\" **********Many analysts, however, see rising fares as all but inevitable, the only question being one of degree. **********\"Realistically, I think that the fare war is over and that prices will now probably firm up,\" said Marshall Whiting, an analyst with brokers S.G. Strauss Turnbull. **********That would be good news for the unprofitable Eurotunnel, which this week reached tentative agreement with its banks over the restructuring of its \u00a38.8 billion ($13.8 billion) in debts. **********Lord Sterling said he hoped Eurotunnel's bankers would put pressure on the company to end the Channel price war. **********\"What perhaps will stop is this form of pricing that is impossible for any company operating in a normal environment,\" he said. **********Even without factoring in higher ticket prices, the ferry companies have penciled in significant gains in profits. Bo Lerenius, chief executive of Stena, which will end up owning 40 percent of the new company, predicted that profits would be \"easily better\" than either current profit levels or anything that Stena could have foreseen if it remained an independent operator. **********Crucial to those projections is the planned \u00a375 million reduction in the companies' combined annual costs of \u00a3280 million. A charge of \u00a335 million will be taken in the first year to cover the costs of that pruning, largely to pay for staff cuts. **********Investors reacted positively to news of the merger. In London, P&O shares rose 16 pence (25 cents) to 643, a gain of 2.6 percent, while in Stockholm, Stena stock soared 6.8 percent, rising 2.20 kronor (33 cents), to 34.20. **********The merger announcement came less than three months after the British government reversed a long-standing ban on such combinations. **********Previously the idea of the ferry companies merging, or even agreeing on scheduling or prices, had been viewed as anti-competitive and not in the public's interest. **********Now, however, with Eurotunnel commanding by far the largest share of the cross-Channel market, those arguments have lost weight. **********In fact, the combined tourist operations of P&O and Stena would have 41 percent of the market \u2014 precisely the same share as that currently held by Eurotunnel. **********In the freight market, Eurotunnel would remain ahead, with 44 percent of that market, compared with 40 percent for P&O Stena."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/04/business/nextel-to-purchase-pittencrieff-communications.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-10-04", "snippet": "Nextel Communications Inc says it will buy Pittencrieff Communications Inc for $159 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEXTEL TO PURCHASE PITTENCRIEFF COMMUNICATIONS", "print_headline": "NEXTEL TO PURCHASE PITTENCRIEFF COMMUNICATIONS", "body_text": " **********Nextel Communications Inc. said yesterday that it would buy Pittencrieff Communications Inc. for $159 million in stock.

Almost three years before, in September 1988, an authoritarian Government with military backing choked off democratic protests that had evolved into an uprising, and the country formerly known as Burma was under tight army control. **********Myanmar became a target of human rights campaigners, who continue to press for the kind of boycott they say helped bring change in South Africa. **********Several American companies have pulled out in recent years. Levi Strauss dropped its contract suppliers in Myanmar three years ago. A spokesman, Michael  Woo, said the step grew out of \"a very serious review of the social and economic and political environment there as well as health and safety issues, the human rights environment and the possible impact on our brand image.\" **********But Pepsico plunged ahead, thereby casting its vote in a long-running debate  between boycott and constructive engagement in countries whose human rights policies fall short of American standards. **********It is a debate with continuing implications, as American companies search the world for new places to grow -- and new sources of cheap labor. As they do, they face issues of human rights, exploitative working conditions and child labor. **********Myanmar is a vexing case. Seven years after the repression of 1988, the military Government has begun to invitingly open the economy even as it clamps down on political opponents. Manufacturers say that the quality of work is consistently high. **********American businesses, often out of self-interest, have argued that economic engagement is the quickest route to democracy, and Pepsico takes that view. \"International trade over the long term builds understanding and communication,\" said Elaine Franklin, Pepsico's spokeswoman, citing the company's presence in the Soviet Union before the collapse of Communism. She said Pepsi had started small in Myanmar, with about $8 million in sales in 1994. But Pepsi was there, as elsewhere, she said, for the long haul. **********In its global competition with the Coca-Cola Company, Pepsi has the edge in Myanmar, a nation of perhaps 45 million, though Coke has made a little headway in the north, where a thriving border trade has brought cheap goods from China. **********A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, Kathryn Norton, said that for \"strictly business\" reasons, the company had no plans to enter Myanmar. \"Our policy,\" she  said, \"is not to involve ourselves in political matters.\" **********Responding to the argument that companies should not dirty their hands with unsavory governments, Ms. Franklin of Pepsico said, \"It is pretty arrogant of any company to decide to make its own foreign policy.\" **********United States policy is neither to encourage nor discourage investment. But political sentiment is increasingly running against Myanmar's Government as it continues to stifle opposition led by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San  Suu Kyi -- who has said that foreign companies should \"jolly well wait\" before doing business in her country. **********And indeed, measures that would impose economic boycotts are gaining backers  in both houses of Congress, with one in the Senate sponsored by Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. **********The Unocal Corporation, with a 28 percent interest in a $1 billion natural-gas pipeline project in Myanmar, is also moving ahead, despite lobbying  by rights groups. **********Barry Lane, a Unocal spokesman, said that if his company pulled out, another  contractor would almost certainly step in. \"What good is it going to do for the  people of Myanmar by our not being there?\" he asked. \"We were in Indonesia when Sukarno was there; he put down some uprisings. But incredible improvements  have been made there over the years. In the Philippines, we began under the Marcos regime.\" **********But other companies, primarily clothing makers that can more easily transfer  operations from country to country, have pulled out -- some citing moral objections, others for business reasons. In addition to Levi Strauss, these include Eddie Bauer, a unit of Spiegel Inc., and Liz Claiborne. **********Levi Strauss has been a pioneer in \"socially responsible business practices,\" issuing a set of guidelines in 1992 for its worldwide operations to insure, in the words of its spokesman, Mr. Woo, that its products \"are manufactured in a way that is fair and humane and compassionate.\" **********Typically, standards like these are applied to individual factories or local  working conditions. Myanmar is a relatively rare case, in which companies have been forced by public lobbying to consider the human rights record of a government. **********With most other companies that have withdrawn, human rights did not appear to concern them as much as the risk of bad publicity. **********Eddie Bauer, for example, with 411 stores in North America and contract factories worldwide, pulled out of Myanmar last year to \"better guarantee deliveries,\" a spokeswoman, Cheryl Engstrom, said. **********In the past, the company has broken its ties with some foreign suppliers because of poor working conditions. But in Myanmar, Ms. Engstrom said, \"it is difficult for us, as customers of a factory, to go outside the walls of that factory and begin making determinations about the status of the country.\" **********Instead, she said, the company is concerned that because of growing opposition by the United States Government and human rights groups, \"it would become impossible for us to work in Burma in the future.\" **********Myanmar is flanked by nations eager to trade with it, sharply reducing the impact of withdrawals by Americans. It has not become a case on the scale of apartheid-era South Africa, where an international boycott helped end white-minority rule. **********As of the last fiscal year, the United States accounted for just 8 percent of the $2.65 billion in investment commitments to Myanmar, with France, Britain, Thailand and Singapore providing most of the rest. China's vigorous cross-border trade is helping to spur the involvement of Southeast Asian nations, which do not want to cede influence to Beijing, the region's giant. **********Still, backers of a boycott emphasize human rights concerns. \"A lot of people have the attitude that business is business,\" said Matthew Donohue, a lobbyist with the Burma Action Committee, based in Portland, Ore. \"But this is business that by being transacted is directly contributing to arrests and repression.\" **********That is the sort of thing people will \"have to start confronting as we move into the global economy,\" Mr. Donohue added. \"We are going to have to assume some responsibility for the effects of the dollars we spend if we are going to consider ourselves to have the kind of moral fiber that traditionally the United States has held.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/20/business/international-briefs-slump-in-germany.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Slump in Germany", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Slump in Germany", "body_text": " **********Germany's economy probably shrank in the fourth quarter of 1995 but growth should resume this year, the Economics Ministry said yesterday.

''By Friday at 11 P.M. we have a pretty good idea of how a film is going to do for that weekend,'' said Jeff Blake, president of Sony Pictures Releasing. ''You celebrate or you retrench.'' **********Judgments are set by Sunday. A studio film, opening nationally, that takes in at least $10 million at the box office is considered successful. ''The First Wives Club,'' produced by Paramount Pictures, grossed an unexpectedly high $18.9 million in its debut weekend. On the other hand, ''That Thing You Do!'' made by 20th Century Fox, which grossed $6.2 million, was a disappointment. **********By Monday, studios are deciding whether to increase or decrease advertising budgets. Theater owners -- like doctors performing triage on a battlefield -- wonder whether to remain with an ailing film or move on to a new one in the next week in the crowded marketplace. **********''You don't abandon ship, you chip away, but it's a rare movie that opens at less than $10 million and goes on to become a smash hit,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. (The rarities, though, include ''Dances With Wolves,'' ''Fried Green Tomatoes,'' ''Driving Miss Daisy'' and ''Fatal Attraction.'') **********Nikki Rocco, president of Universal Pictures Distribution, who has been in the business for almost 30 years, put it another way. ''This opening-weekend craziness is absolutely worse than I've ever seen in my life,'' she said. ''By Monday morning, some pictures that opened on Friday are already doomed. There's no breathing room for good pictures that may have had mediocre openings.'' **********By all accounts, Hollywood's obsession with a film's opening-weekend box office may have begun in 1975 with the release by Universal Pictures of ''Jaws'' by Steven Spielberg. It was the first time that a studio opened a film nationally on a single weekend, as opposed to the traditional way of slowly opening a movie, first in large cities and then smaller ones. It was also the first time that a studio heavily advertised a film on television. **********''Actually 'Jaws' opened on 700 to 800 screens, which was huge at the time, in contrast to today, when 'Independence Day' opened on 3,000 screens,'' said Art Murphy, the respected box-office analyst for The Hollywood Reporter. ''The purpose is simple: to generate as much revenue as possible over a short period of time and spread word of mouth.'' **********More recently, studio executives said, several factors have merged to contribute to Hollywood's obsession with box-office figures from opening weekends. These include the proliferation of television shows, magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times, which report on Monday on the box-office tally, leading studios to sometimes stretch the truth a bit on Sunday to emerge No. 1 at the box office. **********''I'm not saying that they're lying, but there's a lot of enthusiastic estimating on Sunday in order to get on Sunday night's television news and in Monday morning's newspaper,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''They're just guessing, after all, but sometimes the guesses are pretty enthusiastic.'' **********Beyond this, the rush of new films opening almost each weekend creates a Darwinian mood, leaving studios not only competing for audiences but also for theaters after a film's early weeks. Offbeat but acclaimed films in recent years like  ''Searching for Bobby Fischer,'' ''What's Eating Gilbert Grape,''  ''Quiz Show,'' or ''This Boy's Life'' fall by the wayside after they fail to connect with audiences after a week or so. Exhibitors grow impatient. **********''Exhibitors will try to get hold of a new film and, unfortunately, leave what they perceive as a sinking ship,'' Ms. Rocco said. ''That's the battle we fight -- to try to give our films the best shot at the box office.'' **********On the other hand, exhibitors are eager to add screens for films such as ''Forrest Gump,'' ''Waiting to Exhale'' and ''First Wives Club,'' which opened powerfully and quickly generated positive reaction. ''If there's a buzz or a 'want to see,' you add screens,'' said Richard Fay, president of the film marketing department at AMC Theaters, one of the nation's largest theatrical circuits. But sometimes studios lose confidence in a film -- based on its opening -- even before theater owners. **********''Sometimes people like myself will go to distributors and say 'Are you cutting extra prints?' '' Mr. Fay said. ''You'd be surprised. They lose confidence.'' **********Marvin Antonowsky, an industry marketing expert, said, ''If a studio has a real bomb on its hands, it cancels everything.'' **********Where studios -- and theater owners -- especially lose confidence in a film is in its second weekend.

Maybe you have something else a charity can use, like a computer, or something it can turn into cash, like stock. **********Indeed, donating stock may give you a bigger tax break than giving cash. Let's say you are in the 36 percent marginal tax bracket. If you give $5,000 in cash, you can take a tax deduction of $1,800 if you itemize. You get the same deduction if you donate stock worth $5,000. But you get one more thing: avoiding capital gains tax on any appreciation of stock owned for more than a year. **********For example, if you bought 100 shares of stock for $40 each in 1994 and sold at $50 this year, you would have to pay capital gains tax on the $1,000 appreciation. If you paid at the maximum rate, 28 percent, your tax would be $280. **********But if you gave the stock directly to charity instead of selling it and donating the proceeds, you could forget the tax. The more the stock has appreciated, the more valuable this option can be. **********There is one impending exception for publicly traded stock given to a private foundation instead of a private charity. This year, Congress extended a tax statute that allows you to deduct a stock's appreciated value if it is donated to a private foundation. But that extension is scheduled to expire on May 31, 1997. Unless Congress acts again, after that date you will be able to deduct only the amount you invested in the stock. **********The tax deduction for a gift of personal belongings isn't quite so valuable, but it does save something priceless: time. If you have a hard-to-sell car or an old computer and software, you don't have to hunt for a buyer. Schools, for example, love to get computers, even old ones, for students who can't afford them. **********And many charities have programs to handle car donations. The National Kidney Foundation (800 488-2277), for example, will accept cars as old as 1980 models, and it doesn't demand that they actually run. It will even tow your car away. You will need to know the vehicle identification number of your car and will have to hand over the title and a statement listing the car's exact mileage. **********Remember, if your gift is valued at $250 or more, make sure the charity gives you a letter stating the fair market value; for a car, that is the book value. **********For example, a basic 1985 Buick LeSabre Custom four-door sedan has a blue-book value of about $2,750. If you are in the 36 percent marginal tax bracket, donating the car to charity will result in a tax deduction of almost $1,000. **********Most used computers aren't worth nearly that much, so don't expect a big deduction. But at at least you'll get that machine out of your attic.

Smith Jr., to run the Swedish auto maker. **********Robert W. Hendry, a G.M. vice president and group executive, will become president and chief executive of Saab in August. Saab is a joint venture between General Motors and Investor A.B., the Swedish holding company controlled by the  Wallenberg family. **********The appointment of Mr. Hendry, who is 51, along with other recent executive  moves, signals that General Motors is redoubling its efforts to make Saab consistently profitable. Just last week, Saab announced that Joel K. Manby, an executive at G.M.'s much-admired Saturn small- car subsidiary, would become president and chief executive of Saab Cars USA Inc., Saab's American marketing arm. Moving to Saab with Mr. Manby is Saturn's director of consumer marketing, John J. Orth, who today was named vice president for sales at Saab Cars. **********Mr. Hendry replaces Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who is leaving after four years  to join Smiths Industries, the British conglomerate, as an executive director and board member. Mr. Hendry will retain his high post at G.M. while he runs Saab. Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse, who worked for the Ford Motor Company for two decades before joining Saab, is not an officer of General Motors, signaling that Mr. Hendry's link with the parent company will be stronger. **********General Motors paid $500 million for a half interest in Saab in 1990, and has invested another $500 million since. During that time, Saab cut its work force in half and adopted many streamlined manufacturing techniques. **********Saab's goal is to sell 150,000 cars a year worldwide by the year 2000, up from 98,700 last year. It also wants to raise its annual United States sales from 25,595 last year to about 40,000. Saab plans to start selling a new sedan and station wagon next year. The sedan, referred to as project 640, will be more luxurious than Saab's 9000 hatchback, and will be sold in a station-wagon version -- informally called project 641 -- starting in 1999, said Karl Olof Axelson, Saab Automobile's vice president for communications. **********Mr. Hendry's mandate to finish turning Saab around comes after he helped Mr.  Smith and other executives stanch the hemorrhaging at G.M. in 1992. Serving as chief financial officer for G.M.'s North American operations, Mr. Hendry had authority over every major capital spending proposal. \"He was on the front lines during the stop-the-bleeding years,\" said Scott F. Merlis, president of Merlis Automotive International, an independent automotive research firm in Westport, Conn. **********Mr. Hendry also led G.M.'s New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a California  joint venture with the Toyota Motor Corporation in which G.M. learned Japanese lean-production techniques while building Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms. **********Indeed, the new team at Saab could be preparing to link the G.M. subsidiary more closely with the company's Saturn division. \"There has been a lot of talk about a Saturn/ Saab alignment,\" said Lincoln C. Merrihew, an auto analyst for DRI/ McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting company in Lexington, Mass. \"There is  sort of a similarity in the psychological makeup of Saab and Saturn buyers,\" he  said, since both customer bases are famously loyal. Saab and Saturn products do  not compete against each other because Saturn's small cars fill the lower end of the market, Mr. Merrihew said. **********Mr. Butler-Wheelhouse told The Financial Times of London last week that some  Saturn dealers might eventually sell Saab cars, too, and that the two would cooperate more behind the scenes. **********Mr. Hendry was not available for comment.

The median number of checkout counters is 10, and anyone who shops (an average of 2.2 times a week) knows that those counters are a good place to look for the latest headlines: Liz's Hubby's Drug Bust; Six Signs that PROVE the World is Coming to an End; Sexy Blonde Tells All and (now for the good news) Garlic Miracle Cure. **********Until a few years ago, as loudly as the supermarket tabloids shouted, the mainstream press rarely listened. Their stories simply were not mainstream stories. These days, though, what the tabloids dig up the rest of the papers now dish out with relish, as the scandal involving Dick Morris, the Presidential campaign adviser, and a call girl shows. Think of Gary Hart, Donna Rice and Monkey Business (The National Enquirer), or Bill Clinton the Presidential candidate and Gennifer Flowers (Star), or the string of scoops from all sides in the O. J. Simpson murder case that the mainstream media felt it had to follow. **********The oddity is that as these weekly tabloids have forced their way into national attention, their own fortunes have grown more shaky. The biggest ones, Star, The National Enquirer and The Globe have each lost about 30 percent of their circulation in the last five years, with Star and The National Enquirer declining by more than one million each. **********Their readership is aging and, most of all, everyone else is stealing their metier, and their material. **********''We not only have to compete with the other tabloids,'' said Tony Frost, editor of The Globe, ''we have to compete with People magazine and the television tabloid shows for our readers, and we compete with them for our pictures and for our stories.'' **********Michael Boylan, vice chairman of American Media Inc., which is the publisher of Star and The National Enquirer, said, ''When Zsa Zsa slapped that cop, in the old days, the only people that would have been at the courthouse would have been us and maybe the local Beverly Hills paper. The last time Zsa Zsa showed up, there were 400 reporters and television crews, including The New York Times. That's competition.'' **********Actually, there were 100 reporters at the start of Ms. Gabor's trial in 1989, according to The Associated Press, and The Times was not there. Yet Mr. Boylan still makes his point: the aptitude for self-humiliation among famous and powerful people now plays on a wider stage. **********The Audit Bureau of Circulations  considers the supermarket tabloids to be magazines, not newspapers, yet their losses in sales certainly mirror the sagging circulation histories of many daily newspapers, although at much sharper angles of decline. **********According to the Bureau, average weekly sales of Star have fallen from 3.6 million in 1990, the year Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation sold the paper to American Media, to 2.5 million for the six months ending June 30. For its sister publication, The National Enquirer, sales have dropped from just over 4 million in June of 1990 to just under 2.7 million for the first half of 1996. **********The smaller Globe, which is owned by a Montreal businessman, Michael Rosenbloom, saw its sales decline to 918,000 this June from 1.3 million in June 1990. **********''We had a lousy year last year, it's true,'' Mr. Boylan of American Media said. ''But our circulation has stabilized, and I think we're going to show good results this year.'' **********In March, Standard & Poor's put American Media's debt securities on credit watch and downgraded its corporate rating to double-B minus as a result of last year's reduced cash flows. The company officers borrowed heavily to finance its leveraged buyout in 1990, and then refinanced the debt to pay a special $7 dividend that allowed the original investors to recoup their outlays. **********Still, the company has ample lines of bank credit, and Mr. Boylan said the company's paper was trading at above par value. **********Besides, he said, his company has been regularly raising the price of its weeklies, to $1.39 today from 95 cents in 1991, to keep revenues up as circulation declined. The other tabloids have followed suit. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Boylan said American Media has tried to reduce its reliance on gossip by publishing two new publications, Country Weekly, about the country music scene, and Soap Opera Magazine. **********In another twist, the political scandals that the tabloids used to catapult themselves into the national spotlight return no dividends with their regular readers, Mr. Boylan said. **********''All of our political stories have generally been dogs,'' he said. ''The Enquirer had Donna Rice and Monkey Business, and it didn't sell any papers for us. The Star did Gennifer Flowers in February 1992, and it was the worst-selling issue of the first six months of the year, even though it got $100 million worth of publicity.'' **********For the competing Globe, the ban on political stories is absolute. **********''We don't touch political scandals, although I take my hat off to The Star,'' Mr. Frost said. ''The feeling at The Globe is that our readers don't like to read about politicians. Our readers look to The Globe to read about glamorous celebrity figures.'' **********In fact, Star tried to give its story about Mr. Morris and the prostitute away, first to The Chicago Tribune and then to The Wall Street Journal, because its editors knew that their readers would not care. Both papers turned the offer down. **********''We knew we had a good story and we knew we had it nailed, but we also knew nobody outside the Beltway knows who Dick Morris is, and our readers in general don't like reading about politicians,'' Mr. Boylan said. **********Finally, The New York Post, citing  Star, published the story on Aug. 29, and the White House quickly forced Mr. Morris to resign from the campaign. **********The result was a scandal on the day President Clinton was to give his nominating acceptance speech, and it blanketed the papers and television programs Thursday night and Friday morning. Some commentators praised the White House for making the resignation the lead element of the Morris story by forcing Mr. Morris out quickly. **********But what would have happened, a tabloid editor wondered privately, if Mr. Morris had been allowed to wait a day before resigning? Few newspapers would have played The Post's story very big -- after all, two of them turned it down because it could not be independently confirmed. Chances are, if he had waited, Mr. Clinton would not have had to share his triumph with Mr. Morris's disgrace in Friday's coverage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/news/a-nasty-surprise-for-deutsche-bank.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1996-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Nasty Surprise for Deutsche Bank", "print_headline": "A Nasty Surprise for Deutsche Bank", "body_text": " **********FRANKFURT\u2014                     Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank, found itself at the center of yet another financial scandal on Tuesday when a subsidiary disclosed that it faced collapse after uncovering hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of losses hidden by managers over several years. **********Klo\u0308ckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, an engineering company and machinery maker known as KHD, now needs its third financial rescue in a decade. **********KHD held emergency talks over the weekend \"to sound out possible solutions,\" according to Deutsche Bank, which is KHD's largest creditor and shareholder. The bank holds 48.6 percent of KHD after bailing it out last year. **********If KHD and its 9,400 jobs survive, it can thank Germany's time-honored system in which powerful banks often control the fate of the nation's industries through a vast shareholding network. **********Two years ago, that system saved Metallgesellschaft AG, a once-sprawling energy, mining and trading conglomerate. Deutsche Bank, which is also the biggest shareholder of Metallgesellschaft, led the effort to extricate that company from huge losses it generated in trading crude oil futures. **********But the cozy system that allows the biggest banks to lord over the economy has come under attack by bank shareholders, who charge that industrial stakes seldom yield worthwhile returns and that banks should not be in the business of managing industry, much less crisis turnarounds. **********If KHD fails, it could become one of the first victims of the changes sweeping corporate Germany that have made such institutions as Deutsche Bank focus more intensely on profits than ever before. **********Unfortunately for KHD, such change is under way. At its annual shareholders' meeting, which coincidentally took place Tuesday, Deutsche Bank ominously served notice that it no longer sees itself as a white knight that generously dispenses corporate bailouts. It was only a year ago that Deutsche Bank gave KHD its last cash infusion after the bank orchestrated KHD's first rescue in 1988. **********Without mentioning KHD, Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Hilmar Kopper addressed the issue of faltering companies, warning that \"no one can or should expect us to assume the risk of loss without having hopes of making a profit, at least in the long term.\" **********Mr. Kopper went out of his way to declare that his institution was committed to \"shareholder value,\" a term that German managers have begun to espouse only in the past year. **********To groom itself for international shareholders, the bank was the first German bank to junk the country's opaque accounting rules and switch last year to internationally recognized balances. To cement a closer link between the bank's managers and shareholders, it will pay part of management salaries in stock options. It has cut German staff and moved investment banking to London. **********\"Deutsche Bank is currently changing more than it has ever done in its entire history,\" the bank boasted. **********Indeed, Mr. Kopper said that he would happily sell off the bank's holdings in non-financial institutions, but the 60 percent German tax on capital gains currently makes such moves too costly and thus not in the interest of shareholders. **********Mr. Kopper has already been under attack for what critics call his lack of supervision in his role as chairman of the supervisory board at Daimler-Benz AG, where Deutsche Bank is the largest shareholder. Last year, Daimler lost a record 5.7 billion Deutsche marks ($3.77 billion) and had to sell off many of the operations it originally acquired with Deutsche Bank's authorization. **********Troubles at Daimler and Metallgesellschaft have called Germany's two-tiered system of corporate oversight into question. Worried that problems are often recognized too late, reformers are now calling for more power on the nation's supervisory boards so that they can better control the board of managers. **********In KHD's case, the company said executives in its big Humboldt Wedag AG plant construction division had hidden losses since 1993. Anticipating the criticism, Mr. Kopper told shareholders Tuesday that \"nothing is perfect, and that also applies to the German system of corporate governance.\" **********KHD and Deutsche Bank have been in bailout talks since Friday, the day when KHD said an executive disclosed the alleged fraud at Wedag to top management. Just as Metallgesellschaft's former executives face criminal charges, KHD vowed to seek charges against its own executives. **********It is too early to diagnose KHD's losses, Mr. Kopper said. But if KHD's statement that damages would total \"hundreds of millions of marks\" is true, it would quickly wipe out KHD's remaining equity of 300 million DM, rendering the company insolvent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/10/business/apple-plans-to-repair-problems-of-some-macintosh-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apple Plans to Repair Problems Of Some Macintosh Computers", "print_headline": "Apple Plans to Repair Problems Of Some Macintosh Computers", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc., already facing falling sales and big losses, agreed today to repair problems with some models of Macintosh desktop and portable computers. **********Apple said that it had asked distributors and dealers to return flawed Powerbook portables, and it said it would ask individual owners to take flawed desktop models -- they include many Performa models and a few Power Mac models -- to authorized service providers nearby for free repairs.

Both men publicly said the network's performance in February was unacceptable, with Mr. Eisner going so far as to vow that such a showing would never happen again. **********Some of ABC's competitors suggest that the signs in February point to the kind of reversal of fortune that has afflicted other first-place networks in the last decade. **********Like NBC in the 1980's and CBS in the 1990's, these executives say, ABC has been putting too many \"deals\" on the air and too few good shows. ABC has been the most aggressive network in making co-production deals with producers, seeking to gain a share in the syndication profits of shows. **********The most recent example was the network's deal with the new studio Dreamworks SKG, which led ABC to put a new comedy called \"Champs\" in the network's best time period -- Tuesday night after its biggest hit, \"Home Improvement.\" The show did poorly and was quickly taken off the air. **********To make things worse, another show that ABC had developed, \"Third Rock From the Sun,\" went over to NBC because it could not get the same guaranteed time period that ABC had given \"Champs.\" It is now a big hit on NBC. **********Some of ABC's executives point to a promise the network's news division extracted to assure a choice time period, Wednesday at 10 P.M., for its popular  magazine program \"Prime Time Live.\" As a result, ABC's entertainment executives  could not place their best new drama, \"Murder One,\" in that slot for fear that the anchor of \"Prime Time Live,\" Diane Sawyer, would quit in protest. **********Then there was the deal made in 1993 with the producers of the comedy \"Roseanne\" that guaranteed the former hit show three more years on the air. Shortly after the deal was made, NBC moved a new hit, \"Frasier,\" directly opposite \"Roseanne,\" which was slipping slightly in the Tuesday night ratings. **********Partly because ABC feared for its financial investment, \"Roseanne\" was moved  to Wednesday, changing places with \"Home Improvement.\" While the move helped ABC hold onto a winning Tuesday, the battle against \"Frasier\" has hastened the ratings decline for \"Home Improvement,\" which is down precipitously in the ratings. **********ABC wound up moving \"Roseanne\" again this season and it is likely the network will announce a decision this week to cancel the show at the end of this season  because it has become too expensive to keep on the air. **********ABC executives reject the notion that this pile of decisions has cost the network its ratings lead. After all, they say, if ABC had found just two hit shows it would still be soaring. **********Indeed, the business of momentum in network television is almost entirely about hits. ABC has gone two seasons without one, a fact that Mr. Harbert acknowledges is all important. \"You have to get some new blood on the network to supplant your aging shows,\" he said. \"It's like trying to capture mercury between your thumb and forefinger.\"    NBC's fingers have been especially adept of late, having created smash hits in each of the last three years when no other network has plucked even one. Mr.  Harbert noted that ABC had developed shows like \"Lois and Clark\" into slow-building successes and said he still had hopes for a few shows he put on this season, like \"The Naked Truth.\" **********His hopes are even higher for this month, when he will add several new shows, including a new comedy featuring the Muppets and \"High Incident,\" a promising police drama from Dreamworks produced by Steven Spielberg. That one goes on the  air tonight. **********Then there are the shows being developed for the fall season, including a series based on the movie \"Clueless.\" **********\"If I can put a new show behind 'Home Improvement' and it's a fast hit, we'll be fine,\" Mr. Harbert said. \"If not, then it will be 'next folks' in this job.\" **********In the language of the season, Mr. Harbert and ABC need a win in some state's primary or the former front-runner may soon be running on empty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/30/your-money/IHT-emerging-havens-and-their-niches.html": {"writer_name": "Digby Larner", "pub_date": "1996-03-30", "snippet": "WITH a growing amount of private and institutional investment looking for tax-friendly hideaways, it is not surprising that the number of countries clamoring for a slice of the action is growing as well. .

Some are completely new to the world of international finance, while others have decided to promote benefits to foreign investors that domestic investors have enjoyed for some time. **********The U.S. Virgin Islands has attracted offshore investment for at least a decade but has only recently become a serious player, providing a base for financial heavyweights like Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank. **********As with other emerging offshore centers, the U.S. Virgin Islands aims to gain a place in the market by providing a niche service. Its single biggest benefit stems from being the only U.S. jurisdiction where tax-exempt corporations can be created. **********These are free of all local and U.S. taxes but carry an annual license fee of $1,000, which currently is being reviewed. **********Part of the reason for the islands' growing popularity is that it is seen by Hong Kong investors as a haven for themselves and their cash ahead of 1997, when the British colony will be transferred to China. Those able to invest $500,000 into a new business providing at least ten jobs to locals qualify for a U.S. visa. **********For U.S. citizens, on the other hand, the islands offer few benefits. This is mainly because U.S. citizens can claim fewer tax breaks in the U.S. Virgin Islands than international investors and because information on individual investors is freely traded with the mainland. The tax breaks that do exist are designed to promote U.S. export business rather than investment. **********Cyprus, like the U.S. Virgin Islands, is an emerging offshore center that has been around for some time. Despite its friendly tax laws \u2014 international investors are exempt from both capital-gains and withholding tax \u2014 and some 20 years of aggressive promotion, Cyprus has only recently received serious consideration. **********David Wigman, sales and marketing director for Eagle Star International, opened a representative office on the island to service the company's agents in Africa during the Gulf War. \"We needed to move our operations into a safer area that was still strategically well placed to take care of our intermediaries,\" he said. **********Now that peace has returned to the region, Mr. Wigman says he has no plans to relocate the office, especially as other trouble spots continue to make the area appear unstable. **********\"Geographically Cyprus wouldn't ordinarily be favored by businesses making inroads to the Middle East,\" he explains. \" It's much better placed to pull investors from the eastern Mediterranean. But for as long as places like the Lebanon remain unstable, it's bound to attract investment.\" **********But the Cypriot government appears to be aware that attracting investment because of political instability elsewhere could be a short-lived success. Mr. Wigman points out that even if countries like Lebanon continue to be problematic, there are other safe offshore centers, such as Dubai, that are well placed to divert Middle Eastern cash from Cyprus. **********Although Dubai is not officially an offshore center, the absence of income tax and corporation tax has made it one of the Middle East's leading investment areas. Its nearest local competitor for investment business is Bahrain. Since the launch of the Bahrain Monetary Agency in 1973, the kingdom has attracted around 50 foreign banks and over $65 billion foreign investment. **********The Cook Islands off the eastern coast of Australia also are also rapidly gaining credibility as a tax-free haven with a special niche. A spokesman for a European investment house, who preferred not to be named, notes that one of the biggest draws for foreign money is the existence of asset protection trusts, which are often used by investors to keep money hidden away from creditors. Provided the trusts are more than two years old, it can be almost impossible for foreign courts to gain access to them, the spokesman said. **********Geographically, too, the islands are well placed to pick up investment moving out of various Asian countries, including Hong Kong."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/02/business/merrill-officer-is-arrested.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merrill Officer Is Arrested", "print_headline": "Merrill Officer Is Arrested", "body_text": " **********Merrill Lynch & Company said on Friday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had arrested an assistant vice president of the company's Wagner Stott Clearing Corporation unit on charges of wire fraud. **********In a lawsuit filed by Wagner Stott, Alan Burton, 33, is accused of wiring $1.7 million from the firm's accounts to bank accounts held by two individuals over the last two years.

The strong results by Goldman for its  most recent quarter -- its fifth consecutive quarter to show improvement -- reflected its continued turnaround after a particularly difficult year in 1994 when Wall Street's earnings slumped and Goldman's top leaders left. **********\"It was a very positive quarter for all divisions, there was very consistent  profitability,\" said a Goldman partner who declined to be identified. Unlike corporations, partnerships are not taxed directly; rather, the firm's partners pay taxes individually on their shares of the firm's profits, making it is impossible to state meaningful after-tax earnings. Wall Street's last big private partnership, Goldman, which was founded in 1869, decided earlier this year to remain a private partnership after several senior employees spent months studying the firm's capital structure and needs. **********\"We have had favorable markets; we have had a relatively attractive environment to execute a turnaround,\" Jon S. Corzine, Goldman's chairman and senior partner, said in a recent interview. Lauding his employees, Mr. Corzine maintained that the firm had really pulled together during 1995. He even contended that the upsets of 1994, when successive interest rate rises roiled the bond markets and hurt Goldman's earnings, may have been good for the firm. \"We were a little too comfortable with where we were and what we were about,\" he said. **********Mr. Corzine and his deputy, Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's vice chairman and chief operating officer, began running the firm almost 18 months ago, and have led it back to robust health. Goldman, which has 174 partners and more than 7,000 employees, made $1.37 billion in pretax profit in the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1995 -- a strong recovery from $508 million earned in its previous year. \"We must be on 12 cylinders now; the momentum has increased,\" Mr. Paulson  said in an interview earlier this year. **********In its first quarter, Goldman had revenue of $1.464 billion and expenses of $899 million, according to a partner who attended yesterday's meeting. That compares with revenue of $906 million and expenses of $746 million for the quarter a year earlier. Rising compensation accounts for the increase in expenses, the Goldman partner said. Goldman's financial statements will not be completed for another few weeks, but they are expected to show that the firm's capital grew to well over $5 billion at the end of its first quarter, from $4.9 billion on Nov. 30. **********Despite the banner earnings, Goldman has recently failed to maintain all its  momentum in some important markets, according to statistics from the Securities  Data Company, a New Jersey statistical concern that monitors the financial markets. **********From the beginning of the year until March 15, for example, Goldman has slipped to fifth place as a manager in the United States equity issue market, with a 6.6 percent market share, according to Securities Data. A year earlier Goldman was in first place with a 28.5 percent share of the market for domestic  equity issues, a ranking it retained for the whole of 1995 when it held a 17.3 percent market share. Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette all ranked above Goldman as managers in the domestic equity issue market so far this year. **********In the 11 weeks of 1996 ended March 15, Goldman managed a total of $1.1 billion of United States equity issues. This was far below Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney, each of which managed more than $2 billion of such issues. **********And, as an adviser of announced United States mergers and acquisitions, Goldman ranked No. 8 in the first 11 weeks of this year with a 4.9 percent market share, working on six announced transactions with a value of $4.14 billion; in the first quarter of last year, Goldman advised on 14 announced transactions with a value of $5.35 billion to rank No. 7 among its peers. **********Goldman, however, may be hiding some of its achievements when it comes to its current standings in the league tables. Brokerage firms often report large amounts of business at the end of the quarter, raising their league rankings substantially, according to Richard Peterson of Securities Data."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/30/business/gore-urges-cable-industry-to-take-on-the-bells.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1996-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1003, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gore Urges Cable Industry to Take On the Bells", "print_headline": "Gore Urges Cable Industry to Take On the Bells", "body_text": " **********The cable television industry is picking up some friends in high places, just when it needs them most. **********Vice President Al Gore said today in a speech here to the industry's national conference that cable companies had displayed \"good judgment, vision and a willingness to compromise\" in their lobbying for telecommunications legislation. His remarks constituted a startling turnabout for a politician who was once one  of cable's most strident critics and had led the battle to clamp down on cable rates in the 1980's. **********In the wake of deregulation, however, the cable industry seems far less able to play the predator than a decade ago. Indeed, the competition unleashed by the new Telecommunications Act -- and the two recent merger announcements by four regional Bell companies -- is quickly putting cable executives on the defensive. **********Because the Clinton Administration lobbied hard for the telecommunications law, it now requires that the market deliver the kind of freewheeling, free-market competition that deregulation was supposed to usher in.  And so, Mr. Gore's speech amounted to a pep rally for the cable industry, which the Administration is counting on to give consumers a true telecommunications alternative. **********Mr. Gore -- who as a senator once referred to John C. Malone, the powerful head of the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. as \"Darth Vader\" -- today exhorted the industry to take on the telephone companies as aggressively as they could. **********\"You are the second wire that passes virtually every American home,\" Mr. Gore said in his speech to the National Cable Television Association. \"Use that second wire to make available to America a package of services, including Internet access, that is affordable to every citizen.\" **********For several years, cable executives have predicted that they would soon offer a panoply of communications services, including local telephone service and high-speed data delivery. But so far technological snags and economic constraints have prevented the cable companies from establishing much of a beachhead in either business. **********And the phone companies are unlikely to make the cable industry's job any easier. **********The pair of proposed multibillion-dollar Bell mergers that have been announced since President Clinton signed the Telecommuniations Act in February -- those of SBC Communications Inc. and Pacific Telesis Group, and the Nynex and Bell Atlantic corporations -- have focused almostly entirely on local and long-distance telephone service. And because the Bell companies seem determined  to thrive by dominating their core telephone business, rather than branching into video services, some analysts and cable executives said that they would be even more ferocious about controlling access to their monopoly local markets. **********\"The toughest nut to crack is going to be the incumbent local telephone business,\" said James O. Robbins, the chief executive of Cox Enterprises' Cox Communications division, which is the nation's fifth-largest cable operator, with 3.2 million subscribers. **********Cox is one of three cable operators that allied with the Sprint Corporation two years ago with a mission of building a national wired and wireless phone service, with cable networks providing the direct links to homes and businesses. **********But that alliance has been unraveling. And just today the largest of those cable partners, Tele-Communications, served notice that it would choose its local phone markets selectively. The company said that it had filed for permission to offer local phone service in West Hartford, Conn., Arlington Heights, Ill., and San Francisco -- without Sprint or the other cable operators. **********Greg Crosby, the vice president of marketing at the Tele-Communications telephone division, said that his company and Sprint had been unable to agree on which would pay for the costly upgrades of the cable network to enable it to carry switched phone traffic. Mr. Malone, the chief executive of TCI, has said he doubts that it makes economic sense to offer wired telephone service to each  of his company's 13.7 million cable subscribers. **********Cable operators who do go it alone are encountering other problems. Time Warner Inc., the nation's second-largest cable company, filed for permission in  October 1994 to offer local phone service in Ohio. But Time Warner has been hobbled by a protracted squabble in that state with the Ameritech Corporation, the regional Bell company there. The dispute involves the rates that Ameritech charges to complete Time Warner calls to Ameritech customers. **********The Ohio Public Service Commission imposed \"interconnection\" terms that were  supposed to settle the matter, but Ameritech sued the commission rather than accept the terms. Thomas Morrow, the president of Time Warner Communications, said the company was encountering similar hurdles in Texas from the Bell company there, SBC Communications. **********Given these issues, it is not surprising that cable executives spent most of  their time today dwelling on other opportunities, like high-speed data delivery  and digital television. The General Instrument Corporation and Motorola Inc. are among the manufacturers announcing ambitious plans here at the convention to ship new cable modems and digital set-top convertor boxes. **********General Instrument's digital convertor boxes, designed to improve picture and sound quality while increasing the number of channels, are almost two years late, cable executives said. Meanwhile, complications in the development of cable modems have forced major cable operators like Tele-Communications to delay plans to offer high-speed access to the Internet and commercial on-line services. **********Still, some cable executives seized on the anticipated announcements as proof that the industry was finally delivering on its lofty promises. **********\"I believe that this show may begin to put an end to the all skepticism,\" said Brian L. Roberts, the president of the Comcast Corporation and the chairman of the National Cable Television Association. \"It will serve as evidence that we are finally doing what we've said we were going to do.\" **********Mr. Gore, for his part, referred lightheartedly to his old disputes with the  industry, noting that cable executives might perceive him as \"Washington's answer to Darth Vader.\" **********Still, the Vice President was probably less controversial than the other big  name that the association tried -- unsuccessfully -- to lure to the conference: Jim Carrey, the actor who plays a psychotic cable repairman in the soon-to-be-released movie \"Cable Guy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/07/world/target-was-israeli-government-says-arab-linked-to-3-bombings.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Target Was Israeli Government, Says Arab Linked to 3 Bombings", "print_headline": "Target Was Israeli Government, Says Arab Linked to 3 Bombings", "body_text": " **********A young Palestinian man accused of recruiting three of the latest suicide bombers said today that he was told the attacks were called to insure the defeat of the Israeli Government and thus undermine the political process toward peace. **********The man, Mohammed Abu Warda, 20, was shown on the evening television news being interviewed in Arabic. He was arrested Sunday night by the Palestinian police, acting on information from Israeli security services, in a raid on a teacher's college in Ramallah, on the West Bank, and he was sentenced on Tuesday night by a Palestinian security court in Jericho to life imprisonment. **********Speaking of the military wing of the Islamic resistance movement Hamas, Mr.  Abu Warda said its leaders had stepped up their military actions in part because the Israeli elections, originally scheduled for next fall, had been moved forward to May. **********\"They thought that the military operations would work to the benefit of the Likud and against the left,\" he said. \"They wanted to destroy the political process, and they thought that if the right succeeded, the political process would stop.\" **********The four suicide bombings since Feb. 25, which have taken 61 lives, have sharply lowered the popular standing of the Labor Government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and have led many Israelis to question the effectiveness of the Israeli-Arab peace. **********There was no way to judge from the broadcast whether Mr. Abu Warda had been coached or coerced in his statements by the Palestinian Authority, which has a stake in ensuring that Mr. Peres wins re-election. **********Statements issued after the attacks said they were revenge for the assassination of the Hamas bombmaker known as the Engineer, Yahya Ayyash, and made no mention of Israeli-Arab politics. **********Neither Mr. Peres, who was also shown on the news program watching the interview, nor the television announcers questioned Mr. Abu Warda's claim that the targets of the bombing campaign were the peace effort and its Labor Party champions. **********\"It didn't surprise me,\" Mr. Peres said of the claim, which seemed likely to  provide him with political benefit. \"I never wanted to use this, but now the picture is complete.\" **********There was no immediate reaction from the Likud and its leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a resurgence of popular support since the bombings. **********Mr. Abu Warda's appearance followed a day in which both Israeli and Palestinian security forces reported major operations in the West Bank and Gaza  to uproot support for Hamas, the Islamic movement that Israel blames for the terrorism. **********The Israeli police, who have imposed a tight siege on all Palestinian villages and towns, welded shut the doors of Islamic colleges in Hebron and in Abu Dis, near Jerusalem, because they are thought to be centers of Islamic militance. **********In Gaza the Palestinian police raided the Islamic University on Tuesday night, and later showed reporters weapons and hostile leaflets they said they found there. **********Both the Israelis and Palestinians reported scores of arrests, but officials  said the most wanted Hamas military leaders remained at large. **********The hourly reports of harsh actions and the televised interview with Mr. Abu  Warda were clearly intended to demonstrate that Israel and the Palestinian Authority were taking tough measures to curb Islamic militants. **********In the interview, Mr. Abu Warda also appealed to other Palestinians not to follow his example. **********\"I made a mistake,\" he said. \"I call on the sons of the Palestinian people that they should not repeat such actions, and should give the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government the opportunity to restore the situation the way it was, and provide security and calm for both peoples.\" **********According to an Israeli Army statement, Mr. Abu Warda, a resident of the Al Fawwar refugee camp near Hebron, and Abed Rabbo Sheikh Id, 26, from Rafah, in the Gaza Strip, both of whom were arrested in Ramallah on Sunday, were recruited and guided by a man they knew as Abu Ahmad, who is still at large. **********Their task was to prepare three suicide bombers, the lethal terror weapon that been used in Israel 12 times since April 1994, with a toll of 134 lives. The army said the bombers were Majdi Abu Warda, 19, a relative of Mohammed Abu Warda; Ibrahim Sarahne, 25, and Raed Shaghnuba, 21; all three were students at the same teacher's college. **********Shown in a dim red light, the slim, soft-spoken Mr. Abu Warda appeared nervous and frightened as he spoke about being instructed by the Hamas \"military wing\" in early February to find and prepare three young men for suicide missions. **********\"I acted according to the instructions of the military wing, and I prepared for them the people they wanted,\" he said. \"We established their trust. First I  spoke to them and indirectly felt their pulse, then I received their agreement in principle, then I worked with them directly, and in the end they agreed.\" **********After watching the interview, Prime Minister Peres said, \"We saw the head of  the snake just now.\" **********The Israeli police also reported that they had arrested an Arab with Israeli  citizenship who had confessed that he had smuggled the fourth bomber out of the  Gaza Strip by hiding him in a trunk under the back seat of his truck. He dropped the bomber at the Tel Aviv intersection shortly before the explosion there on Monday. **********The 45-year-old suspect, whose name was not given, told police he had no idea what his passenger intended to do. According to the police, he said he had made  the arrangements with a member of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza, and was paid $1,100 for the job. **********The Tel Aviv bomber has not yet been identified, but an anonymous call after  the blast said the bomber was a member of the Islamic Jihad, a small, radical group dedicated to violent action against Israel. **********In an interview on the television news after that with Mr. Abu Warda, Mr. Peres defended the actions he has ordered against Hamas. He said the fact that Mr. Abu Warda was recruited only four weeks earlier demonstrated the difficulties of gathering intelligence about terrorism. **********\"We are not taking only one measure,\" he said, looking calm and firm. \"There  are many measures being taken at the same time. We want to dry up their funding, we want international action to stop the funding, we want to see what seminaries they come from, to close these schools, to increase security.\" **********At the same time, Mr. Peres rejected the notion that the entire political process with the Palestinians was a mistake. \"Making peace sometimes requires going through a minefield of terrorism,\" he said. \"We have to see the alternative -- would it be intifada? murder? knives?\" **********As for Mr. Arafat, who has been under intense pressure from Israel to crack down on both the military and political wings of Hamas, Mr. Peres said, \"He's doing more than before.

They say she is unfit to portray their beloved Evita, wife of Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, the populist strongman who dominated Argentine politics for  nearly three decades. **********Days before Madonna arrived in Buenos Aires, the hard-liners began scrawling  graffiti around the capital that read: \"Evita Lives! Madonna, Get Out!\" **********President Carlos Saul Menem, a Peronist, told local newspapers that the musical is \"a libelous interpretation of Evita's life\" and that Madonna was \"unsuitable\" for the role. **********Several Congressional representatives have presented resolutions calling for  Madonna, her co-star, Antonio Banderas; the director, Alan Parker, and the rest  of the cast to be declared personae non gratae. **********\"It's an attack on our history, offensive to our dignity, an attack on Peronists, a humiliating lie,\" said Marta Rivadera, a Congresswoman who has called on Argentines not to work as extras in the $60 million production. \"Don't prostitute yourselves for $30 a day,\" she said. **********These sharply contrasting sentiments over a movie that has yet to begin production and is not scheduled for release until November suggest the depth of  feeling still engendered in Argentina by the name Peron, 43 years after Evita's  death and 21 years after the death of her husband. **********So powerful are the memories of Evita that each year on her birthday, Peronist Day, and the anniversary of her death, devotees bring roses and wreaths to the family tomb. **********Eva Duarte de Peron came to Buenos Aires from the provinces at age 15 and became a model and B-movie actress. Through her wits and dalliances, she rose to become the mistress and then the wife of Peron. As the First Lady, she built hospitals, schools and nurseries and pushed through women's suffrage. Her visits with lepers, lunches with the poor, lambasting of the rich and hoarding of wealth are legendary. **********The musical begins with Evita's efforts as a young girl to work her way out of poverty by using her good looks and her body. It depicts her meeting Peron and her rise to power, and it ends with her death from cancer in 1952, at age 33. **********Alex Ritchie, a spokesman for the movie production, denied local press reports that Mr. Parker, the director, was planning to move production to Hungary, where he is already filming some scenes. **********Madonna has said her portrayal of Eva Peron will not offend Argentines. In an interview with Caras, a local gossip magazine, she said: \"Many people see Eva Peron as either a saint or the incarnation of Satan. That means I definitely can identify with her. Some people in Argentina seem confused, as they've said things about my role which aren't true. It won't be scandalous.\" **********Liz Rosenberg, Madonna's press agent, said in a telephone interview from New  York that the pop singer fell in love with Argentina on a tour here a few years  ago and that she had done considerable research on Evita to prepare for the role. **********\"When you've got hundreds of kids outside the hotel screaming her name out each night, it's hard for her to believe that the whole country is against her,\" Ms. Rosenberg said. **********Although \"Evita\" was an international hit and won seven Tony awards in the United States, the musical has never been performed on a formal stage in Argentina. **********Tomas Eloy Martinez, a prominent author who is an expert on the Perons, attributes the controversy to ignorance of the musical in Argentina. **********\"This movie is based on a musical that has taken creative license in interpreting the life of Evita,\" Mr. Martinez said. \"It is not a factual biography and should not be viewed that way.\" **********Mr. Martinez said that if Argentines see the musical it will become clear to  them that \"Evita\" upholds their image of Eva Peron, especially through the well-known verse: \"Don't cry for me Argentina; the truth is, I never left you.\" **********At least one Peronist may be changing his mind about Madonna.

These \"engineers\" were once disdained in the world of broadcasting as interlopers without vision, unable to distinguish between turbines and televisions. **********No more. The decade since has been marked by the biggest swings ever in the networks' fortunes, with NBC smack in the middle of the turmoil. The network dominated the small screen until the end of the 1980's, before its ratings and profits collapsed, leaving it losses of $60 million in 1991 and just one prime-time show in the A. C. Nielsen top 10. Rumors swirled almost weekly that G.E. was about to bail out, selling NBC to Paramount, to Time Warner, or even to one of its stars, Bill Cosby. **********Critics placed considerable blame at the feet of G.E.; its chairman, John F.  Welch Jr., and the former G.E. executive placed in charge of NBC, Robert C. Wright. NBC's failure was inevitable, these critics said, because of interference from G.E. executives who simply did not understand broadcasting. **********But G.E. didn't sell, and Jack Welch is still around. So is Bob Wright, now by far the longest-lasting head of any network, and the longest-serving NBC chief executive since prewar radio days. **********Not only that, but NBC has emerged in the last nine months as the undisputed  leader of network television, with the five top-rated shows most weeks, now that ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" is over for the season. NBC accomplished this through a combination of astute programming strategy, a new team of division managers with a special talent for television production and the experience gained from having made numerous mistakes in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Of course, it also had a dose of the good luck that often seems to pass, at random, from network to network. Beyond all this, the company is now armed with  growing cable assets and is becoming a force in global communications. **********Suddenly the connection between NBC and its giant of a parent is being called crucial not just to the network's comeback, but to the vindication of Mr. Wright's once-maligned strategy of expanding into far-flung businesses. **********NBC has grown so strong so fast that there has been a backlash from both network rivals and Hollywood studio executives, who say NBC has displayed a grating arrogance. The friction has been most intense with Disney, ABC's new owner, with sniping over professional tactics and personal ethics reaching the top levels of both companies. **********Mr. Welch himself, though far from smug, does acknowledge that \"recovery is fun,\" clearly enjoying the industry's about-face on G.E. and NBC. **********A SHORT time after Mr. Murphy made his plea for ABC to stand up against the \"engineers,\" Mr. Welch met him on a golf course and could not resist \"ragging him.\" \"Here's the locomotive salesman,\" Mr. Welch said he told Mr. Murphy. **********For Mr. Welch, an engineer himself, who for 15 years has run what is now the  nation's most valuable company -- G.E.'s market value is three times Disney's -- the criticism that he and Mr. Wright faced after they took over the network was  \"a little bit of silliness.\" **********To him, television's unique mysteries were overrated anyway -- certainly easier to fathom than the brokerage business, where G.E. did stub its toe when it purchased Kidder, Peabody only to have to sell it later at a loss. **********\"Everyone in any business thinks their own business is unique,\" Mr. Welch said. \"This business has a distribution, like all businesses have distribution.  It requires revenues, which require a good sales force. So the issue is: What's  new? The only thing new is this content\" -- the programs. **********He did not, he added, have a mastery of other G.E. businesses, either. \"I don't know how to build an engine,\" he said. \"I don't know how to build a turbine. I don't know how to make a light bulb. What you have to do is get people who know how to do that.\" **********In 1986, he chose Mr. Wright, a lawyer who was then president of GE Capital and previously an executive with Cox Cable, as the man to lead NBC. And while the network was riding high in prime-time ratings, Mr. Wright walked in the door predicting trouble if the company did not diversify and get its costs in line. That did not endear him to most longtime NBC executives. But one who remains said, in essence, that Mr. Wright was right. **********\"We were fat,\" said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"Costs were out of control. Our union contacts were too costly. There was no accountability.\" **********The process of paring down cast a harsh public light on Mr. Wright and the new G.E. management, especially when much of the cost-cutting flowed through NBC News. Mr. Wright said he could never accept the premise that news should be a loss leader. \"The news division was losing $50 million or $60 million a year,\" Mr. Wright said, \"and I think they were projecting with a certain casualness that the number could get to be $100 million.\" **********So he began cutting news bureaus and eliminating jobs. These moves branded him in the eyes of critics as a broadcast outsider who cared less about news than about profits. **********Profits were certainly on his mind. In 1988, when NBC achieved record earnings of more than $500 million, the key, one senior executive said, was not  prime-time success, already fading by then, but that \"we had squeezed out $150 million in costs, mostly though staff reductions.\" **********The prime-time slide, however, soon caught up with NBC. By 1991, the network  was losing money -- though NBC as a whole was still profitable because of its television stations. The news division, then under Michael G. Gartner, who Mr. Welch said \"cleaned out a lot of the underbrush,\" had stemmed its losses but still lacked a prime-time news magazine program to generate profits. When it finally developed one, \"Dateline NBC,\" the program blew up in NBC's face -- almost literally -- over a report about truck safety that included faked gas-tank explosions. **********Mr. Wright acknowledged that he had some rocky moments. \"There was a lot of pressure,\" he said. But Mr. Welch said he never questioned Mr. Wright's capabilities. **********\"In the worst moment, never,\" he said. \"I knew Bob was better than anybody else we could have put in that business. He was always this good. He went through a cycle. And while he was going through this cycle he was building all these other assets.\" **********These assets included CNBC, the business news cable channel that analysts now value at more than $1 billion; a second cable channel, \"America's Talking,\" which led to a partnership with the Microsoft Corporation and which is about to  be converted to an all-news format; a Europe-based cable and satellite network called Super Channel, seen as the foundation of an ambitious plan to extend NBC  programming internationally, and stakes in numerous other cable channels, including Arts and Entertainment, Court TV, American Movie Classics, Bravo, Sports Channel America and the History Channel. NBC has also grabbed a huge portion of the sports television pie, having secured the rights to six of the next seven Olympic Games. **********This kind of expansion was Mr. Wright's stated goal when he arrived. That goal began to look misguided as the network's fortunes declined and Mr. Wright continued to push NBC toward adding costly new assets, like the Financial News Network, purchased in 1991 solely because CNBC could not have survived if forced to compete with another business news channel. The two rival channels were quickly merged. **********\"It was very difficult during the expansion,\" Mr. Wright said in an interview. \"The criticism in a situation like that is always, 'You should be spending more time on the core business.' It's one of those impossible-to-defend positions. On the other hand, if we had fixed the core and we didn't do any of these other things, we'd really be bad off now.\" **********ONE obvious key to NBC's turnaround was finding better shows. In part, it was simply NBC's turn for a favorable cycle in programming, but the network also developed a host of original shows that have been widely praised as the best of  their kind, including \"Seinfeld,\" \"E.R.\" and \"Friends.\" Significantly, when asked to cite a turning point, Mr. Wright does not mention any cable acquisitions or the cornering of most of the big sports events. \"It was more or  less the arrival of Don Ohlmeyer,\" Mr. Wright said. **********Mr. Ohlmeyer, whom Mr. Wright called an exceptional manager of the programming staff, joined NBC as head of its West Coast operation in 1993, when  the network had only one real hit show, \"Cheers,\" which had just announced that  it was ending production. But Mr. Wright was also quick to credit Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, with having made several moves  that were beginning to bear fruit when Mr. Ohlmeyer was hired. **********That February, with \"Cheers\" ending production, Mr. Littlefield was freed from an obligation to the show's owner, Paramount, to broadcast another Paramount show, \"Wings,\" immediately after it. Given that freedom, he made a move he had longed to make, putting \"Seinfeld,\" then merely a cult hit, in that  ideal time slot for the rest of that season. **********\"Seinfeld\" became an instant sensation, leading NBC's rebuilding of Thursday  into the strongest night in television. Other shows developed under Mr. Littlefield, like \"Mad About You,\" also started to emerge as hits at that time. **********Mr. Wright said Mr. Ohlmeyer was able to get the most out of those on the staff, and Mr. Welch credited the programming executive with bringing a sense of strength to the operations. \"The guy was a force,\" Mr. Welch said. \"In this business you can't have little people. You've got to have people that have an aura about them.\" **********IN adding Mr. Ohlmeyer, Mr. Wright was acting on a conclusion he had made after working with Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, who was running the only truly successful division at that time. Mr. Ebersol had been a producer, as had Mr. Ohlmeyer; both men moved from sports programming to entertainment shows. Mr. Wright decided that executives with expertise in how to put a show on television could make superior programmers and division managers. **********Having found two producers who could effectively lead divisions, Mr. Wright turned to a third when confronted with the crisis at NBC News in the wake of the \"Dateline NBC\" fiasco. Mr. Wright recruited Andrew Lack, a longtime producer at  CBS News, and, Mr. Lack said, \"He told me to just go produce the heck out of NBC News.\" The network news division turned around quickly, largely as a result of Mr. Lack's skillful salvage operation at \"Dateline,\" which expanded to two nights a week, then three and now four. **********On the same day in 1993 that Mr. Lack was appointed president of NBC News, Mr. Welch took the crucial step of declaring that NBC was not for sale, trying to put an end to the incessant speculation, both in the press and among stock analysts, that G.E. wanted to escape from a bad investment. **********In truth, a deal was almost completed with Paramount in 1992. Mr. Welch now says he intended to sell only a minority interest. But Mr. Wright said: \"He was  willing to take a minority position. At that juncture, he was concerned whether  any of the networks could really make it.\" **********Later, Mr. Welch and Mr. Wright considered sales of interests in NBC to several other companies, including Time Warner and, briefly, Disney, before that company moved on to acquire ABC. \"We also looked at Sony,\" Mr. Wright said, \"to  see whether we could exchange a piece of the network for a piece of their business.\" The proposed deal became so complicated, he said, that \"nobody could  figure out what the point of it was.\" **********Mr. Welch concedes that G.E. was lucky that none of the deals were consummated. \"This is not brain surgery,\" he said. \"Sometimes you end up stepping in the right pasture.\" **********But no matter what efforts G.E. made to sell all or part of NBC, the company  did not back away from supporting Mr. Wright's plan to diversify. That was clearest in 1991, when the decision was made that NBC had to buy the Financial News Network for CNBC to survive. **********\"We were in the midst of some very tough times at NBC,\" said Thomas Rogers, president of NBC Cable. \"And it was a very tough sell.\" At one point, the FNN deal looked dead when a G.E. vice chairman walked out of an NBC presentation on  the purchase. **********Mr. Welch rescued the idea. \"He said, 'Go out and show me that this gets us where we have to be, and I'll support it,' \" Mr. Rogers said. **********At that point Dow Jones was also bidding for FNN, but NBC concluded that a defeat would mean losing all of the money it had pumped into CNBC. \"It was a watershed moment,\" Mr. Rogers said. **********The bidding escalated far beyond what NBC thought the channel was worth. The  network eventually paid about $180 million, including a deal to share profits with the former owners. **********Mr. Welch said that once the decision was made to buy FNN and combine it with CNBC, G.E. was determined not to let the deal slip away. **********\"It was not a brilliant business decision by G.E. to bid $5 million more than Dow Jones,\" said Mr. Welch, whose company's market value is 36 times that of Dow Jones. \"But if we get in a public fight we can't go home. You can't have a $100 billion company walking away from a fight with a popcorn stand.\" **********For Mr. Welch, who subsequently put up $4 billion of G.E.'s money for Mr. Ebersol to acquire the Olympic rights and $23 million to buy a broken-down European network called Super Channel, it was a routine practice to back up NBC  with G.E. cash when it wasn't making much of its own. **********\"We can support businesses through change,\" he said. \"It is G.E.'s strength.  All our businesses never, unfortunately, are in sync. Treating NBC that way is no different from the way we're treating power systems right now and investing for the future there while they have short-term difficulties. Or the aircraft business, which we supported in the early 1990's when the airlines were in the soup.\" **********SUPER CHANNEL made sense, he said, simply because G.E. believes so strongly in giving its businesses a global reach. Mr. Welch said it was the very bigness  of G.E., previously a source of much of the criticism directed at NBC, that made it possible for NBC to take short-term risks for longer-term gains. \"If Super Channel loses a few million for a few years, we make $7 billion after taxes. We  can afford to wait and get it right.\" **********The deal that makes Mr. Welch's pulse race faster now is NBC's alliance with  Microsoft to create a challenger to the Cable News Network. \"The Microsoft thing has huge momentum and big players,\" he said, adding that it \"could change how we do information.\" **********The chairman's enthusiasm has made it easier for NBC to make fast decisions on big deals, several network executives say. Mr. Ebersol said \"it took maybe a  minute\" for Mr. Welch to agree to commit the money to lock up all those Olympics, even though it amounted to nearly two-thirds of what G.E. paid to buy  RCA. **********Mr. Welch also played an important role in backing Mr. Lack on creating a new studio for the \"Today\" show with a window onto Rockefeller Center. It cost $15 million, exorbitant for a cosmetic change. But Mr. Welch loved the idea, and the change in locale has helped propel \"Today\" to a leading position in morning television. **********Mr. Welch says his role is strictly \"cheerleader.\" Other NBC executives dispute that, saying he stays on top of most developments. \"Jack follows everything,\" Mr. Ebersol said. \"He knows about every new show.\" **********Most NBC executives say they also feel quite good about Mr. Wright now. After 10 years on the job, he is widely cited both inside and outside NBC as one of the brightest executives in television. **********Howard Stringer, now president of Tele-TV and Mr. Wright's longtime competitor when he was president of CBS, said: \"He's done a great job of turning everything around. He's pushed home NBC's advantage. He looks very smart now.\" **********Another senior NBC executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said,  \"Bob enjoys revolutionary, not evolutionary -- he wants to leap. People will say he hates the day-to-day stuff, which gives most of us a great deal of autonomy.\" **********The news channel with Microsoft is but the latest leap. In prime time, Mr. Ohlmeyer and Mr. Littlefield hatched an especially bold scheduling strategy, moving the hit show \"Frasier\" from a safe spot on Thursday to Tuesday, where it  took on what was then the highest-rated show in prime time, ABC's \"Home Improvement.\" The move set up a whole new night of hits for NBC. **********The network changed the look of prime time by eliminating all commercials between programs, instead bunching them in the middle of each show, and running  additional scenes from each show during the scroll of credits at the end to keep viewers tuned in. **********Mr. Wright has been at NBC long enough to have seen the program cycles from every angle: up, down, then up again. \"Institutional memory is valuable,\" he said. He noted that he and Mr. Littlefield had been around to see how deals with powerful producers prevented NBC from making moves that might have revived the network earlier. \"Warren and I were bound together in the conviction that we would not repeat those mistakes,\" he said. **********Mr. Wright speculated that it might be NBC's much more aggressive control of  its own scheduling, keeping that power away from the production companies and studios, that accounts for some of the feeling in Hollywood that the network's executives have grown arrogant. **********As one longtime studio executive put it, \"These NBC guys think they own the world now.\" **********Executives from NBC and Disney, the new owner of ABC, have been involved in an increasingly public dust-up over Disney's effort to woo Jamie McDermott, an NBC programming executive. The conflict inspired Mr. Welch to send a sharply worded letter to the Disney chairman, Michael D. Eisner.    NBC executives have openly questioned negotiating tactics that they say have  included the spreading of rumors about Mr. Ohlmeyer's behavior toward Ms. McDermott. Mr. Ohlmeyer has attributed the rumors to Michael Ovitz, the new president of Disney. **********Ms. McDermott completely disavowed making any charge about Mr. Ohlmeyer's behavior. But the friction between the networks increased when Mr. Ohlmeyer, after denying any wrongdoing in his conduct as Ms. McDermott's supervisor, publicly upbraided Mr. Ovitz as having stirred up the rumors. **********Mr. Ovitz has declined to make any public response, but in a call to Mr. Welch he denied doing anything improper. **********The episode has raised the stakes between the networks and their giant corporate parents. But Mr. Wright said: \"I don't think this thing is particularly substantive. I'm looking forward to putting it behind us.\" **********LOOKING forward, Mr. Wright sees one leap he wants NBC to take in the near future. \"The one weak spot we have here is we don't have another entertainment-oriented vehicle,\" Mr. Wright said. Adding a separate entertainment cable channel, along the lines of TNT or the USA Network, is now \"a very specific objective,\" he said. **********G.E.'s new objectives, however, clearly don't include a sale of the network.  Holding onto NBC is, as Mr. Welch put it, \"a no-brainer.\" **********He noted that NBC was probably worth $6 billion today, a tiny fraction of G.E.'s total market value of close to $130 billion. **********\"Say we screw NBC up, O.K.? CBS was the most-screwed up and it was still worth $5 billion\" Mr. Welch said. \"The upside for NBC is $15 billion to $20 billion. So if I'm screwing it up, I'm down to 129, O.K.? If I make it, I'm up to 145 or 150.\" **********That's $150, as in billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/world/serbs-answer-to-oppression-their-web-site.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1996-12-08", "snippet": "Radio B92, independent radio station recently forced off the air by Serbian authorities, has begun digital broadcasts on anti-Government protests over audio Internet links; tens of thousands of students, journalists and others are believed to be c...", "word_count": 1043, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serbs' Answer to Oppression: Their Web Site", "print_headline": "Serbs' Answer to Oppression: Their Web Site", "body_text": " **********When President Slobodan Milosevic, faced with large anti-Government demonstrations, tried to shut down the last vestiges of an independent news outlet last week, he unwittingly spawned a technological revolt he may soon regret. **********Tens of thousands of students, professors, professionals and journalists immediately connected their computers to Internet web sites across the globe. **********The independent outlet that was forced off the air for two days by the Government, Radio B92, used that time to begin digital broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian and English over audio Internet links. And its web site took over the reporting on the protests, which were set off by the Government's annulment of municipal elections won by the opposition. **********The radio station, which has been the main source of news here, is back on the air as the Government has eased its response to the protests and hinted it might reconsider the annulment of the elections. **********But the experience awakened the protesters here to the tremendous potential at their fingertips, and independent journalists have rushed forward at a dizzying speed with plans to bypass Government transmitters, news agencies and television studios and to use the Internet to carry their message across Serbia and to the outside world. **********''It was the home page put out by B92 that saved the revolution now under way in Serbia,'' said Sasa Vucinic, managing director of the Media Development Loan Fund, a nonprofit group that supports independent news and information outlets in Eastern Europe. **********''In the early days of the protests, before the international media arrived, it was the only way most people outside Belgrade could hear about what was happening,'' he said. ''And the moment the radio signal from B92 was cut, the Internet took over. Mailboxes of government officials in Europe, humanitarian agencies, journalists and supporters were flooded within hours with the news of the closure. A campaign began over the Internet to save the station. The Internet has become the movement's lifeline.'' **********Anti-Government demonstrations continued in Belgrade today as thousands of students marched to the office of the Government news agency to protest its coverage of the marches. **********Many students, professors and professionals here have computers, and most people who do not seem to know someone who does. And the ties to the Internet are expected to take a huge leap forward within the next few days. **********B92, which has had a site on the web for a year, is in the process of concluding a deal with supporters in the Amsterdam-based access service XS4ALL to record all its programming digitally and broadcast it over the Internet 24 hours a day. That would mean anyone in Serbia with access to a computer could hear the news over Internet audio links. **********Local radio stations could rebroadcast the news from the Internet, and if the stations were forbidden to carry the news reports, groups could gather around a computer and hear the news there, something many did when the radio was closed for two days last week. **********Some 400,000 Serbs are living abroad, many of them young men who avoided the draft. Large numbers of them, starved for information, gather daily, often in the homes of friends who have computers in Prague, Vienna and Berlin, to pull up the Serbian web sites. During the turmoil in Belgrade over the last three weeks, some of those Serbs have organized protests in European cities. **********''The irony is that the Government meant to silence us, but instead forced us to build on a whole new technology to stay alive,'' said Drazen Pantic, head of the radio's Internet service. ''The drive to close us down has given us a tool to vastly expand our audience.'' **********Government officials ordered the deans of the Belgrade University departments on Thursday to stop students from using university computers to send messages and receive information over the Internet. But with nearly all the professors in the universities backing the student protests, the order has been ignored, and university computer centers remain jammed with students. **********''We have taken over all the computers in the foreign language department and use them for the students' movement,'' said Natasa Milinkovic, 21. **********It is not clear how many users log on to the B92 service, especially as many companies in Europe and the United States have begun to ''mirror'' the web pages sent out from Belgrade. But the number is in the thousands just in Serbia. **********Serbian Internet users have even drawn up plans in case the Government attempts to cut the Internet lines. Thousands of faxes of eggs, sent over the Internet, will flood government fax machines. Eggs are often thrown during street protests. **********Internet users in Europe can log on to the B92 web site at the address http://www.xs4all.nl/opennet. In the United States, the address is http://www.siicom.com/odrazb. **********Users can pull up a page, with graphics, that will give the latest news about the protests from Serbia. **********Today a three-minute news broadcast in English and Serbo-Croatian was available. ''Lord David Owen contacted the Students' Protest 96 today via Internet and said that if there was anything that he could do in this private capacity to help them, he would,'' said the announcer, Julia Glyn-Pickett, a Briton who teaches English at the university and works for the radio station.

He and nine friends, though they say they do not support President Milosevic, have formed a group to sabotage the nascent Internet. **********''The Internet is a dehumanizing addiction and the greatest single threat to human civilization,'' said Mr. Karapandea. ''Fortunately the people who rule Serbia don't understand its danger; otherwise they would help it to grow.

Morneau obsesses about the ones that got away. Take, for example, the whopper off the Angolan coast three years  ago -- a big deep water oilfield that Mr. Morneau, a geophysicist for the Chevron Corporation, still suspects was down there. **********But months had elapsed by the time the ship's seismic readings could be processed by a supercomputer back on land, yielding clues on where to probe further for petroleum. And only then were errors discovered in the original navigational data. The company could not relocate that promising fishing hole. **********Had we known right away,\" Mr. Morneau recalled, still wistful, \"we could have made a correction.\" **********But now, thanks to a communications technology breakthrough with implications that go far beyond the petroleum industry, oil hunters like Mr. Morneau may soon be able to receive billions of bytes of offshore seismic data and process it back on land in \"real time.\" That would enable them to instruct the ship gathering the data to go back quickly for another sweep over a tantalizing spot. **********The technology is based on a high-speed satellite system born of a collaboration between the Government and industry. And it promises not only to put a powerful new tool in the hands of the oil industry, but may also have applications for doctors in remote sites or emergency workers coping with disasters in isolated locales. **********During a recent demonstration, Mr. Morneau and several colleagues sat excitedly in front of computer screens in a Washington office perusing supercomputer analysis of data gathered minutes earlier from a ship 1,500 miles away. The vessel, the M/V Geco Diamond, towed a set of steel cable \"streamers\" with hundreds of hydrophones that measured sound waves being bounced off rock and salt formations thousands of feet below the azure surface of the Gulf of Mexico. **********Using the satellite's return link, the scientists in Washington communicated  by voice, video and text with experts aboard the Geco Diamond, 120 miles offshore from Galveston, Tex., directing them to adjust their course to focus on particularly promising formations. **********\"This compresses into seconds what often can take a year,\" Mr. Morneau said,  scanning the data. **********The breakthrough comes at a time when the oil industry is using ever-more sophisticated seismic analysis to venture into ever-deeper waters to find oilfields -- like the giant Mars site that the Shell Oil Company is now developing in 2,940 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico. **********Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, in whose Washington headquarters the demonstration occurred, said the new satellite capabilities will help the industry's deep-water efforts. \"This cuts the cycle time,\" Mr. DiBona said. \"We're talking about producing a lot more oil.\" **********Or maybe even saving lives. As part of the demonstration, Dr. Michael DeBakey, the well-known heart surgeon, sat at a computer terminal at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology in the Texas Medical Center in Houston. **********As an audience of doctors and communications experts looked on, Dr. DeBakey studied a cardiogram simulating the heart attack of a crewman in the infirmary aboard the Geco Diamond. He also used video and audio links to observe the crewman's symptoms. **********Thus informed, Dr. DeBakey advised the infirmary staff on the steps to take to stabilize the crewman and prepare him for helicopter transport back to shore. **********Satellite data transmissions are nothing new, of course. But even today, when one can communicate from almost anywhere, it has been difficult to dispatch vast amounts of data at high speeds from offshore vessels or from remote hospitals or isolated weather stations. **********The breakthrough is made possible by a NASA satellite called ACTS. It sends and receives data through powerful, highly concentrated spot beams that can focus on nearly any place in North America and its surrounding waters. **********Thus with only two small racks of satellite and telecommunications equipment  and a 16-inch antenna, the crew of the Geco Diamond was able to beam up two million bits of seismic data a second to the ACTS satellite 22,300 miles above the Equator. With a second spot beam, temporarily focused on a receiver antenna  at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the spacecraft bounced the data back to earth, where it was relayed to Minneapolis for processing by a Cray Research supercomputer. **********Within about 15 minutes of the raw data's capture by the Geco Diamond, the supercomputer's analysis was forwarded to the Petroleum Institute and to the Houston research centers of major companies involved in oil exploration that included Amoco, Schlumberger and Shell. **********The system is precisely the kind of civilian use of federally backed technology that the Government has been eager to cultivate since the end of the  cold war. It was developed over the last two years in a collaboration involving  a group of companies including Amoco, Shell, Chevron and Schlumberger; Federal agencies including the Energy Department and NASA, and several of the national research organizations, led by Sandia National Laboratories. **********The idea grew out of scribblings on a napkin during dinner two years ago at a microbrewery in San Francisco. The diners were David Beering, a NASA senior telecommunications analyst, and Raymond Cline Jr., a Sandia researcher. **********Their thoughts had turned to NASA's launching the previous autumn, in September 1993, of an Advanced Communications Technology Satellite, the first spacecraft that could theoretically handle digital data of up to 622 million bits a second. As the napkin diagram took form, they concluded that their system should operate at about 45 million bits a second. At such speeds the World Book  Encyclopedia could be transmitted in about one minute. **********Unlike most previous satellites, which might cover the entire continent with  a 75-watt signal, NASA's ACTS spacecraft uses high-intensity beams that can focus the 75 watts on a spot only 150 miles in diameter. **********These focused beams can provide high-quality transmission through small antennae like the 16 inch by 4 inch flat plate used on the Geco Diamond. **********But the ACTS digital satellite link, while crucial, is only the first leg of  the trip. The entire setup, known as Aires, is also heavily reliant on the ground-based fiber optic networks operated by telecommunications carriers like AT&T, MCI and Sprint, which have been adopting a new high-speed transmission format known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode networking. **********A.T.M., as this technology is known, is a way of shipping digital information in uniform packets that can be sent via satellite, fiber optic or coaxial cable  or even copper telephone wire without requiring the costly and time-consuming format conversions that have long dogged data communications. **********Mr. Beering said the concept was similar to the shipping industry's development of uniform box-car-like containers that can be handled by truck, boat, train or airplane. **********The system uses about $1 billion worth of equipment and communication networks. NASA's cost to build and launch the satellite was about $750 million.  The other Government agencies and the corporations involved picked up the additional $250 million in equipment costs. **********So far, about 100 companies and research groups have tested the system. The Boeing Company, for example, used the system to link its wind tunnels in Seattle with supercomputers at a NASA research center in Cleveland. Engineers sent wind-tunnel readings on an engine inlet, then used the supercomputer's analysis to make design changes as the tests were still under way. **********But it was the oil industry that was particularly interested in getting involved in the Aires project, as petroleum companies look for ways to make more efficient use of data-intensive oil-exploration technology. **********Mr. Zernic recalls that when the ACTS satellite program was authorized by Congress in the early 1980's, his agency was eager to show that the effort would have practical applications. And Aires has demonstrated just that, Mr. Zernic contends. \"We have to make good with the U.S. taxpayer's dollar,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/13/business/casino-looks-at-iowa.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-13", "snippet": "Casino America Inc says it will build $70 million casino on Raccoon River near Des Moines, Iowa, if Dallas County voters approve riverboat gambling; seeks to get gambling referendum on ballot (S)", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Casino Looks at Iowa", "print_headline": "Casino Looks at Iowa", "body_text": " **********Casino America Inc. said today that it would build a $70 million casino on the Raccoon River near Des Moines if voters there approve riverboat gambling.

Trading was halted at $56.75, down $1.625 a share, on a day when the stocks of other big American auto makers also declined. **********Chrysler staved off some of Mr. Kerkorian's key demands, said Jerome B. York, a former Chrysler chief financial officer who went to work for Mr. Kerkorian last fall. **********\"In any compromise, both parties to the transaction get some of the things they want but not all of the things they want,\" Mr. York said, adding that the pact was \"good for the shareholders.\" **********Under the agreement, Mr. Kerkorian can now sell some of his stock back to the company in proportion to the 13.8 percent stake held by his Tracinda Corporation. Beyond the buyback, he can sell additional stock on the market immediately, subject to some limitations. **********\"I don't think Chrysler gave away anything,\" said Philip K. Fricke, an auto analyst at Prudential Securities. \"All of what Chrysler said was hedged, and the hedge was 'economic conditions permitting,' \" when it comes to the stock buybacks. **********In a sense, Mr. Kerkorian, who tried to mount an ill-fated takeover attempt last April, had long ago achieved partial victory by talking up the value of Chrysler's shares, and his own holdings are now valued at $2.95 billion. **********When he first expressed his unhappiness with the stock price, the shares were trading at about $45 and his spokesman said Mr. Kerkorian believed they were worth $70 or more. His initial purchases in 1990 averaged about $12 a share. Despite the huge profits since, Mr. York said Tracinda had no plans to sell now. **********The heart of the fight centered on Chrysler management's insistence that it maintain a $7.5 billion rainy-day fund. Mr. York had argued that the company was stronger now, better able to withstand a downturn in the auto market and therefore needed far less money. Chrysler management refused to budge. **********But Mr. Kerkorian, who had sought a board seat for Mr. York and two others, instead got 2 seats on a 14-member board for directors he likes, one of them a longtime lieutenant, James D. Aljian. The other, announced by Chrysler on Wednesday, is John B. Neff, the prominent mutual fund manager, who retired from  the helm of the highly successful Vanguard Windsor Fund last year. His selection was by mutual assent. Mr. York was kept off the board. **********Mr. Kerkorian said: \"As a major Chrysler investor since 1990, we have long believed the company has the potential to generate significant long-term value for shareholders. We are pleased that we now have the framework for a constructive relationship.\" **********Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, said, \"Kirk Kerkorian has been a long-term and important investor in Chrysler and we are very pleased that we could resolve those issues which will allow the Chrysler team to remain focused on building value for all of our shareholders and on building high-value cars and trucks for consumers.\" **********Chrysler agreed to push for the sale of its non-automotive assets, including  its rental-car company. In all, Mr. Kerkorian values these businesses at roughly $1.4 billion. **********Significantly, the company agreed to remove its legal defenses against a takeover bid as long as the offer was fully financed and gave shareholders a premium price for their stock. However, just as Mr. Kerkorian's bid failed for lack of financing, a takeover of Chrysler would demand at least $21.5 billion at today's market prices. **********While there is no immediately apparent buyer for Chrysler now, foreign giants like Fiat have been interested in the past. Chrysler will become a smaller company at a time when the other large American auto makers, the General Motors  Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, are so large as to be virtually impossible for any one to afford, while most European and Asian car companies are part of conglomerates that make them difficult to swallow, too. **********Among the reactions today from institutional investors, Seth M. Glickenhaus,  a New York money manager with more than three million Chrysler shares, said: \"As a shareholder, I'm elated they're going to double their purchases of shares this year and spend another $1 billion next year. I'm glad they're giving a 15 percent holder of the stock a place on the board.\" **********And Mauricio Kohn, an auto analyst at the Lefco Group, a business-valuation firm in Troy, Mich., outside Detroit, said Mr. Kerkorian had clearly received a setback in not putting Mr. York on the Chrysler board. But the long rise in Chrysler's stock during the five years Mr. Kerkorian has held it may provide considerable consolation, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/business/enron-to-supply-jordan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Enron to Supply Jordan", "print_headline": "Enron to Supply Jordan", "body_text": " **********Jordan has signed a letter of intent with the Enron Corporation to build a $300 million plant in Aqaba to supply Jordan as well as Israel with natural gas  from Qatar in the year 2000, energy officials said today.

It was not until Christmas 1927 that he landed his first client, designing an ad featuring  silverware and watches for a neighborhood jewelry store. **********Realizing that radio could be a powerful advertising medium, he moved so fast to capitalize on his idea that by 1929 Publicis was the exclusive agent for all  18 Government-run radio stations. **********He so saturated the airwaves with commercials that five years later the Government banned advertising on state-run stations. **********Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet, who tended to read such setbacks as opportunities, reacted by buying a private station in Paris and transforming it into Radio Cite. It became the first station in France to broadcast from 6 A.M. to midnight and the first to offer contests, commercial jingles, talent searches and on-the-scene news reporting, not to mention the first to broadcast the music of  Maurice Chevalier and Edith Piaf. **********By 1939 his booming company had expanded into film distribution and even operated a chain of movie theaters, but the outbreak of World War II changed all that. **********After serving as an intelligence agent for de Gaulle, Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet  fled, one step ahead of Nazi agents, making it safely to Spain by truck hiding under loads of vegetables and coal. Going on to England, Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet, a lifelong aviation buff, flew reconnaissance missions over Germany, returning to Paris for the liberation, only to find that retreating German forces had blown up his radio station a day earlier. **********Undeterred as usual, Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet, who liked to boast that he had been a millionaire at 25 and ruined by 40, started over, rebuilding his business into one of the world's largest advertising agencies with such long-term clients as Renault, Nestle, L'Oreal and Shell. **********The success brought the fulfillment of a lifelong dream when he acquired an old hotel that had been used as Allied headquarters in World War II and made it  his corporate headquarters, giving him an address on the Champs-Elysees. **********In 1988 he put together what he called a grand alliance, teaming up with the  American agency Foote, Cone & Belding to form Publicis-FCB, which now operates the second largest advertising network in Europe, with annual billings of $3.3 billion. **********For all his success in advertising, he made his most visible contribution to  French culture in 1958 when he transformed the ground floor of his headquarters  into Le Drugstore, a 24-hour emporium complete with a movie theater, gift shop,  soda fountain and even a pharmacy. **********The business was such a success, drawing hordes of shoppers during the day and a chic late-night clientele, that he later opened several others in Paris. **********But for all its popularity with French shoppers (and tourists),there are those who have never forgiven Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet for what he did to their sacred French language by introducing an ungainly alien term. **********Purists were so aghast that the Prime Minister begged him to call it \"Bazaar,\" and a member of the French Academy suggested \"Pan.\" Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet, noting that one word was Turkish and the other Greek, said an American name was good enough for him. **********Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet, who became a leading philanthropist with lavish support for the arts and cultural causes, was also highly active in Jewish affairs and an outspoken supporter of Israel. **********He is survived by his wife, Sophie; and two daughters, Elisabeth Badinter and Michele Bleustein-Blanchet, and several grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/10/world/at-the-dmz-another-invasion-tourists.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1996-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At the DMZ, Another Invasion: Tourists", "print_headline": "At the DMZ, Another Invasion: Tourists", "body_text": " **********The South Korean Government has declared the situation on the North Korean border to be extremely dangerous.

One North Korean man in a suit was videotaping the South side. **********The only visible sign of the incidents that took place here Friday, Saturday  and Sunday nights was that the North Koreans were not wearing the armbands required under the terms of the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. Their absence and the recent incursions by as many as 300 North Korean troops are intended to show that the Communist state has renounced the armistice in the hope of negotiating a peace treaty with the United States, bypassing South Korea. **********One American soldier on watch pointed his eyes to the nearby fields where North Koreans troops dug some trenches during their recent incursions into the Panmunjom area, known as the joint security area. **********Mr. Coles said that at three other times in recent years North Korean troops  had made similar incursions, the last time about a year ago. Yet those actions attracted relatively little news coverage. **********A big reason the incursions have aroused so much attention this time is the strong statements by South Korea's Government. Many analysts, and certainly opposition politicians, say that South Korea's Government is playing up the incidents to help President Kim Young Sam's New Korea Party win in elections for the National Assembly on Thursday. **********The Government, perhaps recognizing the incongruity of extra-vigilant troops  and nonchalant tourists, said today that it would prohibit South Koreans from touring Panmunjon for the time being. But tours for Americans and other foreigners will continue, Mr. Coles said. **********Still, American officials appear to be more worried than the military spokesmen let on. President Clinton, who was to make essentially a courtesy call on President Kim next Tuesday before heading on to Japan, has extended the meeting on South Korea's Cheju Island to nine hours from three hours to allow more time for discussions. **********One worry is that if the incursions continue, they will further erode relations on the Korean Peninsula. **********A conservative opposition party in South Korea has already called for suspending the latest round of talks now taking place in New York on providing North Korea with modern nuclear reactors. The deal, signed in 1994, was intended to prevent North Korea from being able to produce nuclear weapons. **********Another concern is that with each new incursion, the risk grows of a miscalculation that could lead to a skirmish. **********A skirmish, however, does not necessarily mean war. There have been 700 armed incidents in the demilitarized zone since the end of the Korean War in 1953, Mr. Coles said, including one last fall when a North Korean trying to sneak into South Korea was shot dead. **********The heart of Panmunjom, the village where the armistice was signed in 1953, is what is known as \"conference row,\" a series of low buildings in which meetings between the two sides are held. **********Some 11 tour buses come through the area each day, carrying a total of about  900 people.

The stakes are even higher when the employee is moving to a city with a high cost of living, like New York or San Francisco. **********When moving employees, many companies used to buy their old houses for a fair price, hire a mover, pay temporary living expenses and guarantee to buy the new  house from the employee for the original purchase price if the company moved the employee again. **********\"In the past, the company would say to the executive, 'Mr. Jones, we need you to move to Chicago,' \" Ms. Ehrlich said. \"And Mr. Jones would say, 'Fine. Here's my house. You sell it. I'm having enough trouble just moving my family.' \" **********Until recently, Ms. Ehrlich said, many companies would consent to Mr. Jones's suggestion because the company's primary concern was to get the executive to the new city and back to work as quickly as possible. In many cases, the company would lose money on the sale because of the cost of carrying the house while waiting for a buyer or because it could not be sold for as much as the employee  paid for it. **********As a result, Ms. Ehrlich said, companies started to ask employees to take part in the sales of their homes. The employees did so, but not always in a way  that helped the company. **********\"Some transferees would try to sell their houses for 20 to 30 percent over what they were worth,\" Ms. Ehrlich said. \"They could shoot for the moon because  they knew that if they didn't get the moon, they'd at least get the fair market  value from their employer.\" **********Recently, however, employers have become even more determined to persuade their employees to market their houses aggressively and realistically. **********\"Today, most companies require an employee to market the property within 5 to 10 percent of the appraised value,\" Ms. Ehrlich said. And to insure the employee's cooperation, an increasing number of companies are offering incentives for quick sales. **********\"Some companies give bonuses amounting to 2 or 3 percent of the sale price,\"  Ms. Ehrlich said. \"And since the company saves money by not having to take the house into inventory, it's a win-win situation.\" **********Herb Gousha, vice president and director of credit and financial services for Brown-Forman, a beverage company in Louisville, Ky., said his company's policy of paying employees who are moved 2 percent bonuses for selling their houses had been \"quite motivational.\" **********Some companies are also providing lump-sum payments for living expenses while the employee is house-hunting in the new city. **********\"Many employers are trying to get their employees more involved in the relocation process by sweetening the pot,\" said Cris Collie, executive vice president of the Employee Relocation Council, a trade organization based in Washington. Traditionally, Mr. Collie said, temporary living expenses for transferees were paid with few questions asked by the employer. As a result, transferred employees staying in hotels had little incentive to live frugally when room service was just a telephone call away. **********\"But when you give an employee a lump-sum payment for temporary living,\" Mr.  Collie said, \"you not only eliminate the necessity for reviewing scores of individual receipts, you also give the employee an incentive to manage the relocation more effectively so he or she can pocket whatever is left over.\" **********NOTHER benefit that is being modified is loss-on-sale protection. Until recently, many companies guaranteed employees who are being moved that they would buy back the new house for the purchase price if the company moved them again, regardless of swings in the market or whether the purchase was imprudent. That, however, provided employees with little incentive to get the best deal when buying a house. **********Ellie Monty, president of Dotsero Inc., a relocation consulting and publishing company in Hinsdale, Ill., said many companies now require employees  to get an appraisal to determine the market value of a home before buying it. In many cases, she said, that helps the company and the employee. **********Jacques and Laura Poincloux recently moved from West Columbia, Tex., to Newtown, Conn., after Mr. Poincloux took a new job, with Ciba-Geigy in Brewster, N.Y. Mrs. Poincloux said that after selling their three-bedroom home in Texas for $65,000, they bought a four-bedroom home in Connecticut for $276,000. **********Because Ciba-Geigy was offering Mr. Poincloux loss-on-sale protection, the company wanted the house appraised. It was satisfied when the appraisal came in  at $280,000. **********\"Loss-on-sale protection has been a wonderful safety net for employees,\" Ms.  Monty of Dotsero said. \"But you don't need a net if you don't make mistakes in the first place.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/10/world/brazil-government-changes-rules-for-creating-indian-reservations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 293, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil Government Changes Rules for Creating Indian Reservations", "print_headline": "Brazil Government Changes Rules for Creating Indian Reservations", "body_text": " **********Brazil, trying to resolve a dispute between businessmen and Indians over land, rewrote the rules today for creating reservations over the protests of Indian activists who say their homelands are at risk. **********\"Lots of Indian areas now run a serious risk of being reduced,\" warned Roberto Liebgopt, secretary of the Indigenous Missionary Council, a Roman Catholic Church group. **********About 210 reservations have been created in Brazil since the introduction in 1991 of rules that effectively left non-Indians with no right to appeal decisions to create reservations.

At midnight, the deadline had passed for all combatants to move out of the zone that separates Muslim from Serb with their weapons. The three Serbs would, in theory, have to hand over their guns. **********The Serbs squinted at a copy of the deadlines in the peace agreement that Sgt. Lee Bruneau, 25, gave them. Finally, looking over five American soldiers with their own guns ready, one Serb with graying hair lifted his palms and, in English, said, \"Yes, Yes.\" **********Sir, he understands what's going on,\" Sergeant Bruneau, of Lewiston, Me., who was trying to translate, told Capt. Hugo Jackson, commander of Company C, Fourth Battalion, 12th Infantry. \"He has no problem giving up the weapons.\" **********Captain Jackson picked up the two rifles from beside a picket fence. The Serbian soldiers all lit cigarettes. And at a cold corner on the front line in Bosnia, one of the trickiest aspects of the NATO-led mission -- disarming combatants who do not comply with the Dayton agreement -- went off peacefully. **********These were the only two weapons that Company C saw all day, a sign here -- as is apparently true around Bosnia and Herzegovina -- that the factions have largely moved back from the front lines, as specified in the agreement. **********There is surely no guarantee that future attempts to take away weapons -- a step the peacekeeping forces are authorized to take starting today -- will go this smoothly. With weapons so much a part of Bosnian culture, and so ever-present a threat in three and a half years of war, complete disarmament in  the zone may represent one of the biggest dangers to the peacekeepers. **********So it was no surprise that after they pulled away from this town this morning, several soldiers in Charlie Company cracked big smiles. **********\"Hey, the soldiers did an outstanding job,\" Captain Jackson said, relieved that all went well. \"I'm proud of them. Not a shot fired. Today is a good day, snow and all.\" **********Sergeant Bruneau, who has been leading squads of young soldiers through empty Serb bunkers and trenches all week, tried to figure out what the Serbs were thinking. **********\"They were not happy, but they were not too much upset,\" he said as he walked away from the three. These had been joined by a civilian in ratty white sneakers, who, ambiguously, wished the Americans goodbye and thanked them. **********Sergeant Bruneau pondered whether this scene signaled peace for the moment: that the zone seemed largely clear and that the Serbs gave up their weapons with resigned shrugs. Then he himself gave up, somehow unable to answer one of the most pressing questions in Europe. **********\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to do my mission.\" **********The seized guns were a morale booster for Company C, which on Wednesday set up a round-the-clock checkpoint 2,500 feet up a mountain near the confrontation  lines where a quarter of the company, about 30 men, have been sleeping amid bunkers, spent ammunition and 21 documented antipersonnel mines. None in the warring factions have even tried to pass through. **********\"Ooooohhh, that's what I need,\" Sgt. Manuel Ortiz, 37, said at the snow-covered camp this morning when Captain Jackson pulled up and showed the troops the two weapons. \"Burn those things.\" (United States military officials had decided that in some cases they would destroy seized weapons to show a resolve they said the United Nations peacekeepers lacked. Captain Jackson, on orders, stuck the two today in the back of his Humvee.) **********Pfc. William Urbaniak, 21, of Lockport, N.Y., said he hoped the guns would be the first of many taken in the coming weeks, now that the deadline for vacating  the 2.5-mile-wide zone of separation had passed. **********\"It feels like what we're out here to do: keep everybody apart,\" he said. \"I'm glad we finally have the chance to do something -- do something good.\" **********Whether or not the United States is actually doing something good remains a topic of debate among the soldiers here, as the second month of the yearlong peacekeeping mission begins. Many soldiers in Company C continue to believe the  mission in Bosnia is a dangerous waste of time. **********\"They'll start this up again when we leave,\" said Specialist Ronald Toler, 22, of Orlando, Fla., whose mother-in-law is Croatian. **********But others say that the month of seeing firsthand the scarred countryside, the demolished houses, the people living off cabbage on rugged hillsides has either convinced them that the United States does have a role here or strengthened that conviction. **********\"I agreed with coming here,\" said Specialist Anthony Galindo, 23, a gunner from Los Angeles. \"These people have a very rough life. Now since I've been here it has made me agree with myself even more.\" **********Captain Jackson, 29, more gung-ho and decidedly less diplomatic than his superiors, seems to feel frustration that Company C cannot do more: he was eager to take over a Serbian ammunition warehouse right next to the company's camp in  Ninici, but he said his superiors said the building was outside the zone of separation and thus off limits. **********The same logic went for disarming men with AK-47's on the streets and, most bothersome to him, for removing five Serbian artillery pieces on a ridge that were just outside the zone but were pointing toward the Muslim side. Captain Jackson said he had been instructed \"not to mess with them.\" What did he think of that order? \"I'm not going to say,\" he said. **********Back at the camp, a sense of security is growing greater every day. This week, a company of artillery pieces set up a cornfield away and the concertina wire finally arrived. **********On Friday night, the missing third of Company C, the third platoon, arrived.  This means more men to pull middle-of-the-night guard duty, and the mechanics and medics, who normally do not pull guard, will be relieved of the duty. **********\"It isn't like winning the Lotto,\" said David Cullinan, 31, of Chicago. \"But  with the sleep I'll get, I'll wake up feeling like a million bucks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/06/business/car-companies-in-united-states-hurt-by-imports.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1996-12-06", "snippet": "Japanese and European car companies roar back into US market this fall by cutting prices and increasing rebates, posing greatest challenge for US companies in several years; dollar has increased 15.3 percent against German mark and 41 percent agai...", "word_count": 1663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Car Companies In United States Hurt by Imports", "print_headline": "Car Companies In United States Hurt by Imports", "body_text": " **********Japanese and European auto makers have come roaring back in the United States this autumn, by cutting prices and increasing rebates. **********After several years of gradually winning back buyers, American auto makers, particularly General Motors, are facing their toughest competition since the early 1990's. **********The dollar has risen powerfully,  increasing 15.3 percent against the German mark and 41 percent against the Japanese yen since hitting respective lows against them in March and April 1995. This has allowed foreign auto makers to charge fewer dollars for their cars and still convert them into as much or more money in their home currencies. **********At the same time, Japanese auto makers are introducing new models that were designed to be assembled at low cost, while luxury European auto makers like Mercedes-Benz are producing less expensive models that compete more directly with Lincoln and Cadillac. **********The result of these changes was apparent in November sales. The two biggest Japanese auto makers in the American market, Toyota and Honda, and the two biggest European auto makers, Volkswagen and BMW, all reported sales gains of 13 to 29 percent in November from a year earlier. By contrast, sales for Chrysler rose only 1.4 percent, Ford Motor sales fell 2.2 percent and sales at G.M., which has been hurt by  strikes and a slow introduction of new models, dropped 11.8 percent. **********All of these foreign and domestic auto makers had similar results in October, with the exception of Chrysler, which did well in the month. **********One indication of the significant gains by Japanese auto makers is the race for best-selling car this year. The Ford Taurus is now barely ahead not only of the Honda Accord, a perennial challenger, but also the redesigned Toyota Camry. **********For car buyers, the strong dollar and aggressive pricing of foreign auto makers have produced bargains. Lieut. Col. Michael McPhail, a 42-year-old Air Force officer in Colorado Springs, who paid $20,000 for a 1997 Honda Accord EX in October, said that after an extensive search using an Internet buying service, he was convinced that for Japanese cars ''the 1996's were more expensive than the 1997's.'' **********Susan M. Miller, a 35-year-old actuary in Glen Mills, Pa., went looking this autumn for clearance sales of 1996 models, but wound up buying a 1997 Toyota Avalon instead after reading articles about how Toyota had redesigned its cars to reduce manufacturing costs. ''Even though the car seemed like a better car and they added things to the Camry and the Avalon, the price was down, not up, so you're getting more for your money,'' she said. **********While the more aggressive prices of Japanese auto makers are a boon for buyers, they are creating a serious problem for Detroit auto makers. Japanese auto makers have captured 23.8 percent of the market for cars and light trucks in the current model year, which began Oct. 1. That is up from 22.3 percent in the first two months of the 1996 model year. European auto makers captured 3.6 percent, up from 3 percent in the first two months of the last model year. **********While such shifts in market share may seem small, they represent huge sums in the vast auto industry, The gains of 1.5 percentage points for Japanese auto makers in October and November, if sustained through the rest of the model year, is equal to about 225,000 cars, or $4 billion. **********Big Three officials acknowledge that competition is growing fiercer. ''We've seen more than I would have expected in terms of price aggression by the Japanese in 1996,'' said G. Mustafa Mohatarem, G.M.'s chief economist. ''They responded more quickly to the weakening of the yen than they have in the past.'' **********A comprehensive analysis on Monday by Automotive News, a trade publication, found that Japanese auto makers had raised prices by an average of just $8 a vehicle with the introduction of the 1997 models, while Detroit's Big Three pushed up their prices by an average of $386. A separate analysis issued today by Autofacts International Inc., a market research company in West Chester, Pa., found that Asian auto makers -- including small Korean auto makers -- offered 39 percent larger rebates in November than a year earlier, while European auto makers had more than tripled their rebates. **********The rebates were also available on 80.7 percent of the Asian auto makers' new cars, slightly more than a year earlier, and on 58.3 percent of the European cars, up considerably from last year. So the prices buyers actually pay for many foreign cars have actually been dropping. **********The American auto makers also raised prices twice as fast as the Japanese did during the 1996 model year, according to Automotive News. The average American increase was $184 compared with an average Japanese increase of $94. **********The result has been a narrowing of the price gap between American and Japanese producers. While there have been some signs that the gap in reliability is also narrowing, Japanese auto makers still have a better reputation among many buyers for making high-quality cars. **********Bruce S. Fleischer, a 44-year-old teacher in Herndon, Va., said he decided to buy a 1997 Nissan Altima GLE this August after looking at the Ford Taurus. **********''The Taurus would have been about the same amount of money, but I don't have the same confidence in it,'' he said, adding that he and his wife own a 1986 Toyota Corolla and a 1992 Ford Taurus wagon, and are having more repair problems with the Ford than the Toyota. **********The dollar is now strong enough that Toyota and Honda, the two Japanese auto makers with the largest shares of the American market, are probably making money on their American operations despite the aggressive pricing. Other Japanese auto makers, notably Nissan, are moving closer to breaking even after years of heavy losses. **********While three-fifths of the Japanese-brand cars sold in the United States are assembled in North America, even these cars include foreign parts that account for 10 to 70 percent of the manufacturing cost. A strong dollar makes it cheaper to import these parts. Imports of assembled cars from Japan also leaped 35.7 percent in October and 16.1 percent in September from a year earlier. **********At the same time, Japanese auto makers are beginning to introduce many new models that were designed in the early 1990's when it seemed as though the dollar would continue to fall indefinitely. The new cars are cheaper to assemble. **********Honda, for example, now offers only two combinations of interiors for its new Prelude this autumn, compared with four last year. Toyota has completely redesigned its Camry so that the front bumper, for example, now has 13 parts instead of 20, making it easier to assemble. And the six clips inside each door that hold the interior paneling are painted instead of plated with nickel, for a savings of 10 cents a clip. **********With those changes, Toyota has cut the Camry's price by as much as $600, with the most popular models now costing $16,400 to $20,000. Camry sales in November soared 43 percent from a year earlier, catapulting the model into the competition for the year's best-selling car. Sales of the Accord were up 41 percent and Taurus sales climbed just 9 percent. **********Big Three auto executives, particularly at Ford, have tended to dismiss market research that American car buyers feel prices are too high and would rather spend their money on computers and vacations. Foreign auto executives, especially at Japanese companies, have embraced this view. **********''There is a certain frustration with the escalation of transportation costs,'' said J. Davis Illingworth Jr., Toyota's general manager. **********After years of especially cautious pricing, Toyota is now the most aggressive, cutting prices for its Toyota division by an average of six-tenths of 1 percent in the last year, and by 2.9 percent in the last year for its Lexus luxury division. **********Foreign car makers are still relatively weak in the markets for mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, the most profitable markets for American auto makers. As a result, the latest onslaught has posed a serious problem for G.M., which relies heavily on car sales, and less of a threat to Chrysler, which makes its money on Jeeps and mini-vans. Ford, with sales fairly balanced between cars and other light vehicles, is somewhere in the middle. **********G.M.'s market share has fallen swiftly partly because it has cut back sharply on rebates, believing that they cheapen a brand. ''We think our products are strong enough that we don't have to get into this price war,'' said Roy Roberts, the general manager of G.M.'s Pontiac-GMC division. **********James P. Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president for sales and marketing, said that while strong Jeep sales had allowed the company to build its market share in the last year, he was concerned that the strong dollar was helping foreign auto makers. ''To date it hasn't affected us materially, but certainly it puts them in a markedly better position,'' he said. **********The traditional response from auto makers to such competitive threats by Japan has been to seek Government help, sometimes by filing legal cases with the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission accusing their rivals of dumping, that is, selling a product for less in a foreign market than in a home market. Even the threat of such cases has prompted the Japanese to avoid aggressive pursuit of United States market share. **********But to win the imposition of antidumping tariffs on foreign producers, an American company needs to prove that it has suffered financial injury. The domestic auto makers, which have been posting near record profits because the strong American economy has increased overall auto sales, would have trouble doing so, said Ronald A. Cass, a former vice chairman of the International Trade Commission. **********With dumping cases no longer a fear, foreign auto makers are free to pursue larger market shares, said Suzanne Kinsler, an analyst at Autofacts. ''Now they can jump out of the closet and say 'Yes, I'm going to offer discounts and yes, I'm going to offer deals, and I don't care who knows,' '' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/14/business/new-weapons-new-rivals-in-wireless-phone-competition.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1996-11-14", "snippet": "Wireless telephone competition promises to be as clamorous as wired war among long-distance carriers; Omnipoint Communications plans to offer new type of cellular service in New York area, for rates 15 percent lower than conventional cellular; Pri...", "word_count": 1026, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Weapons, New Rivals in Wireless Phone Competition", "print_headline": "New Weapons, New Rivals in Wireless Phone Competition", "body_text": " **********The wireless telephone war has begun. And if the industry scouting reports are right, it promises to be as clamorous as the wired war among long-distance carriers like AT&T, MCI and Sprint. **********Omnipoint Communications plans to begin offering a new type of cellular service in the New York area tomorrow, for rates that are about 15 percent lower than those of conventional cellular. Primeco Personal Communications said on Tuesday that it would introduce a comparable new service in 16 cities, including Miami, Chicago and Dallas, for monthly rates that are about 5 to 10 percent less than cellular prices. **********Advocates of this new technology, called personal communications services, said it delivered crystal-clear sound and allowed people to use their hand-held phones for everything from sending electronic mail to reading the latest news headlines. **********For the average phone-toting customer, however, P.C.S. may make a splash for a more basic reason: it is cheaper. **********''The long-distance industry exploded after prices fell and the number of choices increased,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, president of Kagan Telecom Associates, an industry consulting firm in Atlanta. ''Now the cellular industry will explode for the same reasons.'' **********With three or more new wireless companies swarming into New York City and every other large market to take on the two cellular companies in most cities, Mr. Kagan said that the wireless industry would be marked by the same fierce price competition that drove down long-distance rates since the breakup of AT&T in 1984. **********The new technology is similar to cellular in most respects except that the signals are transmitted at a higher radio frequency and with lower power than cellular signals. As a result, P.C.S. phones generally have clearer sound than cellular phones. They can also transmit substantial amounts of data, in addition to voice signals. **********The influx of new competitors means cellular service -- still largely a tool of business users or affluent consumers -- is likely to expand well beyond the estimated 40 million customers who now own wireless phones in the United States. Some industry forecasts see 125 million wireless subscribers by 2004. **********''Our goal is to bring our prices closer to traditional phone rates,'' said George F. Schmitt, the president of Omnipoint. **********The mere threat of new P.C.S. rivals recently persuaded Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile, the largest cellular provider in New York, to lower its monthly rates. The city's other big cellular carrier, AT&T Wireless, has rolled out a digital version of its existing cellular service that offers many of the features of the new technology and similar rates. **********Although Omnipoint would not disclose its rates before a news conference in New York today, people familiar with the company said it planned to sell its most basic package of service for $19.99 a month, plus a per-minute rate for calls that is roughly 20 cents less than Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile's current rate of 69 cents a minute. **********Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile, however, beats Omnipoint on two other measures of overall cellular cost. Its basic monthly fee for service is $18.99, versus Omnipoint's $19.99. And Bell Atlantic Nynex's least expensive hand-held phone sells for $149.99, versus $199.99 for Omnipoint. **********For a customer trying to weigh all these prices, the wireless battle will probably wind up looking like the long-distance marketing wars, in which AT&T, MCI, and Sprint devised complex calling plans and then bombarded consumers with their competing promotions. **********In New York City, Omnipoint is only one of three would-be competitors. Sprint PCS said it planned to begin service in the city sometime in the next few months. And Nextwave Communications has bought Federal licenses to offer personal communications services in the New York market, though several analysts said Nextwave's plans to build a network were still uncertain. **********Despite the competitive pressure toward lower prices, Mr. Schmitt and other P.C.S. executives insisted they would not engage in an all-out  price war. They said providers of the new technology would be able to set themselves apart from the cellular companies with better sound quality and more sophisticated features. **********''All you have to do is use a cell phone to see that there are dramatic differences in quality between what we're offering and what they are,'' said Ben Scott, the president of Primeco, which is a joint venture of Bell Atlantic, Nynex, U S West, and Airtouch Communications. **********Primeco, which spent $1 billion to acquire licenses for personal communications services and another $1 billion to build its network, has a potential market of 39 million people, mostly in Florida, Texas and the Chicago area. **********Michael Sherrod, a computer executive in Dallas who has been testing Primeco's service for several weeks, said yesterday that the calls were indeed much clearer than those on his old cellular phone. ''Before, I got a lot of static, and the calls cut out fairly regularly,'' he said. **********Mr. Scott said he hoped the clarity and dependability of Primeco's service would attract new customers, like working mothers, who have resisted buying a cellular phones. **********John Bensche, a wireless communications analyst at CS First Boston, said, ''These guys want your P.C.S. phone to become your main communication device, as opposed to your home phone.'' **********And at Omnipoint, Mr. Schmitt is aiming for customers who want to use their phones for more than talk.

On the way up, however, he had acquired certain blind spots. He was an armchair quarterback, signing off on every small decision. His meetings were a disaster: people wandered in every few minutes, with the boss doing nothing to fend off distractions. **********Key vice presidents were on the verge of mass resignation. The directors got  wind of the crisis. A call went out to Howard J. Morgan, a human resources consultant who calls himself an executive coach -- a Mr. Fix-It for personal dysfunction in the executive suite. **********For five days late last year, Mr. Morgan attached himself like a barnacle to the Manhattan-based executive, sitting through his meetings, eavesdropping on his phone calls, tagging along on business lunches at the Union Square Cafe. He  came up with practical advice and kept shadowing the executive to make sure he followed through. **********Was time management a problem? Very well, Mr. Morgan became the boss's gate-keeper. When subordinates knocked on the door, he told them, politely but firmly, to take a hike. If the boss was hurrying to a meeting and stopped to chat, Mr. Morgan demanded, \"Couldn't that have waited?\" **********After the initial full-court press, Mr. Morgan tapered off his contacts. He expects the executive, who insisted on anonymity, to remain under his care for a year, at a cost to his company of about $40,000. **********\"Usually the person hates me for the first three months,\" said Mr. Morgan, who usually coaches several top executives at once, including clients at American Express and Coca-Cola. \"But by the fourth month they'll love me. In a tactful way you're holding them up on things no one's tackled them on before.\" **********Companies in trouble have long looked to outside experts for advice on market strategy, quality control and other straight-ahead business topics. But sometimes the problems turn out to be interpersonal, and then an executive coach may be called to the rescue. With backgrounds ranging from actual former football coaches to psychologists and personnel from downsized human resources departments, executive coaches promise to rehabilitate talented bosses with whom, because of gaps in their personality, no one wants to work. **********Tom Saporito, a senior vice president of RHR International, a coaching firm based in Chicago, described some reasons coaches are hired: \"There's a fire burning, a crisis of confidence, a tremendous rift in the management team, a C.E.O. suddenly out there by his lonesome without the support of the organization.\" **********The small but growing practice has been embraced by companies like Texaco, AT&T, Citibank and Sun Microsystems. **********There is no single reason for the rise of coaching over the last decade. But  one factor appears to be the gutting of legions of middle managers, which has meant that surviving bosses have authority over areas where they have no expertise, straining their \"people\" skills. **********Also, the advent of a generation of workers under age 45 who are more diverse racially and sexually and were brought up to question authority, has undermined  the effectiveness of older white male bosses, many of whom adhere to command-and-control management. **********\"Years ago, if you were good, you could get away with being abrasive,\" said Judith Blanton, a coach with RHR. \"Nowadays people don't want to work with you.\" **********Yet another factor is the spread of managed health care, which has squeezed the incomes of psychotherapists and prompted many to branch out. A special issue of the Journal of Consulting Psychology, to be published next month, extols coaching as a career of the future. **********There is even Coach University on the Internet, a school for would-be coaches who attend classes by conference call and download course work from the World Wide Web (http://www.coachu.com/info.htm). Enrollment has more than tripled in the last year, to nearly 400. Many students, who pay a fee of $2,495, already have coaching clients, said Thomas J. Leonard, the former financial planner in Salt Lake City who founded Coach U. **********Longtime coaches warn that newcomers to the field, which is unlicensed and unregulated, may be inexperienced and dangerously naive about corporate realities. \"It's a fad now, but unless you understand the culture of a company,  you can give people some bad advice,\" said Dr. Blanton, a consulting psychologist. \"A clinical psychologist who tells someone to share their feelings can end up getting that person fired.\" **********Coaches tend to work in boutique practices, though some big consulting firms  have entered the field. Fees range from $5,000 for a half-dozen 90-minute sessions to $100,000 for consultations that can last two years and involve fact-finding interviews by the coach with dozens of colleagues, customers, even  families. Almost all coaches deny they engage in psychotherapy. Successful executives, they say, will not tolerate being sent to a \"work shrink.\" **********But one New York manager who received coaching and who has spent time in psychotherapy said the line was not clear-cut. \"It's therapy disguised under the word 'coaching,' which is brilliant,\" she said, \"because these people have opened up a whole area for themselves.\" **********In some ways, coaching and psychotherapy clearly differ. Most coaching is short-term. Both its goals and solutions are practical. A boss who sees a coach  because of a tendency to belittle subordinates will be encouraged to find ways to control the outbursts, not explore childhood memories of a domineering father. If the pursuit of childhood memories seems called for, coaches usually recommend traditional therapy. **********FOR Carolyn Piecherowski, the trouble began shortly after her promotion to comptroller of the Rosan Aerospace Fastener Division, a unit of the Fairchild Corporation that makes nuts and bolts for military aircraft like the F-16. **********Ms. Piecherowski, 45, ran an accounting department with eight subordinates in Santa Ana, Calif. Half were used to seeing her as a peer, and the others had recently been hired. As a relatively immature manager, Ms. Piecherowski resorted to issuing orders with little explanation. \"I'd tell them, 'Do it the way I say. Don't worry about the whys,' \" she said. \"You had a dictator rather than a mentor for a boss.\" **********Her subordinates groused to her superior, and even Ms. Piecherowski knew there were problems. \"My people skills needed to be polished,\" she said. The company called in Dr. Blanton, who is based in Los Angeles. **********Why didn't Fairchild just dismiss Ms. Piecherowski? With many out-of work managers eager to take her place and companies desperate to cut costs, how can executive coaching be justified? \"The boss saw her as someone very talented in terms of her technical skill,\" Dr. Blanton said, \"and didn't want to lose her.\" **********Coaches say that most executives who receive coaching are still in their 40's, with careers stretching far enough ahead to justify an employer's investment. But chief executives in their 50's, who may consider a board's demands to see a coach humiliating, have been known to take early retirement. **********Dr. Blanton's suggestions for Ms. Piecherowski were not complex. In addition  to encouraging her to hold meetings to clear the air, the coach gave the manager a reading list of pop business books, like \"Talking From 9 to 5\" by Deborah Tannen. As a result, Ms. Piecherowski is now armed with the latest management buzzwords. **********\"I had to give everyone their own ownership of their job,\" she said. \"Letting them feel they were more in the driver's seat.\" Fairchild was happy enough with  her progress that it promoted her. **********ANOTHER midlevel executive, a 39-year-old operations manager for a television production company in New York, was blunt about why her company sent her to a coach. \"People found me to be a pain in the neck,\" she conceded. **********The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that if she got frustrating news during a phone call, she snapped at the next person who spoke to her. If others made what she considered foolish requests, she replied sarcastically. She responded the same way to a superior, which might have been fatal had her immediate boss not valued her enough to suggest coaching. **********\"I was angry and humiliated at first,\" the woman said. \"But I was also open to it. I said if the company wants to pay for me to get some coaching, I'm smart enough to realize this is not any different than if I went for computer training.\" **********The woman worked with Sharon M. Coleman, a clinical psychologist, in New York. \"She gave the impression to people that she was angry with them a lot of the time,\" said Dr. Coleman, who was once vice president of training and development at Shearson Lehman Hutton. **********Dr. Coleman engaged the woman in role-playing exercises and had her fill out  a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a standard psychological test that measures 16 personality traits. **********\"The more we talked, the more the light bulb went on,\" the manager said. \"When my boss asked me to do something, I should say, 'Sure, no problem.' If I felt somebody asked me something stupid, I might still feel angry, but now I hide it. That's what I learned. You work with people. It's politics.\" **********Not all coaching is aimed at faltering employees, those in danger of derailing their careers or their companies. At some companies it is offered to scores of executives at once, in an effort to engineer a broad shift in strategy. Still other companies, like Texaco and Avon, offer coaching as a perquisite to proven managers, in the understanding that everyone has blind spots and can benefit from a detached observer. **********At Northern Telecom, the giant maker of telephone equipment, thousands of employees fill out anonymous questionnaires that rate their bosses' leadership skills. In a debriefing of his results, Dave Thomson, a sales vice president in  charge of 100 employees at a Northern Telecom division in Overland Park, Kan., learned that he ranked among the top 5 percent of the company's managers in terms of envisioning business strategy. But as a team player and a listener, he  scored in the bottom 25 percent. A superior recommended coaching. **********Mr. Thomson, 42, met with Marshall Goldsmith, a prominent figure in the field who has coached the chief executives of Texaco, Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., and of Northrop Grumman, Kent Kresa. **********Mr. Goldsmith suggested ways for Mr. Thomson to improve his listening. When talking to a colleague, he was told to begin responses by briefly echoing what the colleague had just said. In meetings, Mr. Goldsmith advised, he ought to hold all comments until the end, then present only his top three. To improve as  a team player, Mr. Goldsmith said, Mr. Thomson should spend more time informing  subordinates of the progress of projects. **********\"Before, I would never announce that the boat was leaving the dock,\" Mr. Thomson said. \"We'd just start a job. Now I spend more time keeping people up to date and bringing them along. 'This is what we're going to do. Are you on board?' \" **********Mr. Goldsmith, a former business school professor at Loyola Marymount University and co-editor of the book \"The Leader of the Future,\" acknowledged that much of his coaching was common sense. He compared himself to a personal trainer who comes to a client's home to bark encouragement during a workout. **********\"I give people a formula,\" he said. \"None of it's rocket science. The main thing is to follow through.\" **********Mr. Goldsmith offers clients a money-back guarantee. He said that as companies became more hard-nosed about coaching, they would press for proof of results. So he tries to measure clients' progress statistically. Mr. Thomson, three months after his coaching began, gave mini-questionnaires to 11 colleagues and customers, asking each to score him from minus-3 to plus-3, depending on whether they saw him as more effective, less effective or unchanged as a listener and team player. **********\"One-hundred percent of the people saw increased effectiveness at least at the plus-2 level,\" Mr. Goldsmith said. **********FOR all the successes they claim, though, coaches acknowledge that sometimes  their efforts end in failure. **********Dr. Saporito of RHR said that about a year and a half ago he was hired to coach the new chief executive of a well-known consumer technology company. The boss had been brought in from outside with strong ideas about new products and quickly improving the bottom line. But within six months, he had alienated almost all of the key executives, who bought into his business strategy but bristled at his rapid timetable and his trampling of the corporate culture. **********\"The culture was built on strong interpersonal relationships, with many traditions of how things got done,\" said Dr. Saporito, who has a Ph.D. in psychology. \"The C.E.O. wasn't abrasive, just very focused on how he was going to drive the organization.\" **********After interviewing all parties, Dr. Saporito gave the executive feedback showing how his efforts were self-defeating. But the executive resisted. \"He tended to externalize the problems, saying it was the company and the culture's  fault,\" Dr. Saporito said. \"That was partly true. But he could not and would not take the time to figure out how to meet the culture halfway. **********\"That was his downfall.\" **********Directors, who had hired the chief executive, forced his resignation after only a year. \"He was trying to drive change by himself without building the team to support him,\" Dr. Saporito said. \"He was left out there all by himself.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/22/business/bringing-advanced-medical-expertise-to-the-world-s-poorest-regions.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Rifkin", "pub_date": "1996-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1068, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bringing Advanced Medical Expertise to the World's Poorest Regions", "print_headline": "Bringing Advanced Medical Expertise to the World's Poorest Regions", "body_text": " **********The patient was getting the best care the local doctors could provide. But this case needed outside expertise, and a long-distance phone call was not an option. **********There was a low-cost communications alternative, however, thanks to Satellife, a Boston-based nonprofit organization helping bring the information age to parts of Africa and Asia where up-to-date medical information can be scarce. **********As Dr. Fred Bukachi, a Kenyan internist, recalls the episode, he and a team  of renal surgeons in Nairobi were treating a first-year medical student who had  sickle-cell anemia, an incurable blood condition that had been under control. Now, however, the condition had suddenly worsened. As the student's kidneys failed, his doctors knew he had to have blood-cleansing dialysis treatments. **********No one on the team had experience putting such a patient on a dialysis machine, which typically requires use of blood-thinning drugs that could be deadly to someone with sickle-cell anemia. There was no good nearby medical library. Even an overseas phone call would cost $12 a minute -- an unaffordable  luxury in an economy where hospitals can afford to spend an average of only $1 a day on patients. **********But turning to the keyboard of his specially outfitted personal computer, Dr. Bukachi typed an urgent call for advice that was sent via radio signals to a nearby satellite earth station. A few hours later the earth station's dish antenna beamed the message to the small Satellife satellite that passes over Africa four times each day. **********Several hours later, when the satellite swung into electronic view of Boston, Dr. Bukachi's missive was downloaded to a Satellife ground station, where the organization's staff broadcast it over the global Internet computer web. **********Half a day later came an Internet reply to Boston from a physician at St. Mary's Hospital in London who had successfully handled a similar case. The prescribed treatment: small doses of the blood thinner Heperin. A Satellife staff member telephoned Dr. Bukachi with the information. The treatment saved the Kenyan medical student's life. **********\"In this case, there was no other alternative -- there was no other place to  turn for help,\" said Dr. Bukachi, who serves as Satellife's Africa region director. **********Since its founding in 1989 by the renowned cardiologist, inventor and promoter of social causes Bernard Lown, Satellife has helped save many lives. Its Healthnet medical network now serves thousands of physicians and health care workers in 15 African nations and parts of Asia. **********Healthnet subscribers receive the electronic Healthnet News, a weekly summary of the latest medical research from more than 20 major medical journals. They also get medical information from a growing list of health organizations like the World Health Organization and numerous AIDS research projects. **********During last year's outbreak of the dreaded ebola virus in Zaire, Dr. Paul Fountain, an American Baptist missionary and chief physician at Vanga Hospital in Kikwit, the epicenter of the outbreak, used Healthnet to communicate about the disease with other physicians in Africa and elsewhere. **********Within African nations, Healthnet gives physicians in even the most remote hospitals access to up-to-date knowledge. **********Last year, for example, a doctor in the village of Kafue Gorge in southern Zambia was treating a 12-year-old girl who had severe lesions in her mouth and could barely swallow. Unable to treat the child and cut off by roads washed out  in the rainy season, the physician asked for help via Healthnet. Before nightfall he had received instructions from doctors at the University of Zambia, in Lusaka, on how to surgically remove the lesions. After the surgery, the child recovered. **********Satellife's founder, Dr. Lown, 74, is as well known for his medical innovations as he is for his political and social causes. He is credited with conceiving the modern cardiac-care unit and founded International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, an organization that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. **********And when he set up Satellife with multimillion-dollar grants from corporations including NEC and AT&T, since supplemented by donors including the  actor Hume Cronyn and the media entrepreneur Ted Turner, it was out of recognition that technology and social concerns might be combined. **********\"Ignorance fosters chaos,\" said Dr. Lown, who in the case of most of sub-Saharan Africa realized that medical professionals were hampered by an appallingly inadequate communications system. Voice, fax and video-conference transmissions were either unavailable or made unaffordable by government-run telecommunications agencies. **********What was required was some sort of \"off line\" or \"store and forward\" communications system that did not require connections to the real-time telephone network. **********So Dr. Lown and his advisers settled on so-called low-earth-orbit satellite technology. The approach is a stark contrast to the giant geostationary satellites, which are commonly used for telephone and television transmissions in the United States. These complex spacecraft, costing several hundred million  dollars to build and up to $20 million more to launch, are positioned over the equator at an altitude of more than 22,000 miles, where they orbit in unison with the earth's rotation, seeming to hang in a fixed position. **********A low-earth satellite, which would be the size of a television set and would  zip around the globe at an altitude of only 550 miles, could be built and launched for $1 million. Satellife bought and launched Healthsat 1 in 1991 and three years later sent up a more sophisticated replacement, Healthsat 2, which cost $2.2 million. Both were paid for with private donations. **********Taking 100 minutes for each pole-to-pole orbit of the earth, the satellite makes 14 circumnavigations a day. Every 24 hours, any given spot on earth is within electronic range of the satellite at least four times. **********Each time the satellite comes into view, an earth station has approximately 13 minutes to exchange data with Healthsat 2 via radio signal.  The network's software allows the spacecraft to poll each earth station in turn, collecting any stored messages and downloading any information collected elsewhere on the globe and addressed to that particular station. **********The equipment for each ground station costs less than $15,000. And as telephone service is gradually improving in some African cities, a Healthnet subscriber can use a modem to transmit messages via local phone line to a centrally located earth station, rather than requiring a satellite antenna at each site. **********\"We've devised a system that can easily be replicated within a country for free,\" said John Mullaney, executive director of Satellife. \"It is a medical information system that can be run by Africans for Africans and can be sustained internally.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/04/business/competitive-spur-seen-british-telecom-brings-local-phone-experience.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1996-11-04", "snippet": "British Telecommunications and MCI Communications to merge their operations to create world's first trans-Atlantic telephone carrier; company to be called Concert; deal is structured as $22 billion acquisition of MCI by British Telecom; it will be...", "word_count": 1305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Competitive Spur Seen; British Telecom Brings Local Phone Experience", "print_headline": "Competitive Spur Seen; British Telecom Brings Local Phone Experience", "body_text": " **********The British are coming to the American telephone market. And for people who call London or Long Island, that could translate into lower overseas phone rates and more competition to provide local service. **********British Telecommunications and MCI Communications announced yesterday that they would merge their operations to create the world's first trans-Atlantic telephone carrier, a company to be called Concert. The deal, structured as a $22 billion acquisition of MCI by British Telecom, would be the largest foreign takeover ever of a United States corporation. **********Beyond financial superlatives, the deal could redraw the business map of telecommunications. At home, MCI could become a formidable competitor in the $100 billion market for residential local service. Overseas, BT, as the British company is known, could become the provider of choice for many business customers seeking global communications. **********''This isn't a pebble we're throwing on the surface of a quiet pool,'' said Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, at a New York news conference yesterday announcing the deal. ''This is a rock, and it will make a big splash.'' **********The ripples from the huge merger were already spreading yesterday through Wall Street, Washington and the telecommunications industry. AT&T, which has been the biggest United States telephone company, urged the Clinton Administration to demand that the British Government open its phone market before it approves the deal. **********''BT controls 90 percent of the telephone numbers in the U.K.,'' said Robert E. Allen, AT&T's chairman and chief executive. ''They operate in a market that is not open and competitive by the standards by which we judge competition in the United States.'' **********But several analysts predicted that American regulators would approve the deal precisely because it could accelerate the opening of overseas markets. The merger, they said, could eventually lead to the dismantling of the system of tariffs that govern long-distance rates between the United States and Britain. And approval of a major European move into American markets puts pressure on European regulators to reciprocate. ''This is exactly what the F.C.C. has been looking for,'' said Daniel Reingold of Merrill Lynch. **********British Telecom has owned 20 percent of MCI since 1994, but the companies will now ask the Federal Communications Commission to allow it to take full ownership. BT would acquire the remaining 80 percent of MCI for a mixture of stock and cash that values MCI at roughly $36 a share. The deal is expected to close in nine months to a year. **********It took about five months of trans-Atlantic talks between Sir Iain and MCI's chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., to put the deal together. Mr. Roberts and Sir Iain will serve as joint chairmen of the combined company, to be based in London and Washington. **********Though the dual chairmen and headquarters give the deal an international flavor, its greatest effect on American consumers is expected to be felt in the local phone business. MCI will be able to draw on the deep financial resources of BT to intensify its assault on local markets in 25 cities across 20 states. ''This ranks as No. 1 on our list of priorities,'' said Mr. Roberts in a conference call yesterday with analysts. **********Mr. Roberts declined to give details on MCI's plans, but analysts said they expected the company to spend more on marketing its brand name as a local phone company -- perhaps leasing capacity on the networks of the regional Bell companies. For now, executives at MCI said, the company does not plan to increase the $400 million a year it is spending to install local fiber optic networks and digital switches. **********MCI's strategy brings it into more direct competition with AT&T, which also plans to offer local service by leasing capacity from the Bell companies. Some analysts said that the sheer size of the new company posed a threat to AT&T at a time that it has been grappling with management turmoil and an erosion in its core long distance business. **********''For the first time in history, AT&T is the underdog,'' said Eli M. Noam, director of the Columbia Institute of Tele-Information. **********AT&T also faces a challenge in the lucrative business of providing world communications networks to big businesses. MCI and British Telecom already have a head start through a joint venture, also called Concert, that has 3,000 customers and $1.5 billion in revenue, and was deemed successful enough to become the namesake for the combined company. Now, Sir Iain said BT and MCI would be able to better coordinate Concert's sales force, and bolster its presence in Asian markets through alliances with South Korean, Japanese and Indian companies. **********British Telecom, which was owned by the Government until its privatization in 1984, has expanded far beyond Britain through a web of alliances with European and Asian carriers. Its talks with MCI became serious after it failed to buy Cable and Wireless, whose most valuable asset is Hong Kong Telecom. **********Analysts, though generally optimistic about the combination, noted risks. The onset of genuine competition in American local phone service could be delayed for several months by a recent Federal court ruling that suspended the F.C.C.'s new rules on local competition. Mr. Roberts said the ruling had complicated already jigsaw-like negotiations. **********Some analysts also questioned how well the corporate cultures of BT and MCI would mesh -- especially given MCI's entrepreneurial heritage and BT's roots as a state-owned monopoly. Other experts said that Concert might lose in agility what it gained in size and scale. **********Sir Iain and Mr. Roberts said they sought to address those issues by insuring that MCI's top executives would have a strong role in the new company. Though BT's chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, will retain that title at Concert, MCI's president, Gerald H. Taylor, will serve as chief operating officer. MCI will be able to name seven directors to the board of Concert; BT, eight. **********And MCI, with its underdog image and high growth rate, has risk-oriented shareholders on the lookout for rapid growth and appreciation of assets -- a philosophy markedly different from that of BT's more cautious, value-oriented investors. **********Felix G. Rohatyn, a managing director of Lazard Freres, which advised MCI, said no one had ever tried to reconcile such divergent shareholders in a merger that also involved a foreign company. **********The road to the merger began in June, when Sir Iain and Mr. Roberts met at the St. Regis Hotel in New York to discuss ways to strengthen their existing alliance. Sir Iain suggested spinning off Concert as a stand-alone venture. Left unsaid was the possibility that BT could buy MCI outright. Under terms of British Telecom's 1994 agreement with MCI, Sir Iain was legally barred from broaching the idea of an acquisition. **********So Mr. Roberts broke the ice in a subsequent phone call, proposing a deal that would be structured more like a merger. Sir Iain reacted positively. Early in September, the two men committed themselves to a deal and brought in advisers. Mr. Rohatyn and Michael Price of Lazard advised MCI, along with Richard I. Beattie, senior partner of the law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett. Yves Istel of Rothschild Inc. and Anthony Alt of Rothschild's British sister company advised BT. **********In critical meetings in London, the companies agreed on a management structure and began to hammer out financial terms. They negotiated furiously until two weeks ago, when the talks reached an impasse on the price BT was willing to pay.

But fighting is in the air in Britain's capital, where John Major has thrown down the gauntlet in the country's latest offensive, the 1996 Battle of the Beef. **********\"Major Goes to War With Europe,\" declared the banner headline in Wednesday's  Guardian, above a lurid photograph of some British beef being incinerated in an  abattoir. In The Independent, the comparison was with the Falklands War, which gave Prime Minister Thatcher a much-needed pre-election boost: \"John Major does  a Margaret Thatcher,\" the paper said, lest the point be lost. **********At issue is whether the European Union will lift its ban on British beef exports, imposed on March 27 after the British Government admitted that there was a possible link between mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which has wiped out many British cattle herds, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, a fatal brain illness in humans. **********For weeks, the British have pleaded in vain for the Europeans to rescind the  ban. But on Wednesday, John Major, milquetoast, suddenly became John Major, ultimatum-wielding Commander in Chief. **********Britain would no longer stand on the beach while Europe kicked sand in its face, he declared. If the Europeans wouldn't help Britain, Britain wouldn't help the Europeans. More specifically, Mr. Major announced in a get-tough speech in the House of Commons that Britain would use its veto to block the passage of all European Union initiatives requiring unanimity. It would do all it could to disrupt European business, he said, including obstructing the summit conference  in Florence next month, until the Europeans began easing the beef ban. **********In a country where reactions to Europe run the gamut from grudging tolerance  to baldfaced xenophobia, it was as if Mr. Major had personally driven a tank through the Channel Tunnel and then sent his troops into Germany, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl (also known as \"the Kraut\" and \"the Hun\" in selected tabloids this week) is widely seen as the ringleader of the anti-British forces. **********The move has delighted the right wing of Mr. Major's Tory party, known as the Euro-skeptics, who favor keeping as much distance from Europe as possible, and whom Mr. Major must appease if he is to keep his razor-thin, one-member majority in Parliament. Even Tony Blair, the opposition leader, has been loath to criticize the Government at a time when, he said on Wednesday, \"the national interest has been engaged.\" **********But the mild-mannered Mr. Major's sudden John Wayne swagger has delighted no  one more than London's jingoistic right-wing tabloids, which in the past two days have done everything short of asking readers to convert their vegetable patches into victory gardens. **********\"The Prime Minister has taken command and steadied his troops,\" said The Daily Mail in an editorial. \"What he must demonstrate now is that he has a winning strategy and the will to see it through.\" **********In The Sun, coverage of the day's beef-related events was illustrated by a picture of Mr. Major in a traditional British Beefeater's costume, under the headline: \"Major Shows His Bulls at Last.\" Inside, next to a promotion promising two free British beefburgers for every Sun reader, there was a photograph of Winston Churchill under the headline, \"The Cattle of Britain.\" **********\"Never in the field of human conflict has so much beef been banned from so many by so few,\" The Sun said. **********Few newspapers have failed to point out the connections, however far-fetched, with World War II. **********Mr. Major's speech in Parliament was so reminiscent of Neville Chamberlain's  grim pronouncement in 1939 that Britain was at war with Germany, wrote the columnist Simon Hoggart, that \"children should have been running home from school in tin helmets, gas masks in cardboard boxes swinging around their necks.\" **********But while World War II was fought in planes, trenches, tanks and on battlefields, the Battle of the Beef is being fought in bureaucratic European conference rooms, where British officials have been instructed to constantly harp on the beef issue, no matter what topic is being discussed, and to thwart all European attempts to get anything done. **********Britain has already vetoed a disaster rescue program and resolutions on scientific research and cooperation with eastern Europe, the Foreign Secretary,  Malcolm Rifkind, told reporters with some pride this afternoon. It has also, he  said, blocked plans to call an extra meeting between the European Parliament and negotiators to a conference on the reform of European Union institutions. **********\"We do not know if this will run for days, weeks, perhaps even two to three months, perhaps even longer,\" Mr. Rifkind said firmly, in a tone to conjure an image of him in a Royal Air Force uniform, posing next to his plane. \"The policy will continue until the objective has been achieved.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/24/world/questions-raised-over-handling-of-yeltsin-medical-case.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1996-09-24", "snippet": "Russian Pres Boris N Yeltsin's doctors will meet on Sept 25 to decide if and when he should have heart bypass operation; Dr Leo Bokeria, one of Russia's most renowned heart surgeons, will not attend meeting; with life-and-death decisions pending o...", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Questions Raised Over Handling of Yeltsin Medical Case", "print_headline": "Questions Raised Over Handling of Yeltsin Medical Case", "body_text": " **********When Boris N. Yeltsin's doctors meet on Wednesday to decide if and when the President should have a heart bypass operation, one of Russia's most renowned heart surgeons will not be there. **********The surgeon, Dr. Leo Bokeria, the head of Bakulev Institute, said that neither he nor any of his aides had been invited to take part in the consultations even though his center does more bypass operations than any other in Russia. **********With life-and-death decisions pending on Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian medical establishment's handling of the case is beginning to come under question. **********The issue is not the technical skill of the surgeon who has been selected to operate on Mr. Yeltsin, Dr. Renat S. Akchurin of the Cardiological Center in Moscow. Rather, it concerns his center's experience in performing complicated bypass operations and its rivalry with other Russian institutes. **********Quoting an anonymous specialist, Izvestia recently raised the question of why Dr. Bokeria was not involved. And Mikhail Alshibaya, a top bypass surgeon who studied under Dr. Bokeria, said he was surprised that his mentor has not at least been included in the consultations. **********Dr. Akchurin has also inadvertently encouraged the doubters by giving a startling series of interviews in which he appeared to be anything but the picture of self-confidence. **********The 50-year-old surgeon warned that Mr. Yeltsin, 65, might be too ill to survive an operation, adding that if an operation took place it might be delayed for as long as two months. Communist politicians quickly seized on those remarks to demand that Mr. Yeltsin resign. **********There is no question that the Cardiological Center where Dr. Akchurin operates has all the trappings of an elite institution. The center is the successor to the Fourth Directorate, where leaders of the former Soviet Union received medical treatment. **********Its up-to-date equipment and marble walls are a tribute to the political clout of its director, Dr. Yevgeny I. Chazov, who served as a Soviet Health Minister and doctor to the Soviet leaders Leonid I. Brezhnev and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********But skeptics say the center embodies a paradox: precisely because it has been reserved for the powerful and the privileged, it has performed far fewer bypass operations than Dr. Bokeria's Bakulev Institute. **********Last year, the Cardiological Center performed about 150 bypass operations, according to Dr. Akchurin. In contrast, the Bakulev Institute performed 600 bypass operations. **********Dr. Akchurin said he had personally performed about 100 operations last year. But Dr. Bokeria operates four times a week. **********Located in a stately Moscow building, the 40-year-old Bakulev does one third of Russia's heart operations and 50 percent of those done in Moscow, Dr. Bokeria said. Doctors say such experience is a critical factor in the success of an operation. **********Numbers, of course, do not tell the whole story. But Dr. Bokeria's Bakulev Institute also performs complex heart operations to repair genetic defects. And it was Dr. Bokeria who organized the symposium that has drawn Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the American surgeon who is to consult on Mr. Yeltsin's case, to Moscow, where he arrived today. **********This is not to say that Dr. Akchurin is not well regarded. Dr. Akchurin began as a microsurgeon, using a microscope to repair and reattach limbs. He was recruited as a heart surgeon by Dr. Chazov and later trained with Dr. DeBakey for six months. **********In addition to his involvement with the Cardiological Center, Dr. Akchurin may have been chosen to operate on Mr. Yeltsin because he conducted a successful bypass operation eight years ago on Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. **********But doctors say his was simpler  than the bypass planned for Mr. Yeltsin, whose heart has reportedly been damaged by previous heart attacks and who also reportedly suffers from kidney and liver ailments. **********Taking a diplomatic approach, Dr. Bokeria declined to comment on the number of operations Dr. Akchurin does each year. But he noted that studies showed a correlation between experience and the success of an operation. **********And he added that he was taken aback at recent comments by Dr. Akchurin on Russian television that he had not examined Mr. Yeltsin for several weeks. **********''When he said that he did not see the patient for two or three weeks, I was surprised,'' Dr. Bokeria said.

have been suggesting that one category, zero-coupon bonds, is looking attractive. **********This was especially true at the end of July, when yields to maturity on 20-year zeros hit 7.24 percent.Those rates have since fallen back below 7 percent, but the bonds still look enticing to many advisers, who are recommending zeros as a good alternative to an overpriced and unpredictable stock market. **********As their name suggests, zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest.Instead, the investor buys them at a deep discount to their face value and receives the compounded interest in a guaranteed lump sum at maturity.Last week, for example, a Treasury zero with a face value of $10,000, yielding 6.63 percent to maturity in August 2006, could have been purchased for $5,200 **********Though there are municipal and corporate zeros, most financial advisers prefer Treasury zeros because they cannot be called in before maturity, and there is no credit risk since they are backed by the U.S. government. **********Zeros are especially favored by investors who want the certainty of knowing that they will receive a specific amount of cash on a set date in the future.Another important advantage is that, since they do not pay out interest twice a year like conventional bonds, the investor avoids the hassle of reinvesting these payments, especially if interest rates drop. **********Unfortunately, however, the Internal Revenue Service insists on taxing zero holders as if they received interest payments, a practice known as taxing \"phantom\" income.Financial advisers typically tell investors to own zeros in their retirement accounts, where they can defer taxes until they withdraw their cash. **********Michael Martin, a Columbia, Maryland, financial adviser,thinks now is a good time to be buying zeros.One of his most popular strategies is used by retirees who want to wait as long as legally allowed, until the age of 70 , to start taking distributions from their Individual Retirement Accounts. **********Under this scenario, a 60-year-old would buy a Treasury zero maturing in 10 years.Using the current 6.7 percent yield to maturity, \"the worst case is that they'll get a 6.7 percent yield for 10 years, government guaranteed, with no credit risk and not callable, so you're protected on the downside,\" Mr. Martin said.\"The best case is that rates will fall, causing prices to go up, and we might make 25 percent in the first two years.\" In that instance, Mr. Martin, who is betting that rates on long-term Treasuries will fall below 5 percent in the next two years, would sell the bonds. **********But if rates go up, zeros will fall sharply in value, and because they are so volatile, most experts advise holding them to maturity, when they will receive the guaranteed face value. **********Another strategy is to \"ladder\" a portfolio of zeros, so that they mature in different years.Jack Klein, a senior director at Lebenthal, a New York bond brokerage, recently had a client who wanted to lock in the profits from stock investments in his retirement account.He planned to retire in about 12 years and was not sure if he would need all the money, so Mr. Klein bought him zero-coupon Treasuries maturing over five consecutive years from 2009 through 2013.\"That way, if he has to reinvest any cash, he'll be able to do it over an entire market cycle,\" he said. **********Zero-coupon bonds are also used as savings vehicles for a child's college education, though, again, taxes must be paid each year with no interest coming in.By using a Uniform Gift to Minors account, some relief can be obtained by paying at the child's lower rate.Mr. Klein noted that a grandparent who wanted to open a college account for a one-year-old could pay $8,250 now for a Treasury zero yielding 6.70 percent to maturity that would be worth $25,000 in 2013 when tuition for the freshman year is due. **********But if the grandparents want to give a larger amount, say $100,000, the tax bite becomes more onerous, and tax-free municipal zeros could be a better alternative, even though their yield is lower."},

hype with mutual-fund frenzy and what do you get? Junk mail -- lots and lots of junk mail. **********Fancy cyber junk mail, to be sure, posted on the World Wide Web by scads of mutual fund companies as well as entrepreneurs trying to tap into both crazes. But for the most part, the contents of these electronic Web pages have not differed much from the multicolored marketing materials that fund companies send through the (non-E) mail. **********So while there has been plenty for mutual fund investors to read on the Net, there has been very little for them to do -- until now. **********This summer, financial Web sites are blossoming with interactive activities ranging from the practical, like on-line trading, to the educational, like work  sheets, to the amusing, like trading contests. **********And while \"brochure-ware\" remains the norm, technology gurus predict fund investors will increasingly be able to act on the Internet. Companies that sponsor Web sites \"realize there has to be more than information; you have to be able to do something with it,\" said David E. Weisman, director for money and technology strategies at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. **********Fund investors have long been active on the Net, first by trading information in news groups. But since 1994, fund companies have been jumping in. Many started by providing marketing material through Galt Technologies' Networth, a sort of virtual financial mall (http://www.galt.com). Today, more than 70 concerns post material through Networth, and some bigger companies that sell directly to the public -- including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price -- now have elaborate Web sites (http://www.fid-inv.com; http://www.vanguard.com; http://www.troweprice.com). **********Downloading prospectuses used to be the most exciting Net activity, and it remains a popular feature at Networth, where investors retrieve several thousand a day, said Robert O. Frasca, a founder of Galt, which has been bought by Intuit, the financial software company. But Galt has steadily improved its interactive features, including a program to help users pick funds. **********Tracking funds' performance is also a hot activity on the Web, both at Networth and on individual companies' pages. And a new company, Fundscape, offers investors free software that allows them to track and analyze their fund  investments (http:// www.fundscape.com). **********Tracking is one thing; trading, another. The biggest hurdle for Internet trading has been security, of both information and money. Until fund companies and brokerage firms are satisfied the problem has been solved, you may be able to move money around on the Net but you will probably not be able to cash out of your funds altogether. **********Investors have been able to trade stocks over the Internet for months, but setting up a service to do the same for mutual funds has proved more complicated, said Barry Boyte, vice president of Jack White & Company, the San Diego discount brokerage firm. The hurdles, he said, included different regulations, different settlement systems and quirks like multiple classes of shares in the same fund. **********Nevertheless, Jack White is now opening its mutual-fund trading service to new customers (http://pawws.com/jwc). (Though the firm began the service in March, it originally promoted fund trading only to a small group of existing clients.) The bad news, for Internet addicts, is that they must send paper copies of their account applications to the firm; Federal regulators require it. The good news is that Internet traders get a 10 percent discount on the commission White charges. **********And within a week or two, the Charles Schwab Corporation will also start trading funds on the Net through its e.Schwab service (http://www.eschwab.com).  About 550 funds can be traded without a transaction fee; the costs of trading the 600 other funds carried by Schwab will be the same whether customers place orders electronically or by phone. Fidelity hopes to start a fund-trading service later this year. **********Fund companies that sell directly to investors are also trying to give their  customers account information on line, and even to allow them to move money among funds. For example, T. Rowe Price already has such a system available over a modem and plans to move it to the Net once it is comfortable that investor information is secure. **********In the meantime, the big no-load sites are trying to \"go interactive\" by sponsoring work sheets, contests and quizzes. Scudder's new site, for example, has work sheets on asset allocation, retirement planning and tuition planning, while Vanguard offers a retirement calculator and a quiz intended to test your fund knowledge. **********Contests are popular with investors, and sometimes educational. For example,  a group of chatters on the mutual funds bulletin board sponsored by Brill Editorial Services (http://www.brill.com) started a contest in May to see whose  mock portfolio performs best over three months. The winner will get bragging rights, but most contests have more tangible prizes. **********Gabelli Funds is sponsoring a stock-picking contest (http://www.gabelli.com)  whose winner will get shares in Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust. But to enter, users are asked to fill out a questionnaire, as are entrants in Fidelity's trivia and \"Guess the Dow\" contests. **********Which brings up an important point: these folks are not adding interactive features just for the fun of it. Sometimes the information you give the companies can be used to generate leads for their sales forces. And it turns out that, without some activity to engage in, Internet users seldom return to a Web  site. (Who reads a promotional flyer more than once -- if that?) **********That fact lies behind what its sponsor hopes will be the splashiest new fund  site on the Web: the Fantasy Funds Challenge. Beginning later this month, a tiny brokerage firm in Dallas called 1-800-Mutuals plans to sponsor a trading contest in which participants will create a hypothetical portfolio from a selected group of funds; after 10 months, the monthly winners from each state will compete for  a $1 million jackpot. **********The brokerage firm hopes that the contest (on http://www.1800mutuals.com) will be so successful that funds will pay to be included on the select list, though so far it has been a hard sell, said Richard Sapio, president and founder of the firm.

Despite the fact that nearly 250,000 commercial Internet addresses have already been claimed in this decade's great virtual land grab, a vast number of site names remain open for adoption -- including, for starters, hopeless.com. **********Site addresses, formally known as domain names, lead to the homes of companies and individuals on the Internet. Apple Computer Inc., for example, can be found at apple.com; the Dalai Lama lists his address as tibet.com. **********Domain names are generally the tail ends of Internet addresses. For example, the Dalai Lama's full Internet address is http://tibet.com/ while Apple's is slightly different, http://www.apple.com/. **********The process of registering a domain name was a free-for-all until the Internet Network Information Center, known as InterNIC, issued new rules last year. Now, the process is fairly straightforward, with the center acting as a sort of kindly police officer of cyberspace. InterNIC politely asks applicants to refrain from infringing on trademarks and company names and when disputes arise, swiftly returns such names to their legal owners. **********Other than that, just about anything goes. \"You can have up to 64 characters  in a domain name, including any letter, numbers from one to nine, and hyphens; that adds up to a lot of names,\" said David Graves, the Internet business manager for Network Solutions Inc., the company that processes domain name registrations for InterNIC. Still, competition is fierce: Mr. Graves estimates that the Internet Information Center is processing 7,000 to 8,000 applications a week. **********Pop culture provides a particularly rich vein for domain-name hunters. Late-night television fans -- and network executives -- have missed the boat on  letterman.com, but will find leno.com as yet unclaimed. Snack food fans arriving at the party too late to snag the names, twinkies.com or hoho.com, can still duel over devildog.com. **********It is possible to show loyalty to favorite television shows by tuning in to nypdblue.com, madaboutyou.com, or freshprince.com. However, the popular friends.com, er.com, and seinfeld.com are booked. Lovers of quirky commercials will find mentos.com committed, but not freshmaker.com. Nor is 1984.com spoken for. **********Rhyme and reason can also figure in catchy addresses for digital commerce. The Consolidated Edison Company, New York's electricity provider, has reserved coned.com but not con-ed.com or, for that matter, conehead.com. **********Philosophically minded -- or coincidentally named -- citizens of the Internet have registered plato.com, kant.com, and goethe.com, without touching foucault.com, hegel.com and sartre.com. (The latter should by all rights be packaged with the as-yet-untouched noexit.com.) **********The sheer volume of words, slang, proper names, and acronyms fairly well guarantees the persistence of viable options. For every utopia.com and dollar.com, long since taken, there is a dystopia.com and ruble.com awaiting a champion. Homeboy.com is taken; gameboy.com is not. \"Star Trek\" fans can no longer lock on to spock.com or picard.com, but, to date, no one has beamed sulu.com or worf.com aboard. **********Politics might prove a less fruitful avenue: clinton.com, dole.com, and even  guiliani.com, are taken, though none of them are held by the politicians themselves. Also claimed is whitewater.com, by a group based in Montana. The opportunity does remain for a clever Clinton supporter to apply for damato.com to needle one of the President's tormentors. For that matter, both sueme.com and frivolous.com are up for grabs. **********\"People find ways to get an address that suits their purposes,\" said Carter Burden 3d, president of Digital Telemedia Inc., an Internet service provider based in New York. \"And that means something memorable, something that looks good on the side of a bus or in a TV ad -- even if it takes adding on an extra letter or two just to make it slightly different from a name that's already taken.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/world/arabs-pledge-100-million-to-train-bosnia-army.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Weiner", "pub_date": "1996-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 421, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arabs Pledge $100 Million to Train Bosnia Army", "print_headline": "Arabs Pledge $100 Million to Train Bosnia Army", "body_text": " **********The White House said today that Arab allies had pledged about $100 million for its plan to train and arm Bosnia's military. **********The promise followed a meeting in Saudi Arabia on Monday between a United States delegation led by the Presidential counselor Thomas F.

This is national defense!'' Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, exhorted his colleagues before today's vote. **********But critics denounced the bill as an egregious example of ''corporate welfare'' and pork-barrel politics at its worst. Indeed, a task force advising Vice President Al Gore on ''reinventing Government'' in 1993 recommended dropping the subsidy for an industry that has been badly hurt in recent years by subsidized foreign competitors. **********Even the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee put the maritime subsidies on its hit list of questionable programs soon after Republicans swept control of Congress in 1994. **********''This program delivers to the taxpayer higher costs and no additional security benefit,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, argued. ''Shouldn't that be a clue that this program is wasteful?'' **********''The money goes to wealthy companies and powerful unions,'' Mr. Grassley continued. ''It becomes corporate welfare and union welfare. They keep getting more and more money from the Treasury because they have the clout.'' **********Under the plan approved today, the new subsidies would be much smaller than the Depression-era program that is set to expire next year. The new bill would reduce direct subsidies to ocean-shipping lines to $100 million a year through 2005  from $200 million a year. **********Proponents say the new program would also encourage American vessels to compete with less costly foreign shippers, and would give the Pentagon greater flexibility in crises to summon civilian ships and use commercial terminals. **********Two large shipping lines that stand to reap benefits from the new program, Sea-Land Services and American President Lines, have accounted for $700,000 of the $2.8 million in political donations by the industry in the last decade, according to Common Cause, the watchdog group. **********In addition, the bill contains a loan-guarantee program for building ships, helping shipyards like Tenneco's big yard in Newport News, Va. **********United States flag carriers have for years been forced to compete with subsidized foreign shippers. As these foreign carriers have drained off cargoes, the United States merchant marine fleet has shrunk. **********The fleet has dwindled to about 320 ships today from about 850 in 1970 and more than 2,000 vessels in the 1940's. **********To maintain this smaller fleet, the Government up to now has paid American flag operators the difference between the cost of an American ship and crew and the costs of operating a foreign-flagged ship. These annual subsidies averaged about $3 million a vessel. **********Under the new program, eligible ship operators will receive a flat payment of $2.3 million a ship in the fiscal year 1996 and $2.1 million a  ship for each fiscal year through 2005. To qualify, vessels must operate for at least 320 days a year, and in the United States foreign trade, not domestic trade. **********Critics say that even in wartime, the Pentagon would only need to use a few of these ships, not a majority of the fleet. During the Persian Gulf war, only 17 United States commercial ships sailed into the war zone during the conflict -- out of a total of about 500 ships. Of those 17, only 6  container ships had received a subsidy under the program that would be phased out. **********Moreover, the Pentagon has built its own $6 billion cargo fleet, and during the Persian Gulf war hired both domestic and foreign carriers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/06/business/first-rate-returns-on-third-world-bond-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Middleton", "pub_date": "1996-10-06", "snippet": "Outlook for emerging-market bond funds; graphs (S)", "word_count": 1015, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First-Rate Returns on Third-World Bond Funds", "print_headline": "First-Rate Returns on Third-World Bond Funds", "body_text": " **********CAN emerging-markets debt stage a three-peat? **********Fixed-income mutual funds that specialize in Brady bonds and other debt of third-world nations were top performers in this year's second quarter, and they led the taxable fixed-income category again in the third, with double-digit advances. The reasons for that success, though, make it increasingly unlikely they can continue to outperform. **********''These are bonds, not stocks,'' said Barton M. Biggs, global market strategist for Morgan Stanley. ''It's statistically impossible for this asset class to do in the future what it's done in the recent past.'' **********A torrid rally in third-world debt has seen the interest-rate premium that investors have demanded over United States Treasury bonds shrink to about 6 percentage points, on average, from 19 points at the market's nadir in March 1995, according to Mr. Biggs. With bond prices varying inversely to yields, values have doubled since the low, with 40 percent of those gains coming in the last 12 months. **********To have them double again, investors would have to decide that third-world bonds were more secure than  United States Government debt. That likelihood is zero. **********But many experts say further advances are more than just possible. **********''I wouldn't expect that the party's over,'' said Jim Forest, associate editor of the Bond Fund Report in Ashland, Mass. The devaluation of the Mexican peso, which precipitated the market's collapse in December 1994, was so unexpected that it sent investors reeling, and the result was a selling panic. But subsequent events have demonstrated resiliency in a number of underdeveloped nations, making their debt seem much less risky than it appeared a year ago, he said. **********''It's a bit too early to give up on emerging-markets debt,'' said Simon Treacher, who manages $850 million of such securities for Morgan Grenfell Investment Services Ltd. in London. ''The demand side is increasing. I see more and more interest in investing in emerging-markets debt as an asset class.'' **********Emerging-market debt occupies a small and little-known corner of the fixed-income market, with a total market capitalization of about $180 billion, according to Morgan Stanley. Issuers are clustered primarily in Eastern Europe and Latin America. To overcome concerns about credit quality, currency translations and political risk, nations like Mexico and  Argentina typically offer high long-term yields, on the order of 8 percent to 11 percent, according to Salomon Brothers Emerging Markets Research. **********About $140 billion of this market, or more than three-quarters, is in Brady bonds, the United States-backed debt securities created at the end of the 1980's as part of the restructuring of Mexico's overwhelming foreign debt load. Mounting concerns about Mexico's debt problems  prompted the Treasury, under then-Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, to step in to offer United States guarantees. **********This assurance that principal would be repaid provided the foundation that led to the market's recovery, and Brady bonds have been used in other emerging markets since then. The bonds now represent, for instance, 83 percent of the portfolio of Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Debt Portfolio. **********Unlike the bank loans they replaced, Brady bonds are ''legal securities, which means liquidity goes up dramatically,'' said Ed Vaimberg, who manages a total of $60 million in two Bear Stearns emerging-market  debt funds. **********''They've become a very effective way for a broader array of investors to enter these countries,'' he said. **********But liquidity isn't the only positive this market has enjoyed in the last year. Mexico itself has begun retiring Brady issues early with lower-yielding, uncollateralized debt of its own. **********''We're seeing improving fundamentals in many of the countries, most of which have strengthened their economic reforms,'' said John Carlson, who manages a total of $670 million in seven emerging-market  fixed-income funds at Fidelity Investments. **********The return of confidence to the market is nowhere more obvious than in Russia. Its Vnesh series of restructured debts -- named for the Vnesh Ekonom Bank -- have doubled in the last year, despite the political uncertainty of the Russian elections earlier this year and, now,  the health of President Boris Yeltsin. **********Venezuela and Panama have also been leaders in price appreciation, leaving many larger nations, like Mexico and Argentina, with room to catch up, Mr. Carlson said. The two smaller economies have benefited from successful local financial reforms, said Mr. Vaimberg, and the movement of funds into these smaller markets has also had an outsized impact. **********The state of the global economy is also favorable to emerging-market debt. With interest rates low in the United States, Germany and Japan, ''typically money flows down the credit spectrum and out the yield curve'' to the highest yields, Mr. Carlson noted. **********For domestic investors, emerging-market debt also has an advantage in portfolio diversification over junk bonds, which are its rival for high yields. Corporate junk is closely linked to the business cycle, but the fortunes of emerging-market bonds are tied more directly to interest rates. In a recession, junk bonds can drop along with their issuers, whereas government bonds tend to rise in price as interest rates fall. **********The debt of emerging-market countries can even diversify an equity portfolio, having performed quite differently recently than third-world equities. Much of the debt is denominated in United States dollars, so there is no foreign currency risk, Mr. Vaimberg noted, and many of these nations have policies intended to bring down inflation, which push up interest rates and hurt corporate earnings in the short run. **********Emerging-market debt, Mr. Biggs said, ''is disconnected from everything.'' **********FINALLY, many emerging-markets specialists say the sector's small size will be a big plus as more investors discover it. ''What we like about Brady bonds is that they are limited in size,'' Mr. Treacher said. ''As more money chases the dragon, there isn't going to be any more supply.'' Indeed, if Europe achieves monetary union, the effect will be even fewer choices for fixed-income investors, as distinctions among the bonds of Germany, Italy and Spain are erased. **********Volatility is likely to remain the signature characteristic of this market, however. ''If you can't stand the heat, you shouldn't be in this kitchen,'' said Mr. Forest of Bond Fund Adviser. ''But if your goal is to hold a diversified portfolio, having an allocation to these markets can reduce your overall risk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/18/business/international-business-trade-group-orders-us-to-alter-law-for-first-time.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Trade Group Orders U.S. To Alter Law For First Time", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Trade Group Orders U.S. To Alter Law For First Time", "body_text": " **********In its first major ruling as the international arbiter, the World Trade Organization determined today that a key section of the Clean Air Act discriminated against foreign oil refiners. It ordered the United States to develop a plan to change its rules on imported gasoline or face unspecified sanctions. **********It was not immediately clear what the consequences of the ruling, which concerned the law's standards for reformulated gasoline, might be. Administration officials said tonight that they had not decided whether they would appeal. **********But the political significance of the decision may be larger than its environmental effects. Republican aspirants for President, led by Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, have been critics of the power of the World Trade Organization, warning that it would allow foreign judges to rule on the validity of American environmental and labor laws. **********To win approval of the global trade accord that created the organization, which has broad authority to rule on disputes among more than 120 nations, President Clinton had to strike a deal with Senator Dole that called for Congressional review of all cases the United States loses. **********Another Republican Presidential hopeful, Patrick J. Buchanan, has declared that he would pull the United States out of the trade organization if he were elected. \"We cannot allow panels of foreign judges to dictate our laws to us,\" Mr. Buchanan said recently, a theme he strikes often in his tours of Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season gets into full gear. **********The case against the United States was brought by Venezuela and Brazil, and the three-judge panel that ruled against Washington had members from Finland, New Zealand and Hong Kong. **********The Administration will take some time to decide whether to submit today's decision to the trade organization's just-created \"appellate body.\" Its prospects if it does appeal do not appear good. **********Within hours of the decision, the United States trade representative, Mickey  Kantor, said that \"the results of this dispute cannot and will not compromise this Administration's commitment to our environmental laws.\" **********\"We will be carefully reviewing the panel's reasoning and our legal options,\" Mr. Kantor continued, \"and will be consulting with Congress and interested members of the public about our next steps.\" **********The case involved the law's standards for gasoline intended to reduce emissions that produce smog and toxic air pollutants. It could have the greatest effect on the East Coast, where about 20 percent of all gasoline consumed comes from foreign sources. **********Both the timing and the content of today's decision were problematic for the  Clinton Administration, which argued during the debate over the trade pact that  any loss of American sovereignty to the World Trade Organization would be outweighed by the advantages of the global accord. The agreement requires all the signers to greatly slash their tariffs, a move that is expected to help American exporters far more than their international rivals. **********Mr. Dole has backtracked from his past support of free trade as the political campaign has progressed. He and other Republican candidates, led by Mr. Buchanan, evidently think that Mr. Clinton is vulnerable to accusations that he  has placed the fate of American workers in the hands of other nations. **********Mr. Kantor, in a telephone interview today from California, said he was not surprised by the decision: His office had warned Congress several years ago that any laws that treated imported products differently from domestically produced products were open to attack. **********He also said that the problem was temporary. Under the law, imports and domestically produced gasoline are treated the same starting in 1998. **********\"We understood the risks,\" Mr. Kantor said. By the time an appeal is ruled on and a \"compliance plan\" is submitted, other American officials said, the issue may well be moot. **********The dispute which led to today's decision began three years ago, before the World Trade Organization came into existence, when Venezuela asked the United States for permission to ship gasoline to the Northeast that probably produced more smog-emitting chemicals than American refiners were permitted to sell. Much of the nation's gasoline is sold by the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, which has more than 6,000 outlets under the Citgo name on the East Coast of the  United States. **********Under the Clean Air Act, domestic producers were required to meet standards based on the emissions of gasoline they produced in 1990. But many foreign producers did not keep equivalent records, and they were held to a different standard: They could only ship gasoline that met an average quality standard in  the United States. The foreign companies argued that effectively required them to meet higher standards than some American concerns, putting them at a disadvantage. **********American refiners countered that they had been forced to invest billions of dollars in their refineries to comply with the Clean Air Act rules and that importers should not be able to undercut them with gasoline that did not meet the same standards. \"Anyone selling gas in the U.S. should be playing by the same rules,\" J. Donald Turk, a spokesman for Mobil, said. **********The chemicals at issue are called \"aromatics.\" American experts maintain that Venezuelan gasoline is high in aromatics, a major contributor to smog. **********But from the perspective of the World Trade Organization, the only issue is one of equitable rules. Its dispute settlement panels, which meet in Geneva, are charged with insuring that environmental, legal or labor restrictions are not intended to favor domestic producers over foreigners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/09/business/first-data-shifts-western-union.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First Data Shifts Western Union", "print_headline": "First Data Shifts Western Union", "body_text": " **********The First Data Corporation plans to move the headquarters of Western Union, its money transfer and messaging unit, to Greenwood Village, Colo., from Paramus, N.J., where 150 jobs will be eliminated. **********First Data said the move would create up to 300 new full-time professional, technical and managerial jobs between 1996 and 1998. **********A spokesman said that 150 jobs would be eliminated but that 150 employees would remain at the Paramus site for Western Union's commercial services and international unit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/26/business/cover-peeled-off-minute-maid-s-quiet-switch-leo-burnett-company-june.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-08-26", "snippet": "Coca-Cola Co has quietly moved advertising account of its Minute Maid line of refrigerated and frozen juices to Leo Burnett Co from Lowe & Partners/SMS; switch is inadvertently disclosed in announcement that former Burnett aide Robert H Welke join...", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The cover is peeled off of Minute Maid's quiet switch to the Leo Burnett Company in June.", "print_headline": "The cover is peeled off of Minute Maid's quiet switch to the Leo Burnett Company in June.", "body_text": " **********IT is usually difficult for the gossipy denizens of Madison Avenue to keep a secret. But one account switch -- involving a familiar grocery brand sold by one of the world's largest marketers -- managed to stay under wraps for two months before being inadvertently disclosed late last week. **********The switch involved the Minute Maid line of refrigerated and frozen juices sold by the Coca-Cola Foods division of the Coca-Cola Company. The brand's account was moved between two shops on the Coca-Cola agency roster, arriving at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago from Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York. Though billings were not disclosed, the trade publications Advertising Age and Brandweek estimate annual advertising spending on Minute Maid at $12.6 million. **********The account has actually been at Burnett since June. But Coca-Cola had seen no reason to publicize the change, Bob Bertini, a spokesman in Atlanta, said on Friday. **********How, then, did word of the switch emerge? It was disclosed in passing in a news release that was faxed on Friday to reporters by another agency in Chicago, the Euro RSCG Tatham unit of Havas Advertising. **********The release announced changes in the senior management at Euro RSCG Tatham that included the hiring of a former Burnett creative executive, Robert H. Welke. In outlining Mr. Welke's creative credits, the release described how he had ''been heavily involved'' in work for Coca-Cola, including campaigns for the Fruitopia line of iced teas and juice drinks, which Coca-Cola assigned to Burnett in May 1995. **********The success enjoyed by Mr. Welke's work for Coca-Cola, the release went on to say, ''led Coca-Cola to award Leo Burnett the Minute Maid business.'' **********Oops! **********''My mistake,'' Mr. Welke said in a telephone interview on Friday, adding that because the Minute Maid switch had occurred ''some time ago,'' he believed that it was no longer a secret. **********''Still, I should not have talked about it,'' Mr. Welke said, ''because it's all Burnett's business, not mine any longer. **********''I guess I can only say, 'No comment,' on my own press release,'' he added, laughing. **********Mr. Bertini did, however, confirm the switch. ''The work is under way,'' he said, though he declined to discuss when a Burnett campaign might begin. **********Recent campaigns for Minute Maid have included commercials that Mr. Bertini said were created on a project basis by a small New York agency, the Manhattan Marketing Ensemble. Those spots centered on taste tests called the ''Sunshine Challenge'' that featured frozen Minute Maid orange juice. **********The switch of Minute Maid to Burnett from Lowe was part of ''an ongoing process as we continually evaluate our agencies and the work that they produce,'' Mr. Bertini said.  Burnett landed Minute Maid a year after resigning the account of the brand's leading competitor, the Tropicana line of juices sold by the Seagram Beverage Group, a unit of the Seagram Company. Burnett had attributed the resignation of that account, with billings estimated at $25 million, to a conflict between Tropicana and Fruitopia products. Tropicana has been handled since August 1995 by FCB/Leber Katz Partners, a unit of True North Communications in New York. **********Lowe, which is part of the Lowe Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, continues to handle the account of another Coca-Cola Foods brand, the Hi-C line of juice drinks. Lowe also creates campaigns for two of the biggest Coca-Cola soft drinks, Diet Coke and Sprite. Twice last year, Lowe lost duties on smaller Coca-Cola soft-drink brands; those brands, Diet Sprite and Fresca, were awarded to Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York, an affiliate of the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott. **********In the changes at Euro RSCG Tatham, Mr. Welke, who is 49, is joining the agency as chairman and chief creative officer. He assumes those responsibilities from Ralph Rydholm, 59, who continues as chief executive. Curtis D.

But the arrests, including those of leading Shiite clerics, have added to political and sectarian tensions in a country where Shiites are in the majority. **********The trouble began in December 1994 with the arrest and deportation of a Shiite cleric for circulating a leaflet signed by 20,000 people demanding the restoration of Bahrain's Parliament, which was dissolved in 1975. **********After violence early last year that left at least 13 civilians and 3 policemen dead, there were signs that the Government might open a political dialogue with its opponents. But opposition leaders have accused the Government  of reneging on a commitment to do so, and the disturbances that have resumed of  late have included bombings at a shopping mall and a hotel. **********In his interview today, Sheik Khalifa, whose family has ruled Bahrain for more than 200 years, did not spell out what the Government might do if the violence continued. But the Defense Ministry has said its forces are prepared to enforce martial law, and Sheik Khalifa, who is the younger brother of Bahrain's  Emir, Sheik Issa bin Salman al-Khalifa, said he believed that \"action has to be  taken straight away to eliminate these problems once and for all.\" **********The Government announced today that it had arrested 180 people in connection  with recent unrest, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, it had said it was holding 544 people: 174 rounded up in recent days and the rest for the protests  last year. But two Government officials suggested today that the number might be higher, saying that more than 350 people had been arrested since the beginning of the month. **********The main Shiite opposition group, the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement,  puts the number of detainees at about 2,000. **********The most prominent person in custody is Sheik Abdelamir al-Jamri, a Shiite cleric who was a member of the dissolved Parliament. The Bahraini authorities have also announced the arrests of seven other leading clerics, and a ninth, Ahman Mansour Ali, is also reported to have been imprisoned. **********All are expected to face trial on charges of inciting riots, and Bahraini officials, who say privately that there is evidence linking the attacks to Iran, have said the clerics may also be charged with taking part in a foreign-backed plot. **********Although Shiites comprise only about one-tenth of the world's one billion Muslims, in Bahrain they outnumber Sunnis -- members of the rival branch of Islam, to which the Khalifa family and most of the country's elite belong -- by  about 2 to 1. Shiism has dominated Iran since the 10th century, and the Manama Government has suspected Teheran of trying to stir up trouble among Bahrain's Shiites since Islamic militants took power in Iran in 1979. **********Iran has denied any involvement in the unrest here, and the daily Iran News said on Monday that Bahrain was using Teheran as a scapegoat to justify its refusal to grant political rights to its people. It said that Bahrain's ruling family had \"denied its people even the most basic semblance of democracy -- Parliament -- through which they could have a say in shaping their future,\" and  that it was only natural that \"mass dissatisfaction and civil disturbance should be the outcome.\" **********But other regional leaders, including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, have  suggested foreign involvement in the unrest here, and today Sheik Khalifa came as close as any Bahraini official has to publicly pointing the finger at Tehran. **********\"These people had studied in Iran,\" the Prime Minister said in describing many of those under arrest. \"What did they study, how they have been trained, how they have been contacted, their confessions -- all this will come out in court.\" **********Unlike its Gulf neighbors, Bahrain produces no oil of its own, and mounting unemployment, particularly among the Shiite majority, is clearly a major cause of discontent. In Shiite villages like Bani Jamra, one of the sites of this week's unrest, anti-Government graffiti demand jobs and the overthrow of the Khalifa family. **********Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of daytime fasting, began last Sunday, and many here say that the slower pace it traditionally brings has helped quell the  violence. In Bani Jamra this afternoon, the streets were almost deserted, and the few residents who were outside the closed doors refused to talk with a foreign reporter. **********By today, the riot policemen who were dispatched last weekend to Shiite villages had been withdrawn, although a police convoy was moving conspicuously through Manama on its way to what officials said was an exercise. **********The Bahraini officials made clear that they were no mood to give in to their  critics' demands as a way to win a permanent end to the violence. **********\"Yes, the Western countries and the people here talk about democracy,\" Sheik  Khalifa said. \"We are not afraid of democracy.

Last year, the group was refused permission to have a stand at the annual exhibition. **********The group took the Government to court and won its case on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's Attorney General immediately filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, charging that a gay booth at the book fair would bring a ''breach of peace and disorder and immoral behavior.'' **********In addition, Mr. Mugabe's supporters vowed to tear down the stand. Undaunted, the group opened its booth today. **********There were no posters and no pamphlets, only flowers at the stand. But it immediately became the most popular of the nearly 300 booths at the fair. Scores of Zimbabweans crowded around the booth to talk with representatives about homosexuality. Some questioners were antagonistic and taunting, while others seemed merely curious. **********''When the Zimbabwean public can see that we are ordinary people, then they will realize they don't need to be afraid of us,'' said Keith Goddard, a representative of the group. **********''This may not look like much,'' said Mr. Goddard, gesturing toward the bare stand. ''But for us this is a great step forward. This public education is good for everybody.'' **********Gerald Chibwanya, a member of the group, said, ''This has been difficult for us, but now people realize that we have rights, too.'' **********Some fear anti-gay violence before the book fair ends on Saturday. Threats have come from Mr. Mugabe's ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, and from Sangano Munhumutapa, a university group claiming to be Zimbabwe's ''cultural police.'' **********The controversy over gay rights in Zimbabwe was joined a year ago when the book fair bowed to Government pressure and refused the gay group the right to have a booth at the fair. **********In a series of speeches last year, President Mugabe denounced homosexuals as ''un-African'' and denied that gay Zimbabweans have any legal rights. **********Despite Mr. Mugabe's bitter words, no arrests or prosecutions have so far taken place. **********The gay group had planned to display pamphlets about its counseling service, homosexuality and the Zimbabwean law, a statement from the Roman Catholic Church and an anthology of writing by gay Zimbabweans about winning acceptance in their society. All of the material had previously been cleared by the Zimbabwe police. **********But because of the impending Supreme Court ruling over its right to have a stand at the book fair, the organization decided not to hand out any publications and to simply answer questions from the public. **********Mr. Mugabe's anti-gay stance has galvanized Zimbabwe's gay minority and has won the organization significant international support. After Mr. Mugabe made an anti-homosexual speech while on a visit to the Netherlands, a Dutch organization pledged $120,000 to the Zimbabwean gay group.

Large funds are often unwieldy because it takes time to build or unwind positions and because the impact of winning issues is diluted by the portfolio's size. **********Not so, argues Jack Bowers, editor of the Fidelity Monitor, an independent newsletter in Rocklin, Calif., that covers only Fidelity funds. Defensive positioning -- similar to but smaller than the moves made last year by Fidelity's flagship fund, Magellan -- accounts for the lag. **********After analyzing nine portfolios run by eight of Fidelity's most experienced money managers, he found that they had cut their risk levels this year, and that their cash/bond holdings averaged 13 percent compared with 10 percent for all of Fidelity's domestic stock funds. The nine funds were Magellan, Contrafund, Value, Growth and Income, Equity-Income II, Low-Priced Stock, Destiny I and II and the Fidelity Fund. **********Moreover, these funds now own more conservative stocks, having replaced higher-priced issues with the  cheap cyclical stocks of, say, auto makers and oil companies. **********Much of the repositioning began early in 1996 as Fidelity analysts started forecasting a slowdown in corporate earnings and a slump in the technology sector. The Magellan fund, indeed, started moving out of technology even earlier, in November last year, and into bonds shortly after, eventually building a cash and bond position as high as 35 percent early in 1996, Mr. Bowers said. **********The changes at Magellan were orchestrated by its manager at the time, Jeffrey N. Vinik, who left at the end of May, and its subpar performance after the shift was widely criticized. Under the new manager, Robert E. Stansky, the cash/bond position was down to 16 percent of assets at the end of August. **********The conservative positioning at the other funds has also created performance that mostly lags behind the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year. Earnings growth has not stalled enough to prompt a significant stock market correction, and the market has kept climbing. **********Fidelity managers may have to wait until 1997 to see their views vindicated, Mr. Bowers wrote in a recent issue of his newsletter. But they have said they are comfortable waiting. In fact, the trend may already be reversing itself: in the last four weeks through Thursday, Fidelity's three biggest funds -- Magellan, Contrafund and Growth and Income -- have all outperformed the S.& P. 500. **********Mr. Bowers said he believed that investors in the nine funds he looked at should be rewarded if they, too, wait. He sees an earnings slowdown over the next few years, in part because, if the United States dollar gains strength, many big companies could see some pressure from declines in foreign sales. **********On the Web **********Ryback Management has started a Web site for its Lindner funds (http://www.lindnerfunds.com) with prices, performance data, fund profiles, company news and more.  Other features, including on-line bill-paying, brokerage services and fund transactions, are set for early 1997. **********Janus Funds has set up a home page at http://www.janusfunds.com with information on the Janus funds and their managers, as well as daily fund prices and performance, educational materials and prospectuses. **********Transamerica Premier Funds opened a Web site at http:// www.transamerica.com that offers daily updates on net asset values; describes the funds and their managers, and lets investors download copies of the funds' prospectuses, applications and more. **********In Brief **********Franklin International Equity was renamed Templeton Foreign Smaller Companies and its focus has shifted from investing mainly in large-cap stocks to smaller-cap stocks. The portfolio will change gradually; it should be mostly invested in small overseas issues by January 1997. **********Fidelity Investments has added 225 funds from Alliance Capital, Franklin Templeton, GT Global, Kemper, Keystone, Massachusetts Financial Services, Nicholas Applegate and Phoenix Duff & Phelps to its Institutional Funds Network program.

Germany wants such a pact to include heavy fines for high-deficit nations. **********Mr. Lamfalussy nevertheless saw a \"reasonably high probability\" of a currency merger by 1999.

Feeling More Irish", "print_headline": "Irish Protestants Feeling More Irish", "body_text": " **********When predominantly Roman Catholic southern Ireland won independence from Protestant-dominated Britain 74 years ago, the Protestant minority here felt threatened by what many saw as a Catholic state to be run by a zealous and hostile majority taking its signals from Rome. **********Protestants, particularly of the largest denomination, the Anglican-oriented Church of Ireland, fled by the thousands, mostly to Britain. The Protestant working class virtually disappeared. **********The proportion of the Irish population belonging to the church, which included most of the country's ranking civil servants and affluent landowners and businessmen, dropped from about 11 percent to 2.4 percent today -- or about 80,000 of the Irish Republic's 3.5 million people, 92 percent of whom are Catholics. **********But now, as Church of Ireland members prepare to celebrate Christmas, there is a growing spirit among them of Irishness, a fading of the old links to Britain, says Archbishop Walton Empey, the Church of Ireland Primate here in the Republic. And, quietly, with nobody boasting or counting exactly, several hundred Roman Catholics have joined the Church of Ireland in recent years. **********''We are in very good heart,'' the Archbishop said in an interview at the church's See, which administers the work of 230 priests, 26 of whom are women. ''In earlier times, the majority of the Church of Ireland would have a presumed link with the United Kingdom,'' he said. ''There was among us a certain timidity, a keeping of the head down, a consciousness of being a minority. We would have been quiet. The Catholic Church was very triumphalist.'' **********''But now,'' he said, ''there has been a great transformation. We are an extremely confident minority, not afraid to speak out.'' **********While progress with the Catholic church on doctrinal matters like papal infallibility and mixed marriages is slow, he said, there is a sense that ''we are being listened to.'' **********He said his church had joined the Catholic hierarchy in fighting Government plans to weaken the religious authorities in the running of the country's state-subsidized schools. And despite the grumbling of its older, more traditional believers, the Church of Ireland, while steadfast in doctrine, is allowing change in some of its austere rituals, moving closer to the practices of the Catholic Church and the Church of England. **********Many Church of Ireland churches now permit the lighting of candles (but not the small ones for which Catholics pay before praying, and saints' images are still excluded). Some Church of Ireland clergy members, who are called priests, but not father, including Archbishop Empey, bless themselves with the sign of the cross, which shocks and annoys many parishioners accustomed to watching Catholics bless themselves repeatedly when they pass a church. **********And now at Christmas, in addition to the traditionally decorated evergreen trees, there are Jesse Trees, decorated with symbols of the biblical promises made to Jesse, father of David, that a Messiah would come. Many Catholics attend Church of Ireland services to hear traditional Christmas caroling not provided by their own parishes. **********''I do not get up in the morning thinking I'm a minority,'' the Archbishop said. His view was reflected by other Church of Ireland members, who discussed what it is like to be Protestant in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, where traditional Catholic angelus bells reminding the faithful to pray are played twice a day on national television and radio. **********They talked about the mistaken views many Catholics have about them; the violence between Protestants and Catholics in predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland; issues like celibacy among priests and the recurring scandals involving Catholic priests convicted of sexual abuse of children. **********Many Catholics, some Protestants feel, consider them from afar as cold, nongamblers, teetotalers, too honest in business, too devoted to washing themselves with strong soap, loyal to Queen Elizabeth and to the Protestant majority's discrimination against Northern Catholics. **********''When you meet Roman Catholics they tend to judge you in the context of Northern politics,'' said Heather Jones, an 18-year-old student at Trinity College, once a Protestant bastion and now 70 percent Catholic. ''You don't speak Irish,'' she said, citing the stereotypes. ''You must be very Anglo-Irish, close to Britain, and financially well-off.'' **********She said that most southern Protestants abhorred the northern Protestant insistence on holding patriotic marches through Catholic areas, which has stirred violence in recent months. But both she and her mother, Valerie Jones, a publicist, said they opposed the Catholic Church's rule that a Catholic who marries a non-Catholic must promise to bring up the children as Catholics. Heather said she could marry a Catholic but not agree to such a condition. **********''I'd stand my ground,'' she said. ''I'd point out to him that we're the minority and we need the numbers.'' **********''Twenty or thirty years ago, well, I wouldn't say we were ashamed, but we were in the closet,'' said Tim Keatinge, 55, an official at the Church of Ireland College of Education. ''But I never felt threatened. Roman Catholics would find out your religion and put you on a higher pedestal for some things, like honesty. They thought you could be trusted.'' **********''I think of myself as Irish and Christian,'' said Gillian Wharton, one of the Church of Ireland's 26 female priests, who regularly wears a starched white clerical collar and black blouse and jacket. Miss Wharton, 30, is the roving curate of two parishes outside Dublin, and the church's Youth Officer. She said the Church of Ireland has had no reports of sexual abuse of children by its priests, who are allowed to marry. **********''And when my friends see me out in a pub for a drink with my boyfriend, they don't think I'm losing my vocation,'' she said. ''My brother is married to a Roman Catholic -- my sister is going out with one.'' **********Both men and women seeking help tell her, '' 'I would never talk to a man about this,' '' she said. **********''There are things a married male priest can do,'' she said. ''A priest can talk in a sermon about how he first fell in love with his wife, about how he felt when his child was ill.'' And she said, ''In a hospital I can hold a man's hand. A male priest wouldn't feel free to do that.'' **********Miss Wharton said that when people see her in Dublin shops, they say things like ''Excuse me, father, are you really a woman?'' or ''It must feel very strange.'' **********To which she replies, ''Very strange for you, but not for me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/26/business/another-departure-at-kmart-as-marketing-chief-resigns.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another Departure at Kmart As Marketing Chief Resigns", "print_headline": "Another Departure at Kmart As Marketing Chief Resigns", "body_text": " **********In its latest housecleaning move, the Kmart Corporation announced yesterday that Kenneth W.

Antonini, during his final weeks at the company. **********\"They need their own team and Watson was from the old regime,\" said Walter Loeb, who runs his own retail consulting firm in New York. \"The dynamics of Kmart are changing and some people are just not in step with it. This just continues the restructuring in order to be a more dynamic organization.\" **********Kmart's executive turnover began in October, when Charles Chinni, the executive vice president for merchandising, was pushed out. **********In February, the company dismissed both its merchandise manager in charge of  women's apparel and its general merchandise manager. Mr. Hall said at the time that the company would give responsibility for some home goods to Gilbert L. Wachsman, a senior vice president, and that it would soon name a new manager for apparel and soft goods for the home, which is considered one of the important positions in turning around the embattled chain. **********Mr. Chinni and Mr. Watson, who is 53, were both part of a four-man management team installed by Mr. Antonini only weeks before he was ousted by the board last March. **********\"Ken Watson enhanced Kmart's advertising with the selection of our new strategic advertising agency Campbell Mithun Esty and, through them, has developed a more focused marketing effort during his time at Kmart,\" Warren Flick, president of Kmart stores in the United States, said in a statement. \"We  wish him well in his new endeavors.\" Mr. Flick, who came on board in December, has been aggressively trying to beef up merchandising operations, the company's  core weakness. **********The Minneapolis-based advertising agency was responsible for the Kmart commercials that featured the actresses Penny Marshall and Rosie O'Donnell. In the spots, the two try to persuade the world that they, too, buy boom boxes and  stuffed animals at Kmart. While the campaign received mixed reviews, it gave the company some badly needed attention. **********But the job of vice president for marketing goes beyond good advertising; the person in the position is essentially responsible for creating and honing a corporate image. **********\"What is still missing from the Kmart story is a vision of how Kmart will be  distinct from both Wal-Mart and Target,\" said Barry Bryant, a senior director of research at Rodman & Renshaw in New York. \"Wal-Mart is recognized for low prices; Target is recognized for quality. Unless Kmart wants to go head-to-head  with one of those companies, it has to stake out some other territory. It has to be simple and it has to be powerful, and the marketing function at Kmart needs to create that identity.\" **********Mr. Watson's responsibilities will be divided between Larry C. Davis, vice president for advertising, who will take on the marketing job, and William D. Underwood, senior vice president for vendor and product development. **********The announcement of Mr. Watson's resignation was made after the stock market  closed.

They also signaled that the Republican campaign intends to use others, not the Presidential candidate, Bob Dole, to lead the attack. **********Mr. Dole initially assailed Mr. Clinton's handling of the Iraqi attack on a Kurdish region last week in the hours before the United States launched its first strike against Iraq's air defense and communications systems. The Republican candidate backed off the next day, concerned that he might be accused of jeopardizing national security at a time of crisis. **********Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, one of Mr. Dole's top foreign policy advisers, called Mr. Clinton's policy on Iraq an ''abject failure'' and said the Dole campaign believed that Mr. Clinton's handling of Mr. Hussein was a legitimate area of criticism. The Senator said that since Mr. Dole felt some concerns about raising the issue, he would leave it to surrogates to handle. **********Responding to Mr. Kemp's remarks, the White House spokesman, Michael McCurry, said, ''In facing provocative behavior by Saddam Hussein, the United States will fulfill its mission in the region best when we speak with one voice and not with discordant voices.'' **********Last week, Mr. Clinton ordered two missile attacks against military targets in Iraq after Iraqi forces attacked an area of northern Iraq populated by Kurdish separatists that had been designated by the United States and its allies as a safe zone. **********But the attack by the United States did not seem to deter the Iraqi leader. Ignoring warnings by the United States military, the Baghdad Government has reportedly started repairing some of the anti-aircraft installations that were hit. And tensions increased today after Iraqi forces fired at two American F-16 fighter jets as they flew over northern Iraq, the Pentagon said. **********Mr. Kemp said today that the Clinton Administration had failed to meet any of ''the clear objectives that must be achieved before our mission in Iraq can be considered a success.'' **********He said those objectives included withdrawal of Iraqi troops and agents from northern Iraq, the release of Kurdish prisoners and an end to brutality against the Kurdish people, full cooperation by Iraq with United Nations weapons inspectors, and an end to state-supported international terrorism by Mr. Hussein and his Government. **********Mr. Kemp insisted that he was not playing politics with the issue. ''This is not headline hunting,'' he said. ''This is a very serious question about U.S. foreign policy.'' **********But sensing that the situation in Iraq was turning into a vulnerable spot for Mr. Clinton, the Dole-Kemp campaign jumped at the chance to score a political blow. **********''Our alliances are in disarray and support for our mission is at risk because President Clinton's policy is vague and uncertain,'' Mr. Kemp said in a written statement. ''Before any further action is taken, the President must clearly state his policies, forthrightly explain his objectives, and tell us how he intends to implement these goals. **********''In what is obviously a worsening situation,'' the statement continued, ''the public will only stand united behind the President if he plainly explains his policies and tells the American people what is required to achieve them.'' **********In his remarks to reporters later, Mr. Kemp added: ''I don't think it's politics to question how this effort, how this mission is being carried out. There are people's lives at stake. We have young men and young women in uniform and no one is playing politics with their lives.'' **********He drew parallels between how Mr. Clinton was handling Iraq and the allied effort in 1991 led by President Bush, a Republican, that routed the Iraqi military in the gulf war. **********When Mr. Kemp was asked how a Dole administration would react to similar circumstances, he at first suggested the question was premature, but then added, with a reference to the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staf, Colin Powell: **********''Bob Dole has always believed that you've got to have the support of your allies. You've got to build that coalition that President Bush put together with Colin Powell in the Persian Gulf crisis when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Clearly that has not happened. We do not have the broad support that was put together by President Bush and Colin Powell.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/20/business/avant-buying-anagram-for-76-million-in-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-08-20", "snippet": "Avant Corp says it has agreed to buy Anagram Inc for $76 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AVANT BUYING ANAGRAM FOR $76 MILLION IN STOCK", "print_headline": "AVANT BUYING ANAGRAM FOR $76 MILLION IN STOCK", "body_text": " **********The Avant Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the privately held Anagram Inc. for $76 million in stock.

It was at this site, Maria Reyes Ruiz asserts, that two of her brothers and 11 other people were buried in a common, clandestine grave after the newly installed Sandinista revolutionary Government arrested and executed them in 1979. **********''The Sandinistas killed my brothers, and I want to know who did it and why,'' Miss Reyes, 57, a schoolteacher who lives just a few miles east of this small market town, said in an interview at her home. ''My brothers got no trial and I cannot bring them back, but I do have a right to see justice done.'' **********More than six years after the Sandinista National Liberation Front was voted from power, Nicaragua is belatedly having to confront allegations of Government human rights abuses during the Sandinista era. **********The issue emerged as a contentious one during the country's recent presidential campaign, and with a rightist President, Arnoldo Aleman, scheduled to take office in January, calls for more investigations and accountability are increasing. **********Lino Hernandez Trigueros, director of the private Permanent Commission on Human Rights, says more than 1,100 people who disappeared during the 11 years of Sandinista rule have yet to be accounted for. That number is expected to grow, he said, as other people come forward, encouraged by the sudden shift in the political climate. **********''We have already uncovered and exhumed five such graves from the time of the Sandinistas,'' Mr. Hernandez said in an interview in Managua, ''principally in the area of Granada, where a lot of prisoners disappeared. Many people, both witnesses and relatives of the missing, have come to us since this issue detonated to talk of prisoners who were removed from jails and disappeared.'' **********More than half of the reported cases, about 600, date back to the months immediately after the Sandinista overthrow of the 45-year Somoza family dictatorship in July 1979, and largely involve suspected Somoza sympathizers. **********Another 450 cases, Mr. Hernandez said, arise from missing peasants suspected of collaborating with the American-supported contra rebels, while another 100 or so stem from the disappearance of Miskito Indians on the Caribbean coast. **********But Vilma Nunez, director of a rival group, the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, said efforts to blame the Sandinista Government for clandestine graves were premature and politically motivated. **********The Somoza dictatorship and the Washington-supported contras who fought the Sandinistas during the 1980's were guilty of human rights abuses on an even larger scale, she argued, and were probably responsible for many of the secret burials attributed to the Sandinistas. **********''You are falsifying the history of Nicaragua, making a mockery of human rights and insulting the dead if you speak only of the common graves of the Sandinistas,'' she said. ''You cannot attribute the appearance of bones or remains to them without employing technical resources that we do not have. So what are presented as Sandinista graves could well be otherwise.'' **********But Miss Reyes said she had no doubt about the origin or content of the clandestine grave here. She said she had been able to recover the remains of her brothers Jose Antonio and Pedro Joaquin in 1980, identifying one by the shirt he was wearing and the other by his glasses. ''But out of fear, we never denounced their killing until now,'' she said. **********Reports of disappearances and executions were common throughout the period of Sandinista rule, and when Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in at the polls in 1990, there were widespread expectations that she would pursue the issue. **********Instead, Mrs. Chamorro has favored a policy of reconciliation, retaining many Sandinista security officials in their posts. **********Unlike El Salvador, Argentina, Brazil or Chile, Nicaragua has never formed a truth commission to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and fix responsibility for such acts. As a result, the human rights issue has festered here, and popular resentment has grown. **********''This is a matter that could and should have been resolved years ago,'' Mr. Hernandez said. ''But Mrs. Chamorro has lacked political will, and prefers not to touch questions like disappearances and clandestine graves.'' **********But during the presidential campaign leading up to his resounding victory on Oct. 20, Mr. Aleman promised to appoint such a commission. Its purpose, he said in August, ''will not be to judge people and put them in prison, but to let the families of the victims know what happened.'' **********Sandinista leaders have expressed deep reservations about the structure and objectives of such an effort and accused backers of the proposal of mounting a witch hunt. **********Mr. Ortega, the runner-up in the Oct. 20 vote, has condemned the focus on abuses that may have occurred under his Government as ''a great injustice'' and an act of political irresponsibility. ''What would happen if we started releasing information on mass graves left by Somoza's genocidal National Guard?'' Mr. Ortega asked reporters during the campaign. ''They should not be adding fuel to the fire.'' **********But Mr. Hernandez denied that his group's interest was primarily political. ''We have treated this subject with the utmost caution,'' he said. ''We did not want it to be used as a theme of the campaign, but the publicity has awakened a great interest in the subject'' among surviving relatives of the disappeared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/29/world/summit-meeting-endorses-plan-giving-police-freer-rein-to-pursuecriminals-abroad.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1996-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 876, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Summit Meeting Endorses Plan Giving Police Freer Rein to PursueCriminals Abroad", "print_headline": "Summit Meeting Endorses Plan Giving Police Freer Rein to PursueCriminals Abroad", "body_text": " **********The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia endorsed a 40-point plan today to combat crime and terrorism that would, if fully carried out, give the police far freer rein to pursue criminals abroad. **********The plan, disclosed at the 22d annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries, would allow the United States and other countries to post investigators on foreign soil and would require the seven allies to crack down on the import and export of firearms. **********The plan was under development before the terrorist bombing on Tuesday that  killed 19 American servicemen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. But President Clinton, seizing the moment to drag along allies who have often been reluctant to agree on concrete steps that impinge on their national sovereignty, pressed to tighten some of the provisions. **********Some of the steps, originally packaged as a broader anti-crime initiative, appeared aimed more at drug dealers and corrupt business executives than at terrorists. But Administration officials pointed to requirements that nations coordinate prosecutions when crimes occur across borders and that they \"insure that criminals and terrorists are brought to justice and tried\" even if extradition proves impossible. **********The other members of the Group of Seven -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- are also bound to develop witness protection programs, much  like the one used in the United States, to give new identities to people who testify against organized crime groups. **********While they were eager to portray the agreement as major progress, Administration officials conceded today that turning those general agreements into national laws and regulations would be a long struggle. **********\"These are countries that often can't agree on the rules for selling planes to China or moving lumber across borders,\" a senior Administration official said tonight. **********\"We'd be fooling ourselves to think any of this will happen instantly.

For example, the new rules call for all the G-7 nations to strengthen \"laws to prevent bribery and extortion.\" While that sounds non-controversial, until a few months ago German companies paying bribes abroad were permitted to deduct them from their taxes. **********The most visible divisions among the leaders were over American efforts to isolate Iran, Libya and Cuba and over strategies to relieve the world's poorest  nations from their huge debt loads. **********Several leaders chastised Mr. Clinton for signing legislation that would punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba and for announcing that he would go along with a bill approved by Congress a week ago that would similarly  penalize companies that invest in Iran and Libya. **********At a briefing for reporters today, Daniel Tarullo, a top official of the National Economic Council, said that \"the President pushed back fairly hard,\" telling the allies that they needed to \"confront terrorist states to take action against countries that are threats to democracy and to the safety of our citizens.\" **********Separately, a dispute flared over a plan pressed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin to arrange for the International Monetary Fund to sell part of its $40 billion in gold reserves. The proceeds of a sale of $2 billion to $3 billion in gold would be invested in interest-generating financial instruments, and the  resulting income would be used to pay off debt for third-world countries without requiring donor countries to allocate more resources to pay off the loans. The World Bank would pay off roughly $2 billion, and individual nations would forgive other debt as part of a larger initiative. **********After a lengthy struggle with countries opposed to the plan, led by Germany,  the United States won wording in the economic communique that Mr. Rubin said would allow the gold sales to move forward after the I.M.F.'s annual meeting in  the fall. **********\"We've all agreed that the I.M.F. should fund this primarily through its own  resources, and we've all agreed to optimizing the assets of the I.M.F. to do so,\" Mr. Rubin said. **********But just before he spoke, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, insisted that the wording of the communique would allow the sale of gold to be blocked.

At the same time, he will, under the territory's new constitution drafted by Chinese and Hong Kong representatives, be charged with defining and defending the autonomy promised Hong Kong. **********With the transition only eight months away, the Hong Kong stock market is at new highs and property prices have begun surging after a sharp slowdown last year. Despite assurances from Beijing that Hong Kong will remain ''substantially'' unchanged for the next 50 years, many people here have grave doubts about Beijing's promises. Indeed, earlier this month China renewed its threats against some long-held freedoms, including freedom of assembly and of the press. **********Further souring the local mood,  the candidates have avoided any hint of criticism of Beijing and have refrained from making audible commitments to democratic processes. **********''The more secretive the process,'' said Christine Loh, an independent member of Hong Kong's legislature, ''the more hesitant the candidates.  And the more the Preparatory Committee'' -- the Beijing-appointed body that is overseeing the transition to Chinese rule -- ''ignores the public dimensions of the selection process, the less confidence Hong Kong as a whole will feel.'' **********Of the four candidates, the odds-on favorite is a shipping magnate who has now admitted that he was bailed out of financial oblivion in the 1980's by $120 million of secret financing from China. **********Tung Chee Hwa, like all but one of his rivals, was born in Shanghai and fled Communism with his family, relocating first to Taiwan and later here, where his father built Orient Overseas (International) Ltd., one of Hong Kong's two large shipping companies. After inheriting the concern in the 1980's at a time when global shipping shrank dramatically, Mr. Tung used money secretly invested from China to save the company. **********He also served as a member of Mr. Patten's cabinet, a position from which he resigned in June. **********Another prominent businessman, Peter Kwong-ching Woo, a former Chase Manhattan banker in New York and the enormously successful chairman of a property and shipping conglomerate founded by his father-in-law, has also declared his interest in leading Hong Kong under Chinese rule. At 50, he is the youngest aspirant for the job, but his chairmanship of the local hospital authority has given him experience in public administration that none of the other candidates possess. **********The other two candidates are former Justices on the Supreme Court. Sir Ti Liang Yang, 67, whose resignation as Chief Justice took effect today, was also born in Shanghai and studied law there before Mao's troops entered the city in 1949. He was very much an innocuous fixture in Hong Kong until last year, when he suggested that the Bill of Rights Ordinance, a series of laws intended to codify basic civil rights, should be weakened. **********The second judge, Simon F. S. Li, entered the race last week. The 74-year-old Mr. Li, the only native Hong Konger, is unapologetically pro-China, even resorting to familiar Communist jargon to describe Hong Kong's relationship with China as ''similar to lips and teeth.'' **********But his candidacy is not helped by the fact that his daughter, Gladys Li, is the chairwoman of the Bar Association, a body that has forcefully dissented from China's plans for Hong Kong, or that a son, Simon Li, is the foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times. **********Despite rounds of news conferences, meetings with business groups, and consultations with delegations of the civil services by each of the four men, Hong Kong seems resigned to the fact that there is no real race for the job. But some argue that popular sentiment will be taken into account. **********From a democratic perspective, the selection process is ''totally dictated by China,'' said Peter Cheung, a political scientist at Hong Kong University. ''But this creates a dilemma for China,'' he added. ''It doesn't want things to get out of control; on the other hand it cannot send its trusted officials to rule. So China would like to see a candidate acceptable to the Hong Kong people.'' **********Still, the jockeying has clearly done little to bolster faith in the future. A survey by the Hong Kong Transition Project, a multi-university research effort begun in 1993, found Hong Kongers still skittish about China's impending takeover, still identifying themselves as distinctly Hong Kongers as opposed to Chinese, profoundly unhappy with Beijing's dealings with Hong Kong and deeply worried about a rise in corruption and threats to personal freedom. **********''There is yet to be a majority of people who want to join China,'' said Michael DeGolyer, the director of the project, and a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. ''We've been expecting this number to increase but it's been increasing very, very, very slowly.'' **********Since 1993, when 42 percent of those polled said they wanted unification, today only 48 percent desire unification; the rest are split among other choices, including independence and remaining a colony. The poll found that 44 percent of Hong Kong's 6.2 million people would try to leave if the situation under Chinese rule deteriorated significantly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/01/business/medeva-wins-in-court-battle-with-biogen.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-11-01", "snippet": "Medeva PLC says it won final court victory in Britain against Biogen Inc in patent fight for rights to develop hepatitis B vaccine; Biogen had sued Medeva in 1992, claiming Medeva infringed a Biogen patent for its hepatitis vaccine (S)", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Medeva Wins in Court Battle With Biogen", "print_headline": "Medeva Wins in Court Battle With Biogen", "body_text": " **********Medeva P.L.C. said today that it had won a final court victory in Britain against Biogen Inc. in a patent fight for rights to develop a hepatitis B vaccine. **********The British House of Lords dismissed Biogen's appeal and ordered the company, a biotechnology concern based in Cambridge, Mass., to pay legal costs, Medeva said.

Visa U.S.A., which markets the most popular credit card, reacted angrily to the American Express announcement, because it had long had a policy that banned its member banks from issuing some competing cards, though not those of Mastercard.

Mastercard picked up market share in recent years by issuing cards in association with big companies, notably the General Motors Corporation, well before Visa began issuing such cards. **********\"When corporations wanted to issue credit cards, Visa quickly shied away from that,\" said Robert McKinley, the president of Ram Research. \"Mastercard saw that as an opportunity and decided to take advantage of it.

Students here are unhappy about the fares on commuter trains, so Mr. Yeltsin, during a brief foray into the crowd, summarily  ordered the fares lowered. **********But today's meeting was aimed at a far broader audience. **********In essence, the aim was to persuade Russian voters that the President who launched the Chechen war is the best candidate to bring peace to the Caucasus, or at least that the Communists would be worse. **********Sounding the theme of \"integration,\" the meeting also played to the longing of many Russians for closer ties with the other former Soviet republics. **********Mr. Yeltsin has already used summit meetings with Western leaders and with the Chinese to polish his image as a world statesman. **********The idea for this conference came from Nikolai Yegorov, Mr. Yeltsin's chief of staff.

They said Mr. Holm allowed an operative to carry on a love affair with the French official she was targeting, a decision that may have doomed the operation. And his underlings, including the lovestruck spy, made serious blunders that led to an international embarrassment, they said. **********Mr. Holm retired last year while waiting for the inspector general to compete his report. He is a famous figure to his fellow cold warriors. He was flying into Zaire -- then the Belgian Congo -- during a counterinsurgency operation in  1962 when his light plane disappeared from the radar. He was presumed lost. But  he lived, though horribly burned and permanently scarred, and was nursed by villagers who pulled him from the wreckage. **********The wreckage of the Paris operation goes beyond Mr. Holm's career. Joseph DeTrani, chief of the Europe division of the C.I.A.'s clandestine service, has been placed in administrative limbo and at least four covert operators have been recalled from Paris. The inspector general's report will be shared with the congressional intelligence committees, some of whose members are likely to use it as a club with which to bash the C.I.A. for its work in the field of economic intelligence. **********Officials familiar with the report said the basic facts of the case were accurately disclosed by France's Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, in February  1995. In interviews, intelligence officials added details to the story, which was a major embarrassment for the C.I.A. when the French revealed it. **********In 1993, R. James Woolsey, then a new Director of Central Intelligence, publicly announced that economic intelligence was a major new priority for the C.I.A. This naturally entailed spying on allies like Japan, Germany and France.  The French had been particularly aggressive in spying on American executives --  bugging and stealing from hotel rooms, for example. \"No more Mr. Nice Guy,\" Mr.  Woolsey warned in a speech. **********Soon the C.I.A.'s Paris station had at least five operatives -- four officers posing as diplomats and a woman posing as the Paris representative of a private  American foundation -- working on a two-pronged project. They were assigned to uncover French positions on world trade talks and to counter French economic espionage against American companies. **********The undercover operative posing as a foundation representative made fundamental mistakes: communicating too openly with the C.I.A. station and communing too secretly with her target, a French official. Mr. Holm, the station chief, found out about the love affair she was conducting with the official. It  was clear that the romance could compromise the operation. He and Mr. DeTrani, his boss as chief of the Europe division, agonized over whether to abort it. Mr. Holm wanted to carry on, and he convinced his boss. **********Neither man told Ambassador Harriman that their operation existed, was imperiled and could be exposed. But French counterintelligence officials soon knew that a network of C.I.A. officers was operating against them. Either through sloppy work or through pillow talk, the undercover operative had revealed her secret status as a spy. The operation quickly unraveled. **********The French, breaching the traditional protocol in such cases, raised an uproar over the spying rather than letting the four accused spies working under  diplomatic cover slip out of the country for activities, as the phrase goes, \"incompatible with their diplomatic status.\" The ensuing publicity raised questions about whether spying on allies for economic data is a worthy pursuit for the C.I.A., or whether its operatives would do better to concentrate on the  activities of terrorists and other deep political secrets abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/company-news-danaher-extends-acme-cleveland-tender-offer-again.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;DANAHER EXTENDS ACME-CLEVELAND TENDER OFFER, AGAIN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;DANAHER EXTENDS ACME-CLEVELAND TENDER OFFER, AGAIN", "body_text": " **********The Danaher Corporation said yesterday that it had extended until May 8 its tender offer to acquire the Acme-Cleveland Corporation for $27 a share, or $186  million.

The appetite for expansion has been particularly intense among companies that own the largest stakes in television programming businesses, namely the networks -- and in particular, the NBC and Fox networks. **********Even some companies that do not produce programming are jumping into the fray. Last week, Raycom Media Inc., which is owned by a Boston lawyer and two television executives, agreed to acquire seven television stations in the Southeast and Midwest from Aflac Inc., an insurance holding company, for $485 million. Working with financing from the Alabama state pension fund, Raycom has already reached two other deals to acquire 20 stations in  its effort to build a new broadcast group in smaller-  and medium-sized markets in the region. **********But the bulk of deals has been among the network companies, which are seeking to control and increase the distribution of their programming at a time other companies are increasingly creating competing programming. By owning stations, media companies can assure themselves wide distribution not only for the shows their networks run, but also for other programming they may produce and distribute. **********Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns Fox, has agreed to buy the New World Communications Group for a total of $2.5 billion -- that will give it control over 10 television stations in larger markets that are already Fox affiliates. And NBC has spend $425 million for two stations that were already affiliated with NBC. **********In yet another deal driven by programming, the Tribune Company agreed last month to pay $1.13 billion for Renaissance Communications 10 television stations. The Tribune stations carry the fledgling Warner Brothers network, which is now on two nights a week. **********As distribution outlets expand --  from network television to cable and direct broadcast satellite -- the appetite for programming has increased. But as Mr. Murdoch has pointed out: ''Programming gets more expensive to make, and the audience is fragmenting. There is a very much smaller audience for reruns, so you need distribution.'' **********Television stations also appeal to the network in part because the network programming business is an unpredictable business with low profit margins. The television station business, on the other hand, is far more lucrative. **********Paul Kagan, who heads a media consulting firm that bears his name, said the networks had cash flow margins of about 10 percent, although they could go as high as 12 percent in a good year. Meanwhile, he said, cash flow margins for television stations can run from 25 percent to 50 percent if the stations are well managed. **********Mr. Kagan estimated that the 10 Fox affiliates that the News Corporation bought had operating cash flow margins of about 33 percent for the first half of 1996. **********Still, station buyers, particularly the News Corporation, are paying a steep price. The News Corporation  paid roughly 18.6 times 1996 cash flow, far above the industry average of about 12 times cash flow. **********There is no sign that prices are dropping. Indeed, Michael Finkelstein, the chairman of Renaissance Communications, chose to sell his company to Tribune Company only after he found himself outbid by richer companies in a series of station purchases. **********The relaxation of Federal Communications Commission rules has allowed media companies to expand the reach of their television stations to 35 percent of the American market from 25 percent. And another round of consolidation of the television business may be on the way. **********Some media experts believe that the F.C.C. will eventually allow companies to own more than one television station in each market, just as they can now own more than one radio station."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/17/world/zairian-tutsi-family-now-stateless-runs-for-its-life.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1996-11-17", "snippet": "Interview with Rev Theophile Gakounzi, Pentecostal minister and Zairian of Tutsi origin, who was forced into hiding with his family when Tutsi rebels supported by neighboring Rwanda overran several Zairian cities in border region; in early days of...", "word_count": 925, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zairian Tutsi Family, Now Stateless, Runs for Its Life", "print_headline": "Zairian Tutsi Family, Now Stateless, Runs for Its Life", "body_text": " **********As a melancholy Zairian rumba blared on the grimy river ferry's loudspeakers, the Rev. Theophile Gakounzi sat his wife and infant son on the upper deck, gathered their few belongings around them and set out to start life anew across the river in Congo. **********This was not the dreamy voyage of a young emigrant heading overseas for the adventure of an exciting new land or career. It was the culmination of three weeks of terror, from which he barely escaped with his life and family intact. Those weeks cost him his nationality and the comfort of a world he had considered his own. **********Mr. Gakounzi, 37, is a Pentecostal minister who for seven years has led a small parish in the Matongue section of Kinshasa. Like several thousand Zairians of Tutsi origin, he was forced into hiding when Tutsi rebels supported by neighboring Rwanda overran several Zairian cities in the border region. **********In the early days of the crisis, Zairian Tutsi and people of Rwandan ancestry were hunted by mobs in quarter after quarter of Kinshasa, although it is more than 1,000 miles from the war zone. **********Scores of other Zairians were likewise forced into hiding: people thought to match the stereotype of the fine-featured Tutsi, or whose accents made them suspect to the xenophobic provocateurs who briefly had the run of the streets here. **********''I was a lucky one,'' said Mr. Gakounzi, who explained that a parishioner had come to his house early one morning just as the crisis was exploding and urged him to take cover. **********''I may have lost my home,'' he said, ''but others were dragged through the streets by their hair and beaten. Women were raped, and surely several people died.'' **********Zaire's Government quickly condemned the vigilante attacks, but in a country that even in ordinary times is fitfully subject to law and order, that offered victims precious little protection. **********The Government's position was rendered even more delicate by the ethnic heritage of the Prime Minister, Leon Kengo wa Dondo, whose maternal grandmother was a Rwandan Tutsi and whose father was Polish. **********Even as mobs chased down people in the streets of Kinshasa, the city became the scene of almost daily demonstrations against Mr. Kengo's Government. Already deeply unpopular before the rebel attacks, it was a convenient scapegoat for the scarcely contested loss of Zairian territory to a force supported by a much smaller neighbor. **********''How can you expect a man who is himself a Tutsi to lead us out of this crisis?'' cried Kitwe Kasongo, one of several dozen students who have taken up residence on the grounds of Kinshasa's main cathedral since the Government shut down their campuses in punishment for student strikes. ''The people have vomited Kengo, just as we will vomit all of the Tutsi and make Rwanda pay for its arrogance.'' **********Increasingly, such calls for revenge are being uttered with the kind of ethnic venom that dies hard in  Africa, which has repeatedly been torn by such animosities. **********Zaire has a long history of hospitality toward Tutsi and Hutu peoples of Rwandan and Burundian ancestry. Before Mr. Kengo, who was appointed in 1994, another politician of Tutsi origin served for many years as the right-hand man of Zaire's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. **********Likewise, many of the country's most successful business people -- including the director of the most profitable cellular telephone service, who recently resigned to ease attacks on his company -- are Tutsi. Their place in Zairian society now seems but a distant memory. **********When Mr. Gakounzi arrived this morning at Kinshasa's teeming river port for the 15-minute trip across the  Zaire River into Congo, he and his family were leaving their hiding place for the first time since the attacks on the Tutsi had begun. **********Together with a dozen other Zairian Tutsi, all of whom were born and have always lived in Zaire, they were  surrounded by white-smocked members of the Zairian Red Cross for their protection. **********While a crowd gathered around them, they exchanged snippets of news and gossip about the conflict in the east, mostly speculating about how and when Zaire would recover its lost land. A few shouted insults at the group, which any moment now would be exiled. **********''The Tutsi have revealed their true face, the one we knew they had all along,'' said a Kinshasa street vendor who identified himself as Claude as he boasted of having taken part in recent attacks. ''They want to own everything. And since their women are unnaturally fertile, now they are trying to take over Zairian land as well.'' **********With that, Zairian immigration agents delivered a final insult, confiscating the departing people's travel documents: passports, identification cards, anything else that could prove their Zairian citizenship. **********''It was like we were animals being dragged out of the forest for display,'' said Jeannette Gakounzi,  clutching her 5-month-old son to her breast. ''But we have to thank God that we have not been hurt.'' **********Many of those who fled Zaire early in the crisis, crossing the river into Congo, were flown to Rwanda by the Kigali Government. About 800 others have been taken to a police training camp north of the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, which is just across the river from Kinshasa. **********As the boat's engines were started, belching out thick black smoke, Mr. Gakounzi said he had no idea what was in store for him and his family. **********''Even with all that has happened,'' he said, ''I have no other country but Zaire. They can strip me of my citizenship and prevent me from returning, but like anyone else, I will always want to go home.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/29/world/angry-at-netanyahu-arafat-calls-general-strike.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1996-08-29", "snippet": "Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat calls for general strike, charging expansion of Israeli settlements and actions by Govt of Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu amounts to declaration of war on Palestinian people; Palestinian Council urges Palestinians to ...", "word_count": 1471, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Angry at Netanyahu, Arafat Calls General Strike", "print_headline": "Angry at Netanyahu, Arafat Calls General Strike", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, charged today that the expansion of Jewish settlements and actions in Jerusalem by the Israeli Government amounted to a ''declaration of war on the Palestinian people,'' and he called for a general strike on Thursday morning. **********At Mr. Arafat's suggestion, the Palestinian Legislative Council also called on all Palestinians who could to gather at Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem for Friday Prayers, and for all Palestinians to march after the Prayers to protest the new settlement activity. **********Though the strike is to last only four hours and should not directly affect Israel, the measure carried considerable symbolic impact as the first public protest against Israel called by Mr. Arafat in the two years since he took charge of the autonomous Palestinian areas. For Israelis it carried the clear reminder that general strikes marked the opening of the civil strife that preceded the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace. **********The call on Palestinians to gather at Al Aksa Mosque, the emotional focus of the Arabs' claim to Jerusalem, carried the additional effect of calling on Palestinians to defy restrictions on their movement out of the West Bank. **********Mr. Arafat's speech, made to a session of the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah, was his strongest challenge to the right-wing Israeli Government since its election last May. In recent weeks, facing growing criticism among Palestinians over the plight of the peace agreement he signed with the Israelis, Mr. Arafat has waged a widening campaign to mobilize internal and foreign support against the policies of the new Israeli Government. **********''What is happening are continuous violations and crimes by this new Israeli leadership, which means a declaration of war on the Palestinian people, starting with settlement activity,'' Mr. Arafat said. **********He said the strike should serve as a warning ''that the situation is dangerous,'' and said its rallying cry would be Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that Jerusalem will remain an undivided Jewish capital has been one of the major sources of contention. **********Mr. Netanyahu responded by saying such ''inflammatory rhetoric'' should be avoided. ''I think it would be a very grave mistake to have an escalation of rhetoric or of deeds, especially an escalation toward violence,'' he told reporters. **********''We are in the process of concluding a framework for moving ahead and negotiating many of the outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinians, something that I would like to do, and I hope that this kind of escalation does not hinder it.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that he is committed to the agreements with the Palestinians and that various programs are in the works, but the process has remained stalled while Jewish settlers have resumed building. **********On the day before Mr. Arafat's appearance, the Israeli Government gave its first formal permission to a Jewish settlement to expand beyond its existing boundaries, and today bulldozers were already at work around the ultra-Orthodox community, Kiryat Sefer, in the West Bank. **********In another development that infuriated Palestinians, Israeli crews used a crane to hoist a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem's Old City at 4 A.M. on Tuesday and proceeded to demolish a Palestinian day-care center for the disabled in the Muslim quarter, saying it was being restored without a building permit. The Canadian Government had recently donated $30 million to the center. **********These incidents were among several that Mr. Arafat invoked in the crowded chamber of the Legislative Council: He cited Israel's efforts to force a Bedouin tribe to evacuate West Bank lands sought by a Jewish settlement; the arrival of hundreds of new mobile homes in various settlements, purportedly for use by schools, and the expansion of Jewish settlements in Gaza into areas that had been demarcated as military zones. **********Finally he recalled his own humiliation a week ago when the Israelis delayed permission for him to fly in his helicopter from Gaza to the West Bank. The action led him to postpone his appearance before the council by one week. ''Their silliness reached a new level this week -- they made my helicopter circle over Tel Aviv for 40 minutes,'' Mr. Arafat added. **********Mr. Arafat called on Palestinians ''to confront this huge settlement ghoul.'' **********''We cannot keep silent or ignore this terrible plan, which they insist on implementing in order to break our nose,'' he said. ''They don't know who Palestinians are.'' **********At the same time, there were indications of continuing efforts to prevent a break in the negotiating process. Mr. Arafat said he received three calls this morning from Dennis Ross, the United States coordinator of Israeli-Arab issues, who had been meeting in Paris with Mr. Netanyahu's top foreign-affairs adviser, Dore Gold, and Egyptian officials. **********Mr. Arafat, who had earlier said the ''United States Administration is paralyzed because of the American elections,'' said Mr. Ross told him that ''the Israelis are prepared to move,'' and that they have ''good intentions.'' **********Mr. Arafat said Mr. Ross urged him to send his senior negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas, to meet with Mr. Gold on Thursday. **********Many Council members, however, voiced strong opposition to such a meeting, and it was not clear whether it would be held. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of Mr. Arafat's cabinet, said the deputies were ''exerting tremendous pressure'' on the Palestinian leadership not to meet with Israelis ''unless Israel ceases immediately its activities and starts genuine negotiations.'' **********Later, Mr. Arafat left to take a call from the Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy. Mr. Levy, however, has not figured in Mr. Netanyahu's dealings with the Palestinian issue, so it was not clear whether he was speaking for the Government or for himself. **********After Mr. Arafat's address, the Legislative Council approved declarations calling for a strike and the special call to Friday Prayers. ''Let us stand in one rank in facing the settlements and to protect our Holy Jerusalem and our dear land,'' the statement concluded. Underneath, Mr. Arafat wrote, ''For distribution to everyone.'' **********In his call for a strike, Mr. Arafat also appealed for support from Arabs living within Israel and with Israeli citizenship. Though that call was not included in the Council resolution, an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament, Ahmed Bashara, called on Israeli Arabs to come to Jerusalem for Friday Prayers. **********Mr. Arafat's address was part of a quickening campaign in recent days to press Israel into resuming the negotiating process. It has been spurred in part by the political jeopardy in which the stalled negotiating process has placed Mr. Arafat among his people. **********Many Palestinians, and some members of the Legislative Council, have pointed to the Israeli actions as proof of the failure of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, which Mr. Arafat launched with the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and have revived accusations that Mr. Arafat agreed to a bad deal. **********Mr. Arafat's efforts to revive the process have included a flurry of appeals to the United Nations and world leaders, travels to Arab capitals and meetings with Israeli liberals, including Mr. Peres. One of his appeals led President Ezer Weizman to agree to meet with Mr. Arafat and to press Mr. Netanyahu to do likewise. **********Much of the attention from outside Israel has focused on Hebron. Under previous agreements Israel was to have withdrawn its troops from most of the city in March. Mr. Netanyahu's refusal so far to meet with Mr. Arafat has also been criticized. **********But among Palestinians, the major complaints have been over many actions and statements not necessarily approved by the Government, but encouraged by its right-wing policies. **********Several ministers have independently announced various programs, including a plan to build two new roads for settlers announced by Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, and a plan to incorporate nearby settlements into Jerusalem, announced by Deputy Housing Minister Meir Porush. **********In the Jewish settlements, people have resumed moving into houses left vacant after the Labor Government declared a freeze on settlement expansion, and Palestinians have reported construction activity in many areas. **********--------------------        Ambush in West Bank **********JERUSALEM, Aug. 28 (Reuters) -- Gunmen fired on an Israeli bus traveling near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, leaving two people wounded, a police officer said. **********Some 15 shots were fired at a commuter bus making its way to the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, the police officer, Boaz Goldberg, told Israel radio. **********The radio said the two people were wounded by glass fragments. It was reported that a third person suffered a heart attack. **********The attack took place on a road south of Bethlehem that Israel built specifically to bypass Palestinian areas. The police set up roadblocks in the area and were searching for the attackers. **********No one has taken responsibility for the shooting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/02/world/shanghai-journal-in-75-years-a-party-s-long-march-to-irrelevance.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1996-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 936, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shanghai Journal;In 75 Years, a Party's Long March to Irrelevance", "print_headline": "Shanghai Journal;In 75 Years, a Party's Long March to Irrelevance", "body_text": " **********In a small brick home on a leafy side street in this city, a dozen idealistic young men gathered around a scuffed wooden table 75 years ago today to launch China's Communist Party, or so the history books say. **********One of the participants, Mao Zedong, then just 27, later rose to lead the Communist Party through civil war to make it the ruling power of the land. For decades, Mao directed efforts to install the party's authority in every office,  factory and school, creating a juggernaut that could spread the party's word to  every household and monitor the daily activities of every worker or student. **********Today, the old building is a museum to a lost ideal. Virtually no one believes in Communism anymore. **********As economic growth eats away at old systems and habits, the Communist Party's influence in daily life has receded sharply in the past few years, particularly  among young urban dwellers -- the kind, in their 20's, who might be setting up a political party if they lived in a different era. In the most modern sectors of  Chinese society, such as securities firms, trading companies, banks and real estate dealers, the once-omnipresent party has almost no presence at all. **********The party still has an iron grip on the national levers of political power. Yet its ground-level organization seems to be falling farther and farther out of touch with the work and life styles of the men and women who increasingly drive  China's bustling economy. **********\"No one with any ability joins the party today,\" said Yang Jun, a 26-year-old computer salesman who likes gold-rimmed glasses and polo shirts. \"My company has 80 employees, but there's no party organization. If there are any party members, I don't think any of them would admit it.\" **********Not long ago, a college graduate like Mr. Yang would be assigned a job by one party official and supervised in a new workplace by another. If he wanted to get married, his choice of spouse would also have to be approved by a superior. A neighborhood committee would keep an eye on his home, noting who came and went. **********In contrast, today Mr. Yang lives relatively free from party interference. He chose his own job and home -- he shares a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Shanghai with a co-worker -- and doesn't worry about who approves of his girlfriend, or when she stays over. \"I haven't introduced her to my parents yet,\" he said, a little sheepishly. **********Party officials do not seem overly concerned with individualistic computer jocks like Mr. Yang, though their indifference would disappear in a flash if he  organized any anti-Government activity. But they concede that they are having difficulty setting up party cells in free-market sectors of the economy. **********\"New companies are being set up faster than we can keep track of,\" acknowledged Zhou Heling, who as deputy director of the organization department  in Shanghai's Communist Party oversees the establishment of new party units. \"We are encountering a lot of problems with these new economic entitites. **********\"Joint ventures are very complicated,\" Mr. Zhou added, referring to companies with both domestic and foreign investment. \"Sometimes they register but don't operate; sometimes they operate without registering. It's hard to keep up with them.\" **********Paradoxically, as party organizations lose touch with China's young professionals, they are aggressively enrolling more new young members than ever  before. Perhaps it is to co-opt as many young people as possible; perhaps it is  simply to pad the fiction that the party is getting ever stronger. **********\"Young people are the key,\" Mr. Zhou said. \"Last year, 54 percent of our new  members were under 35. **********In addition to the 19,600 35-and-unders who joined the party in Shanghai last year, Mr. Zhou said proudly, 110,000 more people applied, up 20,000 from the previous year. Altogether, there are 1.14 million members of the Communist Party in Shanghai, a city of 14 million, and 57 million nationwide. **********But numbers can be deceiving. **********A 35-year-old currency trader at a leading Chinese investment firm recalled how a manager at his company recently pressed him to apply for party membership, simply because an order had come down to step up recruitment. **********\"But I don't want to have to pay the party fees,\" the trader protested, as he remembered it later, because he would owe 3 percent of his $3,000 monthly salary in fees. **********\"You don't have to join, just apply. We need to raise our numbers,\" pleaded the manager. \"Help me out.\" **********The trader agreed, on the condition that the manager made sure his application would be rejected. But then the trader had trouble finding any colleagues to write him a recommendation, because none were familiar with the party line that needs to be regurgitated in an application, and eventually gave  up. **********The implications of this sometimes-comical attitude toward party enrollment,  like the political future of China itself, are anyone's guess. One of the puzzles of modern China is whether the Communist Party, if it remains in power,  will simply decide to shed its outdated name. **********Even a leading party organizer like Mr. Zhou does not sound much like a Communist when he discusses the establishment of party cells in a company. **********\"Our primary concern is money-making ability,\" he said. \"Setting up a party organization should be done in parallel with business functions. We will not get in the way.\" **********Outside the museum where the Communist Party's first meeting was held, Wu Xiaoyong, a 40-year-old party member who arrived with a busload of colleagues, pondered the future of the organization. **********\"Not too clear,\" he said. \"Young people have a lot more choices today than we did.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/06/business/mcdonnell-wins-lufthansa-order-for-cargo-jets.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-09-06", "snippet": "McDonnell Douglas Corp says it has won order worth $1.3 billion from Lufthansa for its MD-11 jet, to be used as cargo aircraft; firm orders are placed for five MD-11's, and there are options on seven more; General Electric will provide engines; or...", "word_count": 369, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonnell Wins Lufthansa Order for Cargo Jets", "print_headline": "McDonnell Wins Lufthansa Order for Cargo Jets", "body_text": " **********The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that it had won an order worth as much as $1.3 billion from Lufthansa for its MD-11 jet, to be used as a cargo aircraft. **********The order is timely for McDonnell Douglas, which has been struggling to remain competitive with the Boeing Company, the market leader, and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.

Car sales edged up 1.6 percent, helped by the discounts offered to customers. **********Auto executives were optimistic about their prospects. ''Inflation appears to be in check, consumer confidence is high, the economy continues to grow moderately and interest rates have stayed in a range that historically has supported good sales levels,'' said Bob Rewey, group vice president of marketing and sales at Ford. ''All in all, the outlook for the new model year is a healthy one.'' **********Still, some analysts said today that the strong sales this month signaled that sales would decline later this year. ''We are starting to run on borrowed time,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an auto analyst with Salomon Brothers. Sales have been strong so far this year, but the fact that auto makers must increasingly woo customers with discounts suggests that the market, left to its own devices, would be slowing. **********''A lot of the pent-up demand has been exhausted,'' Mr. Kirnan said. **********A slowdown would be consistent with other signs this week that the economy as a whole is growing moderately. On Tuesday, a September survey of corporate purchasing managers' spending plans showed declines from August levels. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators was nearly flat in August, rising two-tenths of 1 percent. And there were modest declines in retail sales. **********Today, Ford, the last of the Big Three auto makers to report results for September, said that its sales rose 7.3 percent in the month, compared with a year ago. Sales of Ford pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles rose 7 percent, while its car sales rose 7.7 percent in September. Percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 24 selling days last month but 25 in September 1995. **********Ford also won bragging rights to the nation's best-selling car for the model year, which ended Sept. 30, for its redesigned Taurus. Ford sold 378,144 of the 1996 model Taurus, while the Honda Motor Company sold 367,137 1996-model Accords and the Toyota Motor Corporation sold 354,035 Camrys. **********For the 1996 calendar year the Ford Taurus is also ahead of the Accord and Camry. The Taurus has now held the title four consecutive years, both for model and calendar years. **********Ford's brand-new sport-utility vehicle, the Expedition, got off to a strong start in its first full month of sales. Ford sold more than 8,200 of the giant trucks, a company executive said. **********Ford stock fell 50 cents a share, to $31.25, on the New York Stock Exchange today. **********Other auto makers said today that their sales increased. Honda said its sales rose 1 percent, while Toyota said its sales jumped 14.2 percent. Others reported results earlier this week. **********The nation's largest auto maker, the General Motors Corporation, said Tuesday that its sales fell 2.1 percent while the Chrysler Corporation said its sales rose 21.9 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. **********In September, auto makers sold cars and light trucks at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15 million. That is down from August's rate of 15.73 million, but up from July's rate of 14.21 million. So far this year, the industry has run at a clip of 15.1 million annual sales, about the rate that the Big Three predicted early this year. **********That suggested slowing to some economists. ''I think there is a little bit of softening in the market,'' said Thomas C. Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. **********Such a slowing could be good news for those in the market for a new car or truck. Analysts agreed with Mr. Webb that auto makers would likely need to rely on cash rebates and discount leasing deals if they want strong sales to continue. ''It is going to be a buyer's market,'' Mr. Webb said. **********Indeed, Ford announced on Wednesday rebates and discount leases on a number of 1996 and 1997 models, including the Taurus, Aspire, Probe, Mustang, Contour, Thunderbird, Ranger and Windstar, along with Mercury's Tracer, Sable, Cougar, Grand Marquis and Villager. Most discounts are scheduled to last the rest of the year. **********Auto dealers said their customers were responding to earlier rebates, and that the fresh rebates would likely prove popular."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/19/business/company-news-boeing-announces-510-million-order-from-china.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BOEING ANNOUNCES $510 MILLION ORDER FROM CHINA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BOEING ANNOUNCES $510 MILLION ORDER FROM CHINA", "body_text": " **********The Boeing Company, the world's biggest civil aircraft manufacturer, has sold three long-range 747-400 aircraft to China for $510 million, a company spokeswoman said in Beijing early today.

The company flourished in the 1980's by purveying high-priced toys for status-conscious, ostensibly grown-up boys. **********That image, however, is now more dated than yellow ties and other accouterments of the 80's power wardrobe, unless Tom Cruise agrees to appear in 43 sequels to the gadget-friendly film ''Mission: Impossible.'' **********As a result, the financial performance of the Sharper Image has suffered, er, sharp setbacks. Earnings last year sagged to the level of 1992. And in its fiscal first quarter, ended April 30, the company reported a loss of $2.2 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with a loss of $933,000, or 11 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales, at $36.5 million, fell 3.2 percent from $37.7 million in the quarter a year earlier. **********So the Sharper Image, for the first time, has hired an agency to create a campaign that seeks to pull off the tremendously difficult and tricky task of changing attitudes about its products. That agency -- the creative hot shop Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, owned by Omnicom Group -- was named in April after a review. **********The agency's first campaign is scheduled to be introduced next month. The effort is quintessentially Goodby, Silverstein in that, like the agency's popular campaigns for Polaroid cameras and milk, humor is used to help alter attitudes about a product perceived as outdated. The budget for the initial print advertisements, planned to run through the holiday shopping season, is more than $2 million. **********''The customers who like us, love us, and that's good,'' said Sydney Klevatt, senior vice president for marketing at the Sharper Image in San Francisco. ''What isn't good is that people 10 to 15 years younger do not think as favorably of us.'' **********It came down to ''not cool,'' he added, summarizing the results of consumer research. **********That is anathema for a marketer that thrives ''on being cool,'' Mr. Klevatt said, ''on being a place you've got to go.'' Those attributes are important if you are selling merchandise like the Sonicare Plus with Quadpacer -- to translate from Sharperspeak, an electric toothbrush -- priced at $129.95, or a Pulse Action Face Massager, with enough tentacles for a dozen creature features of the 50's, for $49.95. **********''I remember how cool it was to walk into a Sharper Image store in the 80's and see all this James Bond stuff,'' said Rich Silverstein, co-chairman and creative director, who worked on the campaign with Jeff Goodby, the other co-chairman and creative director. **********''But life has gone on, and where do they fit in the world?'' Mr. Silverstein asked. ''You would like to be able to open a gift from the Sharper Image and say 'Wow!' rather than 'What's this?' '' **********The goal of the campaign, Mr. Silverstein said, was to overhaul the persona of the Sharper Image in a manner not unlike the way the hit film ''Goldeneye,'' with Pierce Brosnan as 007, helped administer a makeover to James Bond. **********So the ads try to keep an idea of the Sharper Image -- as promulgated in more than three million catalogues mailed monthly and 82 retail outlets -- as ''a guy's candy store'' selling ''men's fantasy gadgets,'' he added, without the ''black and chrome'' trappings of the last decade. **********And by introducing a theme that promotes the company's geegaws as ''Bare essentials for a really weird world,'' Mr. Silverstein said, the campaign is definitely aimed at an audience younger than the 40-year-old crowd that shops the Sharper Image. **********The humor in the print ads is slightly hip and clearly tongue in cheek. For instance, one ad sells a laser pointer by comparing it to a spy plane. Another ad likens a $350 Panasonic electric shaver to a bullet train because they share ''virtually frictionless linear propulsion systems'' -- but unlike the train, the shaver is ''guaranteed not to frighten farm animals or children.'' **********Mr. Klevatt said: ''We were taking ourselves too seriously. This is having fun without making fun.'' The ads will appear in publications that include Men's Journal, Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated. **********Having the design group at Goodby, Silverstein revamp the Sharper Image catalogue -- the agency's first such assignment -- happened because ''you cannot get a catalogue every month that's dishonest to the advertising,'' Mr. Silverstein said. **********So beginning with the October issue, the catalogue will look less cluttered, with fewer items on each page, and sport a new logo; the text adopts the humorous tone of the ads. The re-creation even extends to opening photographs of the founder, Richard Thalheimer: rather than standing in a business suit, he sits on a motorcycle in a leather outfit. **********As extensive as this ambitious effort is, there are some bounds. Not all Sharper Image items, for example, can be re-presented. **********''Some stuff is totally useless,'' Mr. Silverstein said, citing ''some kind of palm tree with water bubbles through it'' that had him chuckling at its apparent purposelessness."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/25/business/international-briefs-auchan-offers-to-buy-all-of-docks-de-france.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Auchan Offers to Buy All of Docks de France", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Auchan Offers to Buy All of Docks de France", "body_text": " **********Auchan, a French retail-chain operator, offered yesterday to buy the shares in the chain Docks de France that it does not already own, a move that would propel it into third place among French hypermarket operators, behind Carrefour  S.A. and Promodes S.A.

A court case at this short notice is unlikely to force Mr. Bossi to change his plans, and prosecution may only give him the status of persecuted hero in the eyes of his die-hard fans. **********''These initiatives smack of pure fascism because they try to limit freedom of expression and thought,'' said Roberto Maroni, a top member of the Northern League who served as Interior Minister in Italy's most recent center-right Government. **********And so the celebration of the birth of Padania -- an ancient name that now refers vaguely to territory stretching north from the Po River Valley -- is expected to start, as planned, with a flotilla that will head downstream from Mantua to Venice, with Mr. Bossi at the lead helm. Not much is known about whether Mr. Bossi plans a purely symbolic declaration of independence, or whether he plans to call for any concrete acts in defiance of the Government in Rome. Armed resistance is out of the question, though some manner of tax protest may not be. **********Many politicians and some newspapers have proposed that the best way to deal with Mr. Bossi is to challenge him politically. But with Italy's center-left Government, headed by Prime Minister Romano Prodi, absorbed by difficulties with its own coalition as it heads toward crucial budget battles this fall, the drama on the Po has been left to percolate on its own. **********The question of how much support he commands in those northern regions is still open to debate. While the Northern League, a party of protest born in the 1980's, did unexpectedly well in parts of the north last spring during Italy's national elections, it fared poorly in more recent local elections. **********When Mr. Bossi attended a performance of a Verdi opera this week in the northern city of Verona, he got an earful of jeers and insults as hecklers pelted him with chants of ''Long live a united Italy!'' Many league supporters are wary of his calls for secession and would prefer to see him pursue his original goal, which was a loosening of central control over Italy's regions within a new federal framework, and an end to the Rome Government's attempts to redistribute the country's wealth from the rich north to the poor south. **********For his part, Mr. Bossi continues to develop his political imagery. He no longer compares himself to William Wallace, the legendary Scottish nationalist hero in the Hollywood movie ''Braveheart,'' and instead identifies himself with Picasso, at the moment when the artist broke free of narrow definitions of his art. **********''Reality cannot be restricted by a given style,'' Mr. Bossi said this week. ''Reality is free, and by definition, freedom cannot accept restrictions, not even ideological ones.'' **********Several commentators have argued that Italy's mainstream politicians have not risen to meet the real challenge posed by Mr. Bossi, which lies in the frustration and resentment shared among many northern Italians over what they see as decades of waste and the diversion of tax revenue to the south. **********Instead, both the left and the right ''continue to be absent from the real field of battle,'' said Piero Ostellino, writing on Wednesday in the Milan newspaper Corriere Della Sera. ''Bossi, to date, is winning for lack of any opponents.

Both companies found that the move increased worker output. In BMW's case, it says it has actually added staff as a result. **********At BMW's factory in Regensburg, Germany, which produces the 3-series car as well as some auto parts, the recent implementation of a two-shift system that reduced the workweek to 35 hours from 36.5 increased efficiency by 30 percent, the company said. **********The company has added 2,500 workers to the 4,000 who worked in the plant when it only ran one shift a day. BMW said this increase was due to increased sales and had not come at the expense of other plants. **********\"BMW implemented the two-shift system and the 35 hour workweek not due to pressures from the labor unions but rather to increase productivity,\" said Claus Zwingarbargar, a BMW spokesman. \"It is this increased productivity and change to a two-shift system that is responsible for a growth of almost 6 percent in personnel companywide.\" **********In October, Mercedes-Benz began experimenting with a shortened workweek under union pressure to cut the week to 35 hours from 36.5. The company made employees responsible for organizing their work hours during the year. **********\"It has been very positive in that it has increased the responsibilities of the workers to organize their work and free times as they wish,\" Norbert Burcachard, a Mercedes-Benz spokesman, said. \"The end result we see is increased motivation and higher productivity.\" **********But in contrast to the situation at BMW, reducing work hours has not created jobs.\" Rather, the company has learned simply to be more efficient and therefore more profitable,\" Mr. Burcachard said. **********In France, Rusch-Pilling SA, a subsidiary of Teleflex Inc. of the United States, has pared the workweek of its 92 employees to 32.5 hours from 39 in a successful effort to increase the unit's growth. Rusch-Pilling is mainly concerned with the distribution of Teleflex's products, electronic and mechanical devices for medical industries and the high-tech sector and with the design of products special to the French market. **********Rusch-Pilling began the program last September, when its sales were growing at 60 percent a year. Faced with rapid growth and limited office space, the company opted to extend its business hours by splitting its staff into two six-hour shifts. Now employees work either from 6 A.M. to 1 P.M. or 1 P.M. to 8 P.M., rather than 9 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., with a one-hour break. **********\"We decided to do this for two reasons,\" said Paul Steuperaert, president of Rusch-Pilling. \" It was to use our capital investments better, and it has been proven that people can do superior work at better hours of the day.\" **********Catherine de Lamoriniere, the unit's director-general, added: \" It is hard to quantify if employees are working better. What we can say is that the employees are happier, and that tends to improve efficiency.\" **********As a result, work time being lost because of personal reasons has been reduced, and productivity has been improved because a midafternoon slowdown has been eliminated, she said. **********But organized labor was not impressed. Michele Commergnat, an official of France's General Labor Confederation, said the group opposed introducing a flexible working environment to reduce the number of working hours. **********\"This does not necessarily lead to hiring and often makes the company more productive through extracting more work from present employees,\" she said. But Ms. Commergnat does see a reduction of minimum working hours as a solution to rising unemployment in France, where the jobless rate stands at 12.5 percent. The CGT supports a reduction of the standard workweek to 35 hours from 39 without salary reductions or workplace restructuring, with the view that increased hiring will spur economic growth. **********Shareholders, she said, should bear the burden of this investment: \"The added costs of increasing the number of employees needs to come out of existing profit margins and not from a reduction in taxes or other government incentives.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/world/an-african-ex-emperor-laments-his-reputation.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1996-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1211, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An African Ex-Emperor Laments His Reputation", "print_headline": "An African Ex-Emperor Laments His Reputation", "body_text": " **********Before a recent army mutiny and intervention by France to evacuate its citizens and restore order, the last time most of the world had heard from this  sparsely populated country the news was as fantastic as it was sordid. **********An African military leader, Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who seized power on Jan. 1, 1966, from a repressive cousin to become \"President for life,\" decided in 1977 that even that station was not exalted enough and crowned himself Emperor of a realm in the heart of Africa. **********For his Napoleonic coronation, celebrated to strains of Mozart, Bokassa I, as he decided he should be called, spent an estimated $30 million. **********A Parisian jeweler was commissioned to design a $5 million crown, his throne  was decorated with 20,000 pearls, and 450 pounds of rose petals were flown in from France and sprinkled along the route to the national stadium, where the new sovereign was enshrined with great fanfare. **********As with all wild parties, the hangover was not long in coming. Two years later, with his country facing serious financial difficulties and his arbitrary  rule enforced with growing brutality, Emperor Bokassa was overthrown by a France embarrassed that only a short time before, it had helped cover the expenses of his lavish coronation. **********In many ways, the story of Mr. Bokassa is the story of this backwater territory's emergence as a country and its entangled relationship with France, its colonial master until 1960. In many of its broad outlines, it reflects the history of France's heavy postcolonial string-pulling throughout the continent. **********What cemented the Emperor's downfall was charges that he had eaten the bodies of schoolchildren arrested during the violent repression of demonstrations against his rule. **********The allegations of cannibalism, which Emperor Bokassa denied, were never proven. What is certain is that many people died in the student uprising. And in the swirl of events leading to France's first outright military intervention in  this country, suddenly no charges against the Emperor were too grotesque. **********He was overthrown in September 1979, while on a visit to Libya. David Dacko,  the cousin he had unseated nearly 14 years earlier, was returned to power by 700 French paratroopers. And France, whose military the toppled dictator had served  with distinction for 23 years, refused entry to Mr. Bokassa, sending him instead into exile in the Ivory Coast. **********In 1986, Mr. Bokassa returned home voluntarily to face the charges against him and was promptly sentenced to death for murder. But after seven years in prison here, he was pardoned in exchange for a promise to stay out of politics. **********These days, the \"Emperor,\" a bull-necked man of 74, is the picture of loneliness. Seated in the sparsely furnished salon of his sole remaining property in Bangui's diplomatic quarter, he waits out his days hoping for the phone to ring. For the rare visitor, he has nothing if not time. **********Where once there was a reputation for unbridled excess, Mr. Bokassa now passes for an ascetic. **********\"I have definitively renounced the flesh and alcohol,\" said the man who fathered 60 children, many of whom -- he volunteers -- he would not be able to recognize. \"I won't touch a woman or a drink until my death.\" **********Where once there was an obsession for power, the former dictator, seated in front of a cross given to him by Pope Paul VI, says his only remaining passion is for the Bible. **********But the conversation quickly brings out another passion, and that is to restore some balance to the established picture of him as a barbarous tyrant. **********\"I would prefer not to pass judgment on my own rule,\" Mr. Bokassa said, a sly and confident smile playing on his face. \"That is for the Central African people, and I would invite you to ask them about me.\" **********It is a measure of his country's subsequent misrule that on the streets of this city, freshly devastated by a wave of looting, many people speak fondly of  their former leader. **********To this day, Central Africans say that Mr. Dacko's downfall in 1966 had everything to do with a rapprochement that he had begun with Communist China. Coming at a time when important uranium reserves were being discovered in this mineral-rich country, the move worried the French, who historians say encouraged Colonel Bokassa, then Chief of Staff of the army, to carry out a coup. **********\"I simply served France with loyalty,\" Mr. Bokassa said when asked if he had  been given the green light to take power. \"I have never been a pawn of France.\" **********Whatever the case, Mr. Bokassa immediately suspended ties with Beijing and expelled some 50 Chinese advisers. **********Then, within a few days, the new leader proclaimed himself President, Prime Minister, Commander in Chief and head of the sole political party. **********As his behavior becoming increasingly erratic, Mr. Bokassa's comic-opera style began taking on a more grisly character. To celebrate Mother's Day in 1971, he released all female prisoners from jail and ordered the execution of men who had committed serious crimes against women. **********Ties with France remained good until Mr. Bokassa's flair for the unexpected led him to policy initiatives that made Paris nervous. Controversies arose over  a trip to the Soviet Union, over a bid to break out of the French-managed monetary zone for many of its former colonies in the region and over a nationalization plan announced in 1974. **********But in between these controversies, Mr. Bokassa frequently enjoyed the company of the French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who made near-annual  big-game hunting trips to the Central African Republic, where he was hosted in luxury. **********Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's close ties with Mr. Bokassa would come back to haunt  him. After France engineered the Emperor's overthrow, Mr. Bokassa disclosed that he had often given diamonds to the French President. Moreover, Mr. Bokassa  maintained, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing had pursued a relationship with the Emperor's  principal wife, Empress Catherine, who was famous for her beauty. **********Many believe that the ensuing scandal contributed to Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's  defeat by Francois Mitterrand in 1981. **********France's decision to extend or withdraw its support for other leaders here has proven every bit as decisive to their survival as to Mr. Bokassa's. Mr. Dacko, who was restored to power by French paratroopers, was soon replaced by another military man with France's favor, Andre Kolingba. **********Like Mr. Bokassa before him, Mr. Kolingba outlawed opposition parties and ruled brutally before being pushed by France to hold the country's first free elections in 1993, which he lost. **********Although democratically elected, diplomats say, the winner, Ange-Felix Patasse, a former Prime Minister under Mr. Bokassa, quickly proved himself incompetent and intolerant. **********And when an army mutiny plunged this city into an orgy of gunfire and looting last week, an almost universally reviled Mr. Patasse called on the French to save him, which they did. **********These days, it is Mr. Bokassa, the beneficiary as well as the victim of French intervention, who is the most eloquent critic of what many Central Africans now see as a corrosive dependence on an outside power. **********\"Every time we have a problem, the French have to come and meddle,\" Mr. Bokassa said, looking diminished in his large armchair as he echoed sentiments heard throughout this city now. \"Finally you have to ask yourself, are we independent, or are we not?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/07/business/what-may-signal-a-slip-in-new-offerings-guess.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-08-07", "snippet": "Difficulty apparel maker Guess Inc is having with its initial public stock offering discussed; combination of volatile marketplace and offering fundamentals have cooled investor interest (M)", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "What May Signal a Slip in New Offerings?

Guess", "body_text": " **********It seems as if only months ago, Zsa Zsa Gabor could have gone public, simply because her name is known around the world. **********But now the brand-name craze that sent Gucci, Saks Fifth Avenue and Donna Karan down Wall Street's runway may be on the wane if Guess Inc. is any indication. **********Guess, the maker and retailer of expensive jeans and sportswear, has been attempting an initial public offering with some difficulty. It has postponed the offering twice and yesterday it cut the size from a proposed 9.2 million shares, or a 22 percent stake, with a price range of $21 to $23 to 7 million shares, or a 17 percent stake, at $18 to $20. The offering is expected later this week. **********When its executives decided to try to tap the public markets, Guess was likely riding the coattails of luxury-good retailers that have made initial public offerings in the last year, including Ms. Karan's company, Mossimo Inc., a Los Angeles-based designer, and Designer Holdings Inc., which has the license to sell Calvin Klein jeans. **********Yet it seems that the combination of a volatile marketplace, as well as the fundamentals of this offering have cooled investor interest. **********Just a few months ago, Guess would likely have found a receptive audience, even though proceeds of the deal are earmarked for the company's founders, the Marciano brothers, and despite the fact that Guess has limited growth potential. But now, details like weakening domestic sales and exhausted licensing opportunities are starting to matter. **********A rocky market has tossed cold water on many offerings that might have been red hot only six weeks ago; since the beginning of July, at least 19 initial public offerings have been postponed or shelved. **********''I.P.O. investors now are being a lot more cautious and a lot more selective with the deals they want to participate in,'' said Ryan Jacob, the director of research at I.P.O. Value Monitor, a research firm used by institutional investors. ''They realize this is not the first six months of the year, when every deal was going up.'' **********As retail initial offerings go, Guess is not exactly a model. While its licensing royalties have grown steadily, Guess's product sales, which still account for more than 90 percent of its business, slipped 10 percent between 1993, when they were $491 million, and last year, when they were $440 million. **********Further, the company reported that its same-store sales decreased 7.4 percent last year. Same-store sales, or sales in stores open more than one year, are a leading indicator of the health of a retail company. Guess sells its products through leading department stores, as well as its own shops and factory outlets. **********In its prospectus, Guess attributes these losses to increased competition in the jeans market and a sluggish retail environment. Neither of these factors is likely to end in the next year; indeed, for the first six months of 1996, Guess said that its sales abroad rose while its domestic wholesale business fell. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue also declined between January and June compared with the period last year; the prospectus attributes that to growth in lower-margin offerings. **********Guess has sweet deals to license its brand on everything from housewares to children's apparel to sunglasses. But while the revenue-building potential of these deals is strong, the company's ability to develop licensing rights further -- something investors in apparel manufacturers look for -- is limited simply because there are already so many of them. **********Then, too, the fact that the offering's proceeds would go to the founders, while not unusual for a newly public company, is slightly distasteful to potential investors who note that the Marciano family has always put most of the company's profits into their paychecks; indeed, they are some of the highest-paid executives in the retail industry. **********Last year, the three brothers remaining at the company -- Georges Marciano, regarded as the chief inspiration behind the Guess brand, left in 1993 -- earned more than $7 million in combined salary and bonuses, not including the large distributions of annual profits that are paid out to the company's shareholders as part of tax requirements as a private company. **********''The proceeds are going to the brothers and not the company, which investors usually do not like,'' Mr. Jacob of I.P.O. Value Monitor said. In fact, no capital expenditure budget has been set aside from the proceeds of the deal to build the company and improve its systems, as its executives say they wish to do. **********The company declined to comment, citing Securities and Exchange rules on discussing a stock issue before it goes on sale. **********Because the performance of fashion companies often rides with consumer whims -- a point the Guess prospectus takes note of -- such companies have always engendered skepticism along Wall Street. When it does come to market, Guess may suffer similar scrutiny. **********Indeed, apparel stocks were among the worst-performing groups when the Nasdaq market took a nasty dip earlier this summer. **********And for all the half-dressed supermodels in its advertising, Guess may not have quite the brand equity of some brethren that went to market earlier. **********''Guess is not a designer jean like Calvin Klein,'' said Walter Loeb, a consultant to the retail industry. ''Nor does it have the panache of Donna Karan or Saks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/business/daiwa-bank-admits-guilt-in-cover-up.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1996-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 974, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Daiwa Bank Admits Guilt In Cover-Up", "print_headline": "Daiwa Bank Admits Guilt In Cover-Up", "body_text": " **********Daiwa Bank Ltd. of Japan pleaded guilty yesterday to charges that it covered  up more than $1 billion in trading losses at its New York branch, and it agreed  to pay $340 million in fines as it moved to put the scandal behind it. **********Federal officials said the criminal fine was a record for a financial institution. **********By pleading guilty, Daiwa Bank changed its strategy. When Federal criminal charges were brought against the bank in November, Daiwa Bank pleaded not guilty and said it would strongly contest the charges. At the time, Federal officials said the bank, if convicted, would face fines of up to $1.3 billion. **********Yesterday, the bank pleaded guilty to 16 felonies, including 2 counts of conspiracy, 1 count of a cover-up, 10 counts of falsifying books and records, 2  counts of wire fraud and 1 count of obstructing an examination by the Federal Reserve Board. **********Eight other charges included in the original November indictment were dropped by prosecutors. **********The charges against Daiwa Bank largely stemmed from the conduct of its top management during a period of about 10 weeks in the summer of 1995, when its managers deliberately deceived American regulators and covered up the huge trading losses incurred by Toshihide Iguchi, an executive vice president at the  Japanese bank's New York branch. **********Mr. Iguchi, who has already pleaded guilty to securities fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced in April, had accumulated those losses over a period of 11 years as he engaged in a secret and disastrous trading career, using money he stole from the bank and its custody accounts. **********\"This type of conduct will not be tolerated,\" Judge Kimba M. Wood said of the bank at the Federal District Court hearing in Manhattan late yesterday. The judge accepted Daiwa Bank's guilty plea and imposed the $340 million fine, which had been negotiated in talks over the past two weeks between Daiwa Bank and the  United States Attorney's office. **********The prosecution took satisfaction from Daiwa Bank's guilty plea. \"Banks doing business in the United States must abide by the rules,\" said the Attorney General, Janet Reno. \"This record fine demonstrates that we take the rules seriously.\" **********Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said, \"Today's guilty pleas and and fine should serve as a clear message to other corporations -- and  hopefully stop in its tracks any thought of engaging in Daiwa-like activity when confronted with crimes committed by officers and employees.\" **********While most of Daiwa Bank's criminality was related to the events of last summer, Ms. White said yesterday that the bank itself had been charged criminally \"because of the pattern of criminal conduct engaged in by its senior  management, both in New York and Japan, in a series of criminal episodes dating  back over a decade to at least 1984.\" **********To illustrate that pattern, Ms. White referred to an episode that occurred in 1984 when the bank concealed about $30 million of trading losses -- \"very similar in kind to Mr. Iguchi's losses\" -- by moving them to the Cayman Islands  and making false entries in its books and records and making misleading statements to American bank regulators. She also alluded to the way that Daiwa managers intentionally misled bank regulators carrying out routine examinations  by disguising its downtown New York trading room in 1992 and 1993 to make it look like a storeroom. \"What would happen at examination time is like something  out of a very bad movie,\" she said. **********The bank, which paid the fine yesterday by transferring money from a New York account, seemed relieved to have dealt with the charges that have hung over it,  tainting its reputation in the financial markets. **********\"Daiwa Bank is very gratified to have disposed of the charges in this litigation because it is eager to build its banking business in Japan,\" said Louis Begley, senior partner and head of the Daiwa Bank team at Debevoise & Plimpton, the New York law firm that represents the bank. **********\"This has been a very difficult five months and everyone is glad it is over,\" Mr. Begley said. \"The fine, while it is very large, is well within Daiwa Bank's  capacity, and it feels that it has done the right thing.\" **********At the time of the Federal indictment of Daiwa Bank on Nov. 2, Government and state bank regulators ordered the bank to close its operations in the United States within three months. As a result, Daiwa Bank -- which is not related to Daiwa Securities Company, a separate financial institution -- sold its American  operations to Sumitomo Bank earlier this year. **********Under Federal sentencing guidelines, the fine that Daiwa Bank paid yesterday  could have been substantially greater. But, Federal officials explained to the court, prosecutors agreed to a more lenient fine because the bank pleaded guilty to the charges, and repaid $377 million that Mr. Iguchi took from custody accounts. In addition, they said, the bank had itself suffered huge losses as a  result of Mr. Iguchi's actions. **********The prosecution's more flexible stance involved taking the $377 million looted from customers -- which was repaid -- into consideration when calculating the fine. **********The $340 million criminal fine was a record for a financial institution. Some other institutions have paid larger sums but these amounts included restitution  as well as fines, Federal officials said yesterday. Drexel Burnham Lambert, for  example, paid $650 million, the Bank of Commerce and Credit International paid $550 million and Prudential Securities paid $370 million. **********Judah Best, the Debevoise & Plimpton partner who represented the bank at Judge Wood's hearing, emphasized in his submission to the court that Mr. Iguchi  had committed his crimes \"without the knowledge of Daiwa Bank's management.\" **********The bank, he said, had also appointed a new team of top executives and \"hopes to regain the confidence of the international financial community.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/world/bosnia-serbs-again-block-entry-by-muslims.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 416, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bosnia Serbs Again Block Entry by Muslims", "print_headline": "Bosnia Serbs Again Block Entry by Muslims", "body_text": " **********Bosnian Serbs stoned a busload of Muslim women trying to enter Serb-held land over the weekend to plant a tree of peace where some of the war's worst atrocities occurred, a NATO spokesman said today. **********Two women were slightly injured in the attempt to enter the Prijedor area of  northwestern Bosnia, where Bosnian Serbs drove out Muslims and Croats during the war.

Today, in a city that remains substantially unaltered despite glimmers of change and deeply pessimistic about the elections in September, he hewed carefully to the reasons for hope. **********Mr. Christopher looked for a while like a candidate himself, and though it was an unexpected departure from his usual reserved style, he waded into crowds shaking hands and cooing at children. With the President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, at his side, Mr. Christopher announced another sign of change -- the reopening of the Sarajevo airport. **********In front of cheering crowds, he walked across the old Turkish quarter of Sarajevo, marveling at reopened shops and holding the children of a family whose destroyed house was rebuilt with the help of a United States aid program. **********''We're grateful for the opportunity to come to Sarajevo to appreciate the tragedy that took place here, but also to see the sense of revival,'' Mr. Christopher said after he put the flowers at the site where 41 Sarajevans died in a Serbian mortar attack on May 27, 1992. ''We want to redouble our determination to make sure this doesn't happen again.'' **********''I see the elections coming in a month as being a very important way to insure that we don't go back to the terrible days of before,'' he continued. ''And we are very grateful that the United States is able to play a leading role in helping this great city return to something like normality.'' **********Asked whether he thought the United States and other nations should have intervened in Bosnia earlier, Mr. Christopher said, ''You're always wishing it had been sooner, but you are awfully glad it wasn't later.'' **********Fresh from a meeting in Geneva with the three main Balkan leaders,  Mr. Christopher offered no substantive announcements during his brief stop here, but tried to frame the elections in the most optimistic way possible. Assuring the success of the elections is of vital importance to him and the Clinton Administration: The United States views a peaceful election, and its immediate aftermath, as the definitive signal that it can bring home its 15,000 troops stationed in Bosnia by December, as was originally planned. Renewed violence could jeopardize that, as well as cloud Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign, at a time when the peace sustained so far in Bosnia is counted as one of the President's most concrete foreign policy achievements. **********But even American diplomatic officials concede that there has been little progress in three of the main components of the peace accord signed in Dayton, Ohio, last November: Freedom of movement, freedom of the press and bringing war criminals to justice. **********Several international aid organizations and many Bosnians, especially the Muslims who bore the worst of the violence during the war, argue that those shortcomings compromise the fairness of the local and parliamentary elections scheduled for Sept. 14 and argue, at the least, for a delay of several months. **********Acknowledging a less than ideal  atmosphere, Mr. Christopher met this afternoon with the leaders of five opposition parties, including two Muslims, a Croat and two Serbs, to argue that the elections represent the only way to rebuild the nation's political structure, from the presidency and Parliament to a court system and a national bank. **********But the Secretary had no luck with Haris Silajdzic, the former Bosnian Prime Minister who is by far the most prominent opposition figure among Bosnian Muslims. After an hourlong visit with Mr. Christopher, Mr. Silajdzic emerged to say that his party is considering a boycott of the elections because of a registration process that he says favors the Bosnian Serbs. **********''It's not about Secretary Christopher,'' Mr. Silajdzic said as he left the American Embassy. ''It's about genocide.'' **********Serbs have been registering to vote in the towns they live in now, rather than where they lived in 1991, he said, explaining that as a result the vote will ratify the ethnic divisions here and might eventually lead to more fighting. **********''You can take a step,'' he continued, in reference to Mr. Christopher's argument about taking part in the elections.

Huff worked part time stacking merchandise on drugstore shelves. Now, six years later, Mr. Huff can be found sitting at a computer in the library of a nonprofit group called Focus: Hope, creating intricate models of automobile parts. **********Mr. Huff, 24, who spent several years working for auto-supply companies before enrolling in Focus: Hope's engineering program, knows he will have to work harder to get a high-paying factory job than people who grew up in the suburbs a few miles away. **********Some people I've known who have gotten into Chrysler were just regular people,\" Mr. Huff said. But he isn't taking any chances. **********\"I could have gotten lucky, then again maybe not,\" he added. \"The older you get and the less educated you get, your luck kind of plays out.\" **********Every year, Focus: Hope trains 1,000 young adults from Detroit's inner city,  like Mr. Huff, for auto industry jobs. And the contrast between the decay and occasional bedlam of the public schools they left behind and the intellectual challenge and unforgiving discipline they encounter here couldn't be starker. **********Before, they could often skip classes with impunity, and many dropped out. Now, anyone who shows up even a minute late more than three times in the first seven weeks loses the chance of being recommended for more advanced studies; anyone tardy six times is expelled. And while many of the students barely learned to read and write in high school, here they must master the complexities of computers and geometric equations. **********Auto executives would like to see more programs like Focus: Hope as they start their biggest hiring spree in a quarter-century to replace 170,000 retiring workers by 2003. **********\"There is a crying need in the country for the development of skills that would allow people to work in these high-paying jobs,\" said John F. Smith Jr., chairman of the General Motors Corporation. He said schools in the United States should move toward offering European-style apprenticeships for blue-collar workers. **********Robert J. Eaton, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said high schools used to do a better job of training young people for factory work. **********\"I would like to see a dramatic change in schooling in the United States,\" he said. \"I would like to see far more opportunity for technical skills.\" He recalls taking high-school courses \"like sheet-metal shop, machine shop, welding\" and using the expertise he picked up to tinker with cars after school. **********Focus: Hope is bringing back that kind of hands-on training, offering everything from remedial reading to advanced engineering degrees. At the low end, it has designed a seven-week session to bring students -- typically unemployed teen-agers, many of them high-school dropouts -- up to 10th-grade math and reading levels. \"I see young people that are graduating from school and they've got a high school diploma but they have fourth-grade math,\" said Eleanor Josaitis, the group's co-founder. **********Just 60 percent make it through that relatively short introductory phase and  go on to the school's core curriculum, a 31-week stint at the Machinist Training Institute. There, five days a week for eight hours a day, students strap on a royal blue smock and learn the basics of working in the auto industry. They spend half the day in classrooms studying applied math, manufacturing theory, computer programming and blueprint reading. Then they hit the shop floor, where  they use lathes, mills and grinders to precisely slice metal, making hammers and other equipment found in factories. **********Most students work part time to pay their bills while they study at Focus: Hope. By the time they are finished, they have gained self-confidence and the skills to land jobs paying an average of $22,000 a year. When nearby Big Three factories are looking for workers, they sometimes hire Focus: Hope's entire graduating class. **********Some students, lured by the prospect of higher pay, stick around for a more advanced program that lasts 26 weeks and enables them to earn a part-time wage from Focus: Hope, making auto parts sold to local companies, while they study. And the true die-hards stay for advanced studies that can last years in fields like engineering or computer-aided design. They earn associate, bachelor's or master's degrees from six local universities during their time at Focus: Hope. **********Focus: Hope graduates are joining the ranks of a higher-skilled work force that is expected to help make American auto companies more efficient. The University of Michigan calculated that in 1994, the Big Three assembled 66 cars  and trucks per worker a year. By 2003, that figure is expected to jump to 90 vehicles an employee, an efficiency level that Toyota has already exceeded. **********Mr. Huff fears that people from the inner city have a long way to go to get a piece of the action. \"Half don't even know what the Internet is,\" he lamented. \"Half of them have never used a computer. Kids coming from out in the suburbs are more prepared.\" **********And many inner-city children aren't even aware of the opportunities they are  missing, he added. Where he grew up, he said, \"it was unheard of for a person to make $20,000 a year.\" Indeed, it wasn't until he earned enough money to buy a car and drive out past Eight Mile Road -- the dividing line between Detroit and  its northern suburbs -- that he realized so many people lived a life he had seen only on television. **********With so many jobs to be had, Mr. Huff said, \"I can't believe people aren't grabbing this opportunity.\" He paused, then said, \"I can see why people waste it, because they don't know any better.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/03/business/tokyo-stocks-off-slightly.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Off Slightly", "print_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Off Slightly", "body_text": " **********Japanese stocks traded very slightly lower here today.

It seems his wife, Mary Ann, wanted their daughter Kathy to pick out a sweater as a birthday gift. But the Unterbergers live in Rochester and Kathy lives in Austin, Tex. **********Not a problem. Mary Ann Unterberger took her Kodak digital camera to a store and photographed three pink sweaters. Back home, she sat at her computer and converted 540,000 pixels of pink wool into three electronic ''postcards,'' which she electronically mailed to Kathy. Kathy sent an E-mail back to her mother, saying which sweater she liked best. Mom went back to the store, and the sweater was shipped that same day. **********To Mr. Unterberger, that's the Kodak Moment of the 1990's. So what if hardly anyone has a digital camera yet. Commercial photographers, advertising agencies and other users of photography can run Kodak digital scanners to upload film-based prints. Consumers, too, can use scanners, software packages and other devices that turn snapshots into bits and bytes, to be absorbed, used, manipulated and distributed, just like any other data. **********''Photographs aren't just memories anymore,'' Mr. Unterberger said. ''They are information.'' **********That's a pretty radical comment from a Kodak man. This is the company, after all, that made an art form out of feel-good advertising urging people to capture a moment, unchanged, forever. But now that computers have created endless ways to massage data, Kodak must convince the world that photography and photographs are still relevant -- that Kodak can, to quote its new advertising slogan, indeed ''take pictures further.'' **********Kodak is part of a growing cadre of companies trying to tailor their paper-based businesses to a world in which electrons rule. Hewlett-Packard is devising low-cost machines to print photo-quality images from digitized snapshots. Xerox is pushing digital copiers, which put images into computer-readable language that can be transmitted to computers, printers and other copiers. **********These companies are not abandoning their old technologies. Analog products still deliver reliable quality at low prices, and are likely to enjoy many years of sales growth in Asia, Latin America and other developing areas. Moreover, digital products are still too new to be profitable. **********So Kodak and its document-processing cohorts are traveling dual paths. One leads to digital products. The other leads to ways to let customers digitally manipulate their photos and documents, while still using their familiar analog cameras, copiers and printers. **********Kodak's theory is that the more people can do with a picture, the more pictures they will take -- and the longer that Kodak can maintain the silver-based film and paper business that with its profit margins of 20 percent or more is one of the most profitable product lines extant. **********The task facing George M. C. Fisher, the chief executive who joined Kodak from Motorola three years ago, is to make electronics enhance, not usurp, silver halide film. Depending on how well he accomplishes that task, Kodak will emerge as either a star example or a cautionary tale of what happens when a company stops fighting new technologies, and embraces them instead. **********He has clearly made progress. Under his tutelage Kodak, once the most insular of companies, has formed joint ventures with competitors, computer companies and retailers. He has peppered its management with executives from I.B.M., Digital Equipment, Microsoft and other information companies. They, in turn, are infusing Kodak with an electronic-age culture that revolves around rushing to market products that customers want to buy, rather than slowly perfecting products that Kodak wants to make. **********''We need a system where new ideas can attain escape velocity,'' Mr. Fisher said. **********Wall Street seems to be in Mr. Fisher's corner. Kodak's shares were trading in the $40's when he came. They have steadily risen since, trading in the $70's through this year, and closing at $81.125 on Friday. **********The applause is tempered, though. Analysts gripe that Mr. Fisher has been too slow to attack swollen inventories of everything from silver to office supplies, overstaffing and antiquated accounts receivables systems. They question why he has not embraced digital technologies that streamline the editing process for movies, or that let companies transmit photographs via satellite. **********Still, complaints about what Mr. Fisher has not done are often drowned out by applause for what he has accomplished. ''They always had good technology,'' said Jack L. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs & Company, ''but he has instilled a sense of urgency about translating it to products.'' **********Indeed, in just a few years Mr. Fisher has divested Kodak of some $7.9 billion of tangential businesses and revamped those that remained into seven profit centers. Recognizing that sophisticated digital technologies were as out of place in Kodak's silver halide research labs as the  first word processors would have been in a typewriter factory, Mr. Fisher consolidated all digital research and development into Mr. Unterberger's division. **********''If we had allowed digital to remain fragmented, we'd never have attained critical mass in any product line,'' Mr. Fisher said. **********But, perhaps most important, Mr. Fisher has shifted Kodak's focus outward. For the first time, scientists and factory floor workers are listening to customers. That is no small change: Kodak's Photo CD, which transferred snapshots to a compact disk, bombed after its introduction in 1992, when consumers balked at paying around $20 each for the 24-exposure film disk and $400 to $800 for the photo-disk players. **********Consumer focus groups had presaged the debacle. ''We asked, but we didn't listen closely to the answer,'' said David P. Biehn, president of the Consumer Imaging business. They are listening now. In Kodak's photo-paper plant in Harrow, England, shop-floor workers who once made paper for stockpiling now call photofinishing labs to see what paper types they want. Customers get quicker delivery, while Kodak is able to reduce inventories. **********Through customer surveys and on-line chats that Mr. Fisher and his executives held earlier this year on Kodak's Web site (www.kodak.com), Kodak learned that consumers have trouble transferring images from a digital camera to computers. So Kodak developed new software -- provided free with its digital cameras -- that makes it easier for customers to upload and manipulate images. **********Kodak programmers, given a task and left alone to do it, wrote Picture Postcard, the program Mrs. Unterberger used to send the sweater images, in three months. **********The changes come none too soon.  Studies show that prime picture-taking ages are 25 to 35; that cohort is shrinking and the oldest baby boomers are turning 50. ''Kodak is moving into a demographic head wind,'' warned B. Alexander Henderson of Prudential Securities Research. **********Kodak is counting on products like its new Advantix camera to appeal to a younger, more technologically attuned clientele. The camera automatically ''senses'' the lighting conditions and the picture's scope and digitally encodes the film with that information, enabling the processor to yield a higher-quality print. Early orders are brisk, analysts say. **********But the Advantix faces intense competition. It is an outgrowth of a joint development project involving Kodak and Canon, Fuji, Minolta and Nikon. The companies avoided a costly technology war, like the one between Beta and VHS videocassette formats, but each sacrificed a chance at a market coup. **********Kodak is also facing hefty competition from Fuji on the lucrative processing-paper front. And it faces an uphill trek in getting photofinishing stores to install and promote its do-it-yourself machines for enlarging or cropping snapshots. **********Kodak may have an even harder time juicing up its commercial businesses. Only its $700 million motion picture business seems unscathed for now: film makers still use silver halide film to shoot their movies, and distributors need lots of film to serve the growing number of multiplexes. **********But microfilm, microfiche and graphic arts paper (used in color printing) are all under siege from technologies that transfer images directly into a computer. Kodak's $1.2 billion X-ray film business coexists well with CAT scans and other nonfilm diagnostic tools, but the cost-cutting mania sweeping hospitals and clinics has pushed prices and margins down. ''Consumer imaging may be a mature cash cow, but Kodak's commercial business is over the hill,'' Mr. Henderson said. **********Maybe so, but at least this time around Kodak is trying to salvage its film business. That is a sea change from the late 1980's, when its strategy for fighting the digital behemoth was to run from it toward a series of disastrous acquisitions like the $5.1 billion purchase of Sterling Drugs. **********Mr. Fisher, unlike his predecessor Kay Whitmore, agreed with critics of this diversification strategy. Soon after joining Kodak, he put Sterling up for sale. **********Now the question is how long he will stick around. He is unlikely to stay until he turns 65 in 2005. For now, Daniel A. Carp and Carl F. Kohrt, two longtime Kodak executives who share the title of assistant chief operating officer, are front-runners to succeed him. **********''I'll leave when I feel the company is running well and I have a team that can take over,'' Mr. Fisher said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/business/discount-retailers-woo-customers-with-circulars-that-feature-down-earth-people.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1996-08-09", "snippet": "Jennifer Steinhauer (Advertising) column says that while retail advertising dabbles almost exclusively in fantasy, discount retailers are out to woo customers with circulars that feature down-to-earth people and low prices; says discounters are in...", "word_count": 712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Discount retailers woo customers with circulars that feature down-to-earth people and low prices.", "print_headline": "Discount retailers woo customers with circulars that feature down-to-earth people and low prices.", "body_text": " **********RETAIL advertising dabbles almost exclusively in fantasy, creating worlds that most shoppers only wish they inhabited. In these ads, models mow the lawn in evening wear, couples with immaculately clean houses sip espresso and  well-dressed husbands take over the child care with aplomb. **********An exception is newspaper circulars, in which even retailers that  promote fantasy through TV commercials become grounded in reality as they try to identify with the shopper. Price is the important message. **********Nowhere is this more true than in the competitive discount store sector, which depends heavily on Sunday newspaper circulars to draw customer traffic. Discounters are increasingly trying to improve the productivity of their circulars, making them a bit more esthetically pleasing and reflective of their shopper's lives. And they are pushing the point of low prices through their pages even more heavily, in an attempt to draw more shoppers, more quickly. **********''Circulars are getting dramatically better,'' said Walter Loeb, a retail consultant in New York. ''Retailers realize that more dramatic presentations are needed, with fewer items on  the page. They see that if they devote three-quarters of a page to a shirt, they can expect more productivity out of one item.'' **********Indeed, instead of featuring cluttered pages covered with a mishmash of socks, rakes and shampoo, circular pages now tend to focus on just a few related items, with the prices in bold print. **********The Kmart Corporation, for example, which features Penny Marshall and Rosie O'Donnell in its television campaign, recently devoted six months to studying carefully the 73 million circulars it distributes nationally each Sunday. The result was a complete redesign. **********''There were too many products, which made it harder to read and harder to communicate value,'' Kmart's chief executive, Floyd Hall, said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Troy, Mich. ''Using national brands, strengthening the price message, and using more bold red colors has become key here.'' **********The cover of a back-to-school circular that comes out this Sunday, for example, features a family decked out in Brittania jeans, with a bright red $13.99 placed front and center in the copy. Backpacks and stationery fill the margins. The back page has more back-to-school items like pencils, crayons and Elmer's glue. **********In contrast, last year's back-to-school circular featured three pairs of jeans in a closet, with brands like Denim Republic and No Excuses listed in the margin. Prices were hidden deep in the copy. The back page was a hodge-podge of dog food, toilet paper and indigestion medicine, many with unknown brands. **********Caldor, the retailer based in Norwalk, Conn., which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last September, also features giant-sized prices in its circulars. ''Your Choice $10'' is written in bold blue letters next to a selection of cookware in its current circular. **********Further, more people have replaced the old product shots of deodorant and dishcloths lying about. ''Now, they show the product the way it is supposed to be used,'' said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. ''More action makes the look more interesting, and the layout is better.'' **********Discounters tend to use small local advertising agencies to produce circulars rather than their leading agency, or do the work in-house. The newspaper campaigns have also been using models with a more down-to-earth look, as retailers have realized that they need to feature folks who look like their shoppers. **********Mr. Hall said that girls wearing jumpers in the current circular reminded him of real children who popped into Kmart with their parents, and that an effort had been made to show a diverse range of would-be shoppers. Family Bargain Center, a discount store based in San Diego that caters to a mostly Hispanic population, uses store employees in its circulars, which saves the company money and adds a residual benefit of a realistic flavor. **********''Knowing who the target audience is is a very critical part,'' Mr. Barnard said. **********Bradlees, another troubled discounter, may have missed the mark on this point. A recent circular of the chain, based in Braintree, Mass., depicts a softly lighted dinner table on its cover. Inside, a harried businessman in a suit reads his newspaper near a luggage display. The merchandise is depicted in a way that suggests elegance over value. ''Bradlees' circular looks too much like a department store, which may be too upscale,'' Mr. Loeb said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/08/world/aristide-hands-power-to-successor-in-haiti.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1996-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aristide Hands Power to Successor in Haiti", "print_headline": "Aristide Hands Power to Successor in Haiti", "body_text": " **********In subdued, even somber ceremonies here today, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide ended a turbulent five-year term by becoming the first elected head of  state in nearly 200 years of Haitian history to peacefully transfer power to a popularly chosen successor. **********To the applause of Haitian and foreign dignitaries well aware of both the significance and the high cost of his investiture by democratic means, the country's new President, Rene Garcia Preval, promised to duplicate Mr. Aristide's achievement. **********I swear to obey and make sure others obey the Constitution of the nation, and its laws,\" the new President said in taking his oath of office. **********Mr. Aristide, in his last official act as President, tweaked the United States and spared Mr. Preval from taking a step that might undermine his relationship with Washington.

Albright, the American representative to the United Nations. **********Mr. Aristide's decision to revive relations with Cuba in the last hours of his term led to a delicate diplomatic minuet at the inaugural ceremony.

Jean-Pierre Revoil, the deputy director-general, acknowledged that its efforts had overshot the mark and that the organization had not only returned to a sound financial footing years ahead of schedule but was piling up huge surpluses. **********Last year, it managed a 22.4 billion franc surplus.

France has to reduce its deficit to 3 percent of state spending in 1997 to qualify for membership in the single European currency in 1999. **********But Mr. Revoil said unions and employer organizations, which co-manage the fund, had agreed that the surplus should be distributed among contributors and the unemployed to encourage spending and help prime the economy for growth. **********The fund covers about 14.3 million workers in private employment and agriculture but excludes public workers.

Measures taken to reduce France's budget deficit in 1992 lowered each individual's benefits by 17 percent after each four-month period of unemployment.

That strategy has seemed questionable lately -- especially in light of the recent ouster of Michael P. Schulhof, the chief executive of the Sony Corporation of America, who had been unable to recover from the film business's billion-dollar losses. **********But now Sony is looking to one of its American units, Sony Electronics Inc.,  for another form of alchemy by marrying audiovisual products with computing and  communication technologies. **********As Carl J. Yankowski, Sony Electronics' 47-year-old president and chief operating officer, likes to point out, one of Sony's greatest success stories, the Walkman, was not so much a technical innovation as the unlikely merger of two existing products: the office dictation machine and home stereo headphones.  Surely, he suggests, similar cases of two plus two equaling five are possible in the union of computers and camcorders, or PC's and pagers, that Sony intends to  orchestrate. **********\"I know we're going to find things like that when we get into the PC business,\" Mr. Yankowski said, referring to the Sony personal computers the company plans to introduce in the fall. **********\"As the world increasingly becomes digital, part of our core competencies has to be the integration of digital technology with audiovisual products,\" he said. \"We can't afford not to find a way to participate in the PC business.\" **********The move into computers underscores the increasingly American influence on Sony's electronics research and development, and the crucial role played by hardware and software designers attuned to the trend-setting tastes of the United States consumer market. **********Founded in 1960, Sony Electronics, based in Park Ridge, N.J., has over the years become the Sony Corporation's largest overseas subsidiary, with almost $9  billion in annual sales and some 17,000 employees in nearly 100 locations in the United States and Mexico. With research labs and design centers in Park Ridge and in Montvale, N.J., and in San Jose and San Diego, Calif., the United States  unit is increasingly responsible for original product development and engineering. Sony Electronics also manufactures many products, from professional video cameras in Boca Raton, Fla., to memory chips in San Antonio, and color televisions in Tijuana, Mexico. **********Mr. Yankowski, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology electrical engineer by training, said the rollout of the first-ever Sony-brand PC will be part of a continuum of digital offerings. The computer, using an Intel chip and Microsoft  Windows software, will join the Magic Link personal digital assistant introduced in 1994; the Playstation video game machine introduced last fall, and a range of digital video cameras and videocassette recorders just entering the market. **********What all of these products have in common is the presence of a microprocessor inside. All translate human expression -- whether music, video or data -- into the ones and zeros of digital computer code. And all will be capable of being linked in simple networks. Coupling a digital version of Sony's popular Handicam video camera with a personal computer, for example, will allow home users to perform the kind of real-time editing now only possible with professional equipment. **********\"Once you have a digital format established across your audiovisual products, they can easily talk back and forth to our computer and communications products,\" Mr. Yankowski said. \"Worldwide, the audiovisual business is slowing down; we need to regenerate and add new technology and features to these products.\" **********Although Sony has until now kept itself above the rough and tumble of the PC  fray, the company has been a major producer of computer components for many years: a leading producer of monitors, the inventor of the 3.5-inch floppy disk  and co-inventor of the CD-ROM. And it has made a few complete computers under other brand names, including laptops for Apple Computer and Dell Computer. **********So while other consumer electronics companies are also rapidly embracing digital technology, and some computer companies are branching into consumer appliances, analysts say Sony is particularly well positioned to lead the convergence of these fields. **********It has been quietly adding computer capabilities to its audiovisual products  for years. And it understands the consumer marketplace far better than the established PC vendors. Sony announced in November that it had entered an agreement with the Intel Corporation to jointly develop personal computers and related products for the consumer market. **********\"They'll be able to take this new relationship with Intel and graft in multimedia and audiovisual components that they've proven with millions of consumers,\" said Richard Dougherty, director of the Envisioneering Group, a market research firm in Seaford, L.I. \"They have a long-range view that many of  their computer competition can't afford.\" **********Still, entering the PC business means accepting the razor-thin (and at times, nonexistent) profit margins that have left many of the major computer vendors awash in red ink. Although Sony brings a brand equity and an expertise in industrial design to the business that few PC makers even aspire to, analysts say it will still have to compete on the lowest common denominator of this business: price. **********\"We believe they will bring out a fully loaded, multimedia PC for under $1,000,\" said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm based in Cupertino, Calif. \"For them to come in this late and try to capture any of the traditional PC market would be futile. They want the next 20 to 25 million homes that will buy PC's in the next five years.\" **********The big question is whether the company can make money with a consumer electronics approach to computing. **********Mr. Yankowski said the company was not naive about PC pricing, but was willing to accept a \"razors and blades\" business model, where PC's drive sales of profitable peripherals and multimedia content. \"In the short term if we can break even on our PC business and leverage these other businesses we'll be in great shape,\" he said. **********In the long term he said he thought the PC industry needed a new business model, one that derived income from services as well as sales. **********Even though Mr. Yankowski operated under Mr. Schulhof and the Sony Corporation of America, he said Mr. Schulhof's departure had little direct bearing on Sony Electronics. If anything, Mr. Yankowski now has a higher profile with the bosses in Tokyo. **********Under the reorganization that followed Mr. Schulhof's resignation, Sony of America's executive committee for the first time includes the heads of the individual operating companies: Mr. Yankowski; Alan J. Levine, the president of  Sony Pictures, and Thomas D. Mottola, the president of Sony Music. Together, the group reports to Nobuyuki Idei, the president and chief financial officer of the parent Sony Corporation. **********Mr. Dougherty, the analyst, said that Sony Electronics can only benefit from  this new corporate arrangement. \"They've got a lot of technologies that under Schulhof's lead just did not move anywhere because he never went to the R.& D. labs,\" Mr. Dougherty said. \"In the first few hours of Schulhof's being gone, Yankowski took on a new bounce in his walk.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/04/world/serb-and-bosnia-leaders-pledge-to-establish-full-relations-soon.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1996-10-04", "snippet": "Serbia and Bosnia pledge to establish full diplomatic relations soon, a long-awaited move seen as expression of support by Serbian President for new Bosnia; agreement follows meetings in Paris between Serb Pres Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Musli...", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serb and Bosnia Leaders Pledge To Establish Full Relations Soon", "print_headline": "Serb and Bosnia Leaders Pledge To Establish Full Relations Soon", "body_text": " **********Serbia and Bosnia pledged today to establish full diplomatic relations with each other soon, a long-awaited move seen as an expression of support by the Serbian President for the new Bosnia, which is struggling to emerge from nearly four years of war. **********The agreement came after a day of meetings between Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, and Alija Izetbegovic, the chairman of the newly elected three-member Bosnian Presidency.

It raises serious questions as to how the world economy and international trade will be organized in the 21st century. **********Will the dramatic rise of Asia subvert the rules of the Western-dominated economic system that has served the West and the world so well for the past half-century? Or will the Asian countries behave increasingly like Western countries as they get progressively richer? **********Already Asia's different traditions are shaping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the 18-member group including the United States, China and Japan, which has decided to move toward trade liberalization \"the Asian way.\" **********APEC is to rely on voluntary concessions and consensus, rather than follow the traditional Western approach of negotiating binding commitments and common rules, enforceable through an adversarial disputes procedure. **********APEC ministers underlined the point at a meeting in the Philippines this week by agreeing that their disputes should ideally be solved by \"voluntary mediation,\" with the Chinese delegate stressing that private, family-style discussions were far better than public confrontation. **********That might seem self-serving at a time when China is facing the threat of drastic U.S. trade sanctions in retaliation for its failure to prevent pirates from copying \"intellectual property\" such as compact disks, video tapes and computer software. **********But that dispute is itself another prime example of how Asians and other developing countries see things differently from the West. **********Asians are often unfamiliar with the whole concept of intellectual property, according to Narongchai Akrasanee, chairman of General Finance & Securities Co. of Bangkok. Asia's view is that knowledge has accumulated over thousands of years and belongs to everyone, he told a meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Washington last week. **********In any case, most Asian countries \"don't have much law and not much enforcement,\" said Ronnie Chan, chairman of Hong Kong's Hang Lung Development Co. The pattern of how things are done, and their predictability, are sometimes more important than the law, he said. **********Another example is bribery, currently the target of a major international offensive by the United States. Many people in Asia and the developing world see commissions paid to facilitate contracts as a normal cost of doing business, rather like tipping or legal fees in the United States. **********Nevertheless, many Asian participants at the conference said the Asian countries would come to accept Western laws, though not necessarily immediately and not all at once. China recognizes that stealing a Steven Spielberg movie is wrong, Mr. Chan said. **********Much will depend on each country's level of development. Korea, for example, has switched from being a poacher to a gamekeeper of intellectual property as it has become industrialized. **********There are other signs of Asia's Westernizaton. Japan is developing a new ethos based on \"individuality and individual responsibility,\" said Kazuo Haruna, chairman of Japan's Marubeni Corp. What is more, U.S. universities are turning out thousands of international managers, from Asia and other countries around the world, who are trained to operate just like Americans. **********Mr. Chan believes that, partly because of American technological superiority, \"the West will be calling the shots\" for a long time yet. Provided the West stands firm, China will eventually submit to the Western-inspired rules of the World Trade Organization. **********APEC may serve as a two-way street bringing Western ideas to Asia as much as Asian ideas to the West \u2014 especially if, as seems likely, the \"Asian way\" fails to produce results. In fact, Mr. Haruna and others believe, there is a tendency for all the world's different economic models to converge into one. **********The trick will be to draw on the best of both East and West and not end up with the worst of both worlds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/04/business/company-news-scotts-to-take-charge-on-failed-promotion-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SCOTTS TO TAKE CHARGE ON FAILED PROMOTION PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;SCOTTS TO TAKE CHARGE ON FAILED PROMOTION PLAN", "body_text": " **********The Scotts Company said yesterday that it would take a charge of up to $8 million in the next three quarters to help it recover from a failed promotional  plan.

Now, she said, with her eligibility in the company-sponsored program about to lapse, she faced the daunting process of finding new doctors she liked in a health plan that she, as  a part-time Wal-Mart cashier, could afford. **********She spoke with friends in her hometown, Eden Prairie, Minn., about their plans. She spoke with her daughter-in-law's sister, who is in the health care business. She clipped newspaper ads from various plans. She studied a state-sponsored consumer survey. She added up potential premium payments and matched them against the services they covered. And she finally applied to a plan offered by Health Partners, a large, highly regarded Minnesota organization. **********The plan rejected her, saying her cholesterol was too high. **********So she began all over. Now she is thinking strongly about the local Blue Cross plan. But she still has more research to do, enough to keep her busy, she  figures, for at least a couple of months. \"It's like pulling teeth to get the information you need,\" she said recently. Without the help of her daughter-in-law's sister, who worked on the Minnesota consumer survey, she added, \"I wouldn't even have known where to start.\" **********Separating Mrs. Wagner from countless others groping toward an intelligent choice of a health plan is her doggedness in a swamp of less than conclusive information. **********Indeed, millions of consumers recently made their choices in \"open enrollment\" periods that allow them to switch plans once a year, typically in late December -- and quite a few are still wondering whether they made the right decision. Because enrollment periods open at different points during the year, many others are only now starting to scratch their heads about what to do. **********The problem is that people without Mrs. Wagner's grit often confront the decision with paralysis, and for no small reason. **********There are few, if any, other decisions on which so much rests -- not only concerns about health, but about expenses that can vary by thousands of dollars  a year. Few subjects are at once so technical and so riven by revolutionary, often barely comprehensible, change. And there are few choices that have to be made where, even by the admission of many in the industry, the measures of success are so ill-defined. **********As Robert Krughoff, who heads a nonprofit consumer organization in Washington, the Center for the Study of Services, put it, \"When we've rated health care providers, members have greeted it with more skepticism than they have our auto mechanic ratings or plumber ratings.\" **********Many in the health care industry point to the tips, surveys, brochures and telephone hot lines sponsored by H.M.O.'s and other managed-care plans. If anything, they say, these outstrip the information that had been made available  by conventional indemnity insurance plans and by private doctors whose referrals often came by word of mouth. **********\"We are the trend-setters,\" said Susan Pisano, director of communications for the H.M.O. industry trade organization, the Group Health Association of America. \"Increasingly, information is being developed with the idea that it is very, very important for patients to be able to compare plans.\" **********But even supporters of the managed-care revolution say these sources can be flawed. Company help lines, they say, are often staffed by employees with a slender grasp of what they need to know. For example, the New York City Public Advocate, Mark Green, found that when his staff members made more than 500 calls to customer service lines, they often received \"vague\" answers to basic questions and sometimes blatantly inaccurate advice. **********Brochures and advertisements, virtually by definition, are self-serving. One  advertisement from Physicians Health Services, operating in New York and Connecticut, observed, \"Have you ever wondered how four or five different health plans can all run ads in the same issue of the same publication claiming to be No. 1? Common sense tells you they can't all be right.\" **********But it is quite another thing to figure out which, if any, is right. \"It's impossible today to be a good consumer of health care plans, because the information's not out there yet,\" said Martin Schneider, publisher of Health Pages, a magazine that disseminates what information exists in several large cities. \"As far as it being an anxiety-ridden process, it's becoming more and more of one.\" **********Geraldine Dallek, who as executive director of a California advocacy group called Center for Health Care Rights documented the wide range of state regulation of health care plans, put it more bluntly. \"Consumers are making choices in a quality-of-care vacuum,\" she said. **********What is available is spotty and sometimes conflicting. For instance, New Yorkers would be right to be perplexed by the patchwork of information on the Capital District Physicians Health Plan in Albany. The plan takes top honors in  at least one annual survey of patients, conducted by the Gallup Organization for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. So, clearly, patient satisfaction runs high. But the plan fared less well with the National Committee for Quality  Assurance, whose accreditation surveys are the most widely cited in the field. In fact, Capital District was flat-out denied accreditation by that organization. Contractually, neither the national quality committee nor the health plans it studies are permitted to talk about the reasons for the denial. **********But William L. Cushing, director of marketing for the 200,000-member plan, said that it \"passed over 80 percent\" of the national committee's standards and  that it planned to reapply for accreditation this year. **********DESPITE all this, more information is available than might at first seem to be the case. In fact, the information, from disinterested sources, patient surveys and hard-knocks experience, is growing significantly, a result in part of the concern of the more responsible and established segments of the managed care industry, which have helped fund much of the work. Ambitious surveys have been undertaken in Denver, for example, as well as California and Minnesota. **********The grail is what is called \"outcome data\" -- that is, hard facts about which plans' doctors, hospitals and other providers have the highest rates of success  in treating various ailments. The quest for such information -- whether tied to  a health plan's performance or not -- is an obsession of many in medicine, who see it as the best hope for establishing what treatment procedures work best and of giving consumers an alternative to the traditional medical yardstick, which was described by Dr. David Eddy, a doctor and statistician long active in managed care research, as, \"Trust us and pay us.\" **********Yet, Dr. Eddy said, \"this is a slow-breaking story.\" He added, \"What we're trying to do is make up for about two millennia of failure in measuring quality.\" **********Although some plans may promote their treatments as superior, it will be 5 to 15 years before sophisticated comparative data come out, he said. **********Short of this, accreditation surveys are a good basis for measuring plans' performance. The surveys, which are voluntary, are conducted by impartial professional organizations like the National Committee for Quality Assurance. The nonprofit Washington-based group has representatives of employers, unions, managed care plans and consumers on its board. **********An accreditation survey, evaluating a plan's services, doctors, responsiveness to members and other criteria, can cost a plan hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and the results can be embarrassing. **********About half of the nation's managed care plans have been evaluated thus far, and only a third of those plans have received full three-year accreditation. Fourteen percent have been denied even partial accreditation, including some operated in scattered localities by leading national providers like Humana, Aetna and Pacificare. (Each of these organizations also runs plans in other parts of the country that are more highly evaluated.) The information is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ncqa.org. **********But accreditation does not tell the whole story. For one thing, fully accredited plans have nonetheless accumulated a fair number of complaints at state insurance departments. Conversely, the fact that a plan is not accredited  may mean only that it is awaiting approval. In addition, the way plans portray their accreditation in advertisements is sometimes grossly distorted. At the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which requires clearance for ads mentioning its accreditation, Margaret E. O'Kane, the organization's president,  said, \"Some of the claims have been pretty astounding -- we've come close to pulling accreditations if there wasn't change.\" **********The organization is now working on its first national report card, which will match many plans against the cumulative average for the industry in several areas of performance, like the quality of doctors, the access to care and the availability of preventive tests and immunizations. **********It completed such a study last year in the Denver area with the cooperation of the regional phone company, U S West, and six plans, which contributed to the costs. The local Kaiser and FHP Inc. plans generally ranked highest in consumer  satisfaction. **********IN New York, Mr. Green, the Public Advocate, did his own elaborate measurement of H.M.O. performance in areas like the quality of doctors, as measured by the percentage of doctors in the plan who have been certified by professional boards in their specialties, and the number of complaints filed and upheld at the state insurance department. He ranked the Oxford Health Plan highest and the Health Insurance Plan, or H.I.P., lowest. **********Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for H.I.P., maintained that Mr. Green's survey \"mixed apples and oranges.\" While H.I.P., as a not-for-profit organization, did  not have the capital to install elaborate phone systems and other services that  are pleasing to patients, he said, it spent much more of its income on medical services than for-profit plans. **********Critics of the methodologies, as well as some plans that have not fared well  in various surveys, caution that the reports can be deeply subjective and that responses can turn on the phrasing of a question or the demographics of a plan's members. Sicker people tend to be more critical of plans even when they perform  well. Older people are often more generous in their assessments, especially if doctors or nurses take interest in them. All this, compounded with tough issues  about how to determine the quality of doctors within a plan, makes patient surveys useful but not definitive. **********At the least, hard data can often yield considerable savings. Perhaps nowhere is this more vivid than in the market for Medigap policies, insurance sold to supplement Medicare by covering services like eyeglasses and prescription drugs. **********Under law, Medigap plans have to offer largely similar policies with a mix of 10 well-defined services, like eye care. When Health Pages surveyed 10 plans in  the St. Louis area in 1994, it found that in the least-expensive mix of coverage, known as plan A, annual premiums for a 75-year-old woman ranged from $379, offered by the Physicians Mutual Company, to $775, offered by United American. **********Results vary strikingly as well in the growing number of customer satisfaction surveys undertaken by large employers like American Express and Xerox; by private survey companies, like Care Data, and by cost-conscious employers, government groups and others. **********The Pacific Business Group on Health, a consortium of large California employers, completed its eighth consumer survey last year, receiving responses from nearly 20,000 consumers. The Kaiser health plans in Northern and Southern California received \"A\" ratings in overall customer satisfaction, while plans run by other large companies, like Aetna, Pacificare and Pru Care, received \"C\"  ratings. But plans frequently raise issues with surveys on which they do poorly, and this was no exception. **********Kevin Heine, spokesman for the Prudential Health Care Group, said the survey  polled only a handful of statistically unrepresentative Pru Care enrollees. The  plan's own telephone surveys, he said, showed an 88 percent satisfaction rate. **********In a survey of 63,000 members of the California Public Employees' Retirement  System, overall satisfaction ranged from 82 percent for the Health Plan of the Redwoods to 55 percent for the Pru Care Plus plan. **********In Minnesota, a survey of 17,500 consumers commissioned by the state last year was published in local newspapers. The plan ranked highest by consumers was a health maintenance organization sponsored by the Mayo Clinic, which received a 90 percent satisfaction rating. Ranked lowest was a managed care plan sponsored  by Metrahealth, which allows members to go to doctors out of its network. The consumers gave it a satisfaction level of 57 percent. **********THE largest survey was by Mr. Krughoff's consumer group, the Center for the Study of Services, in 1994. The group persuaded the Federal personnel officials  to allow it to survey 150,000 Government workers on their attitudes about 270 plans, which agreed to pay $800 each to finance the project. Another 60 plans declined to participate. **********\"The Federal employees,\" Mr. Krughoff said, \"were just the guinea pigs we sent in to evaluate the plans for everyone else. They can tell us how easy they  felt it was to get advice by the phone, or whether they had enough time with their doctors.\" **********More than 90,000 of those queried responded, for an exceptional 62 percent response rate, and again, the differences were considerable in 26 categories on  which the plans were evaluated. In Maryland, for example, 95 percent of the respondents rated the Columbia Medical Plan good to excellent on thoroughness, carefulness and competence, the highest percentage in that category. The Chesapeake Health Plan got the lowest mark, 79 percent. **********In southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the highest mark in getting an appointment with a doctor was scored by HMO Rhode Island, which was rated good to excellent in that category by 91 percent of the respondents. The Harvard Community Health Plan, generally considered one of the nation's best, scored only 72 percent, the worst in the category. **********But results can change from year to year. In last year's survey, for example, the Harvard plan scored 84 percent on doctor availability. **********These impartial studies are considered superior to unaudited ones sponsored by the plans themselves. Too many, experts say, ask leading questions in telephone interviews and interpret results in the most favorable light. But even among third-party surveyors, there is disagreement over what questions to ask, how to frame them and how to present the results. **********For those who have a deep skepticism about managed care and about financial incentives that they believe put pressure on doctors not to order expensive treatments, the surveys do not touch on a root concern -- the private contractual agreements between plans and the doctors who sign onto their panels. Labeled \"gag clauses\" by critics, some of them prohibit doctors from discussing  courses of treatment that a plan does not allow and bar them from disclosing incentive agreements. **********Several plans have defended these clauses as necessary to insure that patients receive only the treatments deemed most appropriate by an organization's medical director. They deny that the financial incentives keep patients from necessary care and say that discussions of them by doctors -- a fair number of whom are no fans of managed care -- would distort their real intent. **********Nonetheless, consumer advocates are skeptical about the plans' motivation. In several states, they are pushing for disclosure laws that would make these clauses public. **********\"It's a system that doesn't allow much sunshine,\" said Jamie Court of a California advocacy group called Consumers for Quality Care. \"It's a system that at its worst only survives in the darkness.\" **********Whatever the quality of surveys and the level of state regulation, however, choosing a health plan is a personal matter, and personal needs vary. While quality -- in terms of well-thought-of doctors and hospitals -- might seem the primary consideration, it isn't always. Young people, who are less concerned about getting sick, usually cast a much harder eye on price. **********So do poorer people. \"It's a very poignant issue,\" said Ms. O'Kane, of the National Committee for Quality Assurance. \" People say, 'I can't afford to buy a quality health plan -- I have to take what I can get.' \" **********Aside from cost, quality does loom large for many. This usually translates into joining a plan that includes their regular doctor or someone recommended by a friend or relative, particularly if the office is close by. A plan's alignment of hospitals is also important. **********But even obtaining this basic information can be more complicated than it might appear. In New York, for example, Oxford operates two plans, called Freedom and Liberty. Doctors affiliated with one are not necessarily affiliated  with the other, and sometimes they are not even aware of the distinction. **********In California, said Jeanne Finberg, of the Consumers Union's West Coast office, because of complicated contractual relationships, specialists listed as  participating in a plan may be available to members only when they are referred  by specific primary-care doctors. In other plans, doctors may be restricted to treating members in the county in which they practice. **********Informational meetings and plan contracts and brochures can explain restrictions, although Peggy Connorton, director of public policy for the Service Employees International Union, warned that the brochures are often inadequate because they do not anticipate many of the questions members new to managed care might have. **********When going over a plan's satisfaction surveys, Helen Darling, manager of health care strategies and programs for Xerox, recommends finding out how many members rate the plan as \"excellent,\" rather than looking at a rating, often offered by plans, that lumps together responses ranging from \"good\" to \"excellent.\" **********She also recommends visiting clinics and offices to see whether the the staff members seem enthusiastic. For the industrious, she suggests checking state records to see what proportion of people disenroll from a plan, what proportion of income they spend on medical services and what fraction of complaints have been upheld by state insurance departments. **********In the end, though, she observed, most people are happiest with an approximation of what they have always had. \"The plans people like the best are  the ones that have the largest number of doctors and offer a setting most like the old doctor's office,\" she said. **********After cost and quality of care, the extent of coverage offered by plans can loom large and vary widely. While basic coverage is often similar, important differences around the edges -- services like home care and chiropractors -- that can make the difference. **********Those with conditions that they can anticipate, like childbirth, or that require specialists, should study doctor panels with an eye toward their needs.  Sometimes, plans with large numbers of doctors have few in expensive specialties. Some even consider gynecologists specialists, and require referrals before patients can see them. **********Also crucial for many, said Dr. John J. Connolly, who has written two consumer guides, including \"How to Find the Best Doctors, Hospitals and H.M.O.'s\" (Castle Connolly Medical Ltd.), is that some plans will cover pre-existing conditions while others have waiting periods. **********Those with questions about intricacies like these can call the help lines of  various plans, but in the surveys undertaken by Care Data, as many as 60 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with some plans' phone representatives. **********Martin Schneider, publisher of Health Pages magazine, suggests that for this  reason, \"you make sure you get the name of the person you're speaking with.\" **********IN many cases, questions may never come to a consumer's mind, because they involve needs that can't be predicted: *********** What sort of approval does a plan require before a primary-care doctor can  refer a patient to a specialist? *********** What is the procedure for appealing a plan's denial of treatment that a patient believes is necessary? *********** What sorts of treatment does a plan not cover because it considers them \"experimental\"? *********** And is the plan stable enough that it is likely to pay claims quickly and keep doctors happy? **********All of these questions have proved nettlesome for some consumers who have made their way in the managed care world. **********Josephine W. Musser, the Insurance Commissioner in Wisconsin, puts the financial viability of a plan near the top of her list. Too often, patients are  left in the lurch when doctors drop a plan because of its poor payment practices. **********But even more exasperating, said Louise Novotny, health policy analyst for the Communications Workers of America, are cases in which a plan rejects a method of treatment prescribed by one of its doctors. **********\"What do you tell people who were told by the plans than these doctors have been prescreened and are top-notch?\" he asked. \"Whom does the patient mistrust?  Usually, it's the plan.\" **********Yet she and others say appeals processes in some plans start with the very managers who denied the coverage in the first place. **********When coupled with all the other variables, this can lead to a sense of defeat as consumers consider their choices. Dr. Connolly, for one, said, \"I think that's a great mistake.\" **********In Eden Prairie, Judy Wagner is still at work on her final choice, intent on  finding the right price for a plan with good female doctors nearby. Her advice?  Be patient. Study the available facts. **********And, with a nod to the help given her by a health care professional -- her daughter-in-law's sister -- \"Find somebody who knows something.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/business/selecting-the-moment-to-circle-the-wagons.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Brush", "pub_date": "1996-08-04", "snippet": "Oberweis Emerging Growth fnd manager James Oberweis and USAA Aggressive Growth fund co-manager John Cabell comment on guidelines they used when they sold large positions in Valujet Airlines following cash of Flight 592 in Florida Everglades on May...", "word_count": 1499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Selecting the Moment To Circle the Wagons", "print_headline": "Selecting the Moment To Circle the Wagons", "body_text": " **********FOR anyone managing a good deal of money, knowing when to sell an investment is as important as knowing when to buy. In a crisis situation, it becomes even more important. **********When Valujet Flight 592 crashed in the Florida Everglades on May 11, tragically taking the lives of 110 people, James Oberweis held about 120,000 shares of the airline in his Oberweis Emerging Growth fund, about 1 percent of its assets. But to guide his response, Mr. Oberweis needed only to watch for a specific set of signals. And when he got them, he sold. **********''We have a very strict set of guidelines for buying stocks and for selling stocks,'' Mr. Oberweis said from his office near Chicago. One sell signal flares when earnings or revenues show signs of declining for a single quarter. **********''It was obvious that was going to happen with Valujet after the crash. It's relative strength had already declined significantly. The crash pushed us over the brink.'' Mr. Oberweis had already lightened up on the stock late last year at $30 after the shares -- bought at an average split-adjusted price of $4 -- had grown to more than 5 percent of the fund. After the crash, he sold the rest of the postion for $12 to $13 a share. **********FOR a mutual fund manager, deciding how to react when a crisis strikes a company that the fund owns can be crucial in determining performance. The company's stock is sure to plunge on the news, but is that first decline merely the beginning of a long slide or an overreaction that will soon be reversed?  The crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 off Long Island on July 17 as well as the Valujet crash and subsequent grounding of the airline bring this question into sharp focus. But whether it is a plane crash, a tanker running aground or shards of glass showing up in baby food, the manager must make a decision without having the luxury of waiting for all the facts to be sorted out. **********''You have to ask if the problem suggests that the fundamentals of the company are different today than they were yesterday,'' said Whitfield Gardner, chairman of Gardner Lewis Asset Management in Chadds Ford, Pa., which runs the Chesapeake Growth Fund. ''Is the problem part of the company and the business environment? Or is it circumstantial? If it is circumstantial, then typically you maintain your ownership.'' **********To reduce the emotional element, investment managers will often, as Mr. Gardner did, follow a strict set of rules that guide them through crisis management and tell them exactly when to cut back. Which rules they choose and how they react, however, depend a good deal on the type of investors they are. It doesn't take much to scare an aggressive growth investor out of a stock. A ''special situations'' investor, on the other hand, will seek out stocks troubled by some controversy as potential value plays. **********But a manager who has studied a situation and feels comfortable with a company's underlying health will likely stick with it. After cyanide was discovered in capsules of Tylenol in  1986 and glass turned up in jars of Gerber baby food the same year, for example, Mr. Gardner bought more shares in Johnson & Johnson, which makes Tylenol, and Gerber Products  as their stocks fell. ''The psychological reaction had a much greater impact than these events ever could have had on their businesses.'' **********Unfortunately, it is not always so easy. More often, when a stock price goes down because crisis strikes, it is simply not that clear whether the company was at fault. **********When the cause of a problem is murky, fund managers often apply this simple principle: When in doubt, boot it out. ''The rule of thumb is to preserve capital,'' explained John Cabell, a co-manager of the USAA Aggressive Growth fund in San Antonio, which also had a large position in Valujet at the time of the crash. ''If you think the stock is moving against you, you've got to sell and preserve capital. Rarely have I been disappointed that I have sold.'' **********Part of the reason it is important to leave quickly at the first sign of trouble, Mr. Cabell said, is that often the initial problems are really symptoms of bigger difficulties. Investment managers call this the ''roach theory'' because the first problem you see is usually not the last. **********Even for seasoned investors like Mr. Cabell, however, it can be difficult to apply this theory. About eight months before the Valujet crash, Mr. Cabell cut his then 400,000-share position in the carrier in half, to take some profits when the stock was selling between $20 and $25. Then, even before the crash, he began to trim his position once again because of safety concerns. ''I had visited the company in April, and one of the areas of concern was safety because there had been a couple of incidents,'' he said. ''I came back, and I was a bit unsettled, so I sold another 50,000 shares.'' **********After the crash, though, he was at first reluctant to get out of the stock.  ''I was sitting at home on Sunday afternoon, and my wife came over and said: 'Don't you own some Valujet?' '' he recalled. ''My eyes kind of popped because when she says something like that, I know it is not good.'' **********Still, he hesitated to get out of the stock right away because he felt he knew management well and he liked the company's strong earnings record. ''The problems in maintenance that unfolded after the crash, though, were disconcerting. I thought, 'That's not the kind of airline I want to be in,' so I sold my remaining 150,000 shares two days before the airline was grounded. The main rule of thumb I use is whether I would buy the stock today. In this case, the answer was no.'' **********The fact that he sold demonstrates another rule. ''The smaller the company and the more you can't understand what went wrong, the quicker you should sell,'' Mr. Cabell said. But with larger companies that have a strong franchise and stable earnings, there is less reason to exit in a hurry. This is true, for instance, he said, with Trans World Airlines, rocked by the crash of Flight 800, which killed all 230 on board. ''People are obviously thinking this was a terrorist act and the market is more forgiving of these problems,'' he said. But even if T.W.A. is eventually found to be partly at fault in some way, its stock price, Mr. Cabell said, is less vulnerable than Valujet's was in large part because ''there is a big franchise value with T.W.A. that you did not have with Valujet.'' **********MR. GARDNER says an important factor is the extent to which a company's problem becomes politicized. Once it does, he says, management and business plans have little to do with the fate of the company. **********''Our first analysis was that the Valujet stock had overreacted to an event that we didn't think was controllable by the company,'' Mr. Gardner said, referring to the possibility that the crash had been caused by a fire ignited by oxygen canisters mistakenly loaded onto the plane. **********But soon the search for the cause of the accident transformed ominously. First, it turned into an investigation of the airline, and then into scrutiny of the Federal Aviation Administration itself that eventually led to Valujet's grounding of the airline on June 17. **********At that point, the quality of management and business plans became irrelevant. ''So we stepped aside to wait for the fundamentals to become important again.'' Mr. Gardner, who said he had sold some Valujet stock in the $20 to $25 range and pared back some more after the crash, said he closed out his position once the stock had roughly doubled from its $4.50 low just after the grounding. **********Managers of mutual funds also warn individual investors to avoid the common mistake of becoming emotionally attached to a stock when deciding whether to unload a holding struck by crisis. ''You can't get married to a stock,'' said Charles Dyer, who manages the Hawthorne Sea fund through Hawthorne Associates in Boston. ''The stock does not know that you own it. You have to just admit that either you were wrong or times have changed, and cut your losses. You can always buy it back.'' **********As a former Navy flier and commercial pilot for Eastern Airlines, Mr. Dyer may have been more tempted than others to keep his fund's shares of Valujet, if only because his flight experience put him in a better position to understand the airline. As did Mr. Gardner, Mr. Dyer sold the stock once the accident inquiry took on a political nature. ''The more and more this F.A.A. stuff started to surface, even if it was the worst con job against them, the public relations damage was huge and the company became a wounded duck. Even if it was a good company, it was not a good stock.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/29/business/at-t-plans-to-discontinue-network-notes.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1996-02-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T Plans to Discontinue Network Notes", "print_headline": "AT&T Plans to Discontinue Network Notes", "body_text": " **********In an embarrassing retreat tied to the explosive growth of the Internet, the  AT&T Corporation said yesterday that it would discontinue a highly touted service designed to connect businesses with their partners and customers through AT&T computers and the Lotus Development Corporation's popular Notes software. **********The service, called AT&T Network Notes, began operating last summer and was thought to hold huge promise for both AT&T and Lotus when it was announced two years ago. Indeed, after Lotus was taken over by I.B.M. last summer, the computer giant quickly embraced the strategy, beginning a similar service on its global network. Lotus subsequently announced similar deals, to offer Notes on public networks, with 14 other telecommunications companies around the world. **********Despite this new competition, AT&T said that its head start gave it a significant advantage because it had invested heavily in studying the potential  market. But yesterday's announcement suggested that being first actually proved  to be a disadvantage for AT&T. **********AT&T Network Notes was designed to operate on a special communications network designed by AT&T. But with the rise of the Internet, the service's potential customers no longer wanted to pay AT&T for access to the information stored on Notes data bases, because it was much cheaper and more convenient for  them to use their Internet connections. **********The latest version of the Lotus Notes software, which was released in January, makes it easy to get information from a Notes data base over the Internet. But AT&T designed Network Notes around the previous version, which was not Internet-friendly. **********In addition to showing the impact that the rapid rise of the Internet has been having on the computer and communications industries, AT&T's reversal illustrates the challenge facing telephone companies looking to diversify into more lucrative computer-related businesses. **********\"The problem with AT&T wasn't a lack of opportunity, it was a lack of execution,\" said Mark Johnson, chief executive of MFJ International, a software  developer in New York that was working closely with AT&T to develop applications to run on Network Notes. \"They built and built and they planned and planned, and by the time that they got around to making an offering, it was already obsolete.\" **********Mr. Johnson and others said that AT&T's failure would not be a setback for Notes, which has been rapidly gaining users. Indeed, the companies that established public Notes networks after AT&T are doing well with their services, which cost much less than the average charge for Network Notes of about $40 a month for each subscriber plus usage charges. **********Larry Moore, the Lotus senior vice president in charge of the company's relations with telecommunications companies, said that each of Lotus's 15 other  partners was committed to developing its services in tandem with the Internet.    AT&T, too, plans to explore an Internet-based service with Lotus, said Kathleen B. Earley, a vice president in charge of the company's electronic commerce offerings. But the two companies were not prepared to make an announcement yesterday, she said, because AT&T would have to research the number of potential customers and how much they might be willing to pay. **********Ms. Earley declined to say how much AT&T had invested in Network Notes since  1994, but it was surely many millions of dollars. Rather than characterize the cancellation of the service as a black eye for the company, she termed it \"very  good news.\" **********\"I am very proud of this decision,\" she said, because it shows that AT&T is committed to the Internet. **********Earlier this week, AT&T announced that it would offer its long-distance telephone customers five hours of free access to the Internet a month, for one year. **********But Network Notes joins a growing list of failed forays into the computer business for AT&T. Earlier this year, the company announced that it would abandon its Interchange on-line serve, which it bought from the Ziff Communications Company for more than $50 million in December 1994. **********The company has also announced that it would spin off AT&T Global Informations Solutions, the computer subsidiary that was known as NCR Corporation when AT&T acquired it for $7.4 billion in 1991. Now, after hundreds  of millions of dollars in losses under AT&T, the company plans to once again call itself NCR when it becomes independent next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/14/business/dell-earnings-up-58-in-new-sign-of-vigor-in-pc-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-08-14", "snippet": "Dell Computer Corp, in latest indication of new strength in personal computer market, reports 58 percent increase in earnings for its second fiscal quarter, far exceeding Wall Street expectations; for quarter ended July 28, Dell had earnings of $1...", "word_count": 656, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dell Earnings Up 58% in New Sign of Vigor In PC Market", "print_headline": "Dell Earnings Up 58% in New Sign of Vigor In PC Market", "body_text": " **********In the latest indication of new strength in the personal computer market, the Dell Computer Corporation reported a 58 percent increase in earnings for its second fiscal quarter late yesterday, far exceeding Wall Street expectations, **********Dell, whose earnings report sent its stock price up sharply in after-hours trading,  attributed the strong profit to sales growth that exceeded the industry average, and to a steep decline in computer chip prices. **********Analysts said that while Dell was taking market share from some of the industry's weakened players, like AST Research and Apple Computer, its growth was also an indicator that the much discussed slump in personal computer sales might be more perceived than real. **********For computer makers that can survive in a highly competitive environment, a cycle appears to have begun in which users -- particularly corporate customers -- are replacing their PC's with more powerful models to take advantage of the Intel Corporation's Pentium Pro microprocessor and the Windows NT software of Microsoft. **********Dell's surprisingly strong earnings report comes after recent positive results from Gateway 2000, which like Dell takes orders directly from customers and ships the machines without a retail middleman. And even in the retail portion of the PC market, the computer superstore chain CompUSA recently reported strong quarterly results indicating that the trend toward more powerful PC's was being driven by experienced buyers, not novices, said Seymour Merrin, an industry consultant in Mountain View, Calif. **********''People are trying to buy performance at a price, not just the lowest price but the best buy on a specific configuration,'' Mr. Merrin said. **********Dell reported its results after the close of the market. In the regular Nasdaq trading session, Dell shares had closed at $56.625, down 62.5 cents.

The consensus among Wall Street analysts, as compiled by First Call, had been for earnings of 86 cents a share. **********Sales grew 40 percent, to $1.69 billion, from $1.21 billion in the second quarter of the 1996 fiscal year. Second-quarter 1997 earnings reflected a 10-cent charge in connection with the retirement of a portion of the company's senior debt. **********Michael Dell, the chief executive, said in a telephone interview from corporate headquarters in Austin, Tex., that Dell's direct sales allowed the company to operate with much smaller inventories than PC makers that sell through retailers. Smaller inventories meant that Dell could much more rapidly take advantage of the nearly 50 percent drop in memory-chip prices in the first half of the year. **********''Even though we've stayed very competitive, we saw huge reductions in our cost of materials,'' Mr. Dell said. ''Combined with that, we continued to grow very rapidly, particularly in servers, with 115 percent growth year over year, and 57 percent sequentially. We're not seeing this weakness in the market that's been talked about.'' **********Mr. Dell said the company had 35 percent sales growth in Europe over all, led by 60 percent growth in France and Germany, despite weak economies in those countries. **********''In economic recession, the direct model is even stronger because companies are under pressure to cut costs but still need to buy PC's to boost productivity,'' he continued. ''The whole Dell mission is to replace the reseller and slowly but surely we are doing that.'' **********While the company's profit margin received an extraordinary boost from lower-priced chips, the sales growth reflected a healthy market, said Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. ''I think unit demand is much stronger than people realize,'' Mr. Neff said. **********Despite recent theories that computer sales would slow because more and more individual and corporate customers already had PC's -- the so-called installed base of customers -- Mr. Neff sees a seller's opportunity. **********''The larger the installed base,'' he said, ''the larger the base that has to be replaced every year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/16/business/executive-changes-049867.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********AMERIWOOD INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL CORP., Grand Rapids, Mich., promoted Craig Wassenaar to the positions of chief financial officer, corporate secretary and vice president. **********EQUITABLE COS., New York, named Stanley Tulin chief financial officer and senior executive vice president of its Equitable Life Assurance Society subsidiary. **********LANDS' END INC., Dodgeville, Wis., named Bradley Johnson chief financial officer, succeeding Stephen A.

That book has been criticized by Professor Mommsen and others for suggesting that the Nazi mass killing of the Jews was a ''national project'' among Germans. **********The story of the Beetle begins with Ferdinand Porsche, then a disgruntled former employee of Daimler-Benz. Postwar chroniclers have built a more flattering picture of him than the book, which condemns him as ''morally indifferent'' to the use of slave labor. **********Rejecting the common wisdom of the prewar German auto industry, but with an eye to Hitler's foibles, the book says, Mr. Porsche insisted that the dictator's vision of an affordable car for all Germans was feasible. **********''Porsche belonged to those professionals who were determined at any price to use the undreamed-of productive space that the regime suddenly made available for them, without questioning the prevailing political conditions,'' Professor Mommsen's book said. **********Mr. Porsche -- who designed the  postwar sports car that bears his name -- joined the Nazi Party in 1937, but seemed indifferent to its ideological significance.

Satarov, told the newspaper Segodnya today that Mr. Yeltsin was not suffering from new heart trouble but is ''colossally weary,'' and needs a two-month vacation. Mr. Yeltsin plans to go on an extended vacation a few days after the inauguration. **********While Mr. Yeltsin rests, his aides have squashed some of the more extravagant proposals dreamed up by the 14-member inauguration committee, including excerpts from historical operas like ''Boris Gudonov'' and black-tie attire at the 600-guest banquet. **********''We already tried that when the Queen of England visited, and it was a big problem,'' said Dmitri E. Taschev, deputy chief of protocol at the Kremlin. ''Russia is not yet ready for tuxedos.'' **********The Russian Constitution specifies only the wording of the oath, and that it be taken in a ''gala'' atmosphere in the presence of members of both houses of Parliament and the Constitutional Court. **********Three thousand dignitaries are to be invited, and the President's men have been poring through history books about the coronations of the czars to infuse the event with the traditions and grandeur of the Russian Empire -- and a few symbols of modern democracy. **********Anatoly B. Chubais, the Kremlin's new chief of staff, is also chairman of the inauguration committee, has pulled the plug on some of its wackier proposals. He overruled a plan to serenade Mr. Yeltsin with an ode composed in his honor after its fulsome lyrics were printed in Russian newspapers: **********The people give you their blessing **********And entrust you with their fate. **********May our President carry through the years **********The light of freedom **********To the world. **********Mr. Chubais complained Thursday that given the ''far from glittering'' Russian economy, organizers had yet to strike a proper balance between ''monstrous bombast'' and a ceremony befitting the occasion. **********But that is not an easy task. Even the site became a thorny issue. After a fanfare of trumpets, Mr. Yeltsin is to be sworn in within the Kremlin walls, but on an outdoors podium, to which he will descend from the old throne room of medieval czars. **********Organizers felt that holding it inside the vast Assumption Cathedral, where the czars were traditionally crowned, could look both too imperial and too religious for a democracy that upholds a division between church and state. **********The other obvious site, the Marble Hall in the former Russian Senate building, is where the Communist Party's Central Committee used to convene, and is still covered with hammers and sickles. **********''Obviously, there is a lack of desire to use Soviet-era buildings for this ceremony,'' Aleksandr N. Shokhin, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and a member of the inauguration committee, said dryly. **********Perhaps in consideration of Mr. Yeltsin's health, the entire ceremony, including the singing of the Russian national anthem, brief words by the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church and other dignitaries and a 30-gun salute, is expected to last about an hour. Kremlin aides say the President's inaugural address will last only 10 minutes. **********The committee studied proceedings in other countries, including France, Eastern Europe and the United States, but final details on the ceremony are still being worked out. Vladimir Tumanov, chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court, said he had rejected a plan to have all 19 members of the court wear their black robes. He said it would look too much like a ''Jesuit conspiracy.'' **********In 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin was sworn in as President of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union was still shakily in place, and the ceremony was part of a regular session of the Fourth Congress of Russian People's Deputies, with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, icily looking on. **********Organizers struggled to come up with a symbol of presidential power that could someday be passed on to a successor. The only historical precedent was the czarist tradition of presenting a new monarch with a scepter and globe and a sable-trimmed gold crown called a Monomach's hat. **********After rejecting proposals to hand Mr. Yeltsin a national flag or a wooden lacquer plaque, the Kremlin settled on a massive gold chain. Mr. Yeltsin will receive the Order in the First Degree of Meritorious Service to the Fatherland, which was created two years ago and has not yet been awarded to anyone else. **********Two receptions are planned -- a 1,000-person luncheon in the Hall of Marbles, and a more exclusive dinner for 600. One organizer said Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, Mr. Yeltsin's closest friend who was recently ousted as chief of presidential security after a run-in with Mr. Chubais, is not on any of the current guest lists. **********Former Soviet republics will be represented by their heads of state, and other countries generally by their ambassadors. **********Inauguration committee members insist the event will be observed frugally.

That's hopefully what we can do.\" **********A New Age-flavored broadsheetalmost as thick as The New York Times, The World Times made no claims of publishing all the news that's fit to print; rather, it  proclaimed on its front page that it wanted to \"provide hope and inspiration to  us all.\" **********In its January issue, that mission translated into Associated Press articles  about a large immunization drive in India and how black churches in Cincinnati were working to improve bad neighborhoods; features on sightings of the Virgin Mary and how meditation improves health, and business news on the continued success of the Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minn. Not to mention a column of reviews titled \"Uplifting Films\" and advice from the \"Humorous Herbalist.\" **********For habitues of a harder world, a perusal of the paper can leave the treacly  aftertaste of a meal of candy and cake. But sweet-toothed readers have no complaints. **********\"I love that paper,\" said Dale Olson, a Hollywood public relations agent. \"What it gives me is a feeling of serenity, pleasure, warmth and comfort.\" **********But he said he worried about the paper's prospects: \"I wonder if it's going to make it. I wonder if it's so gentle, it'll have difficulty maintaining financial stability.\" **********That was the opinion of media analysts and journalists as well. **********\"Oh, God, how long will that last?\" said Larry Wills, editorial page editor of The Las Vegas Sun in Nevada, when he heard about The World Times. \"I'd be very pessimistic that it would even survive.\" **********Mr. Wills is trying a similar experiment with \"Sunny Side Up,\" a four-month-old column on The Sun's editorial page devoted to good news sent in by readers. Though Mr. Wills said it appeared to be successful, especially among older readers, he added that he was reluctant to devote more space to it, because reader surveys show such a craving for bad news. **********Jon Katz, the media critic for Wired magazine, was similarly skeptical. **********\"New Age journalism -- it was inevitable,\" he said. But \"there's no reason to think papers will sell better if they have more good news,\" he added, because changing the good-bad mix would not solve basic newspaper problems, including falling readership among young people and competition from electronic media. **********Perhaps. But, hey, this is just the kind of pessimism that The World Times is intended to combat. **********Mr. Hamblin said the idea for the paper came to him during a bleak spell in his life. In 1992, a fashion magazine he had been publishing in Rochester for five years went bankrupt and he lost not only his job but his home and car. He said he plummeted into a deep depression for a year and a half, and found that exposure to newspaper and television only made him feel worse. **********\"Everywhere I looked, I couldn't find any inspiration to stay on this planet,\" he said. \"Everywhere -- in the news reports, magazines and The Wall Street Journal -- it was all violence and negativity. I questioned, 'What's going on here?' There's got to be some positive things going on out there.\" **********On a hike through the desert near Santa Fe in May of 1994, the concept for a  good-news paper struck him, he said, and he took the concept to Robert A. Davies 3d, now the chief executive of the Church & Dwight Company of Princeton, N.J., the maker of Arm & Hammer kitchen products -- who was then on sabbatical from the company. In June 1994, Mr. Davies called and offered him $250,000 as seed money, Mr. Hamblin said. **********Three months later, in September, the first World Times issue appeared, a 100-page quarterly. It struck such a chord that two days later, Mr. Hamblin said, Phil Donahue's talk show called and invited him to take part in a debate on journalism. **********Since May, the paper has been coming out monthly. Mr. Hamblin is now trying to raise more than $1 million to enter a second phase of expansion, to enlarge the paper's core staff of three people and increase its circulation to 100,000.  Subscriptions cost about $50 a year (it is also available at some bookstores). The paper is already well sprinkled with advertising for spas, books on holistic healing, recordings of New Age music and paintings of angels. **********Mr. Hamblin objected to calling his newspaper New Age, however, saying the term \"has gotten the reputation of being kind of 'woo-woo' \" -- he imitated a spooky sound -- \"something that's not grounded.\" **********\"And the thing is,\" he added, \"I feel The World Times and the people who work here are really grounded. It's not like we're sitting here channeling some entity or something.\" **********No, but there is much that is quintessentially New Age in The World Times, from its focus on a kind of broad-based Eastern-style spirituality unaffiliated  with any particular religion to its attempt to stoke positive energy. **********At The World Times, Mr. Hamblin said, internal debates tended to focus on whether stories contained too many negative elements to be worth printing rather than on whether they were striking enough to be news. **********\"A few months ago, we were doing an article on a young woman who as a teen-ager had been brutally raped and after she healed she put together a charity for young people who had been abused and raped, and did an incredible job,\" he said. \"The writer just wanted to write about the charity, and I said, 'Wait a minute, you have to tell the whole story, what brought this person to this point?' \" **********\"In mainstream journalism we'd be looking at the rape and the brutal aspect of that and might just mention in a paragraph that she started this charity,\" he added. **********The World Times does raise some important journalistic issues, from the question of what readers really want to concerns about the sensationalism of some American news coverage. **********Mr. Katz of Wired said the paper's determined positivity appeared to echo a growing movement called public journalism, which, in part, focuses on positive community and government news in the belief that the media undermine democracy when they are too negative about civic life. **********\"People are unhappy with a lot of political coverage,\" Mr. Katz said, but \"I  don't think there's any mainstream number of people who don't want to know about a Bronx or Harlem massacre.\" **********Still, Mr. Hamblin said he believed there might be enough of a shift in consciousness in America to create a solid market for good tidings. **********His hopes depend on subscribers like Cynthia Coolidge, a Rochester bookkeeper. \"I try to be an optimistic person anyway,\" she said, \"but with all the news that you hear every day just from the radio, the TV and the regular papers, The World Times gives you such a different perspective. You can realize, hey, everything isn't all bad.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/18/world/us-says-dead-gi-didn-t-follow-orders.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says Dead G.I.

The operation has not started, but the counteroffensive has. **********The directive became public here and in Iran three months ago -- long before  it became law. Now the C.I.A. finds itself required, against its better judgment, to plan a \"secret\" mission, with its cover already blown, in a region  where American policy has suffered failures and fiascos. **********The money for the mission was included in a secret bill passed on Dec. 31 that authorizes intelligence spending for this year. Iran reacted to its passage almost immediately: On Jan. 6, it proclaimed that three Iranians jailed on charges of spying for the United States would be sentenced to death. **********On Tuesday, Iran's Parliament announced a $20 million operation \"to counter the Great Satan\" and combat the American plan. **********The history of the C.I.A. in Iran includes sponsoring the 1953 coup that installed Shah Riza Pahlevi; the 1979 revolution, in which fundamentalists toppled the Shah, seized the American Embassy and the C.I.A. station for 444 days and painstakingly pieced together the agency's shredded files; and the secret arms deals of a decade ago, in which the C.I.A. helped ship missiles to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary Guards. **********In the decade since the arms deals, the United States has regarded Iran as a  principal exporter of terrorism and revolutionary fervor. **********Since the 1986 arms affair was exposed, few in the Government have offered many ideas about how to bring about change in Iran. But since last February Mr.  Gingrich -- an ex-officio member of the House Intelligence Committee who appoints its Republican members and wields great influence over Government spending -- has been calling for a strategy \"designed to force the replacement of the current regime in Iran.\" **********He made his feelings known so strongly that his desire for a covert operation became public in late October -- first in a short article in a Washington newsletter, CQ's Congressional Monitor, then in a six-paragraph article in The Wall Street Journal, then on news wires around the world. Members of Iran's Parliament immediately launched verbal counterattacks. **********One member of Parliament called Mr. Gingrich \"not a balanced person\"; another condemned the United States as \"a renegade Government whose logic was no different from Genghis Khan or Hitler.\" **********Mr. Gingrich, the Clinton Administration and the C.I.A. feel much the same way about Iran and its leaders, and have said so. **********But the Administration and the agency argued against the American operation -- in part because Iran knew of Mr. Gingrich's idea. After the proposal became public in October, the Speaker refused to comment on it. **********In November and December, C.I.A. officers argued that since the proposed covert action against Iran was no secret, its chances for success, already slim, were nil. **********Despite other secret efforts the agency has mounted in recent years, including last year's $2 million campaign based largely on radio broadcasts denouncing the fundamentalist rulers of Iran, the C.I.A.'s analysts and operators saw little hope of helping create a new generation of leaders for Iran, or of coercing the current leaders to change their anti-American thinking. **********Some staunch enemies of Iran's Government agree. **********\"The United States is sending the wrong signal,\" Assad Homayoun, Iran's last  chief of mission in Washington under Shah Riza Pahlevi and an an active opponent of the Iranian Government, said in an interview this week. **********\"I don't think covert operations are necessary,\" Mr. Homayoun said. \"Eighteen or 20 million dollars will not change the Government. **********\"After the '53 coup, Iranians have become very suspicious of covert operations by C.I.A. The people are aware that for the transfer of power from dictatorship to democracy, the help of the United States is necessary, maybe imperative, but this help should be moral and political, not financial. Money and covert operations bring back memories of '53\" and the coup that installed the Shah. **********But Mr. Gingrich insisted, and the Clinton Administration bowed to his wishes after coming up with a compromise: The President would authorize the covert operation if it would seek only to change the behavior of Iran's Government, not to topple it. On New Year's Eve the deal was incorporated in the intelligence spending bill for 1996, buried in a secret part of the military authorization bill, which President Clinton expects to sign in a few days. **********That, too, was reported around the world. Within days, the war of words escalated. The ayatollahs of Iran took to the airwaves. They denounced the \"unpleasant and disgusting policy\" and announced that the three men accused of spying would be hanged forthwith. **********On Tuesday, the Iranian Parliament authorized a $20 million fund to combat the covert action. **********After a debate, broadcast live on Teheran radio, the Parliament approved spending the money \"to uncover and neutralize U.S. Government conspiracies and interference in Iranian affairs, to sue the United States in international legal bodies and to inform world public opinion about U.S. violations of the U.N. charter.\" **********The money would be administered by Iran's Supreme National Security Council,  which coordinates intelligence and security policies and is headed by President  Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. **********Iran would presumably try to \"uncover and neutralize\" any covert operation against it by, among other methods, arresting and executing its opponents on charges of espionage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/11/business/finance-briefs-076627.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt **********CIT Group Holdings Inc., Livingston, N.J., is selling $200 million of medium-term notes due in 1998 through CS First Boston.

Fifteen million people in Britain alone watched it on television. **********The unraveling of that marriage was just as public, with the extraordinary occurrence of candid television interviews by the two partners about their separate adulteries and the descent of the young Princess into eating disorders and suicide attempts. **********Though the marriage ended officially with their divorce a year ago Aug. 28, the rivalry for public attention and approval continued until her death. This year the Princess had taken highly publicized trips to former war zones like Angola to conduct her high-profile campaign against landmines, and had in recent weeks posed knowingly on Mediterranean holidays with her friend, Emad Mohammed al-Fayed, 42, in an apparent effort to show the world that the once troubled young woman had found personal happiness. **********Prince Charles, for his part, held the first photo calls at his vacation home in Balmoral since the early days of his marriage, appearing with the couple's two sons, William, 15, the next heir to the throne, and Harry, 13. It was a competition conducted by photo opportunity, and in the Princess's case turned a liability she often complained about, the constant attention of paparazzi, into an asset. **********Lady Diana Spencer was born on July 1, 1961, Sandringham, Norfolk, and was only 19 years old when Charles proposed. Her son William was born in June, 1982, providing promised continuity to the crown and making her the mother of a king-to-be. **********By 1986 the first press stories about cracks in the marriage appeared, at a time, a biography of the Princess has said, when Charles had resumed his relationship with his married friend Camilla Parker Bowles. **********That biography ''Diana: Her True Story,'' by Andrew Morton, said she then started dating a cavalry officer, James Hewitt, conducting an affair that lasted four years and which she later said had hurt her. **********The royal couple had few common interests. Charles loved horses, his garden and traditional architecture; she loved buying clothes, listening to pop music on her Walkman and gossiping on the telephone. **********Once a girl in frilly modest-maiden dresses and a modified bowl haircut, she had become a fashionplate with annual expenses of more than $1.2 million, a woman whose every style change influenced the way women around the well dressed world appeared. Just this past June, 80 of her dresses were auctioned off for charity at Christie's in New York, promoted in a lavish catalogue shot by Lord Snowden, the former husband of Princess Margaret. **********The couple separated in 1992, and in November 1995, Diana gave her explosive interview to the BBC confessing her own adultery, her anger at the palace and her feeling that Charles would not be a good King. It became widely reported that her wish was that Charles renounce his right to the crown, passing it on to their son William, known to the British public as Wills. **********In the divorce she had to give up the honorific Her Royal Highness, the title that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats, but was able to keep the title Princess of Wales. She obtained lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices.

Today's report did not include sales for the Ford Motor Company, which is expected to report on Monday. **********G.M.'s weak performance was its ninth consecutive month of lower sales and had been expected because of the gradual pace it has set for itself in building 15 new models, the most in a dozen years. The December performance rounded off a difficult year for G.M. but a good year for the industry as a whole. G.M.'s crosstown rival, Chrysler, said its December sales rose 1 percent.

Many cut their estimates by more than half. **********Whatever the future holds for the company, G.M.'s loss was mainly Chrysler's gain.

Mr. Berisha, a former Communist, has kept the reins of the powerful secret police and state media. And he has defiantly blocked the small attempts of the new interim Government, which contains members of the opposition, to assert some control. **********As a Western diplomat put it, ''People I'd spoken to have never seen a revolution like this where -- on cue -- the warehouses of weapons are opened, the police disappear and then suddenly reappear. No Government buildings were attacked; the television station was not touched.'' **********Such institutions could easily have been taken, he said, had the shooting in the capital been part of a real revolt. **********Enver Hoxha, Albania's Communist dictator for 40 years, would have been proud of Mr. Berisha, the diplomat said, adding, ''This is not normal behavior where you burn your country in order to stay in power.'' **********Popular anger over failed investment schemes boiled over into open rebellion recently in southern Albania. Analyzing the country's descent into anarchy since then, both Albanian analysts and foreign diplomats believe that when Mr. Berisha saw the insurgencies wresting control from him and his Democratic Party, he reacted by arming his own loyalists and local thugs. **********The weapons depot in his hometown of Tropoje in the far north was opened. Then, the military academy and other weapons depots in Tirana were surrounded by officers of the secret police and the firearms distributed. In Shkoder, a major northern town, a similar pattern developed, with looting led by Berisha sympathizers. On the outskirts of Tirana, a university library with a prized collection of 150,000 books was burned, apparently by people from Mr. Berisha's region, judging by the crude graffiti they left behind. **********For some hours last weekend it looked as though Mr. Berisha might step down. Among the flood of rumors were several that he was ''vacillating'' over whether to resign. According to another report, he telephoned the new Prime Minister, Bashkim Fino of the Socialist Party, and ordered him to the presidential offices to inform him of his imminent departure, only to change his mind once Mr. Fino arrived. **********But Mr. Berisha, long reputed to be a shrewd inside fighter who can adopt a threatening demeanor, toughed it out. During the visit of a European Union delegation early this week he appeared on television, calm and poised, in the red brocade presidential reception room. **********The signs of Mr. Berisha's resurgence amid chaos abound. **********The man he handpicked to lead the secret police, Bashkim Gazidede, remains in place, even though Prime Minister Fino said this week that Mr. Gazidede had resigned. It turned out that the only post relinquished by Mr. Gazidede, a former teacher from Mr. Berisha's northern province, was a temporary one: manager of the state of emergency imposed nearly three weeks ago. **********Many of the so-called volunteers armed last week to quell the manufactured disorder in the capital were actually members of the secret police or recruits of the Interior Ministry, which Mr. Berisha still controls, a Western military expert said. Riding about in rusted tanks, manning improvised checkpoints and shooting at night, these vigilantes have created a false calm. **********The new Finance Minister, Arben Malaj of the Socialist Party, who is regarded favorably by Western diplomats, said in an interview on Thursday that he had refused requests from the Department of Public Order to approve financing for what he called ''illegal'' law enforcement squads. **********''The Government will not share the country with illegal structures,'' Mr. Malaj said, alluding to the vigilantes. **********By retaining Mr. Gazidede in his secret-police post, Mr. Berisha has managed to cow the opposition. After Fatos Nano, the head of the Socialist Party, escaped last week from a Tirana prison, where he had been serving a politically motivated sentence, he pledged to move around the countryside urging his supporters to disarm. But he told the European Union delegation this week that he was afraid to travel outside the capital because of the secret police. **********The unease in Tirana has been heightened by Mr. Berisha's apparent reliance on several unorthodox sources of support. **********On Thursday, a stalwart of the President's Democratic Party, Bardhyl Ukcama, stormed into a hotel where many opposition politicians gather and threatened to blow it up and take control of the Government radio station. Mr. Ukcama said he had 470 armed men on hand. **********In addition, Western diplomats and Albanian opposition leaders suspect a former head of the Democratic Party, Azem Hajdari, of fomenting terror on Mr. Berisha's behalf by organizing armed gangs. **********Mr. Berisha may well hang onto power for weeks or months, managing to delay elections he has agreed to hold by June with the excuse that the country is too unstable to go to the polls. But the European Union officials who were here this week assessing the need for humanitarian aid say that if the anarchy persists, Albania may receive a dollop or two of assistance but no more. **********The aid that Finance Minister Malaj has requested to help restart the economy will be withheld unless the Albanians get their house in order, the Europeans said. With the deeply unpopular Mr. Berisha stirring unrest, and with a weak caretaker Government that Mr. Berisha has tried to undermine, the requisite stability seems unlikely. **********Mr. Malaj said this week that he understood the Europeans' wariness. So did Fatos Lubonja, a leader of the Forum for Democracy, an opposition group that said it would not join the coalition Government while Mr. Berisha remained President. **********''It's like the end of a film -- the film can't finish until the bad guy is dead,'' Mr. Lubonja said in an interview, speaking figuratively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/04/business/leading-indicators-fall-economists-yawn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-06-04", "snippet": "Conference Board reports decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in index of leading economic indicators during April; it is first decline in 15 months; graph; table (M)", "word_count": 369, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leading Indicators Fall; Economists Yawn", "print_headline": "Leading Indicators Fall; Economists Yawn", "body_text": " **********The most widely followed index for predicting the economy posted its first decline in 15 months during April as 6 of 10 components moved lower, the Conference Board reported today. **********Economists largely dismissed the decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in the index of leading indicators as a temporary statistical blip. **********The two biggest drags, higher claims for jobless benefits and lower stock prices, have both reversed course since April and the index, specialists said, should quickly rebound. **********''We would be looking for a higher reading next time,'' said Eric Green, economist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York. **********The leading, or predictive, index is intended to signal turning points in the economy but its compilers have long insisted this requires that changes be significant in size, duration and scope, conditions that have not yet been met.

And at least one tank rumbled down the main boulevard in Tirana tonight in an area populated by Government buildings. **********This morning, residents said, the police were giving away rifles and ammunition from a local storehouse at New Tropoje, a housing settlement in Tirana named for Mr. Berisha's village in northeastern Albania. **********''The police are not going to give me arms because I'm not on their list,'' one man said, suggesting that the others riding away on bicycles with Kalashnikovs slung over their backs were supporters of the President. **********When the warehouses of weapons were opened in Tirana this morning, men and boys were allowed to help themselves to automatic weapons and wooden crates of ammunition. **********While shopkeepers barricaded their stores, other people dragged 110-pound sacks of flour onto bicycles and raced home. By early afternoon an eerie quiet had settled over the shabby city, but it was punctuated by frequent gunfire. **********Foreigners, too, were pulling out of Albania, with American military helicopters evacuating the first group of Government personnel and dependents as well as civilians today, and Italian helicopters doing the same. **********Popular armed uprisings, rooted in fury at failed investment schemes that the people believe the Government sponsored, swept across southern Albania in the last two weeks and spread to the north, Mr. Berisha's home region. **********Unlike other former Communist countries of the Soviet bloc, like Poland and Czechoslovakia, Albania has no democratic tradition to fall back on. The armed anarchy here bears no resemblance to the peaceful overthrow of Communism in Eastern Europe and the evolution of democratic market economy countries. **********''Albania is going to be in a prolonged crisis,'' said a Western diplomat who knows the country well. ''The Mad Max appearance of the violence is not going to be very helpful. It's not Europe. We're into an eastern Zaire situation.'' **********Until today the capital had seemed relatively insulated from the anarchy in the rest of the country. People believed that here, at least, Mr. Berisha had a vanguard of strong and loyal forces. **********But today the corrupt police officers and the ragtag soldiers, who are paid $2 a month, left when the weapons storehouses were flung open. **********About 300 prisoners from the Central Jail were released during the mayhem, including two archenemies of Mr. Berisha: the leader of the Socialist Party, Fatos Nano, who was jailed on corruption charges after what Washington referred to as a politically motivated trial, and the last Communist leader of Albania, Ramiz Alia. **********Albanians themselves were unsure whether to call the violence a civil war, a revolution, a popular uprising or just plain chaos. **********In Tirana, there was a strong sense that the arming of civilians today was organized by Mr. Berisha and a handful of remaining loyalists from his hometown in the north. Several opposition leaders charged that  Mr. Berisha had deliberately created the upheaval as a way of insuring that he remained in power. **********Opposition leaders said Shaban Memia, head of the organizing committee of Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party, was responsible for the arming of people in Tirana today. **********Mr. Berisha acknowledged today that he had sent Mr. Memia out into the streets today, but only to ''calm things down,'' according to Skender Gjinushi, an opposition leader. **********In an effort to focus Europe's attention on his crisis, Mr. Berisha  appealed late today for the European Union and NATO to send peacekeeping troops to restore order. But propping up Mr. Berisha's Government has not been a priority, and the sentiment in Europe and the United States has been that the first step toward restoring order would be Mr. Berisha's resignation. **********When he came to power in 1992, Mr. Berisha, a former member of the Communist Party, presented himself as an emotional anti-Communist who had only disgust for the hard-line regime of Enver Hoxha, the country's longtime Communist leader. **********Mr. Berisha immediately set about stripping the courts, the Government bureaucracy and the army of the people who had served under Mr. Hoxha. Many of those people came from the south, which is considered the more educated and literate part of the country. **********Mr. Berisha placed his own kinsmen from the north in important posts and packed the courts, for example, with judges who were high school graduates with only four months of legal training. His associates from Tropoje were also placed in senior positions in his political party. **********Today a coalition Government was sworn in, bringing members of the opposition into Mr. Berisha's governing circle. **********But in the areas surrounding the capital, every mind was on revolution or self-defense. **********In Rreshen, 55 miles north of the capital, two 10-year-old girls proudly marched down the road dragging rifles by a piece of string because they were too heavy to carry. **********The country's biggest port, Durres, about 25 miles west of the capital, was filled with people carrying and shooting freshly stolen weapons today. By late morning food and clothing stores were being looted. **********When the military depots in Mr. Berisha's hometown, Tropoje, were broken into three days ago, Western diplomats wondered whether the action had been sanctioned by the Government. If so, they said, it brought the chaos in Albania closer to a civil war between the north and the south or at least between the small element of Berisha supporters and the rest of the population. **********Mr. Berisha's appeal to Europe and NATO today was an acknowledgment that the country no longer had a working army or police force and that outside forces were needed to quell the violence, said Mr. Gjinushi, the opposition leader,who attended a meeting where the appeal for help was drafted. **********To help resolve the crisis, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which Albania is a member, is planning to send a mission to Albania on Friday morning. Their scheduled arrival today was postponed when the airport was closed. **********A former Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, is expected to suggest during the mission that the best way to contain the anarchy would be to have Mr. Berisha resign. Diplomats said Mr. Vranitzky also plans to urge that leaders of the rebellions in the south be brought into discussions. **********For Tirana's neighbors, Italy and Greece, the disintegration of Albania, even with its relatively few 3.2 million people, brings the threat of refugees. Late today an Albanian naval vessel berthed at the Italian port of Bari and the armed troops on board demanded asylum. **********The crisis began in January when a series of pyramid investment schemes collapsed, leaving many Albanians stripped of their life savings. Almost all of Albania -- including soldiers, the police, even Government ministers -- had invested in the schemes, which promised fabulous interest rates. **********But as the pyramids collapsed and the Berisha Government did nothing to stop the free fall -- it had not regulated the investments in the first place -- protesters' demands broadened to the political. **********On March 1, in Vlore, citizens stormed the army barracks and the secret police headquarters. Similar lootings continued in other towns, and by last weekend Mr. Berisha had lost control of the southern districts. His resignation has become the main demand of the uprisings. **********Washington initially supported Mr. Berisha when he came to power, in part because it saw his hardheadedness as a stabilizing force in a strategically important region. Albania was welcomed into the so-called Partnership for Peace, a training effort for countries that aspire to belong to NATO. **********But when parliamentary elections last May were blatantly rigged by Berisha supporters, Washington distanced itself and has urged for the last several months that Mr. Berisha call new elections. Now Washington officials acknowledge that his resignation is essential. But they also doubt whether even that would be enough to put the Albanian genie back into the bottle. **********--------------------        Americans Evacuated **********WASHINGTON, March 13 (By The New York Times) -- As the first Americans were evacuated today from Albania, the State Department warned that ''the situation will continue to deteriorate'' and that all of the estimated 2,000 Americans in Albania should consider leaving the country. **********''You have a tinderbox,'' said a State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns. ''For the private American community in Albania, our suggestion is the following: Keep your head down. Don't leave your homes, because of the insurrection in the streets.'' **********The Defense Department said the first 50 evacuees, most of them the young children of Americans working in Albania, left the embassy today aboard four Navy helicopters assigned to American ships in the Ionian Sea. **********''We're going to be continuing this operation over the course of the next several hours and perhaps the next several days,'' Mr. Burns said. ''to evacuate militarily from Albania all nonessential American Government personnel, their dependents and as many American civilians as we can take out.'' **********He said the United States Ambassador, Marisa Lino, and 17 other State Department employees would remain at the embassy. The Pentagon said the diplomats had been provided with special military equipment to allow them to remain in contact with the Navy ships."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/28/world/rescue-s-architect-fujimori-s-shadowy-alter-ego.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1997-04-28", "snippet": "Peruvian intelligence chief, Ivan Vladimiro Montesinos, shadowy alter ego of Pres Alberto L Fujimori, emerges as architect of assault that rescued 71 hostages from Tupac Amaru rebels at Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima; was heavily criticiz...", "word_count": 823, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rescue's Architect: Fujimori's Shadowy Alter Ego", "print_headline": "Rescue's Architect: Fujimori's Shadowy Alter Ego", "body_text": " **********Information is emerging indicating that the shadowy figure who is the unofficial head of Peruvian intelligence was the lead planner for the assault that rescued 71 hostages at the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima, several experts on Peruvian affairs say. **********The intelligence chief, Ivan Vladimiro Montesinos, cashiered army captain, former lawyer of drug barons, and alter ego of President Alberto K. Fujimori for the last five years, is a figure who inspires fear and fascination in Peru. Like a good spy -- one who has long been reported to have had ties to the Central Intelligence Agency -- Mr. Montesinos has appeared before news cameras only once in several years. **********So when he strode triumphantly, wearing dark glasses, with the Army Chief of Staff into the liberated Japanese compound on Wednesday, followed by a television camera crew, it was a sign that he had emerged as an even stronger figure in Peru. **********Mr. Montesinos took heavy criticism from rivals within the security apparatus for the intelligence breakdown that led to the guerrilla hostage-taking last December. But his brand of secretive authoritarianism may now be politically acceptable again as Mr. Fujimori prepares to run for a third term. **********''Montesinos is the man of the hour,'' said Enrique Obando, a Peruvian expert on military affairs. ''Peruvian sources say he planned the operation, and his public appearance is extraordinary, especially after rumors that he was in political trouble.'' **********Michael Radu, a Peru scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia, said people  ''close to Peruvian intelligence'' had indicated to him that Mr. Montesinos's intelligence service was responsible for ''the basic planning'' of the raid. Noting that the newly constituted 150-man commando unit that conducted the raid was a combination of elite special forces units from the police, army, navy and air force, Mr. Radu said, ''Montesinos is the only person who could bring these four rival -- at times bitterly rival -- forces together.'' **********Although the military contributed by far the most commandos for the operation, it has long suffered from a leadership vacuum. Gen. Nicolas Hermoza Rios, officially the head of the armed forces, is widely considered to be a weak administrator who has been fending off challenges from competing commanders, and even from Mr. Montesinos, in recent months. But his appearance along with Mr. Montesinos as they reviewed the victorious troops at the Japanese compound appeared to signal a consolidation of the two as participants in Peru's ruling troika, with Mr. Fujimori. **********Peruvian military officials have refused to divulge details on the commando units, or who commanded and advised them. **********One former American official who worked in Peru said he believed Mr. Montesinos worked closely with the C.I.A. The former official, who continues to keep in touch with Peruvian security officials, said Mr. Fujimori relied heavily on Mr. Montesinos, who constantly ''nudges'' him in a ''hard-line direction.'' **********Among Mr. Fujimori's advisers, Mr. Montesinos, who is in his 50's, is commonly thought to have been the chief advocate of the President's decision to dissolve Congress and the Supreme Court in 1992. **********Clinton Administration officials have insisted that the United States played no major role in the rescue operation beyond basic anti-terrorism training given to the Peruvian security forces in recent years. Nevertheless, relations between the militaries and intelligence services of the two countries have grown closer in the last few years in the fight against cocaine trafficking, and Mr. Montesinos made a surprise appearance late last year at a reception in Lima for retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton Administration's drug policy director. **********Thomas Crispell, a C.I.A. spokesman, denied having any knowledge of any links Mr. Montesinos might have to the United States or his role in the rescue operation. **********Mr. Montesinos is an exotic figure even in a country whose politics in recent decades have been defined by cultish terrorist groups, leftist generals, a rightist presidential campaign by a novelist who lived in Paris, and the hard-fisted Mr. Fujimori. **********Mr. Montesinos has exhibited an independent spirit from the very beginning of his career as a captain in a leftist anti-American Government. In 1977, he was sentenced to a year in jail by a Peruvian army tribunal for desertion after he visited American military officials in Washington without permission. **********Accusations have persisted that he has had an off-and-on relationship with American intelligence ever since; he has consistently denied them. **********Last year, a man under arrest and accused of being a drug dealer publicly accused Mr. Montesinos of having accepted bribes from drug traffickers. Mr. Fujimori and his Congressional allies blocked efforts to investigate the allegations, and the man later recanted his assertions. **********In recent weeks, Mr. Montesinos has again been at the center of controversy when a female intelligence officer was killed and another tortured while in the custody of other intelligence agents. Four intelligence officers were arrested this month after the tortured agent said on television that she was punished after being accused of telling journalists of secret plans to spy on political figures who opposed Mr. Fujimori."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/business/company-briefs-409847.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********CHELSEA GCA REALTY INC., Roseland, N.J., bought the Waikele Factory Outlets shopping center in Hawaii from KM Halawa for $76.2 million in cash. **********LANDS' END INC., Dodgeville, Wis., sold its majority interest in The Territory Ahead Inc. catalogue company to the International Cornerstone Group Inc. for an undisclosed amount. **********CONSECO INC., Carmel, Ind., said it had started a stock buyback plan in which it would purchase as many as five million of its common shares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/08/business/taking-in-the-sites-kyoto-rio-al-gore-cyberviews-of-the-eco-fatigued.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1997-12-08", "snippet": "Taking in the Sites column discusses web sites of environmental organizations; photo (M)", "word_count": 838, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking In the Sites; Kyoto?

Many of the skeptics were on line. **********As the nations of the world gathered to figure out how to save the planet from the various ills attributed to man-made greenhouse gases, environmental doubters were trying to figure how to convince people that all the concern is a lot of, well, hot air. **********And like many other contrarians these days, the foes of environmental correctness have made a home on the Internet. Judging by all the furious debunking going on in cyberspace last week, there are more than a few people who think that most environmental regulation, Vice President Al Gore's claims to environmental credentials, and the Rio Declaration on global warming are little more than symptoms of a global hysteria that could bring down the global economy. **********Following the Rio Declaration, agreed to in a sultry climate, the foes of environmental correctness chose to issue their own global warming manifesto from a cooler clime -- Leipzig, Germany. The 1995 Leipzig Declaration is a cornerstone of the World Wide Web site run by the Science and Environmental Policy Project, which is a project of S. Fred Singer, ''one of the nation's pre-eminent authorities on energy and environmental issues,'' and a staff member at the Environmental Protection Agency during Richard M. Nixon's first Administration. **********Like most of the anti-green material on line, the declaration contends that global warming is not really happening, but that if it is, it's not such a bad thing anyway. **********''Historically, climate has always been a factor in human affairs,'' it says, ''with warmer periods, such as the medieval 'climate optimum,' playing an important role in economic expansion and in the welfare of nations that depend primarily on agriculture. Colder periods have caused crop failures, and led to famines, disease and other documented human misery.'' **********The site reports that the latest signers of this declaration were a group of television weather forecasters. They could presumably have been among those worried that, as reported at the Web site of Citizens for a Sound Economy, roughly 4.9 million jobs could be jeopardized by regulatory measures being considered to curb global warming. **********But there is no need to go hunting for obscure network addresses to find environmental skeptics on line. Take Globalwarming.org, for instance, the easily remembered address for the Web page run by the Cooler Heads Coalition. **********The Cooler Heads are members of a group established by the National Consumer Coalition, which is backed by a panoply of conservative and libertarian advocacy groups. **********Tucked among the Cooler Heads' wealth of information are suggestions from a book called ''Facts, Not Fear'' on how to educate children about the environment. **********''Explain to them that at the time dinosaurs lived, the atmosphere had CO2  levels that were at least five times greater than what we now have,'' the site says, using the scientific shorthand for carbon dioxide, the gas some scientists say helps cause global warming, ''and that these high levels of CO2  contributed to the rich vegetation.'' **********Serious science is also the theme at the Web site of the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, called the Junk Science Home Page. **********The motto of the page is ''All the junk that's fit to debunk,'' and it includes an essay that reads: **********''As far as agriculture is concerned, a modest warming is bound to be beneficial for several reasons. The increase would register largely as warmer nighttime and winter temperatures, leading to fewer frosts and longer growing seasons, while increased CO2  will stimulate plant growth and lessen the plants' need for water.'' **********The site is also running a $1,000 lottery for those who send E-mail to President Clinton about global warming. But the site cautions that ''if the President signs a global warming treaty, you'll need the cash to pay the new energy tax.'' **********The tone is only slightly more partisan at the Web site for World Climate Report, ''the nation's leading publication covering the breaking news concerning the science and political science of global climate change.'' **********One of the pressing political science questions featured at this site is whether the Republicans can retake the White House on a platform that includes ''No Car-bon Tax.'' **********The Web site does disclose that the report is financed by the Western Fuels Association, which ''promotes the importance of cheap electricity -- coal-fired electricity -- to the U.S. economy and its role in air quality improvements.'' **********But perhaps the most sophisticated voice on global warming in the energy industry remains that of the Mobil Corporation, home of newspaper Op-Ed page advertisements across the country. **********In between ads for Mobil Masterpiece Theater and the Mobil Pegasus Prize for Literature (which was last awarded, coincidentally enough, for a book titled ''A God Strolling in the Cool of the Evening''), the company advocates a cautious approach to environmental regulation. **********''At Mobil, we do have a point of view on global climate change as well as views on many other issues,'' the site reads. ''And we know they are not always the most popular. But we like the public to know where we stand.''"}}
