''We are trying to determine that.'' **********He said that Eastern's staff was asking T.W.A. a myriad of questions concerning routes, labor and assets. **********Mr. McGraw said that C.E. Meyer, the president of T.W.A., had called Frank Borman, the chairman of Eastern, on Tuesday to tell him the board of directors had voted unanimously to put the airline up for sale. **********Inadequate Offer **********The T.W.A. board said that an offer by Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor, and a group of investors to buy 75 percent of the shares of the airline for $18 a share was inadequate, and urged T.W.A. management to pursue other alternatives. **********Mr. Borman has been aggressive in the past in going after international routes, successfully challenging Pan American World Airways for the acquisition of Braniff's Latin American routes, for $30 million, in April 1982. **********The routes have strengthened Eastern's Miami hub by giving it destinations to the south, instead of a dead end at Miami for most flights. The routes have been profitable and have helped the carrier to return to making money. It earned $24.3 million in the first quarter this year - usually its weakest quarter - in contrast to a net loss of $28.1 million in the first quarter last year. **********An aggressive policy by Mr. Borman of buying new airplanes has left the airline with $2.5 billion in long-term debt, however. **********Mediation With Union **********The carrier has also not yet been able to reach an agreement with its flight attendants union, which is necessary as part of a plan by its lenders to prevent it from being put in default. Both sides have agreed to mediation to settle the dispute. **********Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., doubts that the carrier can come up with the financing to make a bid higher than Mr. Icahn's offer. **********Mr. Icahn, who with a group of investors owns 25 percent of T.W.A., has made a bid of $600 million for the remaining shares of the company. **********T.W.A., which has so far fiercely resisted Mr. Icahn, gained support yesterday from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major airports in the New York area. **********Document of Support **********The authority, which leases space to major airlines such as T.W.A. at Kennedy International Airport, La Guardia Airport and Newark International Airport, filed a document with the Department of Transportation supporting the carrier's request that the department determine if Mr. Icahn was fit to run an airline. **********The authority expressed concern that any transfer of control of the airline could result in a reduction of flights, particularly at Kennedy International Airport. **********The authority also said that it was concerned about the lack of experience on the part of Mr. Icahn and his group in operating a major airline. **********Mr. Icahn, who at first favored selling off part of the carrier's domestic operations, has said that he has changed his mind and wants to run the airline as a viable carrier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/02/business/canada-posts-trade-deficit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Posts Trade Deficit", "print_headline": "Canada Posts Trade Deficit", "body_text": " **********Canada had a $1.48 billion foreign trade deficit in the third quarter of 1985, although economic growth as measured by gross national product edged up slightly during the period, Statistics Canada reported Friday. **********Canadian investments in foreign-sponsored ventures, especially the purchase of Canadian oil assets from foreign companies, and slow growth of exports helped to reverse a $32 million second-quarter surplus, the Government agency said. **********The nation had a surplus of $881 million in its 1984 third quarter. **********Real exports of goods and services increased nine-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, while imports of merchandise, especially motor vehicles and parts, helped to raise imports by 5 percent, the agency said. **********The cumulative Canadian trade deficit at the end of the third quarter totaled $6.6 billion, it reported. **********Economic growth as measured by gross national product increased one-tenth of a percentage point, to 4.1 percent, in the third quarter.

He left Saturday after six hours of negotiations Friday and Saturday with Mr. Baldrige.

The Europeans demanded that all of it be excluded, arguing that the contracts had already been signed and that there was a short supply of that type of steel in this country. **********The United States then said it would let the Europeans ship 60,000 tons outside the quota. Now it has gone up to 100,000 tons, which is still far short of the originally contracted 320,000 tons. **********What Washington apparently got in return were European commitments to restrict so-called consultation products. These represent 17 categories of steel that were not part of the basic steel trade agreement reached in 1982. It covered 10 large-tonnage items, representing about 85 percent of all steel imports from Europe. **********Shipments in the 17 categories have surged since 1982, and the United States now wants to impose quotas on the most important of these products. **********Limits for Specific Items **********The plan agreed upon by Mr. de Clercq and Mr. Baldrige would set quotas on such products as cold finished bars, alloy wire rod, black plate, tin-free steel and cold rolled strip, according to a European. **********Also under the plan reached Saturday, the Europeans would agree to renew the basic steel agreement by the end of October. But the coverage would be broader than the 10 products specifically involved in the 1982 pact. **********The trade dispute has been aggravated by a steel production slump on both sides of the Atlantic. **********The American industry's initial reaction to the new accord was cool. **********Roger B. Schagrin, general counsel of the Committee on Pipe and Tube Imports, representing 26 domestic producers, said, ''It's difficult for us to see ourselves as a mere bargaining chip in these negotiations, especially when our rate of import penetration is already over 50 percent.'' **********B.

McCormick, chairman and chief executive officer of Fireman's Fund, who will remain in his post when that company becomes independent. ''Property and casualty is an entirely different business, with 75 percent of our business in commercial lines and only 25 percent in personal lines.'' **********The property and casualty industry suffered from large underwriting losses since 1980, with the total last year amounting to $21.3 billion. Net investment income, which in former years had exceeded the underwriting losses, was just $17.3 billion in 1984. And the combined loss ratio, which compares industrywide premium income with losses and expenses, rose to 118, from 112 in 1983. **********Higher insurance premiums, particularly in commercial lines where the price-cutting had been sharpest, have resulted, however, in improved first-quarter conditions throughout the industry. ''There's been some substantial improvement in the commercial pricing structure,'' said Allerton Cushman Jr., a principal of Morgan Stanley & Company. ''But hardly any of it has come down to the bottom line.'' **********Such is the case at Fireman's Fund, where property and casualty operations lost $4 million in the first quarter of 1985, following a $7 million deficit in 1984. By contrast, the life insurance activities of Fireman's Fund, whose revenues are only about 15 percent of the entire operation, earned $12.4 million in the first three months of 1985, after earning $48.7 million in 1984. **********Rumors About Weill **********Rumors had circulated on Wall Street for many months that Sanford I. Weill, who resigned yesterday as president of American Express and who had also been chairman and chief executive officer of its American Express Insurance Services subsidiary, would join a group that intended to acquire Fireman's Fund. But after considering a number of different alternatives, American Express decided instead to sell some of its holdings now to the public. **********''You don't maximize value in the first year of a cyclical upturn,'' said Donald Franz Jr., senior vice president of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. American Express chose this approach rather than the sale of the entire insurance company, he said, because ''values are not as high right now as they will be a year from now.'' **********Mr. McCormick and Mr. Weill took their posts at Fireman's Fund in Novato, Calif. - Mr. McCormick on a full-time basis and Mr. Weill on a part-time basis - in December 1983 after skyrocketing insurance claims forced a $230 million addition to the company's loss reserves. The insurer reported a loss of $141 milion for the fourth quarter of 1983. For the full year, profits fell to $30 million, down from $244 million in 1982. **********In 1984, Fireman's Fund's net income rose to $43 million. Yet last November, American Express added $200 million to the capital of Fireman's Fund - $130 million at the behest of California insurance regulators and $70 million because of a corporate decision to strengthen the unit. The regulators required the infusion because they determined that in three reinsurance transactions from 1981 through 1983, Fireman's Fund had set aside a smaller amount of statutory reserves than they felt necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/21/business/ex-cell-o-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Cell-O Plant", "print_headline": "Ex-Cell-O Plant", "body_text": " **********The Ex-Cell-O Corporation, which makes aerospace, automotive and industrial parts, said it would close its manufacturing systems plant in Rockford, Ill. **********The company said the move would affect about 410 employees.

The decline was only the latest round in a selling spree fueled by reports that the industry's troubles have finally caught up with the seemingly invincible leader of personal computer software. **********But Mr. Crosett was only partly displeased by the news. For the warning beep was audible evidence that Lotus's newest product, Signal, which will be introduced next week, was performing on cue. Besides alerting its user to key price movements of a favorite stock, Signal can revalue an entire portfolio of several hundred stocks as their prices change and automatically analyze the implications of new stock price levels on a Lotus 1-2-3 financial spreadsheet. **********New Market Segment **********If the $595 hardware-and-software package succeeds, it will propel Lotus into an entirely new segment of the computer market - one consisting of hundreds of thousands of avid stock market investors, small brokerage firms and financial advisers who already use 1-2-3 but do not have access to the giant computer systems of the major Wall Street players. **********''What's going to make the difference for Lotus over the long term,'' said Mitchell D. Kapor, the company's founder and chairman, and something of a cult figure in the software industry, ''is whether we can exploit the linkage between Lotus programs and how people use their computers.'' **********Never in the company's brief but remarkable three-year history has a new product come at such a critical time. Only three months ago, Lotus started shipping Jazz, the business software package that the company said in an advertising blitz would make Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh ''boogie.'' But despite rave reviews about the program, almost no major companies are buying the Macintosh - and hence they are not buying Jazz. **********Indeed, Jazz has tripped over its own feet. The company has been forced to concede in recent days that sales are ''about half'' of its predictions. Analysts have radically reduced their earnings estimates for the company, saying that a 1985 profit that matched last year's $36 million would be a good performance. Revenues are expected to rise to $220 million, from $157 million last year. **********Insider Selling **********Further unnerving investors has been a wave of insider selling. A number of top officers have sold large blocks in recent months, although the company says their motive was ''prudent diversification'' of personal portfolios. Jonathan Sachs, one of Lotus's founders who has since left the company, sold his entire holdings. **********Analysts attribute much of the stock decline to the market's nervousness about software companies in general, and most say they have few long-term worries about Lotus. **********But few in the industry expected Jazz to stumble, and even Lotus's admirers think the trouble - one they attribute to mistakes at Apple more than at Lotus - could take the wind out of Lotus for some time. **********''For a while, at least, they've hit the wall,'' said David Readerman, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Most people who need Lotus software already have it.'' Lotus, he added, is '' increasingly dependent on sales of new computers, which aren't that hot.'' **********Diversification Cited **********Lotus officials say they anticipated that, and earlier this year began extensive diversification into mainframe-personal computer links, software for scientists and engineers, magazine publishing and next week's venture into financial data. Those projects, along with expansion into Europe and soon Japan, where the company plans to sell a Japanese-language version of 1-2-3, has cost the company millions of dollars. But none have yet begun to create any profit. **********''It's strategic spending, and the payoff will not come until next year or later,'' said Jim P. Manzi, the president of Lotus, who runs the company day-to-day while Mr. Kapor concentrates on new products. ''If we wanted to be short-sighted, we could prop up earnings this year,'' he said. ''I don't seriously think anyone wants us to do that.'' **********The more important questions, as even some Lotus officials concede privately, is whether the company has spread itself too thin. Rumors abound of products under development, from a word processor to new versions of Lotus programs with some artificial intelligence features, meaning that computer users would need to do less manipulation of the data. But the company has only about 1,000 employees, and a partial hiring freeze is in effect. **********''Execution will be critical,'' said Michelle Preston, who follows the company for L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. ''It's unfair to expect them to have another 1-2-3,'' which has sold more than 800,000 copies and is considered standard equipment with an I.B.M. PC in most businesses. ''What they are looking for is a way to build on their installed base, which is the path to steady revenues.'' **********Data Beamed to Satellite **********That is the role of Signal. The product is the outgrowth of Lotus's $6 million purchase earlier this year of Dataspeed, a faltering California company that pioneered the technology of instantaneous broadcasting of stock market, options and commodities quotations. The data are gathered from the exchanges, beamed to a satellite, and then distributed by FM radio stations on an unused portion of their radio signal. **********Signal appears to go significantly beyond current stock market services available to personal computer users. The most common, for example, is Dow Jones's Retrieval, which connects users to a data base over the telephone lines and responds to stock queries one at a time. The data can be saved, but often needs to be re-entered into electronic worksheets, like the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, by hand. Users are charged by the minute.  With Signal, no telephones are involved. The computer constantly sifts through the radio signal for stocks it is programmed to fetch. The figures on 20,000 listings are updated every 8 minutes, unless a trade takes place -which is recorded instantly. The data can be transferred to a spreadsheet with just a few key strokes, and a 1-2-3 instantly converts it to graph form. **********Lotus plans to charge a flat monthly fee of about $140, varying slightly according to the services purchased. **********The system competes indirectly with Quotron Systems, which provides similar data to brokerage houses, and with International Market Net, a joint venture of I.B.M. and Merrill Lynch that planned to deliver similar services to PC's on brokers' desks. But last week the joint venture announced that its operations were being scaled back, apparently because they could find few purchasers. Lotus, however, apparently plans to aim at smaller investors. **********With Jazz, Lotus has tripped badly for the first time. And at the company's new nine-story, red-brick headquarters on the banks of the Charles River, company officials are trying to determine what went wrong. **********''It comes down to what happened to the Mac,'' said Mr. Kapor, referring to Apple's inability to break I.B.M.'s stronghold in the office, the most profitable sector of the PC market. ''And to some degree it has to do with what happened to Apple management, which had to unravel sometime, but unfortunately unraveled just as we were bringing out Jazz.'' What Mr. Kapor was referring to was the palace coup at Apple that deposed co-founder Steven P. Jobs from all operating roles and totally reworked Mr. Jobs' strategic direction. Now, rather than aim at the nation's largest companies, Apple is focusing on smaller ones, which are less likely to be Jazz purchasers. **********Lotus officials, however, say they are not giving up on Jazz. They point out that it took a year to find the right niche for Symphony, the rough equivalent of Jazz on the I.B.M. PC and a successor to 1-2-3. **********Lotus just issued a much-improved edition of Symphony and in a few months will turn out the first big revision of 1-2-3, after eliminating technical flaws that early users say made the new version slower than the old. Lotus says the problems are solved, and it plans to sell the upgraded version for $150 to existing Lotus users. In a change of policy, it is granting corporate users a discount of as much as 33 percent for volume purchases. **********''It is getting harder,'' said Stephen J. Crummey, vice president of sales. ''When I came to this company two years ago, everyone loved us. Now there's an entirely new era for software, and we're going to have to work a lot harder.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/world/chief-austrian-investigator-absolve-top-plo-group.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1985-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIEF AUSTRIAN INVESTIGATOR ABSOLVE TOP P.L.O.

But the Minister said the involvement of Abu Nidal's group was not yet certain. **********The precise identity of the group that organized and mounted last Friday's twin attacks against El Al Israel Airlines check-in counters at the Vienna and Rome airports has become critically important since Israel has warned that it plans to retaliate against those it finds to be responsible. **********Impact on Peace Plan **********Mr. Arafat, who is chairman of the P.L.O. and leader of Al Fatah, the P.L.O.'s largest member group, is under strong pressure from some Arab countries to recognize Israel as a prelude to joining in a new Middle East peace initiative being organized by King Hussein of Jordan. **********But diplomats here say any such hopes are likely to be dashed if Israel decides that the P.L.O. was behind last Friday's attacks. **********While some recent Israeli Government statements have tended to blame Mr. Arafat, these sources point out that Abu Nidal's group also has an interest in pinning the blame on Mr. Arafat, since it opposes any peace talks with Israel. **********The Fatah Revolutionary Council, which formed as a breakaway faction of Al Fatah in 1974, has never been a member of the P.L.O.

We are exploring everything to find the truth.'' **********The Interior Minister said the Abu Nidal group had been reponsible for some previous terrorist actions in Austria. ''This group must be taken into consideration,'' he said. ''Whether this is the case this time, no one can yet say.'' **********Contradictory Statements **********In reply to another question, Mr. Blecha asserted that all three gunmen captured in Vienna and Rome after Friday's attack ''have said they belong to the Abu Nidal group,'' adding, ''But this does not necessarily mean they do.'' **********This remark was at variance with what other Austrian officials were saying before the Minister's television appearance. **********While these sources said they suspected that Abu Nidal's group was behind the twin attacks, they insisted that the two gunmen captured in Vienna had not said which Arab group they belonged to. **********This afternoon the Austrian security police chief, Robert Danzinger, told reporters that he still did not ''know what to believe'' about the origins of the attack. **********However, he said the police had discovered that the three gunmen involved had been in Austria for at least a week before the attack was mounted. **********TV Interview Discounted **********Mr. Blecha's remarks today indicated that the Austrian authorities remained unimpressed by a CBS News interview with one of the two captured men Saturday night in which he appeared to claim membership in Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement. **********According to a transcript of the interview, the wounded terrorist who calls himself Abdel Aziz Merzoughi said ''I am Fatah'' in reply to the question, ''Where did you get your instructions?'' **********When asked if all three terrorists involved in the Vienna airport incident were from Al Fatah, he replied, ''Fatah.'' **********Asked then why they had launched the attack, he said: ''Because it is Israel. We kill Israel.'' **********'Don't Know What to Believe' **********Austrian officials said the captured terrorist's claim to belong to Fatah was ambiguous, since the Abu Nidal group is called the Fatah Revolutionary Council. They also said that because he speaks very little English, Mr. Merzoughi may not have understood the question. They said he had not told them which, if any, terrorist organization he belonged to during interrogation conducted in Arabic. **********''They have not said anything certain about their origins. We don't know what to believe,'' Mr. Danzinger said today. **********But an Interior Ministry spokesman told reporters earlier that the investigators were operating on the assumption that the terrorists belonged to the Abu Nidal group. ''We think they belong to Abu Nidal,'' he said. **********The Israeli View **********Israeli diplomats say they are also uncertain about the true authorship of the attack. **********They say that Austria, which was the first Western country to recognize the P.L.O., clearly has a strong political interest in pinning the blame on other Arab groups. **********''The general tone of the press coverage so far has been to exonerate Arafat and put the blame on some obscure Arab splinter,'' one Israeli diplomat said. **********On the other hand, these sources admit they have no hard evidence either way and find the CBS interview unconvincing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/26/world/hostages-lebanon-egypt-s-leader-urges-washington-not-use-force-hostage-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1985-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  EGYPT'S LEADER URGES WASHINGTON NOT TO USE FORCE IN HOSTAGE CRISIS", "print_headline": "HOSTAGES IN LEBANON;   EGYPT'S LEADER URGES WASHINGTON NOT TO USE FORCE IN HOSTAGE CRISIS", "body_text": " **********President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt today condemned the Beirut airline hijacking and other acts of terrorism, but urged the United States not to resort to military action to free the hostages or to retaliate. **********''I could tell you that any violence that is going to take place will lead to more violence,'' Mr. Mubarak told reporters when asked about the stationing of American warships off the coast of Lebanon following the hijacking. **********President Mubarak, pressed further about whether he thought it would be a mistake for the United States to retaliate militarily, replied: ''I think there is no need for that, because it will not solve the problem at all.'' **********He denounced the seizure of the T.W.A.

Ward, chairman of Chesebrough, and H. Barclay Morley, chairman of Stauffer, followed the unanimous approval of both boards, and calls for Chesebrough to pay $28 a share in a public tender offer to begin today. **********Mr. Ward said that Chesebrough was buying Stauffer ''to give us some new products'' through its research capability, but analysts maintained that Chesebrough was protecting itself against a possible takeover. **********Chesebrough, with headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., reported sales last year of an estimated $1.8 billion. Stauffer, based in Westport, Conn, reported 1984 sales of $1.5 billion. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, Wall Street professionals reacted enthusiastically to the deal, bidding up the price of Stauffer's stock by $5.625, to $27. Nearly 8.4 million shares changed hands, making it by far the most-active issue of the day. Wall Street analysts, arguing that they were unable to see any particularly ''fit'' between the two companies, contributed somewhat to the $3.875 drop in Chesebrough to $33.50. **********Option on 8 Million Shares **********In a move that would give Chesebrough a profit on the deal, if someone outbid it, Stauffer said it had given Chesebrough an option to buy about 8 million newly issued shares. No option price was given, but it is also thought to be $28 a share. **********Commenting on the venture, Chesebrough's Mr. Ward said that for consumer products companies ''to make a difference'' for the future, ''they're going to have to provide products that are truly breakthroughs - that really do fill important unfilled needs.'' **********This can only come about, he said, ''by organizations that do both basic research the way Stauffer does - and couple it with applied research and development and marketing the way Chesebrough does.'' **********Stauffer's Mr. Morely added that his company could use Chesebrough's marketing skills to ''capitalize on new products Stauffer may develop.'' **********Jack L. Salzman, who follows Chesebrough for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said he saw ''no fit'' between the two companies. He said he found it ''very atypical for Chesebrough to end up buying a commodities chemical company - one that doesn't sell anything unique'' - and maintained that chemical analysts saw ''no significant R & D at Stauffer for the next two or three years.'' **********'A Self-Protection Device' **********Mr. Ward, he said, was ''looking for a self-protection device,'' noting that Chesebrough had been approached by Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier, last year and was ''still vulnerable'' to similar attack. **********Last August, in a little-noticed $160 million deal, Mr. Icahn, who is currently trying to take over the Phillips Petroleum Company, sold the nearly 5 percent of Chesebrough stock he owned back to Chesebrough. And as part of the deal, he also sold Chesebrough a plastics company, the Polymer Corporation. **********''Ward is looking for a way to be unappealing to corporate sharks,'' the Smith Barney analyst said. **********On a positive note, Mr. Salzman said he thought Mr. Ward might be ''speculating that the worst of Stauffer's problems are over, and that it will show a cyclical earnings recovery over the next two or three years from a very depressed base.'' **********Diana K. Temple, who follows the cosmetics company for Salomon Brothers Inc., said, ''I don't quite understand the rationale for the deal,'' arguing that there were ''more cost- effective ways'' for Chesebrough to accomplish the same ends, such as by increasing research or doing joint ventures. **********Debt Ratio Questioned **********She noted that Chesebrough's debt ratio, which had been about 30 percent, jumped to 45 percent after the Icahn deal, and would jump again after this one to what she called an ''excessive'' 70 percent. **********Chesebrough's Mr. Ward said in a brief telephone interview that the ratio would indeed reach 70 percent initially but was expected to fall to around 50 percent by the end of this year with the paying off of some debt. He said nothing of Stauffer's would be sold, and no layoffs at either company were planned. Moreover, he said, the debt ratio was expected to be down to around 44 percent at the end of 1986, or below the present level. **********Chesebrough said that, despite the big acquisition, it intends to maintain its dividend of 48 cents a share. **********Asked about the negative reaction from analysts, he remarked: ''When we first made our move into food with Ragu in 1969 and then into children's apparel with Health-Tex in 1973, we got the same reaction. They didn't think it was a good idea. Unless we stay in our own backyards, some of them have difficulty understanding it.'' He said that these and other acquistions, including G.H. Bass & Company in 1978 and the Prince Manufacturing Company in 1982, were ''all profitable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/06/world/south-africa-warns-it-may-expel-aliens-if-us-investors-pull-out.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 357, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA WARNS IT MAY EXPEL ALIENS IF U.S. INVESTORS PULL OUT", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA WARNS IT MAY EXPEL ALIENS IF U.S. INVESTORS PULL OUT", "body_text": " **********A high-ranking official says the Government may expel more than a million black workers if the United States pulls its investments from the country to protest Pretoria's racial policies. **********Casper Venter, an assistant to Deputy Foreign Minister Louis Nel, said Mr. Nel issued the statement about possible expulsions at a time when economic sanctions against South Africa were being considered in Congress. **********The Government television reported that Mr. Nel said at a rally Tuesday night that South Africa would evict the million blacks if the United States withdrew its interests from the country.

But they remain skeptical about how much the changes will increase their chances of wresting business from their Japanese competitors. **********Among the new measures, which are timed to the beginning of Japan's fiscal year, are these: **********- Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Government-owned telecommunications monopoly, will become a private company. Competition in telecommunications services and equipment will be allowed for the first time. **********- The Government will relax a number of rules covering Japan's financial and capital markets. Included will be measures that should greatly expand trading in Euroyen bonds and certificates of deposit - yen-denominated instruments issued outside Japan. **********- The 80-year monopoly of the Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation will end, allowing foreign cigarette manufacturers to export, market and distribute their products themselves rather than through their Japanese competitor. **********International pressure for change in each of these areas has been intense, with American Government and industry leaders claiming that the markets were either effectively closed to foreign competition or over- regulated. But there has also been domestic demand for change. Politicians and business people have criticized the state monopolies as inefficient and have urged financial deregulation to open up more business opportunities for Japanese companies. **********The most closely watched changes are those taking place in Japan's $7 billion telecommunications industry. On Monday, Nippon Telegraph becomes Japan's largest private company, with 318,000 employees and total assets of 10 trillion yen. The Government will retain control of one-third of the stock, with the rest to be sold gradually, but only to Japanese citizens. **********Americans Have Doubts **********There is still considerable debate whether the end of N.T.T.'s monopoly presents an opportunity for American telecommunications companies. Most Americans watching the situation, whether in government or industry, doubt that the new rules will end discrimination against foreign products. **********''These regulations do not create any new market opportunities,'' said John P. Stern, senior representative of the American Electronics Association here. ''Deregulation never looked like this.'' **********Mr. Stern and other Americans said they objected to the requirement that companies who want to offer so- called value-added-network services notify the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of their financial status, business plans and types of equipment. The services in question include computer linkups used by banks and credit card companies. **********Americans are also worried that N.T.T., which will continue to be the only company offering public telephone service, will use that source of stable revenues to subsidize ventures in more risky areas of telecommunications. **********Despite the debate over the new regulations, about 20 American companies and at least 100 Japanse companies are preparing to enter the field against N.T.T. **********Many of the American companies are choosing Japanese partners. A.T.& T. has enlisted the help of Mitsui & Company as well as several other Japanese companies.  The International Business Machines Corporation has entered an agreement with Mitsubishi; Hughes Communications Inc. has formed a joint venture with C. Itoh & Company and Mitsui to offer communications satellite service. **********Japanese Dominance Seen **********Dr. Bernard Key, an analyst for Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., said that despite American companies' more advanced technology, Japanese companies would probably dominate the market here even with all trade barriers removed. **********He said that among other advantages, the Japanese corporations have been preparing for two years, making the rounds of corporate executives to persuade them to invest in new data communications networks. **********Herbert F. Hayde, chairman of the Burroughs Corporation's Japanese subsidiary, said he believed nevertheless that American companies could be competitive here, particularly in software and design systems. ''What's lacking in the Japanese marketplace,'' he said, ''is knowledge and expertise in networking, and American companies have over 15 years of experience.'' **********N.T.T., although strong, does have vulnerabilities, according to analysts and the company itself. Hidesada Toriyama, an N.T.T. spokesman, said that the company has very low market shares in areas such as facsimile machines, widely used in Japan because the complications of the written language make word processing difficult. The company also has huge personnel costs, Mr. Toriyama said. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 1984, the company reported revenues of 4.5 trillion yen, but profits of 384 billion yen. **********N.T.T., however, remains a formidable competitor, according to analysts here. It has not been broken up like A.T.& T., and it retains a family of supplier companies. This February, it completed a $250 million nationwide network of optical fiber transmission lines. Its research laboratories are considered top-class."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/07/business/business-people-chief-executive-resigns-at-consumers-power.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chief Executive Resigns At Consumers Power", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Chief Executive Resigns At Consumers Power", "body_text": " **********The Consumers Power Company, the financially troubled Michigan utility, has accepted the resignation of its chairman and chief executive, John D.

An analyst of Middle East military affairs said one of the main lessons of the fighting was that both sides find it difficult to exploit success, to react rapidly to unforseen events and to coordinate airpower, artillery and ground forces. An American official called it ''the slow-motion war.'' **********He said Iraq, which has more and better military equipment, can ''determine the scale of the war, but Iran can determine the length.'' **********None of the analysts professed to see how the war, which started in September 1980, could be won in the usual sense of the word. **********Attack Began on March 11 **********In the latest round of ground combat, a large Iranian force, already holding part of the Huwaizah marshes in Iraq, attacked westward on the night of March 11, reaching the Tigris River about 10 miles away, United States officials said. The Iranian objective seemed to be the highway that closely parallels the west bank of the river and that connects Baghdad and the Iraqi city of Basra about 45 miles south of the battlefield. **********In heavy fighting last Sunday and Monday, Iraqi forces drove the Iranians back to the marshes, but not off Iraqi territory, the officials said. They said the Iraqis inflicted heavy casualties and suffered significant losses of their own. **********In the spring of 1982, roles were reversed. At that time, Iran drove Iraq from most areas of Iranian territory, enveloping and destroying several large Iraqi units. But then, too, nothing decisive was achieved. **********Iraq not only has more planes and tanks than Iran, it has also lately been able to build up stocks of less-glamorous items such as spare parts and ammunition, the experts said. But one United States official said that ''both countries have to live from hand to mouth strategically, and it is hard to see them advancing very far into the territory of the other.'' **********Both Sides Get Soviet Aid **********Both sides get much of their equipment from the Soviet Union, and Soviet military advisers are serving on both sides. In Iran's case much of the equipment comes from Soviet military clients like North Korea, Syria and Libya, but the experts said they doubted the transfers could take place without Soviet approval. **********Between the infrequent major battles both sides have concentrated on small engagements or air attacks on each other's oil installations or commerical oil tankers in the northern Persian Gulf. **********One element of successful war making seems to be absent. That is an achievable goal or objective. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq began the fighting in 1980 to gain control of the disputed Shatt al Arab waterway leading into the Persian Gulf. Instead, Iraq lost its ability to ship oil by sea. **********The Iranian religious and political leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, says Iran will fight until the Iraqi President resigns or is forced out of office. Some American analysts say they believe the war will eventually, but not soon, peter out into an undeclared peace in which a state of war continues to exist but in which there are few, if any, major military operations. Others foresee protracted fighting. **********Experts say they do see some trends in the war, although they evolve slowly and may be of limited significance. **********About half of Iran's ground forces consist of 250,000 Revolutionary Guards, which mostly operate as battalions of several hundred men each. They have achieved a reputation for suicidal advances through minefields. **********In 1982, when Iran dislodged Iraq from such Iranian areas as the city of Khurramshahr, several analysts concluded that professional, trained officers of the regular Iranian Army had found effective ways to cooperate with and utilize the zealous guards, by following human wave attacks by the volunteers with armored thrusts. **********But since then, Iranian religious leaders have apparently relapsed into suspicion of the professional army, air force and navy. Yossf Bodansky, an Israeli analyst formerly of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and now a consultant to the United States Government, says he believes that large numbers of Revolutionary Guards were trained as officers in Communist bloc nations and have diminished the influence of experienced regular army leaders. This, he thinks, may have contributed to the failure of the last Iranian attack."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/business/business-forum-little-reason-to-cheer-low-wages.html": {"writer_name": "George Brockway", "pub_date": "1985-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  LITTLE REASON TO CHEER LOW WAGES", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM;   LITTLE REASON TO CHEER LOW WAGES", "body_text": " **********A RECENT front-page news story informed us that ''As wage settlements and salary plans for next year take shape, all signs suggest that 1986 will become the fifth consecutive year that the typical American worker will receive a smaller pay increase than in previous years.'' What I found particularly newsworthy was that some of the economists who are consulted on such occasions allowed themselves to wonder whether this news might not, after all, be bad news. **********For many years now we have been hearing from people in high places that high wages make for cost-push inflation, that high wages have destroyed America's ability to compete in world markets (or even in our home market), that high wages are responsible for our faltering productivity rate and that high wages have sapped American industry's profits and so forestalled our saving for a glorious future. On the basis of these dicta, you would think that the news of continued low wage rises would be greeted with cheers; but it seems that you can't please some people no matter what. **********The economists' displeasure has two grounds. The first, which I consider irrelevant, is that in previous recoveries wages and gross national product went up much faster than they are going up now, though prices went up less fast. **********This observation is all the more disturbing in view of the tardy discovery that this recovery (if that is what it is) has been led by consumption, that is, the demand side, not the supply side we used to hear about. **********Is the economists' displeasure justified? Perhaps it is, but not for the reasons they give. Statistics from previous recoveries can be correlated in some way with present statistics, but we cannot put much reliance on such correlations unless we can explain them. Without explanation, they are like my use of vitamin C and my concomitant freedom from colds, which my doctor dismisses as merely anecdotal. Well, like Linus Pauling, I believe in vitamin C; but, like Adam Smith, ''I have no great faith in political arithmetic,'' a.k.a. statistics. Without explanation, statistics, even when accurate, are just anecdotal. **********So the statistical explanation is not very convincing. We would better understand what is bothering the economists if we looked back at the reasons previously given for the bad effects of high wages. These are all variants of what might be called the trade-off theory of economics, which holds, as some say, that the economy is a zero-sum game. As economic theories go, trade-offs are very old, dating back at least to David Ricardo's ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,'' in 1817. ''It has been my endeavour to show throughout this book,'' Ricardo wrote, ''that the rate of profits can never be increased but by a fall in wages.'' **********This proposition, which certainly seems self-evident, is known to fanciers of economics controversy as the wages-fund theory. Ricardo was influential on writers as various as Karl Marx on the left and Ludwig von Mises on the right. But as Joseph A. Schumpeter observed drily, the theory overlooks ''the important fact that high rates of profit and high wages normally go together.'' **********The economists are undoubtedly right that the demand side pulled us out of the depression of 1981 and 1982. There is positive evidence in the twofold surges of private demand (consumer debt) and public demand (military procurement). And there is negative evidence in the failure of the 1981 Kemp-Roth tax cuts to deliver their promised increase in the rate of saving (the rate actually decreased). **********And there is in fact a theory that makes sense of this evidence. The reasoning was developed by John Maynard Keynes. Translated, the story goes like this: Sensible businessmen do not produce things they cannot sell and certainly do not build new factories when they have usable old factories standing idle. WHILE THE troubles of individual businessmen may result from their mistakenly producing things nobody wants, the troubles of the economy as a whole result from the inability or unwillingness of the economy as a whole to buy what is offered for sale. The desire to buy may be there, but effective demand is lacking. As Adam Smith put it, ''A very poor man may be said in some sense to have a demand for a coach and six; he might like to have it; but his demand is not an effectual demand.'' **********The problem for an economy in recession is always to stimulate aggregate demand; and given the need or preference of businesses and households to hold at least a portion of their funds liquid, the problem even in good times is to maintain aggregate demand. ''The right remedy for the trade cycle,'' Keynes wrote, ''is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom.'' **********Thus we come to the real reason for dismay at the forecasts of 1986 wages. Stagnating wages mean stagnating demand, and this will occur in an economy already stagnant, with close to 10 percent of potential workers unemployed or underemployed, with close to 20 percent of industrial capacity idle and with bankruptcies spreading across the Farm Belt. **********Now, the Government can do little about wages beyond the minimum, but it can do a lot about aggregate demand. Continuation of the arms race is a possibility, but it would have to speed up to do anything more than it is already doing - not an attractive option. **********But consider the fact that our millions of unemployed, plus the millions of working poor, plus their dependents, comprise a ''nation'' of 40 million to 50 million people - bigger than any but a handful of the 157 members of the United Nations. Consider also that in spite of our shameful failures, these people are at least partially educated, have some awareness of the American work ethic, and have been persuaded to be close to the rest of us in needs and wants. If our national and industrial policies were directed to helping these fellow citizens to turn their undeniable wants into effective demands, there would be plenty of business to keep industry fully occupied and highly profitable. **********As it is, the descendants of David Ricardo slash mindlessly at welfare and Government, and wages and industry. They are aware, with one side of their brains, that they are thus reducing aggregate demand. It would be a blessing for us all if they could activate the other side of their brains and recognize that reduced demand is another way of saying reduced sales, and that reduced sales ordinarily mean reduced profits. Then they might be emboldened to conclude that, pleasant as it is to tromp on welfare and wages, it would be even more pleasant to reverse (for more than one month) the present downward trend in profits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/09/world/kgb-detains-us-reporter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "K.G.B.

Landry, publisher of La Presse -who think Mr. Peladeau combines some of those elements in Le Journal. **********Le Journal, Mr. Landry says, is a mix of ''sex, sports and sensationalism.'' And he likens his competitor, Mr. Peladeau, to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian whose worldwide publishing empire includes more than 80 newspapers and magazines, among them The New York Post, The Chicago Sun-Times and The Star in the United States. Mr. Murdoch's critics say he has turned some of his newspapers into tasteless publications with sensational headlines featuring sex, crime and gossip. **********In fact, Mr. Peladeau, principal owner and chief executive of Quebecor Inc., which owns Le Journal as well as other publications, says he admires Mr. Murdoch and is bent on duplicating his success. **********Second-Biggest Paper in Canada **********In the two decades since he founded Le Journal, Mr. Peladeau has used a Murdoch-like formula to make it the biggest newspaper in Montreal, the biggest French-language paper in Canada and the second-biggest Canadian paper in any language, behind only The Toronto Star. **********The competition in Montreal has been tough: In 1975, there were five French-language papers in Montreal and two in English. Now, there are three French and one English. **********Le Journal, a tabloid, is strong on sports and local news. Crime gets extensive coverage, but there is in fact very little sex in the newspaper. **********The readership is solidly middle class. Increasingly, Le Journal is trying to appeal to younger readers, devoting more and more space to features on movies and other entertainment topics. Charles Dunbar, Le Journal's director of research, said, ''We're a newspaper for people who watch television.'' **********A Publishing Empire **********Mr. Peladeau has built a business empire consisting of three daily newspapers, 33 regional weeklies, four sensationalistic popular papers and several magazines. Quebecor Inc. also publishes and distributes books and records, owns and operates 13 printing plants and owns 24 photographic supply stores. **********For the year ended Sept. 30, net income jumped nearly 50 percent, to $8.3 million, on sales of $203.6 million in United States dollars. For the first six months of this year, net income was up by nearly two-thirds. **********All this is appreciated on the Montreal, American and Toronto stock exchanges, where Quebecor shares are traded. After a two-for-one stock split in February and a three-for-one split approved by shareholders June 11, investors could have about doubled their money in the past two years. **********In the Market for Dailies **********And that appears to be just the beginning. ''We're in the market for a Canadian daily, an American daily and a French daily - we're in the market for a lot of things,'' Mr. Peladeau said. Although most purchases are considerably smaller - a rural weekly, say, rather than a big-city daily - Quebecor has been making about one acquisition a month. **********If the price were right, Mr. Peladeau says, he would be interested in buying either The New York Post or The Chicago Sun-Times from Mr. Murdoch, who is expected to sell both because of his recent deal to purchase a group of independent television stations in the United States from Metromedia Inc. for more than $2 billion. **********Mr. Peladeau is also considering establishing a daily sports newspaper in Philadelphia, Boston or Detroit, perhaps expanding to a national sports daily along the pattern of the Gannett Company's USA Today. **********A Purchase in New Jersey **********So far this year, Quebecor has dipped its toe in the American market by buying two newspaper publishing companies: Pendell Printing Inc. in Midland, Mich., and the Somerset Publishing Company in Somerset, N.J. The Somerset deal, completed this month, is billed as a possible entry into the East Coast daily market, although for now the company will only print papers for others, including Investor's Daily. **********''We have the means, the contacts, the money and whatever is necessary,'' said Andre Gourd, the Quebecor corporate secretary, who will soon be leaving for New Jersey to set up the company's new subsidiary, Quebecor America Inc. ''We are on the acquisition trail.'' **********Quebecor hopes it has better luck than the last time it tried to crack the American market. In 1977, it started The Philadelphia Journal, a splashy, colorful tabloid that died four years later, the victim of labor strife and lack of advertiser interest. Quebecor lost $15 million in Philadelphia. **********Mr. Peladeau says that through that experience, he ''earned the most expensive M.B.A. in the United States.'' Analysts think part of the lesson is that next time Quebecor should buy an existing newspaper, rather than starting from scratch. **********Started With a Weekly **********Mr. Peladeau, 60 years old, began his rise in 1950 with the purchase of a neighborood weekly in Montreal. He bought his own plant in the 1950's when he was having trouble finding people to print his paper. **********Now the owner of 54 percent of Quebecor appears to have shed the impetuousness that used to characterize his decision making but he has not sacrificed his bubbly personal charm. He gives business associates freer rein, is less of what he terms a ''super hustler'' and claims to get ''more action'' as a result. **********''It's a much improved situation,'' said Michel Perrault, an analyst at Alfred Bunting & Company here. He particularly applauds what he sees as a new Quebecor ability to shed money-losing operations quickly. **********Much of Quebecor's success has come at the expense of Mr. Landry's La Presse. Mr. Peladeau started La Journal in 1964 during a bitter strike at the rival paper. In 1978, another strike at La Presse enabled him to surpass the 101-year-old broadsheet in circulation. **********Today, Le Journal's daily circulation of 320,000 is about 50 percent greater than that of La Presse. In addition, Quebecor makes money by publishing and distributing Le Devoir, an ultra-intellectual daily with a circulation of only about 35,000. **********Still, Mr. Landry of La Presse, owned by the giant Power Corporation of Canada, based in Montreal, believes that what he considers the lower common denominator of his rival's news is not attractive. He points out his own paper's daily circulation has increased from 165,000 to about 200,000 over the last five years, and he claims La Presse gets 76 percent of the French-language classified and national retail advertising. **********''We're a pain in his side,'' the La Presse publisher said of Mr. Peladeau."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/02/business/credit-markets-long-term-bond-prices-rise.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Short-term interest rates were basically unchanged. **********Corporate bonds posted small gains in light trading, while the tax-exempt market marked time, as it awaited a record volume of offerings next week. **********Dealers in government securities attributed early weakness to a negative interpretation of the latest figures on nonfarm employment, a higher-than-expected rise in the weekly M-1 money supply figure and a firm overnight interbank lending rate. **********'Changed Its Mind' **********''But the market quickly changed its mind about the 414,000 rise in nonfarm employment in October and an unemployment rate that held steady last month,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Briggs Schaedle & Company. ''The market also chose to view the $8.5 billion rise in the latest M-1 figure as generally neutral. This should be confirmed in two weeks when the broader money supply numbers are released.'' **********The bullish attitude is also based on expectations of a cut in the discount rate by Thanksgiving, Mr. Braverman said, ''as well as the widespread belief that the Federal Reserve and the other members of the Group of Five industrialized nations have agreed to keep a lid on United States interest rates, as a means of further depressing the dollar's attractiveness to foreign investors.'' **********He said, for example, that Japanese investors were not aggressive buyers at this week's Treasury note and bond auctions. Nevertheless, the Treasury's offerings were well received by a market starved of new issues because of the failure of Congress to lift the debt ceiling. This factor has also brightened the long-term bond market, Mr. Braverman added. **********Payment Day **********But yesterday was payment day for the week's Treasury note and bond sales, and with the benchmark overnight interbank lending rate at a relatively high 8.5 percent at the opening, many investors decided to take profits. That contributed to the early weakness, said Douglas McAllister, government securities trader at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********''The market is behaving strangely, as if it was sure the economy is not going to improve for some time and that the debt ceiling issue was never going to be resolved,'' Mr. McAllister said. ''Eventually, perhaps this weekend, the debt ceiling will be raised, and we could see sales of $22 billion of 3-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury paper within days, and then a new mood take over.'' **********Strange also was an unusual move by the Fed to add a modest amount of reserves to the banking system about 15 minutes later than its normal intervention time. This was effected through $700 million of customer repurchase agreements. While a repo operation of this size is too small to have any influence on Federal funds rates, it was interpreted as a signal that the central bank, while not aggressively easing credit, was also not interested in a tightening of the funds rate. **********At the close, the funds rate was trading at 8 1/8 percent. Despite the selling of bills to pay for this week's Treasury issues, bill rates closed basically unchanged, with the 90-day bills yielding 7.41 percent; the six-month issue, 7.65 percent, and the one-year bill, 7.87 percent. **********Among the issues in the secondary market, the 8 7/8 percent notes of 1987 were offered unchanged at 100 3/32, to yield 8.65 percent; the 9 5/8's of 1990 rose 1/32, to 100 24/32, for a yield of 9.41 percent; the 10.5's of 1995 dipped 2/32 at 103 12/32, to yield 9.95 percent; the new 10.75's of 2005 climbed 14/32 at 102 28/32, for a yield of 10.39 percent, and the bellwether long bond, the 10 5/8's of 2015, rose 7/ 32, to 103 23/32, to yield 10.22 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/29/business/finance-new-issues-georgia-electric-agency-plans-yields-up-to-9-7-8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Georgia Electric Agency Plans Yields Up to 9 7/8%", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Georgia Electric Agency Plans Yields Up to 9 7/8%", "body_text": " **********The Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia is offering $650 million of bonds with a maximum yield tentatively set at 9 7/8 percent for bonds due in 2016 and 2017.

Bidding results were about as expected, and the $1.25 billion of noncompetitive tenders was not as low as had been feared earlier in the day. **********Good Commercial-Bank Buying **********''It was a mediocre, O.K. auction,'' said Doug McAllister, an officer in the Government securities department at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''Nothing to rave about, but not a disaster either.'' He said that there was good commercial bank buying of the issue, adding that ''weak loan demand has caused many banks to step up and buy the three-year'' issue. **********''I expected greater investor interest, since there are a lot of major institutions with ample cash to invest,'' said another Government securities dealer, who asked not to be identified. ''But there were reports of some good buying from overseas, and on balance I would call the auction modestly well received.'' **********The 9.53 percent average yield on the new notes was down from 10 percent at the previous three-year note sale in May and was the lowest since May 1983. **********While some dealers described bank demand as less than expected, there was general agreement that the domestic banking system absorbed a large part of the issue. According to Federal Reserve data, large banks across the country added nearly $6 billion to their holdings of Treasury securities between the start of the year and July 17, with most of the increase in notes due between one and five years. The increase would have been much larger but for a sharp decline of more than $3 billion during the middle of July, when note and bond prices were falling and interest rates rising in advance of this week's sales. In that same period business loans rose less than $1.3 billion. **********During the corresponding period of 1984, loan demand was brisk, rising by nearly $19.5 billion, and large banks across the country reduced their holdings of Treasury securities by $8.1 billion. **********Today's Auction: 10-Year Notes **********For the remainder of the Treasury's financing program, securities dealers do not expect much help from the banking system, as banks are not normally buyers of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. **********For those two issues, securities dealers look for foreign investors, bank trust departments, pension funds, insurance companies and other money managers, such as advisers of mutual funds. Demand from these categories of investors has been weak since early July, as note and bond prices fell and yields increased. But now that yields are about half a percentage point higher than early July, securities dealers expect many of these dormant accounts to reappear in coming days. **********In advance of today's $6.75 billion auction of 10-year notes, securities dealers quoted the issue with a yield of about 10.61 percent. The 30-year bonds to be auctioned tomorrow were offered at 10.78 percent, while the outstanding 11 1/4 percent bonds due in 2015 were offered at 104 23/32, up about 2/32, to yield 10.72 percent. **********Elsewhere in the credit markets, prices of tax-exempt securities were little changed. Although the supply of new issues this week was light by the standards of this year, investment bankers noted that the desire of many local governments and authorities to refund outstanding debt will keep the supply of new bonds heavy so long as interest rates remain near current levels or decline further. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new three-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price#99.923 Average Yield#9.53% Low Price#99.898 High Yield#9.54% High Price#99.974 Low Yield#9.51% Accepted at low#59% Total applied for$20,482,680 Accepted$8,523,985 N.Y. applied for$17,299,195 N.Y. accepted$7,037,665 Noncompetitive$1,255,000 The three-year notes mature August 15, 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/25/world/french-seize-protest-vessel-in-pacific.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1985-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 918, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH SEIZE PROTEST VESSEL IN PACIFIC", "print_headline": "FRENCH SEIZE PROTEST VESSEL IN PACIFIC", "body_text": " **********French commandos today seized a sailboat belonging to the antinuclear and environmentalist group Greenpeace as the vessel approached France's nuclear test site in the South Pacific shortly before a planned explosion. **********Greenpeace and the French authorities made conflicting statements as to whether the vessel had entered the exclusion zone France has proclaimed around the site. **********All seven of the Greenpeace protesters aboard were arrested and the vessel, the 36-foot ketch Vega, taken under tow.

He was quoting from a statement by the French leader condemning the Rainbow Warrior sinking. **********France's nuclear tests in the region are opposed by governments there as well as by Greenpeace. The Mururoa site is inside the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone declared in August by Australia, New Zealand and other nations in the region. **********The seizure came after weeks of a seaborne cat-and-mouse game between several vessels participating in the Greenpeace protest and ships of the French Navy that have been closely trailing them. **********The French Defense Department spokesman said that the boat was boarded by a team of eight commandos who ordered the seven Greenpeace members aboard to go below. **********Distance Put at 10 Miles **********Adm. Rene Hugues, commmander of the French Pacific Fleet, said that Vega had crossed into the exclusion zone despite repeated warnings from a French naval tug that had been shadowing it. He said eight commandos left the tug in a Zodiac high-speed dinghy and boarded the yacht when it was 10 miles from Mururoa. **********A Greenpeace official in London, Tony Marriner, said in a telephone interview that the Vega had approached Mururoa Atoll in an effort to disrupt the weapons test. He said that the boats in the Greenpeace protest had remained outside the atoll's territorial limits as long as there were no signs that the testing was about to begin. **********Admiral Hugues said the protesters offered no resistance. ''They weren't taken by surprise. They knew what they were doing,'' he said. **********The Vega was said to have been involved in three previous Mururoa protest vigils. According to Reuters, the ship's captain, Chris Robinson, said by radio before his vessel was seized: **********Appeal to France ''We urgently appeal to France to cancel the test. We are fully aware of the risks we face, but the threat to the future of the people of the Pacific, posed by the release of radioactivity, is far greater.'' **********The confrontation between Greenpeace and the French Government took on the proportions of a major international incident after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior last August. **********The French Government, after first denying involvement in the sabotage, admitted last month that its agents sank the ship. But the major thrust of French reaction to the affair has been to reaffirm France's determination to maintain its Pacific testing program, which it sees as essential to maintaining its independent nuclear deterrent. **********In August, President Mitterrand warned that the French Government would use force if necessary to prevent any interference with its testing program, which has been sharply criticized by New Zealand, Australia, and several small Pacific island nations. **********Visit by Mitterrand **********Mr. Mitterrand payed a brief visit to Mururoa Atoll last month in a gesture clearly designed to reaffirm France's intention of continuing its tests there in the face of the protests. **********The trip to the atoll by the Prime Minister, Mr. Fabius, who left Paris for Mururoa on Wednesday accompanied by Defense Minister Paul Quiles, was also seen as a gesture of French determination to continue the tests. **********The incident today came at a time when what has come to be known as the Greenpeace affair had virtually disappeared in France after a period of several weeks during which it was a national preoccupation. In the view of many here, the phenomonen reflected the overwhelming support among the population for the French independent nuclear weapons program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/12/world/india-s-old-school-tie-harrow-by-the-himalayas.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1985-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1064, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA'S OLD SCHOOL TIE: HARROW BY THE HIMALAYAS", "print_headline": "INDIA'S OLD SCHOOL TIE: HARROW BY THE HIMALAYAS", "body_text": " **********The ''old boys'' will probably talk about it for years. **********Amid revelry, nostalgia and choruses of ''Auld Lang Syne,'' the alumni of one of the country's most exclusive boarding schools came back to their campus in the Himalayan foothills early in November to toast themselves and their ascendancy in India. **********The Doon School, their alma mater, had much to celebrate 50 years after its founding by British educators as an Indian version of Eton or Harrow. **********The ''old boys'' were proud, for instance, that among their number was Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, wearing his blue school blazer and tie, plus several fellow members of the ''Doon School mafia'' who joined his Government. #30 Come From Pakistan In abundance, too, were the executives of scores of India's leading business companies and editors of its news publications. **********From Pakistan came 30 graduates who had risen to prominence in their country and who got a huge standing ovation when one of them pleaded for the barriers with India to ''come down as soon as possible.'' **********In a speech before 3,000 guests at the jubilee, Mr. Gandhi, class of 1960, said that returning to the ivy halls and playing fields of his youth ''has always been like coming back home.'' The Doon School, he said, ''has given us a certain strength to face the world.'' **********But that is hardly all it gave. Alumni and others say that the ''old boy'' network flourishes and helps its members look after each other's interests, forming a cornerstone of the country's upper class establishment. **********''It is unquestionably India's leading school and a breeding ground for the movers and shakers (and reapers) of Indian society,'' wrote Malavika Sanghvi, a chronicler of Indian mores, in Imprint magazine. **********Merit 'the Basic Criterion' **********Not surprisingly, Doon School people are sensitive to criticism that they are sharpening the worst tendencies in a country long burdened by caste and social hierarchies. **********''We are not an elite in the conniving sense,'' asserted Ajit Narain Haksar, a retired chairman of ITC Ltd., a huge conglomerate. ''Merit is still the basic criterion.'' **********Like others, Mr. Haksar said the key to the school's success was its commitment to equality among students. No matter what their background, the boys wear identical uniforms, make their own beds, live by the rules and keep the same amount of pocket money. **********''Remember the day when the Nawab of Rampur brought his son to school in a cavalcade of cars,'' Mr. Haksar said. ''The headmaster directed the boy to get out and carry his own suitcase. Inside, class distinctions vanished.'' **********A 'Fixation' Is Noted **********When the Doon School was founded in 1935, such a rule was considered revolutionary. Until then, the elite educational institutions established by the British catered to the sons of the British raj and the royal families in India. **********The Doon School became the first ''public school'' for the sons of the growing class of untitled public servants and merchants who would later assume positions of responsibility in a newly independent India . **********Today it has come of age as the training ground for India's entrepreneurs. In fact, Gulab Ramchandani, the headmaster, told the alumni this weekend that ''we should wean our boys away from the fixation of executive jobs in industry and commerce.'' **********Others wonder about the relevance of its traditions. English remains the medium of instruction. Athletics and sportsmanship are a must. The boys go on treks in the mountains and do volunteer work among the poor in a nearby village. **********Nearly a third of the students receive financial aid, but few are on full scholarship and the mix of students is generally upper class. **********System Can Be Cruel **********A system of student prefects and captains enforces discipline, sometimes cruelly. **********''They're still training people in 19th-century British values,'' said Dinesh Mohan, a classmate of Mr. Gandhi who is now a biology professor in New Delhi. **********''They pride themselves on upper class things, like quaint hobbies and politics based on class,'' he added. ''But there have been no graduates of national stature in science, or literary achievement in Hindi.'' **********A more typical comment came from Bawa Amarjoyt Singh, a 29-year-old garment exporter. ''You leave here with a feeling of self-confidence and determination,'' he said. ''Whether we're actually brighter than the next fellow, I don't know. But normally, we get what we want.'' **********Students and graduates also generally reject the charge that the Doon School is too Westernized. From its inception, they note, the school made the singing of Hindi and Urdu songs a part of each day's activities. Students are taught to appreciate classic Indian theater and music. **********There were countless stories at the reunion of boyhood pranks, awful food, cold showers and getting lost on hikes, but perhaps little on the stimulation of the classroom. **********Nicknames From the Past **********Grown men laughed and called each other Roly-Poly, Dinky and other old nicknames. Their wives looked forlorn and irrelevant, like their counterparts at reunions at Harvard or Yale. **********At a meeting of the ''old boys'' in a school amphitheater, there were also familiar demands that the school give greater preference for admissions to the sons of alumni. Politely but firmly, Mr. Ramchandani, the headmaster, said no. **********Then an older alumnus rose and proposed that the graduates get together and come up with ''a Doon School plan for the nation'' to help their classmate and Prime Minister. The place erupted with jeers, boos and laughter. **********But there was also a dramatic moment for Izzat Rai Dewan, a 58-year-old tobacco company executive who in 1947, a few years after his graduation, was captured in Kashmir when war erupted with Pakistan. **********Stripped of his clothes and shivering in his undershorts, Mr. Dewan was convinced that he and his brother and father were going to be executed by Pakistani soldiers. Then a Pakistani Army major, Barekara Mali Khan, recognized him as a Doon School chum and freed them all. **********Under a spreading neem tree in the pale afternoon sunshine, the two men were reunited here for the first time in 38 years. They hugged each other in a long silent embrace.

Alexander's Inc., for one, assigned several hundred executives and clerical workers from the finance, accounting and personnel departments to work the cash registers to cut down long lines of customers waiting to pay for purchases. Higbee's clothed its junior managers in red, and made them wear name badges, to assist confused or harried customers. Hess's asked its merchandise managers and buyers to work the selling floors on Saturdays and evenings. And Bloomingdale's put extra staff people on the wrapping and pickup counters. **********Many stores are trying desperately to make a name for themselves as offering personal service, despite the crush of as many as 250,000 Christmas shoppers a day for some big retailers. For example, Marshall Field, in its giant State Street store in Chicago, has set up ''Field Service,'' a ''concierge'' effort with appropriately uniformed personnel who provide information on both what is in the store and in the catalogue, advise customers on where to go and even telephone ahead to prepare the way for customers who know what they want.

In addition, problem loans either increased or remained at high levels. **********Chase **********Chase reported second-quarter net income of $131 million, up 45.6 percent from $90 million in the comparable period of 1984. On a per-share basis, net income rose to $2.88 from $2.21. **********Year-to-year comparisons were affected by the acquisitions last year of the Lincoln First Bank in upstate New York and the Nederlandse Credietbank of the Netherlands, whose earnings were not fully reflected in the second quarter of 1984. Chase said these acquisitions contributed $10 million to the latest quarter's net income. **********Net interest income rose to $722 million, from $582 million in last year's second quarter, partly as the result of a $4.5 billion increase in interest-earning assets and a wider profit margin between the average interest rate Chase paid for its funds and the average return on its loans and investments. This net interest spread widened to 3.93 percent from 3.38 percent. **********The provision for loan losses rose to $105 million, from $75 million in last  year's quarter, while actual net loan write-offs increased to $69 million from $54 million. Included in the loan-loss provision was a special allocation to offset $13 million of interest received in interest payments on loans to Argentina. Problem loans rose to $2.4 billion, or 3.96 percent of total loans, from $2.2 million, or 3.5 percent. **********Foreign exchange trading income rose to $43 million in the latest quarter from $28 million in the comparable period of 1984, and bond-trading profits totaled $22 million, reversing a $1 million loss.

On a per-share basis, net income rose to $1.75 from $1.16. **********Net interest earnings rose to $421.2 million from $359.5 million. An allocation of $18.6 million in interest income received from Argentina was placed in a special reserve and was not included in the company's income. The after-tax effect would have been $9.5 million. Average interest-earning assets rose to $58.2 billion, from $53.1 billion, and the net interest spread widened to 2.91 percent from 2.72 percent. **********The provision for loan losses doubled to $90 million, from $45 million. In addition, Morgan said it sold $70 million in problem loans at a loss of $35 million before taxes, or $17.3 million after tax. Net write-offs amounted to $26 million, up from $12 million in the second quarter of 1985. **********Problem loans rose to $1.02 billion, from $875 million at the end of June 1984. The bank said loans to Argentina's public sector were primarily responsible for the increase in problem loans. **********Foreign-exchange trading profits soared to $45.6 million in the latest quarter, compared with a $12.9 million loss in the second quarter of 1984. Bond-trading income rose to $31.5 million from $3.5 million. **********Gains from the sale of investment securities totaled $24.5 million, compared  with a $1.8 million loss in the second quarter of 1984. Morgan's net income was  also bolstered by a special adjustment of $12.9 million as the result of changes in New York State tax laws. The banking company said similar adjustments will increase third-quarter net income by $40 million. **********Continental **********The Continental Illinois Corporation, which was reorganized last fall after being rescued from failure by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, reported second-quarter net income of $37.3 million. Because of the restructuring, the latest results were not comparable with those of last year's  second quarter. They were down slightly from net income of $39.3 million in the  first quarter. **********The company also reported that its dependence for funding on the Federal Reserve System and on a group of large banks had declined in the latest quarter. Its borrowings from the Fed averaged $481 million in the second quarter, down from $965 million in the first, and its average borrowings from the group of commercial banks dropped to $3.1 billion, from $4 billion.

He slso said he had asked for a face-to-face meeting with ''those who have responsibility for the hostages.'' **********First Appearance Since Arrival **********Mr. Waite was driven by four Lebanese militiamen to a west Beirut hotel shortly after he arrived at Beirut Airport Wednesday. He was not seen again until he entered the Commodore Hotel today. Members of his escort were described as officials of the mainstream Shiite movement, Amal. **********Last month, Islamic Holy War said it had ''executed'' one of the hostages, and identified him as William Buckley, the political officer at the American Embassy here. **********A sixth American, Peter Kilburn, who has been missing since December 1984, has not been mentioned in statements by the kidnappers in several months. He is the librarian at the American University. **********Mr. Waite said he would, if given the chance, attempt to gain freedom for four Frenchmen and one Briton also held hostage. **********The case of the Briton, Alec Collett, a writer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, was raised today by Jean-Claude Aime, a United Nations envoy, with Prime Minister Rashid Karami. **********Mr. Aime said he urged Mr. Karami to press the authorities here to do their utmost to locate and free Mr. Collett, who is believed to be held by a group called the Organization of Socialist Moslems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/17/world/hostage-s-body-clearly-identified-with-signs-of-2-gunshot-wounds.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1985-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1037, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOSTAGE'S BODY CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITH SIGNS OF 2 GUNSHOT WOUNDS", "print_headline": "HOSTAGE'S BODY CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITH SIGNS OF 2 GUNSHOT WOUNDS", "body_text": " **********The United States said today that a body found on the Syrian coast had been ''positively identified'' as that of Leon Klinghoffer of New York, a passenger on a hijacked Italian cruise ship. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Klinghoffer's body showed ''indications of two gunshot wounds, one in the head and the other in the back.'' **********This seemed to confirm earlier reports by passengers and crew of the ship, the Achille Lauro, that Mr. Klinghoffer, who had been in a wheelchair, had been shot twice by one of the gunmen and was then thrown overboard when the ship was off the Syrian port of Tartus on Oct. 8. **********Details on Slaying Provided **********In Jerusalem, Israeli military sources said that Mr. Klinghoffer had been shot by the youngest of the four gunmen, and that the hijackers then ordered a Portuguese waiter and the ship's barber to lift the body over the side along with the wheelchair. **********A United States Government official here said the finding of Mr. Klinghoffer's body ''should put an end to any debate on whether he was killed or not by the terrorists.'' **********The body was flown to Rome to aid Italian investigators in preparing the case against the four Arabs in Italian custody. Forensic evidence will also be used to build up the American case if extradition is requested, officials said. **********In Genoa, Italy, a Sicilian prosecutor said that he had ''reconstructed the killing of the American in all its details'' and that the four men would be charged with premeditated murder. [Page A12.]  The identification of the body came as the United States continued to complain about the failure of the Italian authorities to honor an American arrest warrant Saturday calling on them to hold Mohammed Abbas, accused of being the leader of the group that took part in the ship hijacking. **********The hijacking itself, an Administration official said, appears to have been ''a botched operation'' that occurred when the gunmen aboard the ship were discovered by a waiter while they were cleaning their weapons. **********Mr. Abbas as well as Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, have said that no one was killed by the hijackers and that Mr. Klinghoffer might have died of natural causes. **********Bernard Kalb, the State Department spokesman, said today, ''Gunshot wounds are not exactly natural causes.'' **********Autopsy Possible in Rome **********Mr. Speakes said an autopsy might be conducted on Mr. Klinghoffer's body in Rome as part of the criminal investigation of the four Arabs accused of taking part in the hijacking. The body will then be brought to the United States, Mr. Speakes said. **********He said the positive identification had been made in Damascus by Syrian physicians, who were aided by fingerprint and dental records of the 69-year old man. **********''Our consul in Damascus, an F.B.I. agent from Washington and a Syrian pathologist retained by the embassy witnessed the examination and identification by a Syrian medical team,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''The cause of death cannot be determined without an autopsy, but the body did show indications of two apparent gunshot wounds, one in the head, and the other in the back.'' **********He said American pathologists had gone to Rome to assist in the examination and would ''also be there to gather evidence in connection with the U.S. Government charges against the hijackers.'' **********The decision by Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy to allow Mr. Abbas and another Palestinian official to leave Saturday for Yugoslavia infuriated the United States. The decision caused a split in the Italian Government, with Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini today withdrawing his Republican Party from the coalition led by Mr. Craxi, a Socialist. **********Privately, American officials said they hoped Mr. Craxi was embarrassed by the affair. Nevertheless, Mr. Speakes said, the Italian Prime Minister is still invited to join President Reagan and other leaders at a meeting in New York next week in connection with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations. President Francois Mitterrand of France has declined to attend. **********Timing of Warrant **********The United States went to some lengths today to rebut reports from Rome suggesting that the Italian Government had allowed Mr. Abbas to leave because it had not been given information in time by the Americans. **********''Our provisional request for the provisional arrest of Abbas was delivered to Rome many hours before he left,'' Mr. Speakes said. The request, in the form of a diplomatic note, was delivered to a ranking official in the Justice Minister's office at 6 A.M. Saturday, Rome time, he said. Mr. Abbas left late in the afternoon. **********''Our request for a provisional arrest was accompanied by a substantial body of evidence and we told the Italians that corroborating information was being provided on an on-going basis,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********He said that if the Italian authorities ''had concerns regarding the sufficiency of our request, it was incumbent on them to tell us the nature of their concerns and to prevent Abbas's departure from their jurisdication long enough for us to respond to any concerns they may have had.'' **********There have been unconfirmed reports since Monday that Mr. Abbas was allowed to leave Yugoslavia for Southern Yemen, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States. Mr. Speakes and Mr. Kalb said they did not know where Mr. Abbas was. ----Slaying Tied to Youngest Gunman JERUSALEM, Oct. 16 - Israeli military sources said today that, according to their intelligence, the hijackers designated their youngest member to shoot Leon Klinghoffer. **********After the shooting, the sources said, the gunman pointed his weapon at a Portuguese waiter and ordered him to throw Mr. Klinghoffer's body overboard. The waiter, however, could not lift him, the sources said. **********The hijackers then ordered the ship's barber to help, and between the two of them they managed to get the body over the side, along with the wheelchair. Then, according to the Israeli sources, the hijacker ordered the two men to clean up the blood on the deck and to change and wash their uniforms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/31/business/article-017924-no-title.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1985-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1263, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 017924 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 017924 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********The price of basic telephone service for residences and businesses with one line will rise by $1 a month across America tomorrow. The increase is part of a Government effort to have households and smaller companies pay more of the cost of the telephone system. **********The new per-line fee will affect close to 90 million households, just under 6 million in New York, as well as roughly 5.7 million small businesses. In terms of total dollars, the new charge means that Americans will pay just over $1 billion a year more to receive basic telephone service, according to industry statistics. **********That is a relatively minor sum for an industry in which total revenues already exceed $100 billion a year. But the new fee is an example, industry experts say, of the Government's determination to deregulate telecommunications by permitting prices to move closer to costs. **********Until now, supporters of the new charge say, households have paid less than the full cost of providing local service, and it is only by allowing phone rates to more accurately reflect costs that companies in the industry can prosper and innovation in communications can flourish. **********The new charge is formally known as a subscriber line charge. It is not the same as the access charge, which long-distance companies pay to local companies to connect to customers. **********'Only the Beginning' **********''This $1-a-month charge is only the beginning of what is likely to come,'' said Ronald L. Wyden, a House Democrat from Oregon active in telephone issues. ''Clearly, the competitive model and marketplace ideals have become embedded solidly in communications.'' **********In a sense, industry experts say, the introduction of the $1 charge marks a watershed in public policy. Ever since the Depression, they say, it was believed to be in the public interest to have inexpensive phone service. The Communications Act of 1934 proclaimed universal telephone service - a phone in every home - as a worthwhile national objective. **********Yet local service is not the only aspect of phone service that is going up in price. Other areas are experiencing even bigger increases, all reflecting a widening belief that artificially inexpensive phone service may no longer be appropriate now that almost all households have phones. **********Shift in Costs **********Companies, for example, that used to pay $2,000 to $3,000 a month to have ''800'' numbers so that customers could call them toll-free are now paying many times that. Directory assistance, which used to be free, now costs as much as 50 cents a call for out-of-state inquiries. And the fact that some consumers now get as many as three telephone bills - one for renting a telephone, another for local service and a third for long distance - illustrates an industry attempt to provide a more precise accounting of the cost of specific services and to charge accordingly. **********''The basic economic principle is to move to cost-based pricing,'' said Fred K. Konrad, a specialist in pricing and regulation for the Illinois Bell Telephone Company. ''What we're talking about is adjusting rates for all customers for different services.'' **********It is not clear exactly how the new $1-a-month charge will affect phone bills over all. According to a plan worked out by the Federal Communications Commission, which ordered the subscriber charge in a ruling last December, the fee will be paid to local phone companies to help them recoup, from phone users, more of the cost of local lines. If the F.C.C.'s plan works as hoped, the local companies will then lower the fees they charge long-distance companies for customer connections, and long-distance companies, in turn, will lower rates they charge customers to make calls. **********The effect of all the transactions is that local customers will be paying more of local-service costs, and long-distance rates will more accurately reflect their costs. With long-distance rates down, many households could end up with lower total bills. **********Lower Rates **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in fact, has already said it would lower rates by 5.6 percent once the $1 charge takes effect, or by $1 billion a year. The MCI Communications Corporation said yesterday that it will lower rates July 1 by up to 11 percent. A spokesman for Sprint, the long-distance unit of the GTE Corporation, said a rate cut was likely. **********''We think most people will be better off,'' said Mark S. Fowler, the chairman of the F.C.C., who has been a strong advocate of the new charges. ''People who make an average number of long-distance calls - five or six - will end up ahead. Our studies show that's most people.'' **********Others are skeptical. However small, they say, the $1 fee could force thousands of lower-income families to give up their telephones, notwithstanding the partial or full waiver being offered in some states to people unable to pay. Businesses with more than one telephone line began paying subscriber line charges of as much as $6 a month last June, fees that critics say are causing hardship among smaller companies. **********''The theory has been that your long-distance bill would go down, say, $4 a month, your local bill would go up $2, and you'd end up $2 ahead,'' Representative Wyden said. ''Instead, what we're seeing is that two-thirds of small businesses say their phone bills have gone up since the breakup of the Bell System.'' **********Indeed, residential rates were rising even before the $1 charge was ordered. According to a study by the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington-based consumer group, residential phone rates rose by an average of 20 percent, or $2.5 billion, in 1984, the first year following the breakup. Since then, the group says, local phone companies in 15 states have requested rate increases and more requests are expected. **********Support for Charge **********However steep, the increases, including the line charge scheduled to take effect tomorrow, are necessary, supporters of the changes say, and not just to keep the phone companies healthy. They argue that unless the claimed ''subsidy'' to local service is eliminated, large corporate users will build their own telephone networks, since they use long-distance most heavily. Such ''bypass'' would leave remaining users having to pay more than ever, the supporters say. **********''I like to use the scenario 'Pay me now, or pay me later,' '' said Patrick A. Garzillo, a pricing specialist at the New York Telephone Company. ''If we don't put this plan into effect, the burden on consumers will definitely be worse later on.'' **********Even on that point there is disagreement. The belief that big companies have subsidized households -and that it is both fair and necessary to ask households to pay more for basic service - is virtual gospel among telephone industry executives. Yet critics say no one has ever proved that a subsidy exists and that the threat of bypass is real. And even those who believe that long-distance subsidizes local service say it does not make sense, given differing costs of providing local service, to impose the same $1 line charge nationwide to try to remedy the problem. **********''I, frankly, am puzzled, and I have never heard a defensible argument about why it should be done that way,'' said Carl Oppedahl, a New York attorney who has studied the matter. He continued, ''The right way to proceed is not to impose a uniform $1 access charge but to ask the question 'Is the local telephone company getting a fair return on its investment?' Then you have state regulatory agencies set rates accordingly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/28/world/move-troy-to-dalmatia-who-says-a-mexican.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1985-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 794, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOVE TROY?

A MEXICAN?", "body_text": " **********None of the evidence is in yet, but the people of this sleepy village about 15 miles inland from the Dalmatian coast have begun to act as though they are sitting on the cradle of Western civilization. A steady flow of tourists from many countries strengthens them in their belief. **********It all began last summer, when news reached here from Mexico that a private scholar had published a theory that ancient Troy was not where Heinrich Schliemann excavated it more than a century ago in Asia Minor, on the western coast of Turkey, but in Dalmatia. The Mexican, Roberto Salinas Price, said his reading of Homer's ''Iliad'' left room for no other conclusion but that Gabela had been Troy, he said. **********Because the ''Iliad'' is the wellspring of Greek history and that, in turn, the bedrock of classical culture, Mr. Salinas Price's displacement of Troy's site from Asia Minor to Dalmatia would make modern Yugoslavia the fountainhead of Western civilization. The Yugoslav press seized on the theory with ardor. Unsurprisingly, the Greek press has paid no attention to the theory. **********Mr. Salinas Price published his book in English at Scylax Press in San Antonio. When a correspondent of Tanyug, the Yugoslav news agency, sent a dispatch, the agency was so inundated with requests for special articles from all over Yugoslavia that it took the unusual step of publishing in hard covers both the original book and a Serbo-Croatian translation. They are selling well at about $7 a copy. **********A Lifelong Passion **********Mr. Salinas Price, for whom Homer is said to be a lifelong passion, based his theory on what he considers geographical and astronomical anomalies in the ''Iliad'' that preclude an Asia Minor Troy. After years of research, which first brought him to Yugoslavia in 1967, he concluded that Gabela was the only possible Troy. **********The Mexican theorized that the explanation of the millennia-old geographical error was political. In the 7th century B.C., Mr. Salinas Price suggests, Greeks cleverly transferred all the place names in the ''Iliad'' to territories that were then Greek. **********Yugoslav archeologists gave the theory short shrift, proclaiming to a man and woman that no archeological evidence has ever been unearthed to buttress the Mexican's thesis. **********''We don't care what the archeologists say,'' said Dragan Bradvica of the Gabela Tourist Association, which was quickly formed and gave the unemployed Mr. Bradvica a paying job. ''We are very enthusiastic here and are ready to dig on our own.'' **********The First Tourists Arrive **********As soon as the first tourists showed up last summer, the farmers of Gabela knew they had a good thing going. Inspiring local youths with visions of tourist bounty, they set them to clearing one of the village's three hills, which is crowned by remnants of Roman, Venetian, Turkish and Bosnian fortifications and shrines. About 100 boys and girls gave up their spare time for weeks to make accessible a badly overgrown wasteland. **********The Tourist Association does not actually pretend that the site is the Troy of old, but it does nothing to discourage that idea, either. A visitor's book full of enthusiastic comments along the lines of one man's ''We believe!!!'' indicates that the thought has taken hold. At the moment, the association occupies only the apartment at the back of the schoolhouse that until recently was occupied by the teacher. But before the next tourist season starts, the whole school will be moved to make way for what is hoped to be the beginning of Troy-Gabela's golden age. **********Already, the enterprising private sector of this Communist country has produced an ample range of souvenir articles - Troy ceramics, maps, car stickers, sun visors, model ships and little lions of Troy. The ruins of an Ottoman mosque have been turned into a mini-amphitheatre, where classical Greek and modern Yugoslav folklore performances will entertain next summer's tourists. **********A Triumphant Visit **********It was inaugurated on the new Troy's greatest day so far - a triumphant visit by Mr. Salinas Price in September. Three television crews and 60 or 70 reporters and photographers came to cover the event, Mr. Bradvica recalled. The Mexican was received by an applauding village, which has 2,300 inhabitants, and hundreds of outsiders. **********''People wanted to thank him for bringing back fame to Gabela,'' the novice tourist official said, emphasizing ''back.'' After the welcoming ceremony of bread and salt and a traditional regional dance luckily but inexplicably called the Trojan, the father of the village's fame was taken to see a Euripides drama set in Troy. **********Moved by enthusiasm and clearly aware of his responsibility, the scholar said, according to Mr. Bradvica, ''If they can prove I'm wrong, I'll commit suicide.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/29/world/weather-may-hamper-air-india-investigation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Weather May Hamper Air-India Investigation", "print_headline": "Weather May Hamper Air-India Investigation", "body_text": " **********Investigators trying to find out why an Air-India jumbo jet plunged into the Atlantic are hurrying to gather wreckage from the ocean floor before wintry weather makes recovery operations impossible. **********An inquest began Sept. 17 in Cork, Ireland, into the cause of death of 131 people whose bodies were recovered from the crash site. **********Testimony so far suggests that the victims' injuries do not point conclusively to a cause for the accident, which killed all 329 passengers and crew members. **********The plane was on its way from Montreal to London on June 23 when it disappeared from radar screens at Shannon, Ireland.

They do not have to look far these days for a cliffhanger that has been offering a fast swing for the money. It is the May cocoa futures contract, traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, which has swung between a contract high of $2,570 a metric ton and a contract low of $1,998 a metric ton. **********On Thursday (most commodity markets were closed Friday), the closing price was $2,321, down a mere $1 from $2,322 the previous day. On Wednesday, there had been a $33 decline. **********Deirdre Macleod, tropical products analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., last week called it ''a charming, capricious'' market. **********''The market had gone up almost 500 points in three weeks in terms of the May contract,'' she pointed out. This means a jump of $5,000 a contract, since each contract covers 10 metric tons. **********There is some speculation that a major dealer here, an affiliate of a London-based commodity firm, recently bought many of the May contracts, forcing prices sharply higher, to a premium above prices in European markets. **********The result has been a rush by foreign groups to ship cocoa here for the favorable prices. Also, foreign sellers have wanted to take advantage of the high value of the dollar in relation to other currencies. **********If the dealer with the dominant position in the market does not take delivery, though, there could be a major selloff, Miss Macleod said. **********Dennis C. Koutras, vice president and director of commodity research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., thinks that some of the recent volatility comes from ''nearby tightness'' as a result of West African shipping delays, and that there will be an orderly liquidation of the May delivery. **********''The market is sensitive on the upside now and has limited potential,'' Mr. Koutras said. It could move in a range of $2,050 to 2,450 a metric ton, he said, adding that the May contract price ''has started to decline.'' **********The first delivery notice day for the contract is scheduled for April 17, and the contract expires in mid-May. **********Both Mr. Koutras and Miss Macleod said that once the well-squeezed May contract expired, prices definitely would head downward. Miss Macleod is forecasting a possible bear market in the late summer as the new crop year approaches. **********In recent years, the cocoa market has fallen out of step with some of the leading candy makers, such as Hershey Foods. **********Miss Macleod pointed out that cocoa importers and dealers tend to be sellers in the market against their actual purchases of cocoa, while the chocolate manufacturers often buy contracts to lock in prices. **********But in recent years there has been a third player of sorts - money managers attracted by the speculative aspect of the market. Using computer analysis for fast research, they trade actively, probably helping to exaggerate the price swings. **********But a more fundamental reason for the volatility is a lack of accurate statistics, Miss Macleod noted, especially on crop figures for Ghana and Nigeria. Cocoa smuggling in Africa also makes it difficult to appraise the movement of the product, Mr. Koutras said. **********Like many other commodity markets, politics and weather can bring swift and severe changes for those dealing in cocoa. Fifteen years ago Ghana was by far the world's largest cocoa producer, followed by Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Brazil. Now the Ivory Coast, relatively free of political turmoil, is by far the world's largest producer, followed by Brazil. Ghana and Nigeria lag well behind in third and fourth place. **********Droughts in the past three years have hurt cocoa crops in West Africa and Brazil, resulting in a shortage on the world market for those years. But that situation is beginning to reverse itself now, and the current crop year has produced a surplus. **********''We believe that net production during the 1984- 85 crop year will total 1,757,000 metric tons, or about 17 percent above a year ago,'' Mr. Koutras said. Out of this total, cocoa users will grind about 1.7 million tons of the cocoa beans for use in chocolate and other products, so the surplus will amount to about 52,000 tons. Added to what was left over last year, the stocks will be about 426,000 tons when the new crop year starts in the fall. **********Attempts by the International Cocoa Organization, which links producing and importing nations, to flatten the swings in the market and support prices have largely failed. The group tries to control the market by use of a buffer stock. But the absence of several leading nations, including the United States, a major consumer, and the Ivory Coast, the largest producer, has made the effort largely futile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/15/world/passengers-tell-of-fear-in-the-air.html": {"writer_name": "Margaret Rogg", "pub_date": "1985-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 933, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PASSENGERS TELL OF FEAR IN THE AIR", "print_headline": "PASSENGERS TELL OF FEAR IN THE AIR", "body_text": " **********''First thing we noticed were these people shouting and running and that's when we knew we were being hijacked,'' said Irma Garza, one of 19 people who arrived here from Beirut today after being released from a hijacked Trans World Airlines flight. **********''They told us to put our hands up on the backs of our heads and put our heads down - we were that way all the way to Beirut,'' said Mrs. Garza, a Mexican national who lives in Laredo, Tex. **********Mrs. Garza spoke at an impromptu news conference at the airport with her daughter, Irma Trautmann, an American citizen who also lives in Laredo, and Mrs. Trautmann's two young daughters, Katherine and Susan.

We don't know what happened in the first-class section after that.'' **********Another passenger who was released, Lou Peel, 58 years old, also said she saw little of what happened after the plane was hijacked because her head was down. **********Mrs. Peel said she owned a wholesale beauty supply business with her husband, Robert, in Hutchison, Kan. She said she and her husband and their son B.J., 33, and his wife, Kristi, also 33, had spent the last eight days touring the Greek islands aboard the yacht of a beauty-supply manufacturer. The Peel family boarded the T.W.A. flight in Athens by chance, she said, when the direct flight they were scheduled to take back to the United States was canceled. **********''We couldn't sit together because there weren't enough seats,'' Mrs. Peel said tonight. ''We were scattered all over the economy section.'' **********A Reassuring Hand **********''The last I saw of my husband was when we boarded the plane,'' she recalled. ''Then just after we took off, the stewardess came on and said the plane had been hijacked. She was wonderful, calm. Even though she was tense, she made her voice strong.'' **********When the plane arrived in Beirut ''I didn't know where it was landing,'' she said. ''I was the next to last one called.

Weinberger laid plans to intercept an Egyptian airliner last week over an open radio line that would have been audible to ham radio operators over a wide area, Pentagon and White House officials said today. **********A White House official said the two men decided not to use a coded communications line because ''time was of the essence'' and their separate coding machines were not compatible without time-consuming adjustments. **********What was apparently a security lapse became known after the brother of an amateur radio operator in Chicago called CBS News in New York to say his brother had overheard the conversation. **********'Whatever It Takes' **********In a telephone interview today, the brother said the amateur radio operator had listened in on an open shortwave channel as Mr. Reagan ordered that Navy F-14 fighter pilots force down the civilian airliner carrying four hijackers of an Italian cruise ship. **********''Weinberger made the comment that it may take shots across the bow,'' the ham operator's brother said. ''The President said, in essence, I don't care what it takes, I want that plane brought down in friendly territory.'' **********No shots were reportedly fired as the bevy of F-14's surrounded the Egyptian airliner over the Mediterranean and escorted it to the NATO air base at Sigonella, Sicily. **********The ham operator's brother spoke today on the condition that he not be identified, and that no effort be made to contact the radio buff. **********The brother said the radio operator told him that Mr. Weinberger seemed to argue against the move, saying the Egyptians would be angry. **********A White House official said today that he did not know the exact time of the unsecured phone call and could not confirm that it was the one giving the order for the Navy interception. **********Refuses to Be Interviewed **********CBS News editors said the timing of the call they received from the ham operator's brother, hours before the successful interception was publicly disclosed Thursday night, gave the story credibility. They said they chose not to report the story immediately because the ham operator himself refused to be interviewed or to supply a recording of the overheard conversation to verify the account. **********Newsweek magazine heard the story from a Pentagon official and reported it today. **********The brother said he was later scolded by the ham operator for calling CBS News about the story. The operator, reportedly an invalid who spends much of the day attending to a roomful of radio equipment, apparently feared the White House would change the radio frequencies it uses on Air Force One and deprive him of a favorite form of entertainment. **********The brother said the White House juggled its radio frequencies in 1982 after a ham operator divulged to Jack Anderson, a syndicated columnist, a diplomatically embarrassing conversation between President Reagan and Alexander M. Haig Jr., then the Secretary of State, about the war in the Falkland Islands. **********Audible Anywhere in Country **********Dale Clift, executive associate of the American Radio Relay League, the leading ham operators' association, said today that a conversation between two airplanes would be audible to radio enthusiasts ''anywhere in the country'' if they were tuned to the right frequency. ''It's pretty dumb to do something like that on an unsecured channel,'' he said. **********Mr. Clift said one reason the radio amateur might have been upset about being discovered is that divulging overheard interstate conversations violates Federal communications laws. **********According to Pentagon and White House officials, Mr. Reagan gave the go-ahead for the Navy operation at about 4:15 last Thursday afternoon. **********The President was aboard Air Force One, returning from a speech in Illinois, and Mr. Weinberger was in a military plane en route from a meeting in Ottawa to his vacation home in Bar Harbor, Me. **********'Call the Russian Embassy' **********The brother said today that the radio operator called him at about 4:50 P.M. Thursday afternoon to relate what he had overheard about 20 minutes earlier. A CBS editor confirmed receiving a call from the brother shortly before 5 P.M. The first public reports of the interception, carried by Italian television and wire services in Italy, reached Washington nearly three hours later. **********When CBS asked him how his information could be verified, the brother said today: ''I told them to call the Russian Embassy. I'm sure they heard it, too.'' **********''One strange thing was,'' the brother said, ''when the President got ahold of Weinberger, he started talking as if Weinberger had known about this for a long time. Weinberger said, 'I only found out about it 15 minutes ago.' '' **********Pentagon officials have said Mr. Weinberger was involved in studying the possible interception from late Thursday morning. **********'Time Was of the Essence' **********A White House official denied a report in Newsweek that the two men used an open channel because the Air Force One scrambler was not working. **********''They were on two different planes with two different cryptographic systems,'' the official said. ''They could have been patched through another cryptographic system, but time was of the essence and they decided to go nonsecure. They felt the information was not sensitive enough that they needed a secure call.'' **********Pentagon officials also confirmed today that Mr. Weinberger had warned the President of an angry Egyptian reaction. They said he made that analysis in the course of laying out the risks of the operation, not because he opposed it. **********''Weinberger was totally on board as soon as the President made his decision,'' an official said. Two senior Pentagon officials said they believed Mr. Weinberger made no recommendation on the Navy mission, either favoring or opposing it. **********One official involved in the Pentagon deliberations last week said of Mr. Weinberger: ''My understanding is, he called the President and laid out the pros and cons. He said the military had advised the operation could be done, and that it would be a blow against terrorism. But he said if we could keep the terrorists in Egypt and get custody there, then we wouldn't have a diplomatic problem on our hands.'' **********The official said Mr. Weinberger also warned that ''there's always a question of what you're going to have to do if they resist.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/06/business/patents-controlling-a-craft-on-autopilot.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-07-06", "snippet": "AN invention that enables a pilot to control a helicopter or other aircraft whose flight is being regulated by a mechanical autopilot was patented this week for the Rockwell International Corporation of El Segundo, Calif.", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;\n\nControlling A Craft on Autopilot", "print_headline": "Patents;\n\nControlling A Craft on Autopilot", "body_text": " **********AN invention that enables a pilot to control a helicopter or other aircraft whose flight is being regulated by a mechanical autopilot was patented this week for the Rockwell International Corporation of El Segundo, Calif. **********The pilot gives commands by movement of pedals or an actuator. **********Patent No. 4,527,242 was granted to Kenneth W.

While this concern is warranted, it has also diverted attention from what we may someday regard as the greatest occupational hazard of all: the modern office building. **********Yet, we resist stubbornly the idea that offices can be dangerous places, perhaps assuming that the newest, sleekest buildings in the world are also the safest and healthiest. Thus, examples abound of white-collar workers complaining for months of headaches, nausea, sleepiness or breathing difficulties before the air is tested and found to be contaminated by toxic substances like carbon monoxide or formaldehyde. **********But contaminated air is only one among a wide variety of environmental and behavioral white-collar health risks. Among the environmental influences are noise, inadequate lighting, airborne toxic and infectious agents and exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (produced primarily by microwave, radio and television transmitters). Behavioral factors include stress, time pressures, deadlines, workaholic tendencies and job insecurity. **********Noise pollution, the most common white-collar health hazard, often goes unrecognized in offices, even though health studies have demonstrated repeatedly that noise is the single most important factor in office productivity. More than 20 million workers are exposed to ''hazardous'' noise every year, the majority of them in the white-collar environment. **********Hazardous noise is a function of the volume of sound over a period of time. At 70 decibels, a sound level found typically around typewriter pools or in company cafeterias, employees become irritable, distracted and show symptoms of hypertension over an eight-hour period, with increasing risk over time. Prolonged exposure to noise levels above 75 decibels, the maximum for eight hours set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, can cause gradual hearing loss. **********With the widespread adoption of energy-efficient building ventilation systems and tightly sealed office buildings, the incidence of health problems related to office air has risen dramatically. While the new systems save money (by recycling a fixed volume of inside air) they also can produce dangerous buildups in toxic substances and bacteria. **********The toxic agents commonly found in air samples in such buildings include vinyl chloride, asbestos, formaldehyde, toluene, ammonia, nitropyrenes, PCB's, radon, cadmium and a host of other toxic agents. Exposure to some of the more common airborne bacteria can cause Legionellosis, a hypersensitivity pseumonitis dubbed ''humidifier lung'' and a condition known as ''Monday miseries,'' in which flu-like symptoms often follow a weekend in open air. **********If this isn't enough, exhaust fumes from lower floor garages and loading docks can also enter the building's air system. In many office buildings, afternoon levels of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and other nasal and mucous irritants can be 10 to 20 times greater than E.P.A. standards. **********The growing presence of electronic equipment, especially VDT computer terminals, provides a clear instance of the difficulties of assessing the health hazards of a relatively new technology. According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the level of non-ionizing, electromagnetic radiation emitted by VDT's is within accepted levels of safety. However, this ignores the competing view that there really is no absolutely safe level of exposure to any radiation - not to microwaves, sunlight, fluorescent lighting, televisions, video games or VDT's. AMONG high-exposure occupational groups, such as employees of utilities, airlines, financial and news organizations, radio operators, electrical engineers and electronic technicians, there are higher-than-predicted cases of aplastic anemia, leukemia and certain other cancers. N.I.O.S.H., for example, has identified clusters of pregnancy complications and miscarriages at Sears, Roebuck & Company in Dallas and at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Both companies make extensive use of electronic equipment at these facilities. In neither case, however, has a direct cause and effect relationship been established. **********Compounding the radiation issue, the most unequivocal hazards of prolonged VDT use are in the musculoskeletal problems of tension headaches, swollen legs and lower back pain. These problems are more severe with VDT's than with typewriters or other mechanical equipment because VDT users so often sit in a fixed position for long periods. They have fewer reasons to move than, say typists, because everything they need is right in the computer. Bad posture is harmful any time, but especially when it is prolonged and fixed. **********Stress is the major health concern of white-collar workers and looms four times larger than the next category, hypertension, according to my recent research. Data from Johns Hopkins University indicates that every 1 percent increase in national unemployment is associated with an additional 36,887 deaths, 20,440 from heart disease. There is an attendant increase in alcoholism, crime, family violence, psychological disorders and hospital admissions. **********Regrettably, many management practices tend to accentuate stress. All too often, the predominant corporate culture extols the virtues of time pressure, unrealistic deadlines and aggressive competition, operates with unclear objectives and strategies and uses thinly veiled threats of dismissal or lack of advancement to spur productivity. Such policies and strategies can create an atmosphere of stagnation and fear. **********Responsibility for improving the white-collar work environment rests primarily with employers. While most employers would not knowingly expose employees to hazardous elements, many do precisely that because they are unaware of the potential dangers. Thus, they should test air quality regularly and identify sources of excessive noise. **********They should inform workers -especially pregnant women - fully and immediately of any health threats or risks, and they should support more research in ways to detect and eliminate office-health dangers. As the major buyers of heating and air-conditioning systems, employers need to put pressure on manufacturers to incorporate health-protecting features in the machinery. Finally, employers need to recognize that excessive competition and stress can hamper productivity. **********Beyond that, all interested parties - workers, building engineers and architects as well as employers and manufacturers - need to understand that today's gleaming, high-tech office buildings are more often Pandora's boxes of health hazards than refuges from a dirty environment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/world/around-the-world-us-would-sell-china-a-munitions-factory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. Would Sell China A Munitions Factory", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   U.S. Would Sell China A Munitions Factory", "body_text": " **********The Pentagon today notified Congress that it has offered to sell China plans and equipment for a munitions factory in what would be the first Government-to-Government arms sale between the two nations. **********Unless Congress intervenes within 30 days, the Pentagon would offer the Chinese plans and technical help in building a factory for 155-millimeter artillery shells, with an option to buy the actual manufacturing equipment, said Lieut.

A desire to encourage a drop in the value of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets has often been cited by Fed officials and other economists as one reason why lower interest rates were desirable. **********Possible Effect of a Shift **********Analysts at Money Market Services, a Belmont, Calif., economic analysis firm, said if the new intervention policy helps bring about a gradual decline in the value of the dollar, it ''means that Fed policy will not remain hostage to international developments.''

But he says: ''I've spent a career examining their weaknesses, and you're not going to find any major ones.'' **********Mr. Harris, whose company is a leading foreign cosmetics concern in Japan, gives Shiseido top grades in marketing, production, quality and management, all of which have helped to push the company to the top here. Last year, Shiseido had sales of $1.5 billion. **********And now Shiseido, the third-largest cosmetics company in the world, after Avon and L'Oreal of France, has begun a more aggressive drive to sell its products outside Asia. **********Shiseido has been selling its line in the United States for 20 years. But in the early 1970's, when it tried to make its products in America using subcontractors, it was not happy with the raw materials used or the performance of employees. In the late 1970's, it tried again unsuccessfully. **********The latest effort, though, Shiseido says, is resulting in brisk sales in the United States, which it estimates at $63 million annually. **********Growth Slowing **********Shiseido's renewed efforts abroad come at a time of slower growth and increased competition at home. The company recorded lower growth rates than many of its Japanese and foreign rivals last year, as it had in 1981 and 1982. The only recent year in which its growth exceeded that of the industry as a whole was 1983. **********Shiseido is selling to a market that analysts describe as mature. And while its domestic leadership remains secure, Shiseido has ceded the top share of department-store sales to a much smaller American competitor, Clinique. **********In the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1984, Shiseido earned $62.4 million. Its sales grew 1.7 percent from 1983, below the 3.7 percent average growth of the industry as calculated by the Shukan Shogyo trade magazine, which polls 400 companies selling cosmetics in Japan, but higher than the 1.4 percent worldwide rate. **********Shiseido has not maintained its lead for about 30 years, however, by remaining complacent. The company spends about 6 percent of its sales on advertising - a figure considered low for Japanese companies but higher than American companies with operations here that do not have national networks. And it is trying to spur growth by revamping its retail outlets, developing new markets and diversifying its product lines, along with moving aggressively abroad. **********Low Sales Abroad **********Unlike L'Oreal of France, Shiseido's sales are almost entirely domestic. Overseas sales accounted for 9 percent of total revenues last year. But Yoshio Ohno, Shiseido's president, is trying to increase that with the focus on the United States. **********Shiseido products, under the brand names Moisture Mist and Shiseido Facial, are now shipped from Japan and distributed through 1,000 stores in the United States. But the company is hardly a household word in the United States. It declines to give exact figures, but says its American advertising budget is limited because it sells only through the 1,000 stores, said Iwao Hattori, a company spokesman. **********Mr. Ohno said Shiseido is now moving cautiously, after going through ''a lot of soul-searching.'' **********Among the first decisions made in the renewed overseas effort were to manufacture all products in Japan and to concentrate on the high end of the market. Thus Shiseido is advertising in such high-fashion magazines as Harper's Bazaar and Town and Country, and is selling its products through prestigious department stores, such as Bloomingdale's. **********'Have to Make a Name' **********Although Shiseido executives seem happy with current sales in the United States, analysts here believe that they may have to push harder to increase that presence. **********Chiyoko Tada of Jardine Fleming Securities, said, ''I think they will have to spend a lot more on advertising. When you enter a new market, you have to make a name. I don't think they've done that yet.'' **********Shiseido may be placing particular emphasis on its overseas sales because the Japanese market is growing so slowly. But Mr. Ohno said, ''I still believe there is potential.'' **********One of Mr. Ohno's approaches is to develop a market in Japan for fragrances, which the Japanese have traditionally shunned. Mr. Harris, however, said Max Factor had spent a lot of money unsuccessfully trying to promote fragrances in Japan. **********In the meantime, Shiseido is proposing that its more than 20,000 retail outlets, which account for the vast majority of its sales but which have been underperforming lately, renovate at their own cost to concentrate on specific consumers and markets. **********''The retail shops are losing attractiveness to our customers,'' Mr. Ohno said. **********One proposed type of store, called the Cosmetics House, will feature specialized skin-care and makeup products, include kitchen and interior-design products and emphasize personal service. Another type, called Your Shiseido, will aim at young married women and will include Shiseido food products. The company's Y & Y shops will be geared to teen-agers and include apparel and accessories. **********The remodeling, which Miss Tada described as ambitious and imaginative, also allows Shiseido to distribute growing lines of non-cosmetic items. Cosmetics accounted for 84 percent of sales last year and toiletries, 11 percent. In the last few years, Shiseido has opened health clubs, clothing boutiques and several restaurants, with food ranging from coffeehouse fare to nouvelle cuisine.

Along with ripped, faded bluejeans, bandannas and long hair, water beds were yet another way to make the statement: We're against convention. ''Really, the water bed is about the only symbol of that era that's lingered,'' said Jerry Long, director of sales and marketing at Wavecrest, a California-based waterbed manufacturer. **********Water beds have not only lingered - they have thrived. Over the last decade, water bed sales have increased by about 100,000 units each year. **********Last year, 3.4 million water beds were sold in the United States. When the prices of accessories -chemicals for the water, special linens and the like - are counted in, water beds represented a $2 billion industry in 1984, according to Facts Consolidated, a Los Angeles research firm. **********Conventional bedding manufacturers are jumping into the market, either through acquisitions or additions to existing product lines. In the last two years, the Ohio Mattress Manufacturing Company, a large manufacturer of conventional mattresses, has acquired Wavecrest and Monterey Manufacturing, as well as Wood Stuff, which makes waterbed frames. The three acquisitions are generating more than $60 million in annual sales for their new parent. **********Since 1978, Sears, Roebuck & Company has been selling water beds. Sears has begun a national magazine advertising campaign for its water beds, as well as a direct mail program and radio campaign. Simmons, meanwhile, added water beds to its line in 1979. **********Water beds, which normally sell from $500 to $900, come in many versions. They can be virtually motionless (for those who find the wave action of some waterbeds unpleasant) or full-motion. They can have temperature controls and, for queen- or king-size beds, dual controls. And they can be hardside - a water-filled mattress enclosed by a wood frame - or softside - a mattress with a water-filled cavity. **********Industry insiders say that the softsides (also called ''hybrid'' mattresses) are the fastest-growing segment of the water bed market. They are less prone to leakage than the hardsides. And they look more like conventional beds, and thus can be suited to headboards and other bed accessories. **********According to Facts Consolidated, softsides accounted for one of every eight water beds sold in 1984. Softside sales climbed to 408,000 in 1984 from 350,000 in 1983, a 16.5 percent increase. **********For most adults, water beds are an acquired taste. But the manufacturers are trying to get the next generation into the water bed habit as early as possible. According to Mr. Long, 75 percent of all stores that sell water beds offer a selection of water bed cribs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/28/world/israel-blaming-plo-issues-a-warning.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1985-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL, BLAMING P.L.O., ISSUES A WARNING", "print_headline": "ISRAEL, BLAMING P.L.O., ISSUES A WARNING", "body_text": " **********Although the Palestine Liberation Organization denied involvement in the attacks in Rome and Vienna, Israeli officials blamed the guerrilla group today and made it clear that Israel would respond at the appropriate time and place. **********''Israel is shocked and outraged by these two new acts of senseless terror against innocent civilians,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. **********''The terrorist attacks come against a background of declarations by the head of the P.L.O., and those Arab states that support this organization, that these terrorists will cease terrorist operations outside of Israel. Israel will continue its struggle against terrorism in every place and at any time it sees fit.'' **********Syrian Missiles in Lebanon **********Meanwhile, Israeli analysts said Israel's ability to retaliate for the attacks had been limited by Syria's decision to move mobile surface-to-air missiles into Lebanon. **********In the past, Israel has often retaliated for terrorist attacks abroad by bombing Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon, regarding these as convenient ''return addresses.'' **********To do so now, however, Israeli jets would have to penetrate the new curtain of surface-to-air missiles Syria has drawn over the Bekaa region in Lebanon, which could lead to an all-out war with Syria, the analysts said. **********Since Israel already destroyed the main P.L.O. compound in Tunisia last October, that too is no longer an option for retaliation. The analysts said new P.L.O. offices in Baghdad would not be easy to reach and were widely dispersed. This would seem to leave as the only option for retaliation a more surgical strike against specific individuals, the analysts said. **********A Political Statement **********To appreciate the full Israeli quandary, officials said, it must be understood that the Syrian decision to deploy the SAM-6 and SAM-8 mobile batteries a few miles inside Lebanon, for the second time in a month, was as much a political statement as a strategic military maneuver. **********It was apparently designed, Israeli officials say, to send Israel and the United States clear signals about Damascus's intentions to change some of the rules in the Middle East. **********To begin with, said Itamar Rabinovich, an authority on Syria at Tel Aviv University, the Syrians are apparently trying to establish a new relationship with Israel in Lebanon after the Israeli withdrawal. **********While Israel wants to hold onto all of its old perquisites in Lebanon, particularly its freedom to fly reconnaissance missions over the Syrian-controlled Bekaa, the Syrians want to reverse once and for all this free Israeli access to their neighboring client state. **********A Challenge to Israel **********''By sending the missiles back, the Syrians are signaling Israel that they intend to reassert their hegemony over all of Lebanon and its airspace and to test Israel's willingness to resist this new situation,'' Mr. Rabinovich said. **********The Syrians are also indicating that no one in the region should consider them prey to American influence, the Israeli analysts said. Israeli officials now recognize that not only did they provoke Damascus by shooting down two Syrian MIG's over Syrian territory Nov. 19, but they also compounded the situation by announcing two weeks later that thanks to American mediation Syria decided to remove the mobile batteries. **********''The Syrians do not like to be depicted as being subject to either American or Israeli pressure,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''We should have kept the whole matter secret.'' **********In addition, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria seems to be sending a signal to the Arab world, and particularly King Hussein of Jordan, who is to arrive in Damascus on Saturday for a state visit, that if the Arabs stand firm they can get what they want from Israel. **********''This move is very much directed at King Hussein,'' said Abba Eban, chairman of the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee of Parliament. ''What Assad is saying is that we are the bosses, we create the situations to which others react, we are the dynamic initiating party in the Middle East, and don't think you can start making peace without us.'' **********Options for Israel **********Given this Syrian approach, the analysts said Israel had a number of options. **********The first is to send Israeli aircraft to destroy the missile batteries, as Israel did in June 1982, when it destroyed 19 Syrian SAM launchers in one afternoon. **********But officials say this option has drawbacks. For the Israeli Air Force to destroy the Syrian mobile batteries requires it to use extremely sophisticated electronic countermeasures. **********In the past, these electronic countermeasures involved the use of decoy aircraft that prompted the Syrians to turn on their missile radar at the wrong time, or for too long a period, enabling Israeli aircraft to fire anti-radiation missiles down the radar beams. At the same time the Israelis used jamming devices to confuse the radar guidance of the Syrian missiles. **********Lessons of June 1982 **********Israeli officials have no doubt that the Syrians and their Soviet backers have learned the electronic lessons of the June 1982 debacle. Israel, it is assumed, has also learned the lessons that the Syrians have learned and devised the appropriate electronic counter-countermeasures. **********For Israel to use this sophisticated electronic intelligence in something less than an all-out confrontation would be a great waste, Israeli military sources said. Even more so if this technology were used to destroy mobile missile batteries, which, like a field of mushrooms, would immediately spring up anew. **********In addition, if Israel starts destroying Syrian SAM-6 and SAM-8 launchers in Lebanon, the Syrians are almost certain to respond by firing their new SAM-2 missiles located just across the border in their own territory. Israel would have to destroy those missiles as well, and that would be act of war against Syria proper. This could lead to an all-out confrontation, for which the Israeli public has not been prepared. **********''The Israeli public is in no mood for a full-scale war with Syria,'' said Moshe Maoz, an expert on Syria at Hebrew University. ''People here are still getting over Lebanon.'' **********Playing Into Assad's Hands **********Finally, for Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel to enter into a conflict with Syria now would be to play into Mr. Assad's hands, by disrupting whatever progress Israel has made in improving relations with Egypt and nurturing Jordan toward negotiations, Israeli analysts said. **********With all of these constraints in mind, however, if Israel simply allows the new situation created by Syria to take hold, it will be paying a heavy price in its own long-term deterrent power, Mr. Rabinovich said. **********Israeli leaders are now trying to negotiate between these equally bad options. They seem to have decided to avoid flights over the Bekaa for now and to try collect the same data in other ways, probably through pilotless drones. **********At the same time, they are quietly working through American mediators to persuade Damascus to pull back, while also warning the Syrians publicly and privately that if they fire at any Israeli planes Israel will have no choice but to react. **********''We do have an ability to act,'' Mr. Eban said, ''so that action might not be necesssry - provided the Syrians understand that.'' **********For now the weather over Lebanon is cloudy and rainy, and reconnaissance flights have been curtailed, military sources said. But eventually the weather will break, and the unstable situation on the ground in Lebanon or Palestinian attacks will demand that Israel resume its reconnaissance or air strikes, analysts said. **********Only then will it be clear which bad option Israel has chosen, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/25/business/vms-realty-to-buy-holiday-inn-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VMS Realty to Buy Holiday Inn Units", "print_headline": "VMS Realty to Buy Holiday Inn Units", "body_text": " **********The Holiday Corporation said today that it had agreed to sell as many as 28 hotels to VMS Realty Inc. of Chicago for more than $400 million. **********Holiday said that its subsidiary, Holiday Inns, would continue to operate the hotels under long-term management contracts.

A spokesman said an investigation had immediately begun into the incident, in which, according to witnesses, the child was shot at by three white policemen in a van as she was playing outside her parents' home. **********In Salt River, near Cape Town, a policeman was killed and two people were hurt at the funeral of a Moslem leader. Witnesses said that someone in the crowd of mourners pointed out a white security policeman and that the crowd advanced on him. The policeman reportedly opened fire before he was beaten to death. **********Among other incidents, the police said, students were forced out of their classes by a group of youths at a high school in the township of Daveyton and two classrooms were hit by gasoline bombs. In Clermont, outside Durban, a black man was set afire and killed by a crowd of black rioters Tuesday night, the police said. **********Government officials have been promising concessions surrounding the issue of black citizenship since last January, when President Botha said blacks living outside the country's tribal homelands would have a greater political voice. No legislation dealing with the issue was enacted in the previous session of Parliament, however, and unless a special session of Parliament is called, such laws cannot be put in place until Parliament reconvenes in January. **********'Dual Citizenship' **********''The South African Government is prepared to negotiate with these four governments about restoring the South African citizenship of members of the black communities residing within the borders of Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei, who lost that citizenship as a result of independence,'' Mr. Botha told members of his party in Orange Free State, a conservative area. **********''We propose that this be done on the basis of dual citizenship, which implies that these persons may have the option of accepting South African citizenship as a second citizenship in addition to their current citizenship of, for example, Transkei.'' **********Mr. Botha reiterated that blacks living outside the nominally independent tribal homelands - six of them have not been granted independence or have refused it - were South African citizens and would be ''accommodated by structures within South Africa, both for their own and for general affairs.'' **********He said the matter was at the top of the Government's political agenda. He also restated the Government's position that blacks living in those homelands that had not become independent were still citizens of South Africa. **********U.S. Envoy Seeks Meeting **********The United States Ambassador, Herman W.

''This leading indicator should be watched closely in the months ahead.'' **********On a brighter note, employment improved slightly, with 21 percent of the respondents reporting higher levels in March, compared with 16 percent in February. Vendor deliveries were about the same as last month - only 5 percent of respondents noted any kind of slowdown - and lead times for production materials remained virtually unchanged. **********And, for the fourth consecutive month, more purchasing managers reported price decreases than increases.

Yurchenko, once portrayed by the United States as a valuable Soviet defector, had hoped to live anonymously with a woman on the West Coast after he had been thoroughly questioned by the Central Intelligence Agency, a senior intelligence official said today. **********But during his interviews, the official said, Federal Bureau of Investigation officers who participated in the C.I.A. interrogations repeatedly showed Mr. Yurchenko newspaper clippings describing his defection. That is when ''he began thinking maybe he'd made a big mistake,'' the official said. **********''He was very, very upset,'' the official added. **********In his comments, the official sought to lay some of the blame for Mr. Yurchenko's decision to return to the Soviet Union on the F.B.I. **********At the F.B.I. today, Lane Bonner, a press officer, said that when Mr. Yurchenko ''was in the United States, he had free access to television, radio and newspapers. It's absurd to say any person provided him with clips when he had free access to that.'' **********But Mr. Yurchenko said at a news conference last week that he was shown newspaper clippings describing his disclosures, and that the officials who brought them ''were looking at me as if they were looking at zoo animals,'' to see how he would respond. **********The senior intelligence official, who has been briefed on Mr. Yurchenko's interviews, said, ''He thought he could keep even the Soviet Union from knowing where he was. He thought he could beat the system and just disappear into the great, blue yonder.'' **********Called a Significant Catch **********Mr. Yurchenko, described by many American officials as a senior K.G.B. officer who defected to the United States in August, had been portrayed one of the most significant defectors of recent times. But he left his C.I.A. escort last week and walked to the Soviet diplomatic compound here. **********After holding a news conference there denouncing the C.I.A., he returned to the Soviet Union. In the days since, the C.I.A. has been under increasing attack, from the White House, Congress and elsewhere, for its handling of Mr. Yurchenko. Questions have also been raised about the quality of information he provided, and whether he was even as senior a member of the K.G.B. as some American officials have maintained. **********A senior official said the prevailing view among Reagan Administration officials was that the affair was ''a major embarrassment.'' A White House official called it ''quite a blunder.'' **********But the intelligence official said the agency had to allow Mr. Yurchenko some freedom because ''he had to adjust to life in the United States.'' **********'They Couldn't Lock Him Up' **********Even when officers realized Mr. Yurchenko was growing restive, ''they couldn't lock him up. What are they going to do: put a ball and chain on him?'' the official asked. **********Still, he said, Mr. Yurchenko was watched most of the time, ''for his own protection'' since Soviet defectors are often afraid they will be kidnapped or assassinated. ''He didn't spend much time alone.'' **********Even when Mr. Yurchenko visited a Washington-area bowling alley to sign up for a bowling league, ''someone was with him,'' an official said. ''He was nicely treated - as a colleague.'' **********But ultimately, the intelligence official said, ''If he had said he wanted to go home, they would have talked to him about it, but if he still wanted to go they would have taken him to the Department of State and let him go. Why have a guy on our hands forever who doesn't want to be here?'' Criticism of C.I.A.  In recent days, members of Congress and others have said they believed the C.I.A. should have done a better job of trying to help Mr. Yurchenko cope with the emotional trauma that defectors almost invariably experience, if emotional turmoil was in fact the reason he returned to the Soviet Union. Some officials believe Mr. Yurchenko was a double agent, sent here by the K.G.B. **********''Either a mistake was made in getting into this situation, or a collosal mistake was made in not spotting a double agent,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman. **********Administration officials ''were sucked in'' by the C.I.A, a senior official said, adding that for two or three months agency officials touted Yurchenko as a wholly reliable defector. **********''The more we pressed,'' the Administration official added, ''the more reassurance we got. Then Yurchenko goes back, and all of a sudden the agency says they had doubts all along.'' **********'Too Much Terrific Data' **********Although the C.I.A. can never know for certain, officials said, agency officers do not believe the theory that Mr. Yurchenko was a plant because ''he gave too much terrific data,'' an official said. **********Mr. Yurchenko gave his debriefers ''the locations of scores of Soviet spies throughout the world, in the United States and in Canada,'' the official said. ''He described where the K.G.B.'s internal security problems are.'' **********''It's always conceivable that it's all a big put-on,'' the official added. ''But so far we have no reason to doubt him because all the leads checked so far have been good,'' although he added that much of Mr. Yurchenko's information still has not been checked. **********Last week, the C.I.A. released a biography of Mr. Yurchenko, an unusual step that some officials viewed as an effort to counter criticism of the agency's handling of Mr. Yurchenko, an explanation the C.I.A. denies. **********In September, Mr. Yurchenko visited the wife of a Soviet official in Canada. Officials said Mr. Yurchenko had been romantically involved with the woman while they both were stationed in Washington during the late 1970's. **********In September, he tried to persuade her to join him in the United States, officials said, but she declined, because ''he looked better as a K.G.B. officer than as a defector,'' an Administration official said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/business/mca-acquisition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MCA Acquisition", "print_headline": "MCA Acquisition", "body_text": " **********MCA Inc. said that it had reached agreement to acquire L.J.N.

The police would be given new authority to control threatening crowds, he said, and to bring charges of disorderly conduct -a new criminal offense here - against rowdy elements. **********The minister rejected the view that social deprivation and unemployment lay behind the unrest, or that new programs were needed to quiet inner city areas. ''Public expenditure is not a remedy for crime,'' he declared. ''There is no evidence whatsover that adding to the substantial sums already being put into these centers would guarantee tranquillity for those who live there.'' The causes of looting and riots, he said, were ''greed and the excitement of violence.'' **********Penalties for Guns **********Mr. Hurd's speech also promised that the penalties against criminals who carry firearms would be stiffened to the point of making life imprisonment a possibility. **********His tough line came across as measured and moderate in a debate in which one speaker received an emotional standing ovation after declaring bitterly that that the Conservative Government had failed to ''sweep the filth from the streets of this country'' because ''we don't want to dirty our hands.'' **********The speaker, a local government representative in Nottinghamshire named Tom Butcher, appeared to be endorsing the call of Enoch Powell, a right-wing member of Parliament, for the forced repatriation of blacks and Asians from Britain. Mr. Powell was forced out of the Conservative Party years ago. **********The anxiety about rising street violence was voiced in what this week is certainly the most heavily policed town in Britain. The Winter Garden, a huge Victorian pleasure palace that is the site of the conference, was surrounded this morning by hundreds of police constables who have been concentrated in this old-style working class resort on the Irish Sea in order to prevent any recurrence of the bombing carried out by the Irish Republican Army at last year's conference, in which Mrs. Thatcher and other members of her Cabinet were the targets of a time bomb placed in a Brighton hotel. **********Despite the security precautions in Blackpool, Irish violence seemed far from the minds of party delegates who had to walk through metal detectors and submit to body checks each time they entered the hall. **********Councilor Praises Rioters **********A succession of speakers, instead, hurled their most indignant words at a black local councilor in the Tottenham area of north London named Bernie Grant, who praised the youths who rioted there Sunday night for giving the police ''a good hiding.'' Scores of constables were injured in the violence and one was knifed to death. **********As the Labor Party majority leader in the council in which he serves, Mr. Grant is presently the highest elected black official in the whole of Britain. He has also been nominated as a Labor Party candidate for Parliament. **********Mr. Hurd called him a ''high priest of race conflict.'' Mr. Butcher said he should be deported. A third speaker said he was ''evil.'' Each time he was denounced, the Tory faithful applauded with an enthusiasm that most members of Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet who have addressed the gathering have noticeably failed to ignite. **********Later, speaking on immigration, David Waddington, a minister in the Home Office, pointedly reminded the delegates that the opposition parties were all pledged to ease immigration controls that have been tightened since Mrs. Thatcher led her party to power in 1979."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/11/business/iran-oil-plan-is-reported.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran Oil Plan Is Reported", "print_headline": "Iran Oil Plan Is Reported", "body_text": " **********Iran has set up a committee to implement a plan under which imports from many countries would be limited to half the value of oil the countries buy from  Iran, informed Iranian sources said today. **********The plan, proposed by the Oil Ministry, aims among other things to recapture  some of the share of the oil market Iran has lost during its war with Iraq, the  sources said. **********The principle has been applied to trade with Japan since late last year, they noted.

''The military said they did not think China would come in, but if it did, it would lead to nuclear war,'' he said, ''and that decided that.'' **********He said American public opinion stayed with the Vietnam War for a long time. The ''turning point,'' he said came in 1968 when it became clear that no one could say when the war would end. That is when, he said, the public became determined to bring the war to an end. **********In 1968, the North Vietnamese carried out a major offensive during the Tet holiday that, while a military setback to them, had the psychological effect of indicating to Americans that the war could not be easily ended."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/world/wreckage-of-air-india-jet-shows-signs-of-fire-piercing-and-bulges.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Witkin", "pub_date": "1985-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WRECKAGE OF AIR-INDIA JET SHOWS SIGNS OF FIRE, PIERCING AND BULGES", "print_headline": "WRECKAGE OF AIR-INDIA JET SHOWS SIGNS OF FIRE, PIERCING AND BULGES", "body_text": " **********The theory that an Air-India jumbo jet may have been destroyed by a bomb was strengthened over the weekend when a salvage ship retrieved additional wreckage showing signs of fire damage, investigators said yesterday. **********The airplane, a Boeing 747, plunged into the sea off Ireland last June 23, killing all 329 people on board. **********United States Government experts from Washington were sent to Ireland meet the Canadian salvage ship Kreuzturm when it arrives at Cork, Ireland, Thursday with a deck full of wreckage brought to the surface over the past two weeks. **********Jack Gamble, a spokesman for the Boeing Company, which built the airplane, said a second Canadian ship involved in the salvage operation, the John Cabot, would arrive at Cork on Friday and that it had some of the wreckage.

And with them has also come talk about the need to make the system so attractive technologically that deployment would come politically irresistible. **********But amid the enthusiasm, there are also growing concerns: Will Congress try to pare the program further? Will the summit meeting produce agreements that make it difficult, if not impossible, to prove the system works? How much of their own resources should companies commit to a program that could be scuttled by a future President? **********Many in the military contracting industry believe their future prosperity may lie in the answers to those questions. **********''The traditional defense budget clearly isn't going to grow much in the near future,'' said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation. ''Every company is on notice that, if they want to be a long-term player, they can't let S.D.I. get away.'' **********The Pentagon has already spent more than $2 billion on space defense research, spread over more than 1,500 contracts. Industry officials point out that the figures are miniscule by Defense Department standards, but the program's potential is not, and a fully deployed system could cost as much as $400 billion to $1.5 trillion, depending on whose estimates are believed. **********And as they jockey for position, companies are supplementing Government spending with tens of millions of their own dollars, developing new technologies that could be incorporated in a space- and ground-based defense against nuclear missiles. **********The research is under way from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratories outside Boston to the Boeing Company's Seattle space center. And after a year of work even enthusiasts admit that the technical challenges are so daunting that billions more will have to be spent. **********''For the most part, I think it is feasible,'' Mark K. Miller, the president of the Boeing Aerospace Company, said in a recent interview when asked to assess the early results. ''But there are problems, uncertainties really, because we have simply never attempted anything of this size before.'' Big Contractors Biggest Winners Assessing the big winners so far, both among companies and technologies, is possible only to a limited extent. While the Government catalogues the prime contracts it awards, much of the work is actually being performed by subcontractors. Details of the most interesting projects are usually either highly classified and considered proprietary, with many contractors more worried about snooping competitors than about the Russians. **********But some trends are clear. The most lucrative missile defense contracts, for example, have gone to many of the same companies, including Teledyne Inc., the Avco Corporation and Rockwell, that also build Minuteman missiles, the MX missile and military satellites. The top 10 Star Wars contractors command more than 60 percent of the money so far, according to several private studies. Some of the largest contracts, however, involve research that was under way long before President Reagan first committed the Administration to strategic defense research in March 1983. **********Government officials have pledged to bring small business and new ideas into the effort, and there are initial signs of success. A 28-page list of Star Wars-related contracts for the 1985 fiscal year, released by the Defense Department last month, includes a host of small companies that are benefiting from the Pentagon's seemingly insatiable appetite for studies and small-scale experiments assessing specific parts of the Star Wars technology. **********Among them are companies such as the fast-growing Kaman Corporation of Bloomfield, Conn., which holds more than 25 contracts to analyze how to assure the survivability of space weapons against attack and to perform a host of other studies. The company has also designed a new, relatively low-cost tracking system, that aims weapons. **********In California, research groups such as the Rand Corporation and SRI, formerly the Stanford Research Institute, both longtime consultants on the deployment of offensive weapons, have quickly shifted their research focus into defensive technologies. The Mission Research Corporation and the General Research Corporation, both of Santa Barbara, say that the strategic defense program has rapidly become a ''significant'' percentage of their business. Two other small research groups, Sparta Inc. and Science Applications Inc., won much-coveted contracts to work on possible designs of the overall defensive shield, and some experts speculate that one of them will emerge as the system's overall engineer. **********''With every research project there is a paper phase, and that's what we are seeing now,'' said Rosy Nimroody, a policy analyst for the Council on Economic Priorities, which has been critical of the plan. ''That's what we are going through now.'' **********For the largest contractors, however, the planning phase cannot end soon enough. Their biggest profits come later, in what the Pentagon calls ''technology demonstrations'' of specific hardware systems, from laser weapons to advanced radar systems. Outguessing The Pentagon Those profits are hardly assured. So at cocktail parties and in corporate lunchrooms up and down the coast, guessing which technologies the Pentagon will ultimately embrace has become something of a pastime. **********''Nobody talks about the Rams anymore,'' one TRW engineer with a passion for football complained the other day. ''Instead, it's lasers.'' **********Indeed, TRW's hopes, and much of its future, ride with two immensely powerful laser systems called Miracl and Alpha. Miracl, a ground-based chemical laser, was successfully tested two months ago at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico where it destroyed a stationary Titan rocket booster in much-publicized experiment. Meanwhile, in the hills near the famous mission at San Juan Capistrano, company engineers are readying the first tests of Alpha, a highly classified, lightweight laser designed to operate from a platform in space. Both projects could prove big winners if the Pentagon decides to go ahead with a full-blown, multi-layered system, the kind first envisioned by the Reagan Administration. **********If only a partial defense system is deployed, however, the winners may be companies such as the Lockheed Corporation, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and the LTV Corporation, which have concentrated on more conventional weapons and sensors. Lockheed seems in a particularly strong position after winning a major contract two weeks ago to develop prototypes of a nonnuclear missile that homes in on and destroys incoming warheads merely by crashing into them. While the contract's details are still under negotioation the prokject is expected to bring Lockheed tens of millions of dollars. **********In any event, executives at most of the companies say they are covering their bets. ''As long as there is competition for the contracts, you end up putting in as much money as you get'' from the Government, Morry Thorson, the vice president of space systems for the Martin Marietta Corporation, said in Denver. The company, he estimated, was putting about $30 million of its own funds into Star Wars research this year, primarily in a ground-based kinetic energy weapon for the Army code-named Headeye. Risk Reflected In Boeing Project Already, however, there is evidence that gearing up for Star Wars is fraught with risks. At the aerospace companies surrounding Los Angeles, for example, distress creeps into the voice of executives asked about the rocky history of the largest Strategic Defense Initiative contract yet: the Boeing Company's Airborne Optical Adjunct. **********The plan, with a budget of $289 million over five years, is to design a long-wave infrared sensor capable of aiding traditional radar systems in detecting warheads in the middle of their flight, just as they are about to re-enter the atmosphere. The plan was to build two sensors based on different technologies, one constructed by Hughes, the other by the Aerojet-General Corporation, a subsidiary of Gencorp Inc., and mount both atop a Boeing 767 for testing in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. **********By this summer, however, it became clear that the project was technically far more complex than first imagined, and would run far over budget. ''We figured that we would exceed our target by $100 million,'' said Mr. Miller of Boeing. Pentagon officials came to the same conclusion. To Boeing's apparent surprise, a drastic restructuring of the program was ordered, one that left Aerojet-General, and its potentially more powerful but technically riskier sensor, out of the program. **********''I think it came as a real shock to the industry,'' said John Pike, who has followed the contract situation closely for the Federation of American Scientists, which is generally opposed to the strategic defense effort. ''It seemed early in the race to be throwing people overboard.'' **********The incident caused consternation among several contractors, who say that in a basic research program it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast expenses precisely. And at Boeing, engineers complained that they would never be able to measure fully the effectiveness of the Hughes sensor without another with which to compare it. **********Army officials, who run the program, say the problem is not critical. ''There will be a loss of some advantages,'' said Ed Vaughn, a spokesman for the Strategic Defense Command in Huntsville, Ala. ''But we will accomplish our key objectives.'' **********Other companies have also run into snags. Lockheed's Talon Gold project, a pointing and tracking system, has been virtually cut out of the research budget; company officials concede that it is ''on hold for some time.'' Early studies, industry insiders say, showed that the system was far too expensive and too inefficient when compared with alternatives. Computers Called Weakest Area Future troubles for large contractors, most experts agree, may arise not from the technology they have developed, but from those they have not. Even Star Wars enthusiasts concede that the project's vulnerable underbelly is the nervous system of supercomputers and software that will control the whole system. Yet computer technology, while far ahead of the Soviet Union's, is widely acknowledged to be one of the weakest area for large contractors. **********Moreover, some contend it an area of relatively little activity. Conspicuously absent from the Pentagon's contractor list were the Internatinal Business Machines Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which employ thousands of the country's most talented software engineers. ''The absence of an I.B.M. or an A.T.&T. is disquieting,'' said Mr. Demisch of First Boston. **********Others note that the Pentagon, which supported much of the early work in computer technology, is now rushing to get back in, supplying financing for a number of small companies and ambitious internal projects such as S-1, an advanced supercomputer effort under way at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. But that project also suffered delays when some key mistakes by engineers made their second-generation computer too large and unweildy. **********''We screwed up our second machine, there is no question,'' said P. Michael Farmwald, one of the project's directors, in an interview at his laboratory in Livermore. ''A lot of people are skeptical. But we still think we can build the world's fastest, most powerful supercomputer.'' **********Large contractors are meanwhile looking to the outside for computer talent, particularly in key programming technologies such as artificial intelligence. Lockheed made a $10 million investment in August in Rational Computer, a Silicon Valley software house, and Martin Marietta now owns 17 percent of the Verdix Corporation, a company in Chantilly, Va., that specializes in military software. **********The Ford Motor Company, also hopeful of attracting some of the research work, is spending heavily on both software and electronics, apparently hoping to improve the talents of its Ford Aerospace division. Last month Ford invested in several companies, including the Carnegie Group in Pittsburgh, specializing in artificial intelligence work, though Carnegie is expected to work primarily for Ford's automotive business. And last March Ford Microelectronics opened a Colorado Springs semiconductor facility to produce high-speed gallium arsenide microchips. An alternative to silicon chips, the circuits are considered a key to the development of high-speed optical computers, another strategic defense initiative. Political Questions Worry Companies Still dogging the contractors are political questions that many fear could keep the program forever in the research stage. **********Chief among them is a growing debate, both within the Reagan Administration and on Capitol Hill, over how to interpret the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. A liberal reading of the document could allow some space testing, considered critical to creating confidence in the program's viability. President Reagan has said that he believes the broad reading of the treaty is valid, but that he intends to stay within the bounds of the narrower interpretation. **********''Some people are unhappy with the narrow reading because they say the only way to test this system is to launch some missiles and try to shoot them down,'' Robert Walquist, TRW's director of research for the program, said in his office recently. ''We don't subscribe to that. We think you can test components without going that far.'' **********Nonetheless, in recent Congressional testimony, Lieut. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, the director of the strategic defense project, has suggested that amendments to the treaty may be necessary to test the system in the 1990's. **********The testing debate has unsettled the contractors, primarily, they say, because it has unsettled Congress. Support for the research program has only been lukewarm in recent months, and the Administration's budget request for research this year has already been cut back by about a quarter, to less than $3 billion. Already the cutbacks have forced delays of some key programs, General Abrahamson told a Congressional committee recently. **********But company officials, accustomed to intensely lobbying for specific weapons systems, say they have been hesitant to take a public role in the Congressional debate. One aerospace executive said his company was trying to avoid the appearance of ''straddling up to the trough.'' Added a Boeing executive: ''When the President of the United States is your lobbyist, you're best advised to sit down and shut up.'' **********Increasingly, contractors are also growing wary of foreign competition. American allies are arguing for a substantial slice of the research budget, and an agreement reached with Britain last month seems likely to bring British researchers about $1.5 billion in contracts. Should West Germany and others receive similar guarantees, United States companies say privately, their own research efforts could suffer. A New Source Of Employment? Meanwhile, though, there are signs that support for Star Wars is beginning to become an issue of jobs as well as strategy. Some in Congress argue that strategic defense, like nuclear missile and aircraft construction programs, will create a host of highly skilled and unskilled jobs. Experts say that most would be concentrated in traditional high-technology states such as Massachusetts and California, and centers of space research such as Huntsville and Colorado Springs. **********''We have to make our strategic determinations separately,'' said Representative Kenneth B. Kramer, a Colorado Republican who added that Colorado Springs, site of the new Unified Space Command, should soon become ''the space capital of the free world.'' **********''But when you get past that, we have to think about what a stimulus this can be for the economy,'' he added. ''When we implement the defense initative, it becomes the single largest undertaking ever attempted by mankind.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/25/business/oil-outlook-of-norway.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Outlook Of Norway", "print_headline": "Oil Outlook Of Norway", "body_text": " **********Norway, which has been accused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries of increasing crude oil output at OPEC members' expense, expects its production to level off this year. **********Kaare Kristiansen, the Norwegian oil minister, said the national oil company, Statoil, which provoked a round of price cuts last winter, preferred to follow the market rather than lead it. **********Mr. Kristiansen, on a four-day official visit to Kuwait, said Norway would produce about 700,000 barrels a day or slightly more this year, ''about the same as in 1984.''

The timing of the negotiations agreed to Tuesday in Geneva still has to be worked out, and Mr. Shultz said, ''I think it's important that these negotiations get started in good time.'' **********Says Gromyko Wanted More **********Participants in the closed-door sessions said Mr. Shultz told them that the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, initially pressed for an American commitment to halt research into what the Administration calls the Strategic Defense Initiative and others call ''Star Wars.'' **********But at the end of the two-day meeting, Mr. Gromyko agreed on the joint statement calling for negotiations on three areas - limits on medium-range missiles, reductions in strategic arms and preventing an arms race in space. **********U.S. Delegation in Agreement **********In briefings for members of Congress and for the press in recent days, Administration officials have said that despite differences within the Government over how to approach Moscow on arms control, there was virtually no disagreement in Geneva within the American delegation, which included officials of diverse views. **********Flying home with Mr. Shultz from Geneva on Wednesday, several officials told reporters that Mr. Shultz showed skill in holding the group together through the talks. **********They cautioned, however, that fundamental differences remained and would probably emerge when Washington has to consider actual trade-offs with the Russians. Defense Department officials have said they doubt that any agreement that can be adquately verified can ever be achieved. The State Department has been less pessimistic. **********U.S. Willing to Bargain **********In a news conference Wednesday, President Reagan said the United States was willing to ''discuss trade- offs'' in offensive weapons. He also stressed the importance of agreeing on as much verification as possible. **********A senior official who has been at odds with the State Department said Mr. Shultz was careful in Geneva to solicit opinions from everyone and to avoid letting disagreements fester. **********''He really brought out the best in every one of us, and in the group itself,'' said another official, Kenneth L. Adelman, the director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. **********Difficult Decision for Shultz **********The most difficult decision for Mr. Shultz and the delegation was to agree to have the American research program into defensive weapons made part of the future negotiations, even though Washington has said it will not bargain away this program. **********The decision was made with Pentagon approval, officials said, because Mr. Shultz got Mr. Gromyko to agree that, under the heading of space weapons, the United States included not only weapons in space aimed at other weapons in space but also ground-based weapons aimed into space. The latter category would include the large Soviet program in antiballistic missiles and antiaircraft weapons with possible missile defense potential, which have alarmed the Defense Department. **********On another potentially contentious issue, that of testing in a new antisatellite program, Mr. Shultz said that Mr. Gromyko did not raise it as a question and that as a result no American response was needed. **********Soviet Focus on Space Research **********Officials said the major problem facing the future negotiations is Soviet insistence that although the Russians want ''radical'' cuts in nuclear arms, they will not agree to them until Washington agrees to halt its space research program. **********Mr. Shultz has said he would prefer to have each set of negotiations handled separately. But today, the Soviet Politburo repeated that it wanted progress in the negotiations ''in all of its parts.'' **********Mr. Shultz told reporters that Mr. Gromyko had spoken with ''great intensity with regard to their feeling that our scientific capability is formidable, and their desire really is to stop all of it at this point.'' **********''But we are clearly going ahead with the research,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''We pointed out that there would be no way of verifying an agreement to stop research in any event, and apparently they have agreed with this point of view.'' **********Some time after March 1, Congress is supposed to vote on whether to release $1.5 billion for deployment of a second group of 21 MX land-based missiles carrying 10 warheads each. Congress is also to be asked to approve an additional $3.7 billion as part of a $26 billion research and development program for the Strategic Defense Initiative. **********In another matter, Mr. Reagan surprised lower-level officials by his comment in the news conference that the Administration would go ahead with plans to destroy some older Polaris submarines to allow a new Trident submarine to go into action. The strategic arms accord of 1972 obliges the United States to do this to keep within the limits set, but some conservative members of Congress have urged dropping that accord. **********Today, the State Department issued a statement saying that although the United States abides by the 1972 accord, no decision had been made on destroying the Polaris submarines. **********Reagan Aide Meets With Pope **********ROME, Jan. 10 - Robert C.

This strategy has met with considerable success for Fidelity Investments of Boston, the nation's largest privately owned mutual fund company, and the approach seems likely to gain favor. **********''Fidelity popularized the sector funds, but the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., and Financial Programs Inc. in Denver also provide sector funds,'' said Richard J. Fabian, owner of the Telephone Switch Newsletter. From his base in Huntington Beach, Calif., Mr. Fabian is an astute observer of the mutual fund scene. **********In the past, his monthly publication has advised subscribers on timing and investments in three broad areas - equity funds, gold funds and international funds. But now it is branching out. In the issue going into the mails this week, his newsletter will add a new dimension with a section on sector funds. **********''One inherent appeal of the sector fund is that its portfolio can move in a direction opposite to the overall stock market,'' Mr. Fabian said in a recent telephone interview. ''My feeling, too, is that sector funds will appeal more to mutual fund shareholders who are trading oriented.'' **********Currently, there are eight industry sectors available in Fidelity's package, known as Select Portfolios, and plans call for adding new sectors. ''These funds give investors the ability to target the areas of the market they like and also to switch their commitments easily,'' said Michael J. Hines, Fidelity's product manager for all equity funds. **********Two of these industry portfolios ranked among the top six performers of 773 mutual funds in the first quarter of 1985, as rated by Lipper Analytical Services. The total return of Fidelity's Leisure and Entertainment portfolio was 24.10 percent; its Health Care portfolio, 22.92 percent. Total return is market appreciation plus dividends and interest reinvested. **********Other measures of the market during the same quarter showed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index with a total return of 9.21 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average with a return of 5.78 percent. **********For all their appeal, sector funds provide no magical answer to successful investing. Like any investor who puts money into an individual stock, the sector shareholder must own the right fund at the correct time in order to reap the rewards. For example, Fidelity's Health Care Portfolio displayed a negative return of 1.07 percent for all of 1984, a year when the 500-stock index produced a return of 6.3 percent. **********Two other Fidelity Select Portfolios - one devoted to precious metals and minerals, the other to energy stocks - showed total returns in excess of 16 percent in the first quarter. The military and aerospace portfolio gained 13.76 percent. Fidelity Select Utilities and Fidelity Select Financial Services were each up nearly 9 percent. The company's remaining sector fund, Fidelity Select Technology, managed a gain of only 2.44 percent for the quarter. **********Each of Fidelity's sector funds carries an initial sales charge of 2 percent and a redemption charge of 1 percent. But shareholders can switch from one fund to another up to four times a year at no additional cost. If an investor decides to move out of stocks altogether, a switch also is available into a money market fund called Fidelity Cash Reserves, which was yielding 8.16 percent late last week. **********''After the big market rally in January and February of this year, we saw a lot of money move out of Fidelity Cash Reserves - what you might call 'sidelines money' - and go into the technology fund,'' Mr. Hines reported. **********In all, the Fidelity Select Portfolios have more than 200,000 accounts - proof that this approach has its appeal. **********Michael Lipper, who heads the analytical service, said he views sector funds essentially as ''product line extensions.'' He added that ''more people are using these funds as trading devices.'' **********At Telephone Switch Newsletter, Mr. Fabian said that, by the reckoning of his service, equity funds have been in a ''buying mode'' since the start of 1985. ''In late March,'' he added, ''we also got a buy signal for gold funds and international funds.'' **********Placid Period for the MarketExcept for speculation on possible corporate takeovers, the stock market provided little excitement last week.

Analysts said it would greatly enhance Dow Jones's own news ticker and stock and news retrieval system.

Last year Merrill Lynch & Company formed a venture with the International Business Machines Corporation to market computerized services to brokerage firms. Three weeks ago, I.B.M.'s biggest rival, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said it was teaming up with Quotron System Inc. to provide similar services.

Joe Selby, has warned almost 100 big banks, including the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York and the First National Bank of Boston, that they have been mishandling some of the funds of their trust and estate clients, industry and regulatory sources said today. **********The regulator did not accuse the trust departments of any illegal practices, but said the banks were not abiding by regulatory guidelines in handling customer funds. **********It told them that by the end of the year they would have to repay any lost interest retroactive to July 1982, which could total millions of dollars. **********Statement by Chase **********''We believe we are totally in compliance with general regulations and the Comptroller's own interpretations of those regulations,'' said Kenneth Mills, a spokesman for Chase. **********Added Wayne Taylor, a spokesman for the Bank of Boston, ''any reimbursement that is made would have a minimal impact on the earnings of the bank.'' Mr. Taylor would not say, however, that his bank was in compliance with the Comptroller's regulations. **********In letter sent within the last four weeks to nearly 100 banks that each manage trust assets of $1 billion or more, the Comptroller asserted that the institutions were not placing all trust money into high-yielding accounts, such as money market accounts. Instead, the agency found that some bank trust departments were parking some funds into such low-yielding accounts as 5.5 percent passbook accounts. **********Banks 'Just Lazy' **********''We're not accusing them of a nefarious motive,'' said one regulator, who asked not to be identified. ''We think the banks were just lazy.'' **********Many of the banks are objecting to the Comptroller's insistence that retroactive interest be paid, and the issue is shaping up into a battle between the Comptroller and the American Bankers Association. **********''Our members feel strongly that they did abide by the rules governing funds awaiting investment - especially the guidelines they have been receiving over the last three years from Joe Selby himself,'' said Daniel S. Buser, a spokesman for the bankers group. **********Mr. Buser also said that the banking community has complained that the Comptroller has refused to provide ''strong, clear guidelines'' on the investment of such funds, and that the demand by Mr. Selby for retroactive reimbursement is particularly irksome. **********''The banks don't feel that the Comptroller has any right to make it retroactive,'' he said. **********Policy Directive **********But Leonora Cross, a spokesman for the Comptroller, said that a policy directive from the Comptroller's office on Dec. 13, 1983, did give adequate guidelines. ''It says that the banks are supposed to make trust cash productive and the marketplace has provided high-yielding investment media that are available for that purpose,'' she said. **********Mrs. Cross would not confirm or deny the reports that letters had been sent to the banks ''because they pertain to our examination process, which is confidential.'' **********But she said that last spring the Comptroller sent a ''special call report'' to about 120 banks, ''asking them how they were handling the idle cash balances in their trust accounts.'' **********Mrs. Cross would not say whether follow-up letters had been mailed to some of the banks warning that they had been in violation of the Comptroller's rules. But according to a spokesman for the bankers association, the Comptroller sent out the letters last month, ordering that by the end of the year the banks repay their trust clients the interest lost. **********According to banking sources in New York, almost 100 of the 120 banks that received the first letter received the warning letter, too. **********Most Big Banks Believed Warned **********While it could not be confirmed that other major New York City banks had received the warning letter, one banking source noted that almost all the major banks had been warned. **********Susan Weeks, a spokesman for Citibank, the nation's largest bank, would not say whether the bank had received the Comptroller's warning. But she added, ''We have always fully complied with regulations governing these matters.'' **********Several big New York banks such as Morgan Guaranty, Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust and Manufacturers Hanover would not have received the letter because they are state-chartered and not regulated or examined by the Comptroller of the Currency. **********Mr. Buser of the bankers association said that both the Bank of Boston and the Bank of New England, also a recipient of the letter, had urged the bankers group to seek a meeting with Mr. Selby, the Acting Comptroller, to discuss the issue.

Previous talks between them about a settlement had not yielded any substantive progress, officials from both companies have said. **********United States District Judge Charles L. Brieant Jr. told a packed courtroom in White Plains that he had been informed by lawyers for both companies ''that their clients are still having discussions with each other looking toward the amicable settlement and disposition of all of the underlying litigation.'' **********The court hearing had been called to consider Texaco's request for a preliminary injunction to bar Pennzoil from acting to collect the judgment of $10.53 billion plus interest awarded to it by a Texas court, pending the outcome of any appeal in the Texas courts. An injunction would also free Texaco from the necessity of posting a $12 billion bond to appeal in Texas. 45-Minute Meeting Judge Brieant called the court into session after a 45-minute meeting between representatives of both companies in his chambers. He immediately adjourned the hearing ''so as not to impede the efforts of the attorneys and the clients to adjust the matter.'' **********Judge Brieant said a new date for the hearing would be set if one of the companies requested it. In the meantime, the temporary restraining order against Pennzoil that he issued on Tuesday would remain in effect. **********David Boies, a partner at the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, who is representing Texaco, declined to comment, as did Arthur Liman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, who represents Pennzoil. Texaco's chairman and chief executive, John K. McKinley, who attended the hearing flanked by other top Texaco executives, also declined to comment. **********The adjournment of the court proceeding, which was agreed to by lawyers for both sides, appeared to meet a previous demand by Pennzoil that it would not engage in serious settlement talks while Texaco pursued additional litigation against it. The companies are battling over Texaco's acquisition of the Getty Oil Company for $128 a share, or $10.1 billion, in 1984, just after Pennzoil had reached what it considered a binding agreement to buy part of Getty. **********Extreme Financial Pressure **********Texaco has been under extreme financial pressure to resolve the case quickly because of nervousness among its lenders, suppliers and business partners about its future. Texaco has repeatedly said that it might be forced into bankruptcy proceedings if it had to post a $12 billion bond required under Texas law to appeal, or if Pennzoil started attaching liens to its property. **********Some analysts said that Pennzoil might also have been under increasing pressure to get settlement talks going before the possible issuance of the preliminary injunction, which would greatly increase Texaco's bargaining power. **********In that sense, Texaco's tactic of bringing part of the case into a Federal court - especially one situated just miles from its corporate headquarters in Harrison, near White Plains - might already have paid off, analysts said. To agree to postponing the preliminary injunction hearing, Texaco ''must sense that Pennzoil is more willing to settle, while Pennzoil must sense that its bargaining position is weakening,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be identified. **********No details of the settlement talks were available. Pennzoil in the past has indicated that it wants to receive the oil and gas assets that it would have attained through its partial purchase of Getty. Pennzoil has also indicated that it would prefer a settlement based on an asset transfer because that would make it easier to avoid paying taxes on the settlement. Some analysts think Pennzoil does not want to accept a settlement of less than $5 billion, although others think something in the range of $2 billion or less is more likely. **********The stock prices of both companies rose on the news yesterday. Texaco closed at $30.50 a share, up 62.5 cents, in heavy trading. Pennzoil closed at $63.625 a share, up $1.875."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/27/world/security-council-votes-anti-apartheid-measure.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES ANTI APARTHEID MEASURE", "print_headline": "SECURITY COUNCIL VOTES ANTI APARTHEID MEASURE", "body_text": " **********The Security Council today urged governments to suspend new investments in South Africa and take other steps to force the Pretoria Goverment to dismantle the apatheid system. **********The United States and Britain abstained from voting on the resolution. **********Passage of the French-sponsored resolution marked the strongest anti-apartheid measure adopted by the Council since it proclaimed a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa in 1977, the chief French delegate, Claude de Kemoularia, said after the vote. **********The remaining 13 Council members voted in favor of the resolution, which also calls on South Africa to repeal its emergency decree and release all political prisoners and detainees. **********Resolution Seen as a Warning **********''Let us hope that this warning will be heeded,'' Mr. de Kemoularia told the Council. He later called the vote ''a significant action that will provoke and shock the international community'' into taking further steps against South Africa. **********Earlier, the United States and Britain vetoed an amendment that would have required the Council to consider mandatory economic and political sanctions against South Africa if its Government failed to end apartheid. **********That amendment, sponsored by African and nations professing nonalignment, referred to a provision of the United Nations Charter that authorizes the Security Council to take punitive action against nations said to be in breach of the peace. **********The vote followed two days of debate and hours of closed-door negotiations. **********After the vote, delegates from the Soviet Union and from Burkina Faso, the African Council member that spoke for the nations professing nonalignment, criticized the resolution as insufficient, though they had supported it. **********The Soviet delegate, Vassily Safronchuck, said that despite American and British criticism of apartheid, their abstention ''once again indicates on whose side these countries are.'' **********During a debate Thursday, the United States and Britain rejected any call for suspension of new investments, saying such actions would be counterproductive for South African blacks. **********Speaking after the debate, Warren Clark, a United States delegate, repeated American objections to such sanctions and said the Reagan Administration would maintain its policy of ''constructive engagement'' toward South Africa. **********Harm to Blacks Seen **********''Actions to restrict new investment both undermine the economy of that country and create additional hardships for blacks in that country,'' Mr. Clark said. ''Isolating the South African economy further would only do further harm to the black majority of South Africa.'' **********Economic Sanctions **********The resolution passed by the Security Council also called on nations to introduce a variety of economic sanctions, including the end of guaranteed export loans, halting imports of South African gold coins and the end of sales of computer equipment that could be used by the South African police or army. **********In the debate today, speakers from 10 Soviet bloc and developing nations condemned the South African emergency decree and called for economic and political sanctions much stronger those in the French resolution. **********On Thursday, the South African delegate, Kurt von Schirnding, told the Council that his nation did not regard South Africa's ''internal situation'' as open to Security Council discussion. **********''Nothing this council may say or plan,'' he said, ''will deter us from doing what we believe is in the best interests of all the peoples of South Africa.'' **********The resolution marked the second time this year that the Council has condemned internal developments in South Africa.

The Egyptair plane had initially flown to Athens from the Egyptian capital. **********Security at the Greek airport came in for worldwide criticism after the June 14 hijacking of a Trans World Airlines plane that took off from Athens with 153 people on board and ended up in Beirut. An American Navy diver was killed by the Arab hijackers and 39 American hostages were held for 17 days. **********The State Department issued a travel advisory on June 18 advising American travelers to avoid the Athens airport. The advisory was lifted July 22 after stringent inspections by the International Air Transport Association and the Federal Aviation Administration that led to tough new security measures. Both agencies ultimately labeled the airport as one of the world's best-guarded terminals. **********'Security Was Second to None' **********On Sunday the Egyptair incident was already touching off new demands for more intensive scrutiny of flight operations at Athens, a crossroads on airways to and from the Middle East. Officials of the international pilots' union spoke of a possible brief boycott of Athens to bring pressure for even more thorough security improvements than were put in place after the T.W.A. hijacking. **********But the authorities in Greece, where earlier criticism had produced widespread outrage, came to the defense of the upgraded security system and began an inquiry to reconstruct how the Egyptair hijacking had come about. **********A senior police official, quoted by The Associated Press on condition that he not be identified, said, ''We have started looking into the event, but it is still too early to draw any conclusions.'' He too expressed doubt that the weapons used in the hijacking had been brought aboard the Boeing 737 plane in Athens, adding, ''The passengers go through two security checks, ours and the airline's.'' **********The senior security official at the field, Vassilis Meraviliotakis, went further, according to U.P.I., saying: ''Both the Trans World Airlines jet hijacked from Athens in June and the Egyptair jet hijacked from Athens Saturday had originated in Cairo. The United States, whose officials inspected Athens airport after the T.W.A. hijacking, publicly declared security was second to none. This leads us to believe that the weapons used by the hijackers may have been placed aboard the aircraft in Cairo and not in Athens.'' **********Security Measures Listed **********Later a Government spokesman issued a statement listing in detail the security measures to which those who boarded the Egyptair plane had been subjected. These included use of electronic devices for bodily checks of passengers at two points, once by Greek security police and once by Egyptair employees using the airline's own equipment. **********In addition, the statement said, passenger luggage got a triple inspection, once at check-in, a second time by security police using manual and electronic search procedures, and finally a manual check by airline personnel. **********In the furor over the T.W.A. incident last June, critics of the Athens Government emphasized that the Athens airport had built a reputation over many years as one of the most loosely guarded of all the world's major terminals. **********The international transport association, which has 140 member airlines, submitted an initial list of security recommendations to Greek authorities back in 1980. The security survey was one of a series that covered about 40 airports over 10 years, according to David Kyd, a spokesman for the association. **********Large Dollar Losses **********''In the case of Athens,'' he recalled after the T.W.A. hijacking, ''we sent somebody there this past May to check what they had done and they found nothing much had happened.'' **********But the outcry over the T.W.A. incident, which not only embarrassed the Athens Government but led to huge dollar losses as travelers shunned the area, did bring concrete improvements. **********Mr. Kyd said on July 16 that ''virtually all'' new measures recommended by a inspection team of five airline experts had been carried out. ''This means,'' he said, ''that checking of passengers and hand luggage, protection of a perimeter of the airport, and access to parking areas of aircraft, are now all up to satisfactory standards.'' **********The issue now is whether the Egyptair incident was made possible by a loophole in the Athens system or whether the weapons were smuggled on board somewhere else. **********Meantime, the F.A.A. confirmed that American airlines and airport officials had been put on alert last week against reported security threats. But it was a general alert and no direct link could be made to the Egyptair hijacking. **********An agency spokesman, Fred Farrar, said: ''We regularly advise U.S. carriers of security-threat conditions anywhere in the world. It's a security matter and we don't comment further.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/24/business/marine-to-buy-finance-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 161, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marine to Buy Finance Unit", "print_headline": "Marine to Buy Finance Unit", "body_text": " **********Marine Midland Banks Inc. said today that it had agreed to acquire Commercial Credit Business Loans Inc.

Also, the company was forced to withdraw from the pre-insulated piping systems business. Triangle reported a stinging net loss of $1.1 million in 1983, after posting earnings of $5.8 million in 1983. **********$3.2 Million Profit in 1984 **********Since then, however, the company has picked up steam, improving the distribution system of its coin-changing machines while virtually abandoning the sluggish video game machine business and other unprofitable operations. It operated profitably again in 1984, reporting net income of $3.2 million, or $1.29 a share. **********The man widely credited for the company's rebound is Nelson Peltz, a New York businessman with a string of previous corporate affiliations, who gained control of Triangle two years ago. Mr. Peltz previously served as president and chief executive of both the Coffee-Mat Corporation, a manufacturer of vending machines for beverages and snacks, and the Flagstaff Corporation, a food service marketing and distribution concern. **********Besides restoring profitability, Mr. Peltz's major achievement, observers of the company said, was in arranging more than $500 million in financing for potential acquisitions. **********Changes Called Unlikely **********Neither Mr. Peltz, who is president and chief executive officer, nor other Triangle officials would agree to be interviewed. However, those close to the company have speculated that it is unlikely that Triangle would change either National Can's management or operations. **********''National Can is an outstanding company and it would not be their intention to change it,'' said David G. Kay, managing director and director of acquisitions for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Triangle's investment banker. **********''These are smart, intellegent business guys,'' Mr. Kay continued. ''And Nelson Peltz spent time reorienting that business to the point where it has become a nice little operation.'' **********Triangle, whose 1984 sales of $290.8 million compared with National Can's revenue of $1.1 billion, would be making its first acquisition under Mr. Peltz's tenure, although the company has actively looked to purchase other companies. **********A year ago, Triangle had considered merging with the Beverly Hills Savings and Loan Association, which had sought a corporate rescuer in its proxy fight with a dissidant stockholder. Triangle later decided against the merger. Triangle, which until the 1960's was called the Triangle Conduit and Cable Company, was founded during World War I as a privately owned manufacturer of steel and metal construction products. **********It went public in 1955 and in 1968 acquired the Rowe Manufacturing division of the Canteen Corporation for $28 million. That division, now Rowe International Inc., manufactures the currency changers, jukeboxes and vending machines, while the copper and steel products are made by Triangle's second operating subsidiary, PWC Inc. **********Despite the progress Mr. Peltz and his team have made in their tenure with Triangle, some troubles remain. Its distribution business, for example, continues to be negatively affected by the decline in the amusement game business. **********Still, Triangle is perceived as a little-known company that is assiduously plotting a course to greater corporate influence. ''I still don't know much about them,'' said Frank W. Considine, chairman, president and chief executive of National Can. ''They're obviously aggressive.

Richard W. Murphy Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, was also sent to London to meet with the King. **********Hussein's Peace Plan Cited **********American officials were concerned that the King might become discouraged over the Administration's failure to move quickly on providing him with the advanced fighters and air defense equipment he is seeking and might lose interest in the peace plan with Israel he has promoted recently. **********The $250 million in economic aid, if approved by Congress, would be spread over the current fiscal year and the 1986 year, which begins on Oct. 1, officials said. It was agreed to this morning by Mr. Reagan after Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, and other officials discussed the options on Wednesday. **********Jordan receives aid from the United States and Saudi Arabia, but American officials said the Saudis, who in the past had financed Jordan's military purchases in this country, were upset at Jordan for its latest diplomatic initiative with the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The Saudis are concerned because the initiative had not been approved by other Arab nations and threatened to split the Arab camp, given Syria's strong opposition. Some Jordanians have said the Saudis have refused to pay for any more arms purchases because of this dispute, but this could not be confirmed. The $250 million supplemental request represents a sixfold increase over Jordan's current economic aid from the United States, which has been at about $20 million a year. **********''Despite its prudent economic policies, Jordan has legitimate economic needs that deserve attention,'' Robert Sims, a White House spokesman, said. ''And the King's clear movement toward peace negotiations with Israel this year carries real risks, including economic risks.'' This was an allusion to the possible cutoff of Saudi aid. **********''The President feels it is important to show tangible support for the King's efforts to move toward negotiations,'' he said. ''Also, as Jordan enters a period of sustained, intensified peace efforts, it is in everyone's interests that Jordan have as solid a foundation at home as possible.'' **********The Administration has also asked Congress to approve a supplemental economic aid package for Israel of $1.5 billion for the 1985-86 fiscal years, bringing the total economic aid sought for Israel in that period to $3.9 billion, in addition to $3.2 billion in military grants. **********Aid Package for Egypt **********For Egypt, the Administration is seeking an economic aid package of $500 million, in addition to $2 billion for the two years, and about $2.6 billion in military credits. **********Jordan, by comparison, is to get about $200 million a year in military credits and $40 million in economic aid over the two years, not including the supplemental amount. **********The Administration said the supplemental $250 million included $100 million for the purchase of specific nonmilitary commodities, $100 million in cash to meet balance-of-payment problems and $50 million for specific development projects. **********This afternoon, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Administration's requests for the additional economic aid for Egypt and Israel. But no action was taken on the economic aid for Jordan. **********Senate Leadership Surprised **********The decision to seek the supplemental aid surprised the Republican leadership in the Senate, which had urged the Administration to put off any action on Jordan until there was more concrete progress toward peace. Seventy-two senators have already signed a resolution opposing arms sales to Jordan now, but it was uncertain whether there would be concerted opposition to the economic package. **********The Jordan aid is likely to be attached to the emergency supplemental bill that contains aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. **********The Israelis also oppose military aid to Jordan. Israeli sources said today that Israel had promised Mr. Shultz not to oppose military aid if King Hussein would publicly pledge to end the formal state of belligerency with Israel when negotiations began. **********But when he was here two weeks ago, the King limited himself to saying he envisioned negotiations taking place in ''a nonbelligerent atmosphere.'' ----Egypt Welcomes Israeli Plan CAIRO, June 13 - Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid said today that Egypt welcomed a new Israeli peace plan as an ''effort to advance the peace process'' but expressed reservations about parts of the proposal.

Shultz is considering meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Jordan to discuss the makeup of an Arab delegation to negotiate peace with Israel, Reagan Administration officials said today. **********Egypt supports such a meeting, but the Jordanians are resisting the idea because they say they prefer the first step be an American invitation to a Jordanian- Palestinian delegation. Jordan says Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization need to start talking. **********Administration officials say Mr. Shultz has discussed the idea with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who suggested the meeting as a way to avoid the Palestinian issue, and with Foreign Minister Tahir al-Masri of Jordan, who has been in Washington this week. The officials said Richard W. Murphy Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, would pursue the question of what to do next when he goes to the Middle East in the next two weeks. **********Any meeting of Mr. Shultz, Mr. Masri, and Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt would take place later in April or in May, the officials said, and might be held in Washington. Mr. Shultz would then talk to Israeli officials separately to see if a Palestinian delegation acceptable to them could be chosen. **********Reagan Affirms U.S. Stance **********President Reagan said at a news conference Thursday night that he would be willing to invite a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, but only if it had no Palestine organization ties or if the P.L.O. met longstanding American conditions to be recognized. **********Jordan's Foreign Minister said today, however, that it was not feasible for the United States to meet with a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation that was independent of the Palestine organization. **********Commenting on President Reagan's statement that the United States would be willing to meet with such a joint delegation if the Palestinians in the group ''do not consider themselves represented by the P.L.O,'' Mr. Masri said no Palestinian would take part unless he was under the group's instructions. **********''I can tell you one thing,'' Mr. Masri said, ''that even if you pick out the most moderate Palestinians, anyone you name - including myself, if I am not a minister - no one would accept to participate in such a delegation unless he asked the P.L.O. for a public acceptance of his participation.'' **********Mr. Masri, 43 years old, is a Palestinian who was born in the West Bank town of Nablus. **********Whether a Palestinian belongs to the Palestinian organization is, Mr. Masri said, a ''technicality because this man, whoever he is, will go back, or before he goes he will meet Arafat or the executive committee and ask what is the policy, where can I stop, what can I say. **********''So practically, it is the same,'' Mr. Masri continued, alluding to the allegiance of Palestinians to Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian organization. **********Mr. Masri mentioned that Mohammed Milhelm, a Palestinian leader who was exiled from the West Bank by Israel, and who had regularly met with Mr. Shultz and other American officials, had recently joined the Palestinian group's executive committee. Now, Mr. Masri said, Mr. Shultz will no longer meet with Mr. Milhelm. **********Discussions With Shultz **********In Washington, Mr. Masri met with Mr. Shultz, most recently late today, to discuss ways to advance the Middle East peace process. Mr. Masri, echoing the remarks of King Hussein of Jordan and President Mubarak, has said in private and public that the United States has to begin dealing with the P.L.O. for there to be any conceivable hope of progress. **********The United States is adhering to its 10-year-old policy of refusing to deal with the Palestinian organization until it accepts Israel's right to exist and unequivocally accepts the United Nations Security Council resolutions that are considered the basis for Middle East negotiations. **********In the agreement King Hussein and Mr. Arafat signed on Feb. 11, the two sides generally accepted all Security Council measures on the Middle East, but none specifically. Mr. Masri said he had asked the Palestinians to accept Resolution 242 of 1967 explicitly, but ''they could not do it.'' **********He said the Palestinians had told him they had gone as far as they could to be conciliatory by agreeing to the concept of the return of occupied land in exchange for peace that is contained in that resolution. **********Mr. Masri, who met with reporters this morning, said he believed that if the United States welcomed the Palestinians, that would be seen as tantamount to American acceptance of the group and might encourage the Palestinians and other Arabs to agree to start direct talks with Israel. **********Reagan Repeats U.S. Stance **********Mr. Reagan, in his news conference, repeated the longstanding American proposal that Jordan, along with some local West Bank Palestinians not affiliated with Mr. Arafat, should talk with Israel. **********He added that ''there are many Palestinians who don't feel that they're represented by the P.L.O.'' **********Mr. Reagan's comments are disputed by King Hussein, Mr. Masri and Mr. Mubarak, all of whom have said that it is no longer feasible to hold peace talks without directly involving the Palestinian organization. **********Israel has said it will talk directly to any Jordanian-Palestinian group not affiliated with the P.L.O."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/18/business/lobbyists-turn-to-ads-to-shape-tax-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1985-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 814, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lobbyists Turn to Ads to Shape Tax Bill", "print_headline": "Lobbyists Turn to Ads to Shape Tax Bill", "body_text": " **********Between strains of classical music on a local radio station, listeners were lectured recently on the history and merits of the ''completed-contract'' method of tax accounting. **********This lesson on an arcane area of tax law was not an effort to stimulate the intellect of lovers of Bach and Vivaldi. Rather, the commercial message from the Associated General Contractors of America is among an array of lavish advertising campaigns mounted by lobbying groups to influence the Congressional tax overhaul debate. **********Over the last several weeks, many more lobbying groups have decided to employ Madison Avenue-style tactics than for previous tax bills because of the huge stakes involved in the tax overhaul effort. Millions of dollars have been poured into newspaper, magazine, radio and television advertisements by groups seeking to protect billions of dollars worth of tax benefits as the House Ways and Means Committee drafts its tax revision package. **********The life and health insurance industry spent $4 million on advertising; a coalition fighting to preserve the deductibility of state and local taxes, $1 million. Other campaigns have been waged to save solar energy tax credits and a host of corporate tax preferences. **********Some Ads Aim at Congressmen **********Some of the ads, such as those by the Associated General Contractors group, are aimed directly at Congressmen and their staffs. Others, such as the insurance and state- and local-deduction campaigns, are aimed at mobilizing grass-roots support for their causes. **********''It was really quite effective,'' said Walter Bussewitz, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance. The council estimates that some two million pieces of mail flooded Capitol Hill offices in response to the campaign, which was waged in conjunction with the Health Insurance Association. It included nationwide television commercials and magazine ads containing pre-printed post cards for readers to send to their Congressmen. **********The life insurance council won their first major victory last Friday when the committee rejected President Reagan's proposal to tax the annual cash-value increases in life insurance policies. **********Earlier this month, the Associated General Contractors won a partial victory. The completed-contract method of accounting was preserved for smaller companies. **********An Appeal for Solar Greenhouses **********But not all campaigns appear to have been as effective. Last week, the Four Seasons Solar Products Corporation, based in Farmingdale, L.I., ran a full-page ''Open Letter to President Reagan'' in The New York Times urging the extension of the residential solar energy tax credit. The ad pointed out that the tax credit, which is scheduled to expire Dec. 31, has spawned a ''thriving new industry'' for residential solar greenhouses. **********In discussing the credit last Friday at a closed-door session, a committee member reportedly alluded to newspaper advertisements to call attention to the fact that greenhouses were eligible for the credit. A discussion ensued and in the end members decided to extend the solar credit, but they specifically excluded one item -greenhouses. **********Nonetheless, even some veteran lobbyists are turning to advertising for the first time this year. ''I don't know how effective it's going to be because we've never been involved with ads before,'' said Charls E. Walker, one of Washington's leading tax lobbyists and a former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon Administration. Mr. Walker's Coalition for Jobs, Growth and International Competitiveness, which includes such concerns as the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Weyerhaeuser Company, placed large ads in The New York Times, The Washington Post and the National Journal calling for retention of the investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation deductions. **********These types of ads by business groups have increased over the past week as the committee prepares to decide on major corporate issues in the next few days. Among the most prominent was a two-page ad placed by the National Association of Manufacturers last Thursday in The Washington Post. The ad had the headline ''Tax Reform Is on the Wrong Track'' and listed 1,750 companies that wanted major changes in some of the corporate proposals. The rate quoted by The Post's advertising department for such a two-page ad is $58,300. **********Campaign on Local Taxes **********The $1 million advertising campaign to protect the deductibility of state and local taxes, another issue that comes up this week, was waged two months ago by the Coalition Against Double Taxation. This television, radio and newspaper campaign was conducted in 15 states where committee members and House leaders were seen wavering on the issue. The ads were intended to spur constituents to contact their Congressmen. **********But many members of the committee downplay the influence these ad campaigns have on their ultimate decisions. **********''I think the grass-roots campaigns are more effective outside the committee,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California.

McFarlane, the President's national security adviser, hinted at the complexity of the hostage situation in remarks today in Colorado Springs to the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association. **********Mr. McFarlane said the announcement of the release of Mr. Weir had been delayed because of intelligence from the region suggesting that the remaining hostages were to be released soon. **********''Because today, in Lebanon, the competition, if you will, for custody over these people is fairly keen, between three and four different factions, we thought it possible that the awareness Sunday or Monday of Reverend Weir's release could intensify that competition and make it more difficult for the release of the others,'' he said. **********Mr. McFarlane added that there were ''literally half a dozen avenues that seem to hold some promise of help, but I wouldn't pretend they've worked; they haven't.'' **********Release by Israel **********Administration officials said the Syrian Government's attitude changed sharply after Israel this month released the final group of more than 750 Arabs, mostly Shiites, it had been holding in Atlit Prison near Haifa. **********''There's a great deal of activity going on,'' a senior official said. ''It picked up significantly after the last of the Atlit prisoners were freed.'' **********Another official said the Syrians believed that there had been a deal last June in which 39 American hostages taken from Trans World Airlines Flight 847 would be freed in exchange for the immediate release of the Shiites held by Israel. During the crisis President Reagan conferred by telephone with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria about ways to gain the hostages' freedom, and some officials later acknowledged that Mr. Assad had been instrumental in arranging for their release. **********When Syria saw in July that the Israelis were continuing to hold the Arab prisoners, their enthusiasm for negotiating the release of the remaining Americans cooled, an official said. **********Syria Assumed a 'Linkage' **********''The Syrians made the assumption there was a linkage,'' an official said. ''They said, 'You promised to let all of them go, and now you haven't.' '' **********United States officials insisted at the time that no deal had been struck. These officials said they had been pressing Israel to release the Shiites even before the T.W.A. plane had been hijacked and its passengers dispersed to houses in Lebanon. **********An official said the United States had been involved in intense diplomatic efforts to free the remaining hostages. He declined to provide details about many of what he said were key elements, but said the United States Government had been in contact through intermediaries with the Iranian Government. **********Officials said it was unclear whether Syria had played a decisive role in the release of Mr. Weir. **********A Sense of Momentum **********One official said the Reagan Administration was trying to continue the ''momentum'' created by Mr. Weir's release after 16 months in captivity. **********''We are working on the assumption that when you get momentum, you do everything you can to keep it going,'' he said. ''Nonetheless, this is the Middle East, and nothing ever happens as fast as you think it will.'' **********A senior intelligence source said the captors had continually moved the hostages around. Sometimes, he said, they have been placed in areas that the United States would be likely to attack if the Administration decided on military retaliation. **********This source said the movement of the hostages was done so openly that American analysts had concluded that it was intended as a warning against attacking the particular areas where they were held. ''Either that, or they are extraordinarly naive about the ways we gather information,'' the source said. **********An Administration official said that Mr. Weir had been debriefed extensively. Officials said, however, that his recollections could add only fragments to the murky picture of precisely who is holding the captives. **********The officials believe that Mr. Weir spent at least some time in a Lebanese Army barracks in the Baalbek area of the Bekaa region of Lebanon, which was taken over several years ago by Shiite forces. Among the groups that use the barracks, one official said, are the Party of God and a contingent of Iranian revolutionary guards. **********One group holding the hostages is believed to be connected to the Musawi clan of Baalbek. The demands made in several kidnappings in the region, including the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner last December in which two Americans were killed, have focused on the release of Shiites arrested in a series of truck bombings in Kuwait. **********Lebanese and American sources have said one of the groups reportedly holding the American hostages has a relative in prison in Kuwait. **********THE AMERICANS LEFT BEHIND **********Terry A.

Volcker delivers the Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy to the Senate Banking Committee today, credit market participants will of course be listening for clues to monetary policy decided at last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. **********But the Fed's willingness to provide funds to the banking system through temporary purchases of securities last Thursday and Friday convinced many specialists in the money markets that the central bank is holding policy stable. **********''The real issue is not so much what the Fed decided in February - I think everyone assumes that no real move to a tighter policy was made because that would make the dollar even stronger,'' said one Government securities trader. ''We will be listening to learn how willing the Fed is to bring the dollar down, how tolerant it will be if money supply growth remains above target and their outlook for the economy and inflation.'' **********Since late January, the rate on three-month Treasury bills has climbed to about 8.2 percent, from 7.7 percent, while the yield on new 30- year Treasury bonds rose to about 11.3 percent, from about 11 percent. At first, analysts attributed the rising interest rates to an adjustment in Fed policy that caused overnight interest rates to rise from about 8 1/4 percent to 8 1/2 percent. **********Moves to Raise Rates **********But more recent developments suggest that the Fed's adjustment, which has been so small that analysts have a hard time proving it, may have been a one-time shift, and not the first of a series of moves to raise interest rates. Much of the rise in long-term rates has been linked to this month's heavy supply of new Treasury notes and bonds. **********''It's premature to be worrying about a tighter Fed policy,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''There is no constituency in the Fed, in the banking system or in the real world for a tighter policy. The real question is, 'Will the Fed hold the status quo or look for a way to ease policy without being too obvious?' '' He noted that there are still weak sectors in the domestic economy, such as agriculture and some manufacturing businesses, which have been hard hit by the strength of the dollar. **********Fed officials have said recently that the dollar is an increasingly important factor in guiding monetary policy, but Wall Street observers say there are no hard and fast rules for predicting Fed policy. Fed officials have often said monetary policy is guided by the economy, inflation, interest rates, money supply growth and the strength of the dollar. How those concerns are weighted depends on circumstances and the judgment of Fed officials. **********When Mr. Volcker reviews 1984, he will undoubtedly point to solid achievements such as low inflation, a strong economy and within-target growth for the most important money supply measures. But the rosy past will be threatened, he may say, by the huge Federal budget deficits and strains in some sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and manufacturing, which have been hurt by the sharp rise in the dollar. **********Financial Stress on Economy **********The strong dollar has kept inflation low and benefited consumers by reducing the price of imports and inhibiting the ability of American companies to raise their prices, but it has brought financial stress to sectors of the economy that must compete with foreign goods, which become cheaper as the dollar rises. **********Many economists now warn that reducing the budget deficit is not the cure for the strong dollar. ''If the deficit is cut, the dollar will only get stronger,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Like many other analysts, he said a cut in the budget deficit would enhance the appeal of the dollar to foreign investors because it would remove the fear that the Federal Reserve would eventually be required to buy such a large portion of the Treasury's debt that money supply growth would surge and inflation would rise. **********Cutting the budget deficit may not solve the problem of how to bring down the dollar, but it was still cited as a primary reason why interest rates remain far higher than the inflation rate of 4 percent or slightly less in each of the past four years. **********Later in the year, Mr. Kellner said upward pressure on short-term rates might re-emerge, especially when the markets see that the budget deficit is not reduced and private business credit demands are growing. Other analysts argue, however, that long- term rates might still decline this year as investors become more confident that inflation will remain low."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/05/business/gulf-canada.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gulf Canada", "print_headline": "Gulf Canada", "body_text": " **********Gulf Canada Ltd. said it will continue to operate its Montreal East Refinery, which was scheduled to close Oct. 21, for another two months beyond the scheduled shutdown date.

A spokesman said the four terrorists had been taken into custody by Italian authorities. **********In a late evening news conference, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said President Reagan had ordered the dramatic military action after learning that Egypt had turned down repeated American pleas to prosecute the four gunmen and was flying them to freedom. The hijackers are believed to have killed an elderly American tourist aboard the cruise ship. **********No Shots Fired **********The United States intends to seek ''the prompt extradition'' of the hijackers from Italy, Mr. Speakes said. Later, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said the United States hoped the Italians would waive their right to try the hijackers and would allow them to be prosecuted in the United States. **********Mr. Speakes said that the Egyptian plane, a commercial 737 airliner with armed Egyptian security men aboard, was intercepted by the F-14's from the aircraft carrier Saratoga north of Egypt in international waters. The F-14's ''diverted'' the plane to a joint Italian-NATO base at Sigonella in Sicily. Mr. Weinberger said four F-14's were involved. **********The incident occurred without the American planes having to fire a shot, Mr. Speakes said. **********Troops Surround Plane **********He said the Egyptian aircraft had been headed for Tunisia but that the Tunisian Government had refused to grant it landing rights. For that, he said, the United States was grateful. Mr. Weinberger said the Egyptian plane had also been refused permission to land by authorities in Athens. **********After the Egyptian plane landed, it was surrounded by American and Italian troops, Mr. Speakes said. Mr. Weinberger said American forces had been prepared to use force to take over the plane, but apparently this was not necessary. Italian authorities agreed to take the four hijackers into custody along with two other Palestinians accompanying them, Mr. Weinberger said. **********He said the Italian authorities would investigate whether charges should be pressed against the other two Palestinians as well as the hijackers. The Egyptian plane and its crew and security guards would be permitted to fly back to Egypt, he added. **********There were many unanswered questions this morning. These included whether the F-14's would have fired at the Egyptian plane if it had refused to accompany them to Italy; what diplomatic messages went back and forth between Washington, Rome and Cairo in the hours preceding the interception; whether the military action was wholeheartedly supported by all of Mr, Reagan's advisers, and whether the American action would cause severe strains in ties with Italy and Egypt, or whether those countries welcomed the move. **********Mr. Speakes said that ''the terrorists aboard were taken into custody by Italian authorities.'' **********''We have been assured by the Government of Italy that the terrorists will be subject to the full process of law,'' he said. Mr. Speakes praised the Italians for their cooperation. **********In an effort to head off a serious rupture in relations with Egypt, Mr. Speakes praised the Egyptians for their efforts to save the lives of the other hostages on the hijacked ship, the Achille Lauro, but said that the United States ''strongly disagreed'' with Egypt on its decision to let the four gunmen go free. **********In Rome, senior Italian officials asserted that the transport of the hijackers to Italy was the result of an accord between the United States, Egypt, Italy and the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********But, said Mr. Speakes, ''I can categorically deny any deal between the United States and Egypt'' on the interception of the plane. **********The President approved the general decision to intercept the Egyptian plane while he was traveling in Chicago Thursday, Mr. Speakes said. Flying back aboard Air Force One to Washington at about 3 P.M., ''he approved the specifics of it,'' the spokesman said. **********Crucial to the mission was knowledge of the exact whereabouts of the four gunmen and when their plane left Egypt. Mr. Speakes said that ''we used every available means at our disposal to be aware of when the aircraft left Egyptian soil and then we were able to locate the aircraft, pursue it, persuade it to go to the airbase at Sigonella.'' **********The American pilots advised the Egyptian pilot by voice radio transmission to accompany them to Italy and he complied ''without incident,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********The most potentially disrupting aspect of the operation was the future reaction from Egypt, State Department officials said tonight. They said there had been no reaction as yet from Cairo. **********In discussing relations with Egypt, Mr. Speakes repeated that the United States had been distressed by the Cairo Government's ''independent'' decision to allow free passage to the hijackers after they surrendered to Egyptian authorities on Wednesday. **********But he added: ''The United States wants to emphasize the fundamental and durable interest that the United States and Egypt share, interests which transcends this difficult incident.'' **********'Trying Times' **********''These have been trying times for both our Governments,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''We will do all we can to ensure that basic U.S.-Egyptian relationship, in which both our countries have taken so much pride for so long, remains unaffected.'' **********Earlier Thursday evening, Italian officials confirmed that an Egyptian plane and a squadron of Navy fighters had been given permission to land at the joint United States-NATO air base in Sicily. Reagan Administraton and Congressional sources said the plane landed after President Reagan made a telephone call to Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy shortly before 6 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time, which is midnight Rome time. **********The whereabouts of the four gunmen had been a matter of intense discussion here and in Egypt throughout Thursday. **********President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said Thursday morning that the four gunmen, who surrendered on Wednesday, had been turned over to the Palestine Liberation Organization and had left Egypt. He said he believed that they might be in Tunis, where the headquarters of the P.L.O. is situated. The P.L.O. had denied that the gunmen were in Tunis. **********But Mr. Speakes said the Administration believed that the hijackers were still in Egypt at the time Mr. Mubarak said they had left. Officials said they believed that the gunmen were at an air base outside Cairo waiting for a flight to either Algeria or Tunisia. **********Mr. Speakes, in his comments during the day Thursday, repeated the American demand that the hijackers be prosecuted or extradited for the seizure of the Achille Lauro and the killing of Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year old New York resident who was reportedly shot to death and was apparently thrown overboard during the hijacking. **********Senior Administration officials said Thursday that the Administration understood that as of that morning Washington time - early afternoon in Cairo - the hijackers were at an Egyptian air base awaiting a flight to an undisclosed destination. They said the Egyptians seemed committed to carrying out their end of the bargain with the hijackers to let them have safe passage out of Egypt in return for surrendering the ship. **********Mr. Mubarak and other Egyptian officials had taken the public position that when they helped arrange those terms, which had the approval of Italy and the P.L.O., they believed the words of the ship's captain that all the passengers were safe. But American officials said the Egyptians and Italians should have been more wary, from the moment on Tuesday when the hijackers said they had killed two Americans. As it turned out, only Mr. Klinghoffer had been killed. The Achille Lauro was off the Syrian coast at the time. **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said: ''We hear our Egyptian allies say they made an agreement, so they have to let them go.'' **********''That's nonsense,'' he said.

Weiss, Democrat of New York, in whose Manhattan district Mr. Klinghoffer lived, introduced a resolution condemning the slaying and calling on President Reagan to convene an international meeting to determine steps ''to rid the world once and for all of hijacking and the taking of hostages.'' **********''The American people are filled with outrage that a 69-year old American, wheel-chair-bound, half of his body paralyzed by stroke, was executed and dumped into the sea,'' Mr. Weiss said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/20/world/drugs-change-face-of-a-mexican-tourist-mecca.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1985-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DRUGS CHANGE FACE OF A MEXICAN TOURIST MECCA", "print_headline": "DRUGS CHANGE FACE OF A MEXICAN TOURIST MECCA", "body_text": " **********For decades, tourists have come to this western city for its rich colonial heritage and Orozco murals, a glimpse of Mexico's history and culture. **********Starting in the 1960's, older Americans began to settle here, many drawn by the city's pleasantly slow pace and low prices. In the 1970's, investigators say, drug dealers came for the freedom. **********Until recently, when a United States narcotics agent was kidnapped and killed here, no one seemed to complain much. But perhaps as much as Mexico's economic boom of the late 1970's, investigators say, drugs changed the face of Guadalajara. **********Discos and Airplanes **********Glistening new hotels of concrete and glass soared into the skyline of Mexico's second-largest city. Fashionable new restaurants and discoth eques opened, catering to a select clientele that seemed to have money even after Mexico's economic crisis took hold. Investigators now say that drug traffickers were ''silent partners'' in many of these legitimate enterprises and continue to use them to conceal the origin of the enormous sums of money gained in the drug trade. **********Private planes, not belonging to any of the major corporations that have headquarters here, parked at the airport; walls went up enclosing huge, well-guarded estates of people whose sources of income were not entirely clear. ''Around here,'' a United States official said, ''you don't ask what your neighbor does for a living.'' **********The change, according to investigators, started in the mid-1970's, when joint efforts of the United States and Mexico, known as ''Operation Condor,'' pushed the drug traffickers out of strongholds in northern Mexico like Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa and Monterrey in Nuevo Leon. **********What the traffickers found in Guadalajara, investigators say, was a government willing to look the other way for the proper incentive and an underpaid police force amenable to any new manner of adding to its income. **********''They were probably welcomed by some people here,'' a United States official said. The way of life of the drug traffickers, he said, fit nicely into Guadalajara's rough-and-tumble ''macho'' image. **********But according to local residents, things quickly began to get out of control. ''Drug deals were being made out the backdoors of discos and restaurants, a local entrepreneur said. ''There used to be shootouts outside of my office at night.'' **********In 1976, the newly elected Governor of the state of Jalisco, Flavio Romero de Velasco, took things in hand, according to residents and investigators. Establishments with a reputation of drug-related activities were closed down. Word was circulated to drug traffickers to lay low. The police were limited in their ''freelancing.'' **********A ''depistolization'' campaign collected 6,000 to 10,000 guns, and although no one is quite sure what happened to them - investigators say they believe the guns were sold to El Salvador - the streets of Guadalajara quieted down. **********Drug Families United **********About the same time, however, Mexico's various drug families, which had long been at odds, quietly began to consolidate. ''Eight to ten years ago, these people were fighting each other,'' an investigator said. Suddenly, he added, it became ''like a big company - very modernized, with very up-to-date communications systems.'' **********In the succeeding years, according to United States and Mexican investigators, a young man named Rafael Caro Quintero and his family came to the fore. He is now believed to be one of the leaders of an interlocking group of traffickers that, according to United States drug enforcement authorities and the Mexican Attorney General's office, includes the organizations of Miguel Felix Gallardo, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, the Salcido Azueta brothers and Juan Matta Ballesteros, a Honduran national. **********Mr. Caro Quintero is now one of the prime suspects in the killing of the United States agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, and a Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. At age 32, a top investigator said, Mr. Caro Quintero's organization is worth ''not millions - billions'' of dollars, and he owns some 350 ranches around the country. **********His profile in Guadalajara is hardly a low one; a remarkable number of people can correctly point out his home here, or the 45-acre, high-walled estate he is building for himself in the hills overlooking the city. **********'A Wild Guy' **********Said by a top investigator to be a heavy cocaine user himself, Mr. Caro Quintero is described as ''a wild guy'' who travels in well-armed convoys and carries an AK-47 automatic rifle himself. **********''He loves what money can buy,'' the investigator said. ''Power has gone to his head.'' **********The city, many here say, remained in a state of apparent calm until Governor Romero de Velasco left office in late 1982 and was replaced by Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, the current Governor. Whatever power Mr. Romero Velasco wielded to quiet the drug traffickers did not appear to extend to his successor, according to investigators and residents. **********They said that links between narcotics traffickers and the police began to strengthen again, and that killings apparently related to the drug trade reappeared. The Mexican Government has now conceded that there are ''criminal links between narcotics traffickers and police agents,'' but the full extent of the connection has yet to be made clear. **********''From the day this guy got in,'' a Guadalajara businessman said, ''it was, 'open city, let's go.' '' **********A United States investigator who has worked in Guadalajara said that ''it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys here - they all carry badges.'' **********The Governor's office did not return repeated telephone calls requesting an interview. **********With tourism a major source of income here, of most immediate concern to law-abiding citizens here is the damage that the publicity over the case is doing to Guadalajara's image. Residents say it is unfair - that, much as in the case of Miami, those who do not dabble in illegal activities have nothing to fear. **********Of the six other Americans to vanish from the streets of Guadalajara since last December, American officials acknowledge that two of them were seen in tough late-night places that most tourists would fear to enter. The disappearance of the other four, who were Jehovah's Witnesses, was explained by one local newspaper by saying they were engaged in ''plainly illegal religious proselytizing.'' **********Tourism Is Down **********Nevertheless, the graceful colonial plazas for which the city is renowned today seem nearly bereft of American tourists, as do the hotel lobbies and dining rooms.

The loss was caused by huge loan charge-offs. **********Frank V. Cahouet, Crocker's chairman, said it was difficult to pinpoint any one area that was responsible for the loan charge-offs, except that agriculture and real estate loans played important roles. **********Analysts Stunned **********Bank analysts were stunned by the news. ''We were really surprised at the extent of the losses,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, first vice president and bank-stock analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********But the financial markets reacted calmly, mainly because Britain's Midland Bank, which owns 57 percent of Crocker's shares, announced yesterday that last Monday it covered the loss by injecting $375 million of new money into the California bank holding company, the 14th largest in the United States. **********The Crocker National Bank is the holding company's chief asset. Midland, which is planning to acquire Crocker's remaining shares, is the 15th-largest bank in the world. As a result of the loss, however, Midland said it was planning to change some details of its proposal, reducing the amount it will offer to the 20,000 stockholders who own 8.3 million of Crocker's 12.2 million of outstanding shares. **********At a news conference in San Francisco, Mr. Cahouet, who last March took over as chairman and chief executive of the bank, said that despite the announcement, Crocker had no trouble raising money yesterday from banks and other financial institutions. That was largely because Crocker's chief officers worked throughout the day to reassure the markets. The press conference was part of that strategy and Mr. Cahouet said that ''starting at 1 A.M. in San Francisco we were on the phone talking to our correspondent banks around the world.'' **********The estimated fourth-quarter loss would have been substantially larger if it had not been for a an $85 million profit from the sale of Crocker's San Francisco headquarters last month. **********One of Biggest Losses **********Bank analysts said that only the Continental Illinois National Corporation of Chicago and the Seafirst Corporation have reported larger losses for a year. **********Continental, which lost $1.16 billion in the second quarter, is expected to report a loss of more than $1 billion for 1984, and Seafirst lost $456.4 million in 1983. Both Continental and Seafirst almost failed; Continental was rescued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Seafirst was taken over by the BankAmerica Corporation of California. **********Other large losses by bank holding companies included $248.5 million in the third quarter of 1983 by the Interfirst Corporation of Dallas, which led to a loss of $172 million for that year, and a $71.8 million loss in the third quarter of this year by the First Chicago Corporation. **********First Chicago's loss came after a special examination by the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of federally chartered banks. Mr. Cahouet said that the Comptroller recently examined Crocker and agreed with the charge-offs, but said that the initiative was taken by the bank, not the regulator. **********Crocker's expected fourth-quarter loss came on top of a loss of $120.8 million in the first quarter. These losses were slightly offset by earnings of $6.1 million in the second quarter and $6.4 million in the third quarter. **********Since 1981, when Midland made its initial investment in Crocker, the California banking company has had a cumulative net loss of $200 million. It earned $62.9 million in 1981 and $71.6 million in 1982, but lost $10.4 million in 1983 and $324 million in 1984. **********$1.07 Billion Invested **********Midland's investment in Crocker, not counting the $375 million made Monday, totals $1.07 billion. **********The $375 million infusion of funds on Monday was done in two pieces. One involved the purchase of $250 million in newly issued preferred stock from Crocker, and the remaining $125 million was in the form of a one-year note. **********The estimated $215 million loss in the fourth quarter will result from a $326 million provision for loan losses, while actual charge-offs will be about $253 million. Loan charge-offs are deducted from the loan-loss reserve and do not directly affect earnings. They indirectly affect earnings because the reserve must be replenished. **********Some analysts said they believed that the huge write-offs were an attempt to allow Crocker's new management team, headed by Mr. Cahouet, a former senior officer of the Security Pacific Corporation, to start anew. **********The move also gave Midland an opportunity to reduce the amount it is offering for the 43 percent of Crocker's stock that it does not already own. Yesterday, Midland said it would reduce the stated value of the preferred stock it plans to swap for common stock to $27, from $30. Thus, if Midland decided to use its option to buy out the preferred stock, the payments would be made on the basis of $27 a share rather than $30. Crocker's stock closed yesterday at $24.25 a share, down $1.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Agreement Expected **********Crocker said yesterday that it expected to reach definitive agreement with Midland by mid-January on the British bank's purchase of the Crocker stock it does not yet own. That plan would have to be voted on by the stockholders and, if accepted, all shareholders would have to convert their common shares to preferred. **********In addition, Midland said it was dropping its proposal to pay an additional $3 a share if Crocker's earnings were to reach a specified level over the next few years. **********If Midland actually acquires all of Crocker's shares, as seems likely, its injection of funds into Crocker would merely represent a shift of money from a parent corporation to one of its subsidiaries - the money stays in the family. Of course, if Crocker were to lose more money, it would be a bigger loss for Midland, but if Crocker becomes profibable, it will be Midland's gain. **********Indeed, if Crocker recovers and eventually becomes a good earner, Midland's buyout of existing shareholders could be at an attractive price for the British bank. The $27 it is offering compares with a book value - the company's net worth - of $42.20 per share. That reflects the 1984 loss and is substantially below the book value of $58.82 at the end of 1983. **********In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Cahouet said that he expects Crocker eventually to be earning about 50 or 60 cents for each $100 of total assets. With assets now at about $22 billion, that would mean net income of between $100 million annd $200 million a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/21/world/south-african-trial-opens.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South African Trial Opens", "print_headline": "South African Trial Opens", "body_text": " **********The police arrested a dozen demonstrators outside a court today at the start of a trial of 16 people accused of treason by backing a revolutionary group aimed at overthrowing the Government.

Freedom Medicine is closely cooperating with other refugee and relief groups, including the International Rescue Committee, Direct Relief, the International Medical Corps and the French group Doctors Without Borders, Mrs. Brenner said. **********'Tenacious and Brave People' **********Mrs. Brenner said Freedom Medicine chose Afghanistan because ''the need was so obvious and so great.'' ''It wasn't being filled by anyone,'' she said.  ''The interest wasn't generated from any sort of anti-Russian sentiment, because we are really apolitical,'' she said. ''It's just that the Afghans are tenacious and brave people, and they deserve support for their efforts to help themselves.'' **********She said the group had raised about $20,000 in private donations toward first-year operating expenses, which are expected to come to $250,000. She said she expected the rest to come from Federal grants and individual donations. **********Members of the group are searching for a building at the Thal refugee camp to convert into a 30-bed medical unit. The building is to serve both as a training hospital and as a surgical center for Afghan refugees, Mrs. Brenner said. **********The program is to teach both medicine for combat situations and community health care. Rebel commanders are to select 200 to 300 people for a six-month training program. Then another group will arrive to replace them, Mrs. Brenner said. **********Steady Medical Supplies **********Under the group's plan, she said, the rebels will receive textbooks to take back into embattled areas for referral and will also begin getting regular deliveries of medical supplies for the first time. Steady deliveries are important, Mrs. Brenner said, because interruptions in the course of treatment may mean that patients do not heal completely and that the initial supplies have served no purpose. **********There have been other training programs, mostly in limited first aid, in Pakistan.

Wounded insurgents are known to walk for days, weeks or months to get treatment in Pakistan. ''We either get well or we die,'' a rebel fighter told the reporter who recently traveled in Afghanistan with a rebel convoy. **********The worst combat-related medical problems, Mrs. Brenner said, appear to be the loss of limbs or severe trauma from antipersonnel mines dropped by Soviet planes. **********''Limbs are wrapped, generally in a dirty old rag,'' she said, ''and the fighters are carried, usually by relatives, to the Pakistani border for treatment.'' **********Among the diseases prevalent in Afghanistan, she said, are tuberculosis, amoebic dysentery and malaria."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/world/us-prelates-surprised-but-pleased-over-synod.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1985-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. PRELATES SURPRISED BUT PLEASED OVER SYNOD", "print_headline": "U.S. PRELATES SURPRISED BUT PLEASED OVER SYNOD", "body_text": " **********American Cardinals, Bishops and theologians said yesterday that they were stunned by Pope John Paul II's announcement that he is calling an extraordinary synod of bishops to examine the results of the Second Vatican Council, which ended 20 years ago. But they welcomed the synod as an opportunity for bishops to discuss developments since Vatican II directly with the Pope. **********''It seems that the bishops didn't know about it,'' said William Ryan, associate public affairs secretary for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, D.C. ''It was a big surprise.'' **********The Pope made the announcement Friday and said the synod, to be held in Rome from Nov. 25 to Dec. 8, would seek to ''relive, in some way, that extraordinary atmosphere of ecclesiastical communion that characterized'' Vatican II. **********Pope John Paul has always praised Vatican II, which ushered in sweeping changes, both in the way the church saw its mission in the modern world and in church practices. It introduced liturgical changes such as the saying of mass in the vernacular and more active participation of the laity and placed a new emphasis on ecumenism and on religious liberty. **********Basic Doctrines Stressed **********But as early as his first sermon as Pope in 1978, John Paul has expressed concern that loyalty to Vatican II not affect loyalty to the basic doctrines of the church. **********Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, who as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops will attend the synod, learned of the synod only on Friday when he arrived in Montreal from Havana, where he had been visiting at the invitation of Cuban bishops. **********''The synod will give bishops an opportunity to work in a special way with the Holy Father to apply the insights and wisdom of Vatican II to present- day problems confronting the church,'' Bishop Malone said yesterday through a spokesman. ''I look forward to preparing for the synod and to contributing to it to the best of my ability.'' **********Not even Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, the only American on the Vatican advisory council for synods, knew about the Pope's decision in advance, but he too praised it. **********''From my experience of past synods, I know that this meeting will provide a unique instrument for reviewing, evaluating and furthering the goals of the Council,'' Cardinal Bernardin said in a statement through a spokesman. ''The synod is another moment for renewal.'' **********Some Reluctant to Speculate **********Some church leaders and theologians seemed reluctant to speculate on what would be on the synod's agenda. **********According to canon law, a special synod is called ''to deal with matters that require an immediate solution.'' But the Pope did not announce what those matters might be. **********''Will the synod deal with broad doctrinal issues that have been unresolved since Vatican II?'' asked the Rev. Donald R. Campion, spiritual director of Jesuit scholastics at Fordham University, who reported on Vatican II for the Jesuit magazine America. ''Or will it limit itself to discussing the nitty-gritty of Vatican II, such as clerical garb, marriage laws, the liturgy? All these issues require a lot of preparation and debate, and there is no speedy solution.'' **********Brooklyn Archbishop Comments **********Archbishop Francis J. Mugavero of Brooklyn, hospitalized for treatment of an infection, said through a spokesman: ''The synod will enable the church to apply the doctrinal and ecclesiastical wealth of Vatican II to the serious issues that have arisen over the pasty 20 years in our rapidly developing world, issues such as nuclear war, the decline in the number of priests and religious and ethical questions of divorce, abortion, death and dying.'' **********There was no agreement on whether the Pope would use the synod as a means to reinforce church discipline. **********Archbishop John J. O'Connor of New York said Friday that he believed the call for the synod reflected concern that Vatican II ''has been misinterpreted and perhaps misused.'' He said many Catholics no longer go to mass or to confession out of a mistaken interpretation of the Council's work. **********But Archbishop John R. Roach of St. Paul-Minneapolis, former head of the Conference of Bishops, stressed through a spokesman that ''any speculation that this is an effort to tighten discipline would seem to be premature.'' **********What most surprised some leaders of the American church is the short notice they have to prepare for the synod. Preparations for an ordinary synod, generally held every three years, begin as soon as the previous one ends and involve complicated drafting and revisions of working documents and lengthy consultations. Even deciding the agenda for a synod is a monumental task. **********Some church leaders also questioned privately just how much the synod can accomplish in a two-week period. The last synod, held in 1983, lasted four weeks. **********A synod, the highest form of consultation in the church, is an advisory body, and its recommendations can be overruled by a Pope. **********There has been only one other extraordinary synod.

It also cited job security promises in a handbook and other pertinent data that led the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to consider what it called ''the totality of circumstances'' resulting in ''an expressed contract'' not to dismiss Mr. Weiner ''without rehabilitation,'' according to Malcolm H. Davis of Levy & Davis, the lawyer handling Mr. Weiner's case. **********''How did I get lucky?'' Mr. Davis asked and then answered. ''We had the right fact patterns.'' The case had been in the courts since early 1979, and a decision is yet to be made on what Mr. Weiner might receive. **********Mr. Davis was quick to point out that few other cases have fared well in New York courts, where judges have indicated that remedies for termination ''at will'' should come through legislation. **********Calling the ''at will'' concept an area of change, Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration Association, said the idea that an employee might have recourse against dismissal at will when not covered by a specific union contract ''hardly existed 10 years ago.'' He added that ''even five to six years ago few companies realized the law was changing.'' **********In line with the new philosophy, many companies have been altering their personnel handbooks to eliminate possible implied promises of job security. **********However, one speaker at the ''at will'' seminar, Michael Baker, executive vice president of a consulting group called the Educational Fund for Individual Rights, said that on a more altruistic level companies were becoming concerned about improving the handling of employee grievances as a method of improving management and job security. He called it ''an effort to grapple with the problem rather than taking a defensive posture.'' **********For example, he cited the use by Federal Express of an appeal board of employees, with half its members selected by management and half by the concerned employee. **********Meanwhile, the Work in America Institute, led by its president, Jerome Rosow, has been stressing employment security. Mr. Rosow said in an interview that ''employment security is a hidden dimension in productivity.'' **********He explained that knowledgeable American companies ''want a compromise'' between the concept at some Japanese companies of granting lifetime employment and the tendency of American companies ''to terminate at will.'' **********''I think there is a growing awareness of the need for employment security,'' Mr. Rosow said. ''I think employment security is the hidden dimension in productivity,'' he added, saying that during the last recession there was a large-scale impact on basic industries and subsequent dismissals of large numbers of middle managers. **********''In a sense, this has elevated the issue above wages and benefits,'' he said. Citing the institute's new study on employment security programs at such leading companies as International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell, and Control Data, he said, ''Such programs are a feedstock to growth.'' **********Dr. Jocelyn F. Gutchess, an economist who did the study, said the ''policies which enhance employment security allow managers to maximize skills, technical know-how and creativity of their workers.'' **********Ways in which these companies try to insure employment security involve a variety of techniques - reassigning tasks, use of temporary workers in boom times, subcontracting of work outside the company, inventory building in lean times - all of which can be used to help smooth economic ups and downs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/23/business/business-digest-187454.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********TUESDAY, APRIL 23, 1985 **********Companies **********Pan Am agreed to sell its Pacific operations to United Airlines for $750 million, subject to approval by the various governments involved.

There is free and compulsory French education and excellent, subsidized medical care. The housing is substantial and the roads are well maintained. The people eat well and, according to Government officials, they are among the highest consumers of champagne in the world. **********Even the leaders of the main pro-independence groups, which operate openly here, running FM radio stations, publishing weekly newspapers and staging rallies and marches, say independence for Guadeloupe is probably many years away. **********Activities Stepped Up **********Nevertheless, they have been stepping up their activities, underscoring their demands with bombs and arson. They have found encouragement, too, in the success of separatists on the French-administered territory of New Caledonia in the South Pacific in getting debate started in the French National Assembly on the political status of their island. **********Henri Bangou, who is one of the leaders of the Communist Party in Guadeloupe and who has served as Mayor of Pointe-a-Pitre for 20 years, says he believes that the idea of independence is gradually taking hold in the minds of many of the island's 340,000 people. **********''But,'' he said in an interview, ''there is a difference between the idea of independence and giving support to a political program for immediate independence. The majority of the people of Guadeloupe do not accept the idea of immediate independence.'' **********The main reason, he said, is that people realize that without France the standard of living on Guadeloupe would plummet. The island, which from the air looks like a butterfly with its wings spread out on the sea, has little industry and production of its main crop, sugar cane, has been dwindling. Last year, Guadeloupe's sugar, rum, bananas and other farm exports earned only enough to cover about 15 percent of the cost of the goods it imported from France. **********Hardship Pay for Workers **********About 70 percent of all the money Guadeloupe takes in, the Mayor said, comes from the Government in France, much of it in the form of salaries for the 15,000 civil servants who, whether they are Europeans sent out from Paris or native islanders, are paid a 40 percent hardship bonus for serving outside continental France. **********The first French settlers landed in Guadeloupe in 1635. They wiped out the native Carib Indians, brought in tens of thousands of slaves from Africa and by the early 1700's had created one of the world's richest collections of sugar plantations. In 1946 the French Government changed the designation of Guadeloupe from colony to department, giving it locally elected representation in the National Assembly in Paris and, officially, the same status as the 95 departments of continental France. **********Most of the more than 70 bombings that the police have attributed to pro-independence revolutionaries since 1980 have occurred at symbolic sites such as Government buildings and statues late at night when no one was around. But last March 13, for reasons that are still not clear, a bomb exploded in a crowded downtown restaurant, fatally wounding three people, including the daughter of the president of the Chamber of Commerce here and an American tourist in town for a few hours from a cruise ship. **********The incident, for which no one claimed responsibility, horrified Guadeloupians, and the Popular Movement for the Independence of Guadeloupe, which the police say is the most violent of the revolutionary groups, has become divided over the efficacy of violence as a political tool. **********Bombings Called Useful **********Max Safrano, a 34-year-old supervisor in the French social security office here and one of the leaders of the Popular Movement for the Independence of Guadeloupe, said in an interview that he believed earlier bombings had been useful in ''waking up some people and letting the Government know we are serious.'' **********''You ask and you talk all day long and they don't listen,'' said Mr. Safrano, who has been jailed several times in connection with bombings and arson. ''Then when you throw two bombs under their tails they say, 'Watch it, something's happening.' '' **********But now, Mr. Safrano said, with fear and resentment in the air, it would be ''absolutely illogical'' to try to advance the cause of independence with more bombs. He acknowledged that not everyone in his organization agreed. **********Dr. Claude Makouk, the 48-year-old French-trained physician who heads the Popular Union for the Liberation of Guadeloupe, which is regarded as the most influential of the pro-independence groups, said in an interview that he endorsed nonviolence, but he said he worried that Mr. Safrano would not be able to control some of his more militant associates. **********Few Attend Rally **********Earlier this month, in the town of Capesterre, about 20 miles south of here, Mr. Safrano staged the first of what he hopes will be a series of outdoor rallies and cultural shows ''so the population can see the independence movement in a new light, not only as people who place bombs, but also as people who make proposals for the future.'' **********Fewer than 100 people turned out. A couple of blocks away, three times as many spectators watched young men racing go-carts that cost $1,200 each, more than workers on many Caribbean islands earn in a year. Nearby, in a modern, Government-subsidized apartment building, where a three-bedroom unit rents for $132 a month, a nurse preparing lunch for her family shooed a reporter away from her door. ''I'm not interested in independence,'' she said. **********Government officials say that the violence has hurt tourism and investment and that some wealthy people have been transferring large amounts of money to banks outside Guadeloupe. The police say they have found nothing to substantiate reports that Cuba and Libya are assisting the revolutionaries here. **********Unlike Britain, which has happily conferred independence on most of its colonies in the Caribbean in exchange for freedom from heavy financial burdens, France does not seem eager to cut its ties with Guadeloupe or its two other departments in the region, the island of Martinique to the south and French Guiana on the northeastern coast of South America, where there has also been talk of independence and a few bombs. **********Cultural Ties Stressed **********''It is not up to the Government to make a change, it is up to the people of Guadeloupe to make a change,'' said Maurice Saborin, the senior representative here of the Government in Paris. **********''In every election the population has registered a very important majority in favor of its attachment to France,'' Mr. Saborin said. ''As long as this situation does not change, the position of the Government will remain constant.'' **********Government officials say the expense of maintaining Guadeloupe far outweighs any economic benefits to France. ''But,'' Mr. Saborin said, ''the French presence here has a history, a cultural dimension, a significance that cannot be expressed in monetary terms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/business/smart-machines-get-smarter.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1985-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SMART MACHINES GET SMARTER", "print_headline": "SMART MACHINES GET SMARTER", "body_text": " **********NEARLY two decades after the first screening of ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the specter of HAL, the omniscient but soulless computer, still haunts programmers in artificial intelligence laboratories. **********''It was a great movie,'' said Gary G. Hendrix, who has spent the past decade toiling to make computers respond to vague human commands. ''But it led people to jump to incredible conclusions.'' Now, he complained, ''there is a backlash of disappointment. People who thought we could make computers do everything are wondering if we can make them do anything.'' **********Reality is beginning to set in around the mystic art of artificial intelligence. What the public expected -fueled in part by science fiction and self-promoting entrepreneurs - were computers that could replicate human abilities, that could understand simple conversation, see and, most important, reason. But even as the first artificial intelligence labs sprouted in the backyards of M.I.T., Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, it became clear that the roadblocks to commmercial applications would prove far greater than imagined. **********Only now is artificial intelligence beginning to break out of the lab and into factories, offices and homes - and in a very different form than nearly everyone expected. Rather than creating human-like computers that can do it all, the industry is subtly incorporating bits and pieces of artificial intelligence techniques into otherwise ordinary software. The goal is to make computers far easier to use for neophytes and far more efficient for experienced users. **********''It's beginning to dawn on everyone that A.I. is a set of technologies, not a distinct product,'' said Esther Dyson, the computer industry critic who is devoting more space in Release 1.0, her influential newsletter, to the practical applications of artificial intelligence. **********What is emerging is a new generation of ''smart'' software in which the artificial intelligence lies invisibly buried. Unlike the solitary HAL, these programs crave company: They ask questions, remind and cajole. Included among them are ''smart'' financial spreadsheets that respond to plain English, ''expert systems'' that diagnose the trouble with a balky automobile engine or interpret an electrocardiogram in a doctor's office, and word processors that offer stalled writers ideas for crafting the next paragraph. **********Enhanced by artificial intelligence, new programs - like the Ansa Corporation's Paradox and Symantec Corporation's Q&A -suggest that there could be big changes ahead in how computer users interact with their machines. The effects are likely to be felt from the back rooms of insurance brokerages to the war room of the Pentagon. **********''Will computer users know that this is artificial intelligence?'' asks S. Jerrold Kaplan, who is heading up an intensive project to exploit A.I. technologies at Lotus Development Corporation, the maker of the enormously successful Lotus 1-2-3. ''Maybe. Will they care? Probably not.'' So far, the artificial intelligence business is tiny, and it is nearly impossible to guess its potential. Assessing the value that artificial intelligence adds to software is as difficult as estimating the contribution that special effects make to a hit movie. **********Befitting such a small industry, the pioneers are hardly household names. Most are still privately held. The major exceptions are Symbolics, a spinoff of M.I.T.'s artificial intelligence laboratory that makes specialized hardware, and Intellicorp, a software firm specializing in expert systems. The stock prices of both have soared in recent months despite the computer industry's downturn, but analysts remain cautious about investments in the infant industry. **********Some of the biggest forces in office computers, however, are racing to grab a stake, particularly in A.I. hardware. Xerox and Texas Instruments both introduced new specialized artificial intelligence computers this year, primarily for developing new applications using the computer language preferred by most artificial intelligence developers, called LISP. The specialized machines cost $10,000 and up, and many industry experts suggest that artificial intelligence may not flower until most programs embodying it are designed to run on ordinary desktop computers. Only now are advanced personal computers becoming sufficiently powerful to handle the task. **********Meanwhile, non-computer companies, too, are showing a keen interest in the field. General Motors and Ford have spent millions recently to buy into the talents of small artificial intelligence start-ups that they hope will make factory operations vastly more efficient. Defense contractors, hoping to build smarter tanks and the computer systems that could become the core of a ''Star Wars'' defense system, are already doing the same. **********In fact, virtually all the major advances in artificial intelligence research so far, have stemmed from Pentagon-funded research. Since the 1960's, when most companies viewed the technology as science fiction, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency saw its potential. ''Very few people realize the degree to which A.I. is owned by the Department of Defense,'' said Mr. Kaplan. Now industry is financing more of work itself, partly in response to Japan's Fifth Generation project, an effort to leapfrog American No. 1 position in artificial intelligence. But Mr. Kaplan and others worry that new Defense Department projects will siphon away too much of the industry's scarce human talent. **********Already, artificial intelligence has brought a new sort of talent into the computer industry. So unusual are the problems, so diverse the solutions, that traditional computer scientists find themselves at something of a disadvantage. ''If you look at who did the personal computer development work, it was a bunch of nerdy engineers,'' Miss Dyson said. ''A.I. has nerdy engineers, but also philosophers, psychiatrists, neurobiologists and English teachers.'' **********And it has its charlatans. ''Artificial intelligence'' may win the prize as the computer industry's most abused buzzword, affixed to everything from toy robots to ordinary tax-planning software. Frequently it is no more than an advertising ploy, an effort to capture the aura of HAL. ''It's becoming an axiom of the software industry that every chief executive has to say he's working on A.I.,'' says Edward Esber, the chief executive of Ashton-Tate, a leading personal-computer software firm that says it's working on artificial intelligence. ''Otherwise, we'd feel impotent.'' **********Separating the real from the imaginary is particularly difficult because no one has yet come up with a workable definition of what artificial intelligence is. Experimental techniques that riveted the attention of A.I. specialists a decade ago draw yawns today. ''Once it works,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, the editor of the Technologic Computer Letter, ''it's just good computer science.'' **********If all this has left ordinary computer users a bit mystified, they are in good company. ''Most people in artificial intelligence who have had a glass of wine,'' said Alan Kay, the technology guru of Apple Computer Inc., recently, ''will tell you that they do not actually understand it much either.'' **********THE PLAIN-SPEAKING PROGRAM **********Stored in the United States Navy's giant computer systems is a data base that follows the movements of 40,000 ships around the world - destroyers and oil tankers, American submarines and, more important, Russian ones. But as Navy officials started conceding 10 years ago, extracting that information meant mastering obscure computer languages that could only slow decision-making in battle conditions. **********Solving that problem gave Gary Hendrix, once the director of natural language at the Stanford Research Institute, his start. In the early 1970's, with three-quarters of a million dollars in Defense Department funds, his team developed a system called LADDER. It allowed Navy officers to ask simple questions, such as: ''What ships are within 500 miles of the John F. Kennedy and what are their weapons systems?'' The answer could be displayed on a map. **********''When you are under pressure, falling back on your native tongue is really useful,'' Mr. Hendrix says. Now, at a small Silicon Valley company called Symantec, which he helped found, he is applying ''natural language'' principles to personal computers. Symantec's new program, which is called Q&A and came out in September for $299, appears to be the most advanced in the field. **********The personal computer industry has more than a little riding on Q&A and its ilk. To pull out of the industry's severe slump, many analysts believe, hardware and software companies must attract a new kind of user - people with no patience for learning computer-ese. **********The irony is that software executives are wringing their hands over this problem at just the time when they are pushing the technology further, with programs that are larger, more powerful and more complex. ''This notion that software is somehow getting easier to use is dead wrong,'' contends Mr. Esber, the head of Ashton-Tate, which manufactures the popular dBase. **********Natural language programs are a step toward solving the problem: They make computers more approachable - to a limited degree - by translating vague English phrases into specific computer commands. **********With programs like Q&A, or the Microrim Inc.'s Clout, which came out last year, an executive can talk to a computer the way he would talk to a personnel officer. For example, a tight-fisted chief trying to prune his budget can ask, ''Who earns more than $40,000, and where do they live?'' If the chief thinks there are too many people earning those wages, Q&A allows him to go a step further: He can actually change the data. When the boss says, ''Cut all their salaries by 25 percent,'' the data base - and the employees' paychecks - are dutifully adjusted. **********But no natural language program, particularly one built for a personal computer's limited memory, is fluent. Q & A comes with a basic vocabulary of only about 500 words, and conversation cannot stray from the familiar terms used in the data base. (Thousands of words can be added to the system, however.) Furthermore, parsing a sentence with Q&A and translating it into computer language is so slow that a user might just as well brew a cup of coffee while the computer is doing the task. And ask for ''Ted's salary and Lynn's address'' and you will also get Ted's address and Lynn's salary. **********Already, software companies worried about expanding their markets are racing to get natural language ability. On Tuesday, Lotus announced that it would buy the GNP Development Corporation, a tiny Pasadena, Calif., company run by two brothers, Bill and Larry Gross. After a brief foray in selling stereo loudspeakers, the two Cal Tech graduates switched into software. Earlier this year, they began spending 20-hour days, amid personal computers and pizza boxes, disassembling Lotus 1-2-3 and re-writing portions so that users could ask it plain-English questions. They were so successful that Lotus reportedly paid between $2 million and $4 million for GNP. **********''When I saw this, I was really knocked off my feet,'' said Lotus's Mr. Kaplan. ''They did things to 1-2-3 we didn't think could technically be done.'' **********Lotus won't say when it will bring out GNP's first product, which the Gross brothers, ages 24 and 27, had planned to call -what else - HAL. **********LETTING THE MACHINES DO THE REASONING **********Richard L. Schwartz and Robert E. Shostak look like Silicon Valley, California, computer hackers. They sport shaggy beards and wander around the office in blue jeans, usually with a can of soda in hand. For three years, they buried themselves in their attics at night, one in San Mateo and the other in nearby Menlo Park, zipping fragments of computer code to each other electronically as they struggled to break new ground in computer programming. ''If Woody Allen were doing a spoof of Silicon Valley,'' joked one associate, ''these are the guys he would cast.'' **********Looks are deceiving, however. Early personal computer entrepreneurs started from scratch, growing successful by disregarding the programs and computer designs that guided companies making giant mainframes. But the 31-year-old Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Shostak, who is 37, have taken a different tack, applying artificial intelligence techniques first used in mainframes to improve personal computers data bases. **********They have come up with what industry experts call a second-generation program, one that - like a good improvisational actor -begins to perform on its own after a fleeting glance at its director. **********The data base, called Paradox and created by Mr. Schwartz's and Mr. Shostak's Ansa Corporation, enables a sophisticated computer user to retrieve information without having to issue explicit directions to the computer. By tapping one of the most useful and versatile techniques in the artificial intelligence grab-bag, a system developed by I.B.M. called ''query by example,'' the program lets a computer user point out where he wants to go and lets the computer do the driving. **********Consider the case of an auto parts wholesaler who keeps a log of his sales representatives and the orders they have received in one file, and an up-to-date account of inventories and part numbers in another. Suppose he wants to create a single list that will compare the orders for each part with the number he has on hand. That means merging the data on two lists and sorting it in a specific sequence. **********Even using a sophisticated data base, such as Ashton-Tate's dBase II, he would have to issue precise instructions, probably in an obscure computer language. With Paradox, however, he would simply place little electronic checkmarks next to examples of the entries that need to be combined. Then the program begins to work its logical magic. **********''It looks for relationships between the data that you checked,'' said Mr. Shostak. ''Then it begins to write a program automatically, the same kind of program you might otherwise be asked to write.'' **********But the user never even sees the program being created. Nor does he see it being honed to sort the data in the fastest way possible. He simply gets his list, with no added complications. ''The trick,'' Mr. Schwartz said, ''is to write a program that doesn't depend on humans for instructions about how to do everything. Instead, you can be vague, and give it just a general idea.'' **********Like natural language programs, so-called machine reasoning software makes computers easier to use. But the similarity ends there. Natural language enables novices to get information out of a computer - albeit slowly - when they know little or nothing about the data stored in the machine. By contrast, machine-reasoning programs like Paradox let experienced users work at very high speed but require them to know exactly what they want. The auto parts distributor, for example, would have to know what information about inventories and orders is stored in his computer and why it is important. **********No one is ready to guarantee that Paradox will catch on, despite a list of influential venture capital investors that includes Benjamin M. Rosen, who provided the initial funding for Lotus. Retailers are wary about taking on new software these days and dBase has already captured a loyal following, making it nearly impossible to displace. **********But Paradox is considered important because it is an evolutionary step, away from the concept that a computer blindly executes instructions, and toward programs that interpret intentions. **********What could come next for machine reasoning is the design of ''software robots,'' and work is already feverishly under way, from Lotus's headquarters on the edge of the M.I.T. campus to Hewlett-Packard's research center across the road from Stanford. The software robots, really just programs that act as a computer user's secretary or accountant, would simulate the reasoning powers of a semi-bright office assistant. **********For example, a research robot might notice that its human boss was outlining a speech about zoology. Picking up on some key words in its master's computer directory - like ''lion,'' ''tiger'' and ''bear'' - it might prompt the executive with a question like, ''Would you like me to do some research into what has been published recently about lions, tigers or bears?'' **********If the answer is yes, the machine might write a small program - or call upon an existing one - to search the electronic research services, like Nexis, for relevant material. And an advanced robot might draw on its base of knowledge to point out why some facts about those animals are more important than others, further honing the executive's thinking. **********Some experts contend that software that looks over one's shoulder might prove more annoying than useful. But some ideas are definitely appealing. An electronic travel assistant, for example, could scan an itinerary and automatically call up the Official Airline Guide, which lists flight options. A secretarial assistant program could sort electronic mail or telephone messages, putting the most important on top. Or, preprogrammed with the computer user's daily schedule and a knowlege of his or her working habits, it could negotiate meeting times. **********''These are all things that a human assistant would pick up to do instinctively,'' says Ira P. Goldstein, who is directing a $30 million to $50 million project to develop such robots for Hewlett-Packard. ''The question,'' adds Mr. Goldstein, who was a philosophy and mathematics major at Harvard and has spent the last 15 years attempting to depict knowledge in software, ''is whether we can instruct computers the way we instruct people - by inference and metaphor.'' **********TURNING COMPUTERS INTO EXPERTS **********Aldo Cimino is nearing retirement, and not long ago the Campbell Soup Company started to get worried. Mr. Cimino, with 44 years at the company, is one of the few employees who know everything there is to know about the 72-foot-high ''cookers'' that fill up to 850 soup cans a minute. **********So late last year, a gaggle of software engineers began interviewing Mr. Cimino, attempting to organize and codify a lifetime of experience about canning. The idea was to capture his expertise in an inexpensive computer system that could diagnose problems instantly by asking maintainence workers a few questions. **********''You have only a short period of time to correct the problem. Otherwise you lose the soup,'' Mr. Cimino explained patiently last month to a televised symposium on ''expert systems.'' The symposium was produced by Texas Instruments, which also designed Campbell's program. **********More than 34,000 people, including roomsful of production experts at General Motors, tuned in to that all-day symposium - clear evidence of industry's growing interest in expert systems. Although far less dazzling than the other major artificial intelligence techniques used today, expert systems have the most commercial applications. **********''Five years ago you would have gotten 500 people at a symposium like that, at the most,'' said Mark S. Fox, who is the director of Carnegie Mellon's Intelligent Systems Laboratory. **********Already, a small sub-industry of the software business has emerged to design expert systems, supported chiefly by companies trying to cut manufacturing costs. Two months ago, Ford said it would invest up to $28 million for a 10 percent stake in the Carnegie Group, formed by Mr. Fox and three faculty colleagues, and in the Inference Corporation, of Los Angeles. Carnegie is already at work, building a diagnostic system that would track down problems with engines and transmission systems, for use in Ford dealerships. **********General Motors and Procter & Gamble are also in the game; each has an 11 percent stake in Teknowledge Inc., which sells programming ''shells'' -the basic ingredients from which a company can design its own expert systems. I.B.M. just entered the race, selling a shell of its own. **********Meanwhile, startups like Palladian Software and Applied Expert Systems, both in Cambridge, Mass., sell ready-to-use financial adviser programs with built-in expertise. Palladian's is aimed at corporate managers performing cost-benefit analyses, while Applied's program helps financial institutions design financial plans for clients. That $50,000 program, which runs only on the new Xerox computer, churns out a 75-page report analyzing the client's net worth, and recommending cash management, tax strategies, retirement and estate planning. **********Virtually all expert systems work on the same principle. They try to boil down knowledge into a highly structured outline, which then is converted into a number of ''if-then'' rules. At Campell Soup, if the problem is temperature deviation within the cookers, the program will ask maintenance workers a series of technical questions about the status of valves, cooling sprays and the like. What follows is the ''then'' - perhaps an instruction to replace a specific valve. **********Such principles have been applied to a wide range of problems. Some of the oldest systems have been used by doctors to diagnose lung disease, among other things. Digital Equipment Corporation uses an expert system to analyze the equipment needs of large computer users, and another to allocate components to workers building VAX 8600 superminicomputers. Northwest Orient Airlines has a system to evaluate how many discount and full-price seats it should offer on each flight to maximize profits. **********But those systems, users admit, are no panacea. When Hewlett-Packard started designing an in-house system to solve problems in its semiconductor fabrication plants, it discovered that its top experts disagreed on several key points. It solved that problem, only to find unexpected problems in a second facility where the system was installed. **********More important, experts learn from their mistakes; expert systems do not. They need to be reprogrammed when something goes awry or the problem changes. ''Learning is still a third dimension,'' notes Mr. Goldstein of Hewlett-Packard, ''We haven't really approached that yet.'' **********ELUSIVE VISION **********For years, software engineers have believed that computers do worst what people do best. No field of artificial intelligence proves the rule more emphatically than machine vision, the effort - so far largely unsuccessful - to give computers not only the power of sight, but the power of recognition as well. **********The problem, quite literally, is that computers cannot see the forest for the trees. Humans can instantly sift the important from the trivial; they will usually pay more attention to a car hurtling at them rather than an 18-story building in the background. But vision systems usually suck in everything in sight. Then, bit by painstaking bit, they try to distinguish objects from one another and identify them. **********''It's much, much more complex than what people expected 10 or 15 years ago,'' said Daniel Sabbah, the senior manager of artificial intelligence systems at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Laboratory in Yorktown, N.Y. **********Mr. Sabbah repeated the widely told tale about Marvin Minsky, the founder of M.I.T.'s artificial intelligence lab who by some estimates trained nearly a third of all the nation's leading A.I. scientists. Long ago, the story goes, Mr. Minsky asked a graduate student to solve the problem of machine vision ''as a summer project.'' The result? ''He didn't make it,'' Mr. Sabbah smiled. **********Today, most work on vision is still being done in university research labs. Truly versatile commercial products still appear at least a decade away, even for companies with particular interest in such clearly connected products as sight-guided robots. **********In retrospect, the early optimism arose from great strides in the 1960's in pattern recognition - the technology behind supermarket cash register lasers. But almost all those systems involve high-contrast scenes and objects that can be compared with a limited library of shapes and sizes stored in a computer's memory. **********Far more complex are the shades of gray and unusual shapes in the real world. Consider, for example, the seemingly simple task of recognizing a cat sitting on a chair. The computer would first have to distinguish the outline of the cat from the upholstery, still no easy trick. Then, more likely than not, it would have to reach into its file of ''four-legged things,'' trying to determine if this was an elephant, a horse, a dog - or even a chair. **********''We don't even know how to represent a cat in the computer's memory,'' said Mr. Sabbah. ''We can enter an iconic representation, but the computer would still need the power to generalize - there are cats of different colors and sizes, tigers and house cats, even cartoon cats.'' **********But the stakes for solving those problems are enormously high. On the factory floor, machine vision would mean that robots would no longer have to be programmed with excruciating precision, told to pick something up at one coordinate and drop it off at another. Rather, they could roam, operating with only general instructions. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has funded much of the pioneering work in artificial vision, hopes to give the same powers to an ''autonomous land vehicle,'' essentially a pilotless tank that could follow a clear, well-defined road and avoid obstacles. A prototype is being built by Martin Marietta. **********Now, specialists are trying to interconnect symbols stored in memory the way neurons connect ideas in the brain. Silicon circuits, they note, can operate up to a million times faster than neurons. But the brain easily outdistances the electronic circuitry because it can perform thousands of operations at once. Most computers, in contrast, plod along one operation at a time, creating huge information bottlenecks. In fact, Mr. Sabbah says, ''the brain may be the best parallel processor we've got.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/07/world/thai-forces-clash-with-vietnam.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 375, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THAI FORCES CLASH WITH VIETNAM", "print_headline": "THAI FORCES CLASH WITH VIETNAM", "body_text": " **********Thai troops and aircraft attacked Vietnamese forces that had crossed the border in an effort to surround the last major Cambodian resistance camp, the Thai Army said today. **********The Thais said they had driven the Vietnamese troops from one of three hills the Vietnamese tried to seize and had killed 60 soldiers.

''It helps clear the air, and eliminates one of the uncertainties we faced.'' **********Following the regular auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills totaling $14 billion next Monday, the Treasury on Tuesday will auction four-year notes due March 31, 1989,totaling $6.25 billion. On Wednesday, the Government plans to auction $5.75 billion of seven-year notes due April 15, 1992, followed on Thursday by a $4.25 billion auction of 20-year bonds due May 15, 2005. All three will be available in minimums of $1,000. **********When-Issued Trading **********Late yesterday, government securities dealers offered the new four- year issue on a when-issued basis with a yield of 11.51 percent, while the seven-year notes were quoted at 11.93 percent and the 20-year bonds were at 12.13 percent. **********In advance of today's $9 billion auction of new two-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the notes with a yield of 10.84 percent, down from 10.90 percent a day earlier. Among issues outstanding, the 11 1/4 percent bonds due in 2015 were offered at 94 30/32, up nearly 1/2 point, to yield 11.87 percent. **********Funds raised by the financing will be used to repay nearly $3.4 billion of maturing four-year notes and raise about $12.8 billion of new cash to finance the Federal budget deficit. Known to government securities dealers as the ''mini-refunding,'' next week's auctions conform to the Treasury's established pattern of selling four-, seven- and 20-year issues late in the last month of each calendar quarter. **********Still Higher Than January **********Although rates declined yesterday, they remain well above the levels of late January. The 11.87 percent yield for 30-year Treasury bonds, for example, is up from a low of about 11 percent, and yesterday's 8.56 percent rate for three-month Treasury bills is up from 7.76 percent on Jan. 28. **********Most explanations for the rise in rates dwell on the widespread perception that the economy is growing at a brisk rate that will inevitably mean stronger credit demands and upward pressure on interest rates. In addition, some, but not all, analysts say that the Federal Reserve's decision in January to stop encouraging lower interest rates will be followed later this year by a decision to begin encouraging higher interest rates. **********Despite the higher rates in recent weeks, other analsyts say that market particpants have overreacted. Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank, said: ''The fears of Fed tightening and an overheated economy have been vastly exagerated.'' He added that the manufacturing sector of the economy was very weak, with some sectors, such as new orders for capital goods, ''actually signaling a recession.'' **********James J. Lowrey, head of an investment banking firm of the same name, said that ''there are a lot of favorable developments'' that may have been overlooked in recent weeks. ''Inflation is still low, with no prospects for a demand-pull rise in prices,'' he said, adding, ''Right now I am more concerned about a real economic slowdown than about too rapid a growth rate.'' **********If analysts such as Mr. Lowrey are correct, a large supply of new issues would not necessarily prevent prices from rising, and yields from falling.

Richman, the chairman of Dart & Kraft Inc., sees it, Americans have embraced two contradictory fads. On one hand, they are gorging on luxurious, calorie-laden foods as never before. But at the same time, they are becoming health and fitness enthusiasts. **********Dart & Kraft, the huge food and consumer goods conglomerate, is trying to capitalize on these conflicting trends. It has just bought Frusen Gl\"adje, the manufacturer of the creamy, cholesterol-rich ice cream - but it has also acquired Borg, a company that makes bathroom scales for the calorie-conscious. **********Similarly, Dart & Kraft has purchased Lender's frozen bagels, in hopes of expanding the market for that tasty though heavy bread - but its West Bend division has also bought Precor, a manufacturer of exercycles and rowing machines for those who want to work off the calories from their bagels and ice cream. **********''Two interesting trends are going on at the same time,'' Mr. Richman said. ''We are trying to be part of both. **********'Calories and Cholesterol' **********Kraft, which contributes about 70 percent of Dart & Kraft's revenues, markets such household names as Cracker Barrel and Velveeta cheeses, Parkay margarine, Breakstone cottage cheese, Breyers and Sealtest ice cream and Light N' Lively yogurt. But Kraft's horizons have become clouded because cheese demand is only inching up slowly and because the Federal Government has flooded the market with excess cheese. **********''Nothing in all of Kraft is growing fast,'' said Robert Back, an analyst with Rodman & Renshaw in Chicago. ''The problem is everything Kraft sells is loaded with calories and cholesterol.'' **********Mr. Richman disagrees: ''We have a good number of low-fat products that consumers are looking for - low- calorie salad dressing, low-fat cottage cheeses,'' he said. ''But those same consumers also like to treat themselves to something that tastes very good - croissants are part of it, and so are superpremium ice creams like Frusen Gl\"adje.'' **********Dart & Kraft's recent flurry of acquisitions came as no surprise to many Wall Street analysts who were aware that many of the company's basic lines - Kraft cheeses, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Tupperware - are mature. Indeed, Dart & Kraft's sales inched up just five-tenths of 1 percent, to $9.76 billion, last year, while its net income rose 5 percent, to $456 million. **********'Very Predictable' **********''Their mainstream products have become very predictable,'' said John Bierbusse, a food analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ''They're trying to find some attractive niches that offer some growth potential.'' **********Dart & Kraft's recent purchases are part of a jigsaw puzzle-like restructuring effort begun in 1980 when Dart Industries merged with Kraft Inc. Since then, the company has divested itself of many small, low- growth, low-return businesses, especially industrial businesses that were part of the late Justin Dart's empire. **********At the same time, using money from divestments as well as cash on hand, the company has moved decisively to purchase small, but flourishing companies: It has bought 8 in the last 15 months. In this way, the 57- year-old Mr. Richman hopes to increase his company's return on equity, which reached 16.5 percent in 1984. The company has not disclosed the terms involved in the acquisitions. **********Mr. Richman, whose office is on the top floor of one of the palatial corporate headquarters astride the superhighways north of Chicago, said Dart & Kraft was not trying to become ''trendy'' or ''upscale'' in buying Frusen Gl\"adje and Lender's, or in purchasing one of the choicest companies on the block - Celestial Seasonings. The last is the leading producer of herbal teas, the lifeblood of the health-conscious. Rather, he said, Dart & Kraft is simply looking for a way to rejuvenate itself. **********''One of the ways to grow in the food business is through add-on or buy- and-build acquisitions,'' said Mr. Richman, a lawyer who used to be the company's general counsel. ''The fact that we selected Frusen Gl\"adje is not because it's upscale, but because upscale is the fastest-growing part of the food business.'' **********Building a Future **********Although some analysts say Frusen Gl\"adje, Celestial Seasonings and other recent purchases are inconsequential drops in a $10 billion bucket, Mr. Richman said: ''You have to add them all up. Remember, there was once the first jar of Miracle Whip. All these things started somewhere.'' **********''We're trying to build for the future,'' he added. ''You have to replenish a business every day.'' **********Mr. Back of Rodman & Renshaw says Kraft has two options - both of which it has begun to pursue in the past year. First, he said, Kraft can ''take a Velveeta or Miracle Whip and try to whip it up again.'' This Kraft is trying to do with its recent introductions of a reduced-calorie Miracle Whip salad dressing, a Velveeta shells and cheese dinner, a Mexican Velveeta and a salsa variety of Cheez Whiz. **********Kraft's second option is to acquire companies, Mr. Back said, and he and most other analysts have praised its recent purchases. **********A Perfect Couple **********For marketing purposes, Lender's bagels is a match made in heaven with Kraft's Philadelphia cream cheese, many analysts say. Moreover, said Steven Carnes, a food analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, the Lender's acquisition was far-sighted because it moves Kraft into the non-dairy frozen food case in the supermarket. ''They have to be in that area over time because it's one of the growth areas in the food industry,'' Mr. Carnes said. **********As for Celestial Seasonings, Mr. Carnes said Kraft could milk that well-known name by introducing a line of Celestial Seasonings' herbal salad dressings. **********Mr. Carnes said that last month's acquisition of Frusen Gl\"adje, which is based in Lindenhurst, L.I., was a logical addition to Kraft's other ice cream operations because premium ice cream has grown in market share to 20 percent, from 3 percent in 1980. **********''There's nothing like selling ice cream for $15 a gallon,'' said Mr. Back of Rodman & Renshaw. ''The problem is, the market for superpremium ice cream may prove very limited.'' **********Regional Expansion Sought **********Mr. Richman says Dart & Kraft's strategy is to use its distribution and advertising muscle to push Celestial Seasonings, Lender's and Frusen Gl\"adje into more regions and supermarkets. **********''Bagels have 42 percent household penetration east of the Appalachians, but 7 percent west of them,'' Mr. Richman said.

At that moment, bottles, stones and bricks came flying at him. **********As he was hurried away, gangs of youths overturned cars and set fire to several buildings with gasoline bombs. **********Riots Shocking, Thatcher Says **********Mr. Hurd had been dispatched to Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city, by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who called the rioting shocking. **********On Monday, authorities said black youths, mostly of West Indian descent, as well as whites rampaged through Handsworth, looting Asian-owned stores and starting fires. Tonight the violence was more sporadic - torching of cars, attacks on policemen - but it spread beyond Handsworth into adjacent inner-city neighborhoods. **********Police officials described the outbreak as the worst inner-city street violence since 1981, when riots flared in 20 towns and cities. **********The Lozells Road area of Handsworth, where the rioting Monday night was centered, is home to many unemployed, especially young people, and drug use is said to be widespread. Authorities said unemployment in Handsworth, which is inhabited mainly by black and Asian immigrants, was 55 to 60 percent compared with a national average of just over 13 percent. **********Causes Are Disputed **********There was disagreement over what lay behind the rioting, which began when several hundred youths attacked firefighters who had arrived to extinguish a blaze in an abandoned bingo hall. Local people blamed what they called constant harassment by the police. The West Midlands police chief, Geoffrey Dear, said the rioting had erupted ''out of the blue.'' He said he thought it was possible that recent television news pictures of riots by blacks in South Africa had encouraged the mob here. **********''It wasn't against society,'' he said. ''It was just an orgy of thieving.'' Birmingham's Lord Mayor, Frank Carter, expressed the same sentiments, calling the violence ''absolute thuggery gone mad on drugs.'' **********The last time Handsworth burned, in 1981, the outbreak was attributed to the rioting in the South London district of Brixton. Lord Scarman, who investigated the 1981 disturbances, praised the relationship between the residents and the police in Birmingham. **********Authorities said that the death toll since the unrest began was at least two, with two more feared. More than 45 buildings, many housing shops owned by Asians, were destroyed by fire. **********Officials said that 1,400 policemen had been deployed since Monday night. At least 25 people were reported arrested. Some 15 policemen and two firemen were injured in fighting today and Monday night. Two had broken bones but most injuries were minor. **********''We are not going to lose control of Handsworth again,'' Chief Constable Dear vowed on television tonight. **********''We had to regain control of a considerable part of Handsworth block by block in something akin to street fighting,'' he said earlier. **********'Copycat Riots' Feared **********Earlier, Mr. Hurd had said he felt there was a danger of ''copycat riots'' in other cities similar to Birmingham and urged police forces to watch out for trouble. **********The rioting Monday caught the 12 police officers on duty in the neighborhood by surprise. **********But community leaders and politicians said there was nothing new about violence in the area. In the 1981 riot, more than 500 people were arrested and 150 were injured. **********''People had been warned before,'' said Jeff Rooker, a Labor Member of Parliament for the area. ''It's going to happen again if we don't do something about it.'' **********How the Trouble Began **********According to Bob Skellern, a spokesman for the West Midlands Fire Service, the serious trouble began Monday night when the firemen who arrived to extinguish the fire in the bingo hall ignored a black youth who asked them to let it burn. **********When the firefighters refused, he said, several hundred youths gathered and threw stones, bricks, bottles and finally gasoline bombs at them. **********The firemen withdrew, returning on foot to fight the fire from the rear of the building, out of sight of the crowd, Mr. Skellern said. When the crowd discovered this, he said, they began to vandalize and burn other buildings, turning the neighborhood into an inferno. **********A hardware store caught fire and cylinders of propane exploded like gunshots. By the time 600 policemen restored order and the fires had been brought under control, the neighborhood looked as if it had been bombed from the air, with roofs and walls collapsed. **********This morning the horror grew as two badly charred bodies were found in a post office in the neighborhood. The police said they feared another two people reported missing might also have died in fires. **********''It piles shock on top of shock,'' Prime Minister Thatcher said after hearing of the deaths. **********Rumors of Police Violence **********James Hunt, chairman of the Birmingham Community Relations Council, said today that he felt the rioting had been touched off by rumors of police violence during the arrest of a motorist earlier in the afternoon. **********Mr. Hunt, who lives near Lozells Road, where the rioting centered, said seven motorists had been handcuffed, beaten up and threatened with being pushed under a bus during the arrest. **********Mr. Hunt said he went to the police station where the man was being held and urged the officers to free him to avoid trouble. **********He also accused Chief Constable Dear of trying to divide Asians and West Indians here by observing that the riots were directed at Asian shops. **********Handsworth, a neighborhood of delapidated homes and shops with heavy security grills, is home to 57,000 people. According to officials here, there are 18,000 Asians and 12,000 blacks of West Indian descent living here. Of 16,000 homes, some 15,000 have neither a bath nor a toilet. **********Recently, the police have said, residents have complained bitterly about narcotics transactions carried out in broad daylight, but police drug raids and arrests have also brought complaints of heavy-handedness. **********At a news conference today, Chief Constable Dear played down the significance of the stopping of the motorist and the knifing of an Asian businessman earlier Monday at a Handsworth bank. **********He discounted speculation that tension had been mounting during the day, pointing out that ''it had been a relatively quiet day by Handsworth standards'' until the attack on the firemen at the bingo hall fire. **********He also said he did not think the violence was premeditated. Only last weekend, he said, community leaders had been congratulating the police and each other about good relations in Handsworth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/21/business/finance-new-issues-fannie-mae-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Fannie Mae Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Fannie Mae Issue", "body_text": " **********The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, announced yesterday that it will price a $250 million issue of mortgage-backed securities next Tuesday.

McFarlane, his national security adviser. **********''At first blush,'' said Mr. Speakes, ''the proposal for a moratorium seems to revive prior Soviet efforts designed to freeze in place a considerable Soviet advantage. **********''The deployment, for example, at this time in intermediate nuclear forces gives a 10-to-1 advantage in the Soviets' favor. Also worth noting is that prior Soviet statements of intent to establish a moratorim by the Soviets have been followed by continued deployment.'' **********Mr. Speakes' comments came after he conferred with Mr. McFarlane, who later had lunch with Mr. Reagan to discuss the development. **********The moratorium had been proposed by Soviet negotiators at the Geneva arms control talks, according to State Department officials. Some in the Administration were said to believe that by making the issue public Mr. Gorbachev had violated the confidentiality of the talks. **********The Russians have a total of 414 intermediate range mobile missiles, each with three warheads. Of these, 276 are targeted on Western Europe and the rest on Asia and China. **********By contrast, the United States has deployed 54 Pershing II missiles and 48 ground launched cruise missiles, all with single warheads, as part of a planned deployment of 572 medium range missiles in Europe.

Chernenko. Mr. Speakes said that it did not appear that Mr. Gorbachev was linking such a meeting to a United States freeze in the deployment of intermediate range missiles. **********Asked about United States-Soviet relations since Mr. Gorbachev came into office, Mr. Speakes said it would be ''premature'' to make any sweeping statements on changes in relations between the two countries. **********''Many of the things that we've heard and seen since then are similar statements that have been made by the Soviet leadership in the past,'' he said.

General Foods soared 11 1/8 points, to 82 3/8, on the week, and all but a fraction of this gain came in the closing session. Wall Street traders recalled the deal early in June in which R. J. Reynolds Industries, another leading cigarette maker, agreed to buy Nabisco Brands in a move seen as lessening its dependency upon tobacco. **********General Foods, whose stock sold as low as 29 in early 1982, is also a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, and that market barometer rose 23.52 points last week, finishing at 1,324.48. **********Despite a surge of more than 24 points on Friday, the Dow did not quite manage to topple its record closing high of 1,327.28 set on June 6. Other broad market averages are also hovering just below recent record levels. **********For nearly a year now, Richard Eakle, the technical market analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, has set his sights on a target between 1,380 and 1,420 as this year's top for the industrial average. ''Originally, I thought we would reach that area around the middle of this year,'' he said late last week. ''I may be off a bit in the timing, but I still see the Dow getting to that target zone in late July or early August.'' **********In the event his forecast proves correct, Mr. Eakle sees an ensuing correction of perhaps 15 to 20 percent in stock prices. But, for the near term, he suggests that technology issues - including the NCR Corporation, Cray Research, Automatic Data Processing and Motorola - could post good percentage gains. **********Elsewhere, he believes the prolonged rally in Government bond prices is over. Long-term bonds, which yielded 14 percent at the end of May 1984, have rallied to produce yields slightly above 10 percent this month. The analyst cited the risk of a ''sharp, intermediate setback'' in bond prices and, late last week, prices of these fixed-income issues were falling. Mr. Eakle suggested that, over the next five or six weeks, yields on long-term Treasuries could climb above 11 percent as prices declined. **********According to his scenario, rising interest rates in response to an improving economy could ultimately become the ''catalyst'' for lower stock prices. **********On Wall Street, there is still no consensus on the rate picture. ''We believe the process of disinflation can work,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist for E.F. Hutton & Company. ''Therefore, we see prospects for much lower interest rates over the remainder of the 1980's.'' **********In a ''flash'' estimate issued Thursday, the Commerce Department said that the nation's economy in the June quarter was expanding at the rate of 3.1 percent - a sharp pickup from the sluggish first quarter. However, Government estimates are often revised, so uncertainty lingers as to the staying power of an apparently reviving economy. **********One technical analyst who sees no sustained price gains for the stock market in the period immediately ahead is Eugene E. Peroni Jr. of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles. Although he views 1,275 as a zone of stubborn support for the Dow industrials, Mr. Peroni said: ''We have to view the summer months as a buffer period, with a basically sideways movement in stock prices. The greatest risk in the market during this period is investor boredom - not cascading stock prices.'' **********Later, in the early part of the fourth quarter of 1985, he believes the Dow will move to a high between 1,375 and 1,425. Thus, although his target is approximately the same as that of Mr. Eakle at Morgan Stanley, the two technical analysts differ as to the timing of the market's rise. Eventually, Mr. Peroni also believes that ''rising interest rates could stall the stock market.'' **********What areas of the market does the Bateman Eichler analyst favor? ''Certain groups that have performed well should continue to do well,'' he said. ''This would include the food, broadcast and entertainment, newspaper and specialty retailing sectors.'' **********But one money manager who thinks the market may already be close to its high for this year, as expressed by the Dow industrials, is W. Christopher Maxwell, who heads the investment department of the Chase Lincoln First Bank in Rochester. He has begun paring substantial positions in food stocks, for example, and switching the proceeds into short-term Government issues. What makes Mr. Maxwell wary is the recession he believes will arrive in 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/07/world/around-the-world-kuwait-appoints-new-justice-minister.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Kuwait Appoints New Justice Minister", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Kuwait Appoints New Justice Minister", "body_text": " **********Kuwait today named its Islamic Affairs Minister to replace Justice Minister Sheik Salman al-Duayj al-Sabah, who resigned Sunday after allegations of improper conduct. **********An Emiri decree quoted by the Kuwait News Agency said Ahmad Said al-Jasir would take over the Justice Ministry while retaining the Islamic Endowments and Islamic Affairs portfolio. **********Sheik Salman, a member of the ruling family, had been due to face a no-confidence motion in the National Assembly Tuesday.

Walker Jr., the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement and Operations, has said that the cash movements resembled a money-laundering operation. **********The Justice Department is also reported to be investigating domestic cash transactions made by the Bank of Boston that may have been used by organized crime figures. **********In 1981, the bank was in the spotlight when the owner of a chain of jai alai frontons, which were financed by the bank and over which it had some control, was found slain in Tulsa, Okla. In addition, at that time there were questions about a number of other bank practices, including certain loans and some large fees, some of which were the subject of lawsuits. **********For now, some are willing to believe the bank's explanation that the recent charges resulted from ''an administrative glitch'' among as many as a dozen departments. **********''I just can't believe that the senior management of the bank had anything to do with this,'' said Stephen Kay, partner in charge of the Boston office of Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Others, however, are expressing concern that the bank's problems seem to mount as the case unfolds. **********The worries come at a time of renewed growth at a bank that is, in several ways, unusual. The Bank of Boston's net income jumped a healthy 21 percent last year, to $164 million, for a relatively high return of 79 cents for every $100 of assets. Its total assets of $22.08 billion make it the 16th-largest bank holding company in the country. **********Most important for 1985, said James McDermott, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, earnings accelerated in the fourth quarter, when net income soared 115 percent from a year earlier and the bank's return on assets climbed to $1.36 for every $100. **********One feature that sets apart the Bank of Boston, which traces its roots back to 1784, is that it dwarfs its competitors in New England. **********''In our market in New England, the Bank of Boston is the competition,'' commented Peter H. McCormick, chairman of the Bank of New England. ''They are a good, big, strong, dominating bank.'' **********The bank has a reputation as the preserve of, and banker for, the upper crust of Boston society. **********In the race to expand across state lines, the bank has also been an aggressive leader. It has recently acquired or is trying to acquire large banks in Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut and has invested in a Vermont bank. **********A National Force **********The bank has grown into a force nationally, too. ''Can they butt heads with a Citibank, or Chase or Morgan? Not really in terms of sheer dollar assets,'' commented Mr. Kay of Goldman, Sachs. ''But they cut a much wider swath nationally than a regional bank of that size would be expected to.'' **********The Bank of Boston has, for example, applied to open 16 consumer-bank offices in 10 states. It has also carved out several profitable niches nationally. It is, for instance, very strong in lending to the entertainment industry. This specialized lending was the result of the efforts of Serge Semenenko, a Russian emigre who retired from the bank in 1967. His by now fabled entrepreneurial spirit left an indelible impression on the institution, contrary to its conservative reputation. **********''The perception of this bank has always been as a large, solid, Yankee, somewhat arrogant, stubborn institution,'' said one prominent Boston business figure, who asked not to be identified. ''The reality is that it is not so stodgy. Most people here don't know about the movies, or its involvement in the New York textile business, or a lot of sides to the bank.'' **********There are other ways in which it does not fit the traditional mold. William L. Brown, the bank's crusty and impatient chairman, is from North Carolina, not Boston, and its president, Ira Stepanian, is of Armenian heritage and from a working-class Boston neighborhood. **********The bank also does not hesitate to take combative positions in public, contributing to its reputation for arrogance. This was clearly demonstrated at a news conference on Monday aimed at putting to rest questions over its movements of cash internationally. Mr. Brown, indicating that he saw little to apologize for, suggested that the Federal charges were unwarranted and blamed the news media for most of the problem. **********Large Overseas Network **********There is yet another distinct face to the Bank of Boston: it is an international force. It says that it has the third-largest overseas network of offices and branches of any American bank, currently 160. In Argentina, where it has had a presence since 1917, it has about 20 offices. The Bank of Boston is also a major player in Brazil, as well as in Europe. **********With the Latin American debt crisis, some have looked upon this involvement as a liability. According to Keefe, Bruyette's Mr. McDermott, however, much of its lending is in local currencies and to private companies, not governments, giving it something of a shield against the worst problems in the region. **********In addition, this international presence adds to the Bank of Boston'a competitiveness in New England. The region's manufacturers have increasingly been looking abroad for markets and facilities, and they need international banks to service this expansion. ''The bigger the international network one has, the stronger you can appear to manufacturers in this region with overseas operations,'' said Mr. McCormick of the Bank of New England. **********Finally, there is that more puzzling side of the bank that has a tendency to crop up every few years. The bank's recent problems involving its international cash transfers have been compounded by its admission that the reporting violations were discovered by Government investigators who were originally inquiring into other business involving its domestic operations. **********Further Charges Possible **********Federal officials have said that there could be further charges regarding these domestic cash transactions. There have already been allegations that the Angiulo family, reputed leaders of organized crime in Boston, may have laundered money by making large cash transactions through the bank. **********Still, while such events and the recent felony charge puzzle many who thought they knew the bank, they are not yet altering their generally positive views of the unusual institution. **********As Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette said: ''Am I changing my estimates for the bank at this point? The answer is no. But I will have to wait and see what the end result is.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/24/world/around-the-world-plane-crashes-in-brazil-killing-all-13-aboard.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Plane Crashes in Brazil, Killing All 13 Aboard", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Plane Crashes in Brazil, Killing All 13 Aboard", "body_text": " **********A twin-engined airplane crashed today while making an emergency landing in the state of Mato Grosso in the northern Amazon, killing all 13 people on board, airport officials said. **********''There were no survivors. **********Everyone died,'' said an airport spokesman, Severino Curvo, by telephone from Cuiaba, the state capital.

One woman working at the United Nations said her pass was scrutinized six times as she walked along the avenue from 41st to 42d Streets. **********So many Secret Service agents, police officers and bodyguards have accompanied the dignitaries that there were jokes that the real event in New York was a convention of security officials. **********''On balance,'' said Georgia Beach, a spokesman for the United Nations Plaza Hotel, where many heads of government and state are staying, ''we have more security than guests.'' **********In the spirit of secrecy and diplomacy that has marked almost every aspect of the United Nations session, officials decline to divulge details of security procedures and have resorted to estimates in describing the intensity of their efforts. **********''Exact figures?'' said Inspector Nathan Markowitz, who was coordinating security activities today at First Avenue and 42d Street. ''I can't give you exact figures. Afterwards, maybe next week, but not now. Some information shouldn't be released -numbers, routes, times of arrivals. We wouldn't want to give anyone any ideas.'' **********Pedestrians are not the only ones who have been inconvenienced by the barrage of security. Tony Guglielmo, a district superintendent for the Sanitation Department, approached Inspector Markowitz with a problem. **********''We've got garbage in this area,'' Mr. Guglielmo said. ''It's gonna stay in this area,'' Inspector Markowitz said. **********Over all, people seem to be taking the increased security in stride, police officers said, even if a few groused about there being still another place in Manhattan where you need clout to get in. ''Definitely worse than the Palladium,'' said John Petrolli, after being turned away from 45th Street and Second Avenue moments before Mr. Reagan's motorcade was scheduled to pass. **********As closely as officials want to guard the comings and goings of dignitaries, it is difficult to be discreet when traveling with a 45-vehicle entourage. **********''It's sort of like a checkers game,'' said Deputy Chief Peter J. Prezioso, the commanding officer in the Police Department's intelligence division, ''except the checkers are moving in all directions, and none of them are moving off the board.'' **********Not all the security scenarios are confined to the United Nations itself, for wherever go the dignitaries, so goes the chaos. **********When Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel had lunch at a midtown office building earlier this week, his arrival was preceeded by a security check. Secret Service agents with sniffer dogs in tow poked about the hallways, the elevators and the offices, asking to look through closets and desks. **********Mr. Peres's host explained that he would be glad to accommodate the officers, but years before he had lost the keys to two of the drawers and had not opened them since. The agents obliged by picking the lock and discovered a lost cache of liquor. **********Sometimes, however, even the best of intentions can go awry. A New York City police car nearly hit Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany today as President Reagan's motorcade left the United Nations. Thinking the entire stream of cars had passed, Mr. Kohl tried to cross the driveway. But a police car suddenly sped by, causing Mr. Kohl to jump and his security detail to panic, if only momentarily. **********The police say, with measured relief, that so far nobody has been hurt and that 18 bomb threats, suspicous packages and suspicious cars that have been reported in the city since Sunday night have all proved to be erroneous. **********If anyone was more prepared for the deluge of dignitaries than the Police Department, it was the staffs of the hotels where they are staying. The Waldorf-Astoria, which is housing President and Mrs. Reagan, spent months sketching out the details of their security plan and even set up a command post for the Police Department inside the hotel. **********''You're safe in this place, that's for sure,'' said Barbara Wainscott, a spokesman for the Waldorf. ''You can't go outside without tripping over someone from the Secret Service, the White House, the New York City Police or some foreign service security detail, tapping their ear and talking into their wrists.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/17/business/apple-income-increases-9.9-in-latest-period.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "APPLE INCOME INCREASES 9.9% IN LATEST PERIOD", "print_headline": "APPLE INCOME INCREASES 9.9% IN LATEST PERIOD", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. reported today that net income for its March quarter rose 9.9 percent on a 45 percent increase in revenues. **********Two United States makers of mainframes, the Burroughs Corporation and Honeywell Inc., reported gains in sales and earnings for the first quarter. **********Apple said net income for its second fiscal quarter, ended March 29, was $10 million, or 16 cents a share, compared with $9.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the corresponding 1984 quarter. Sales rose to $435.3 million, from $300.1 million. **********Despite the increase in net income, the quarter was not a good one for Apple, analysts said. Apple closed its factories for one week to reduce surging inventories, resulting from a slowdown in sales that took place after Christmas. In addition, the results are being compared with a poor quarter last year, in which the Macintosh computer had barely started shipping. **********Apple declined to comment on what the inventory situation is now. In a statement accompanying the release, its president, John Sculley, said, ''We continue to monitor business conditions closely to keep expenses in line with our revenues and thus increase Apple's profitability.'' **********The company said sales of computers to schools were stronger than expected. It did not say anything about its home market and business market, considered to be much weaker. **********Apple said its new laser printer and local network, only recently available in the market, have ''experienced significant dealer and industry enthusiasm.'' If the new products do well, and new business software for the Macintosh appears, the company's performance could improve, analysts said. **********The Detroit-based Burroughs said that net income rose 8.4 percent, to $46.6 million, or $1.03 a share, from $43 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier.

''We're with you,'' the Mississippian, Charles L. Irby, told Mr. Calero. As they shook hands a television crew from the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' closed in with lights and cameras. **********Beside them was Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, a retired Army officer and World War II hero who was relieved as chief of staff of United States forces in South Korea in 1977 after publicly criticizing President Carter's tentative decision, later reversed, to reduce the number of United States troops there. The meeting was the kind of thing he has become expert at arranging. **********He says he wants to turn back Communism with a coalition of people who are willing to risk their lives and people who are willing to risk at least part of their fortunes. **********Conference Ends With Dinner **********General Singlaub, who has become a major figure in gathering money and supplies for the Nicaraguan anti-Government rebels and in advising them on arms purchases, uses as his organizational base the World Anti-Communist League and its American affiliate, the United States Council for World Freedom. He is chairman of the first group and president of the second. **********The World Anti-Communist League, which says it has members in more than 90 countries, finished its four-day annual conference Thursday night with the International Freedom Fighters Dinner, to which the general invited some multimillionaires and other rich people. He estimated that 60 to 70 Texans came to mingle with the delegates and representatives of guerrilla armies under the crystal chandeliers of the ballroom of the Registry Hotel. **********Mr. Irby said he had given about $25,000 to the United States Council for World Freedom, confident that General Singlaub would spend it in the best way. The Mississippian, who runs a family construction business in Jackson, said that seemed ''little enough,'' coming from someone who had never had to fight in a war for his country. ''I feel like certain people have given so much for freedom,'' he said. **********Though more reticent about their financial commitment to the cause, Nelson Bunker Hunt and some associates gathered against one wall during the reception before the dinner. His wife confirmed that she and her husband were contributors to the United States Council for World Freedom. **********Countries Long Communist **********Many of the delegates represented countries that have long been Communist and are not viewed as ripe for revolution or insurgency. There were Americans who used to be Ukrainians, Americans who used to be Chinese, Swedes who used to be Estonians, many people from Taiwan, many West Europeans, a few Africans and Middle Easterners, an occasional Latin American and more. **********During the days of meetings, the delegates heard reports on the status of anti-Communist rebel movements in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. General Singlaub called the existence of these groups the most significant international political development of the last 40 years. **********The delegates said they felt encouraged by President Reagan's tough talk against Marxist-Leninist Governments. Taiwan academics warned the delegates not to be misled into thinking China's economic changes meant it was moving toward political democracy. Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor in chief of The Washington Times, told them not to be misled about reports to the effect that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the new Soviet leader, is a charming lawyer type who is committed to give and take. **********They met a Soviet soldier who defected in Afghanistan. They heard from Dr. Haing S. Ngor, the Cambodian star of the movie ''The Killing Fields.'' The Israeli researcher and author Avraham Shifrin, once a Soviet concentration camp prisoner, brought them up to date on Soviet prison conditions, things he said they would not otherwise know. Speakers complained about the ''naivete'' of the ''liberal establishment'' over Central America. **********Photo Sessions With Rebels **********At the closing dinner, the delegates and the affluent contributors and would-be contributors had photographs taken with rebels who wore a variety of garb. Dr. Ikram Gran of Afghanistan, dressed in the short, baggy trousers and unbuttoned camouflage shirt he wore to all the meetings, was sought after for photographs. Mr. Calero wore a business suit, as did Holden Roberto of Angola. Mr. Irby wore a tuxedo and a shirt with gold buttons, and the television crews wore blue jeans. **********President Reagan sent greetings, and so did 25 hotel employees, many of whom General Singlaub said were ''refugees from Communist tyranny.'' **********The dinner guests stood and cheered at every opportunity, especially for Hubert Rodriguez, a 21-year-old Nicaraguan rebel whose left leg was amputated because he developed gangrene after he had to walk and crawl 13 days to find medical care. Mr. Rodriguez received one of the ''freedom fighter of the year'' awards. The other went to an Afghan who, according to General Singlaub, led an action that cut off the electricity of Kabul for more than a week. He could not be in Dallas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/08/business/harrod-s-new-owner-mohamed-al-fayed-a-quiet-acquisitor-is-caught-in-a-cross-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1985-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A QUIET ACQUISITOR IS CAUGHT IN A CROSS FIRE", "print_headline": "HARROD'S NEW OWNER: MOHAMED AL-FAYED;   A QUIET ACQUISITOR IS CAUGHT IN A CROSS FIRE", "body_text": " **********AS Mohamed al-Fayed talks of his family's prized possessions, such as Harrods, this city's legendary department store, or the Ritz Hotel in Paris, he is an effusive and joyous man. But when a visitor to his elegant Mayfair penthouse residence overlooking Hyde Park turns the discussion to his friends, his family background and the scope of the family fortune, affability fades from the face of the 53-year-old Egyptian patriarch. He rustles impatiently in the deep cushions of his chair and, although the politeness is unfailing, he becomes tense. Such questions have become the bane of Mr. al-Fayed's existence. **********Last March, Mr. al-Fayed and his two younger brothers, Ali and Salah, made news when they mounted a management-supported bid for control of the House of Fraser P.L.C., acquiring the retailing empire, including its jewel, Harrods, for $842 million. This was a dream come true for the family, which built its fortune in real estate, shipping, construction and banking - first in the oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf, then in Europe and, more recently, the United States. **********Unlike many high-flying deal makers, however, Mr. al-Fayed treasures his privacy and tries to keep his family from the limelight. To the general public, the Fayeds were known, if at all, for their lavish restoration of the Ritz Hotel since acquiring it in 1979, and a major role in financing the Oscar-winning film, ''Chariots of Fire.'' **********Most notably, Mr. al-Fayed has shown a penchant for acquiring and developing unique, tradition-rich assets - such as the British department store, long a magnet for some of the world's richest shoppers. ''There is only one Harrods,'' said Mr. al-Fayed, who is fond of comparing both Harrods and the Ritz to the pyramids of his native Egypt as an international attraction. **********The family's major holding in the United States is a 5 percent stake in the San Antonio-based National Bancshares Corporation, a conservatively run bank holding company that is one of the most profitable in Texas. The family also owns the Warner Communications building in New York's Rockefeller Plaza. **********In July, Mr. al-Fayed considered bidding for all or part of the MGM/ UA Entertainment Company, which includes a film library with such classics as ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But he stepped aside when Ted Turner and Kirk Kerkorian, MGM's majority shareholder, struck a deal that the Fayeds thought valued MGM/UA too highly. Still, the Fayeds remain interested in expanding their Allied Stars film finance company into other aspects of the movie industry. **********Mr. al-Fayed, who makes the family's major investment decisions, handles most dealings with a minimum of publicity. The House of Fraser, to his dismay, has been a notable exception. The deal was a bitter blow to Roland W. Rowland, the combative 67-year-old chief executive officer of Lonrho P.L.C., a mining, agriculture, trading and publishing conglomerate that had been stalking the House of Fraser for seven years. Mr. Rowland, a six-footer known widely as ''Tiny'' - has mounted an aggressive anti-Fayed campaign, and Lonrho has retained a lawyer to prepare a lawsuit against Mr. al-Fayed. **********Mr. al-Fayed, who was a major shareholder and board member of Lonrho a decade ago, concedes that the ferocity of Mr. Rowland's attack has tarnished the pleasure he had taken in his family's biggest acquisition to date: ''If I had known he was going to turn on me this way, I wouldn't have touched it.'' **********Even before the takeover was completed, Lonrho had begun a campaign to convince the Government that the Fayeds have neither the background nor the wealth claimed by them and Kleinwort Benson Ltd., their highly respected merchant bankers. Lonrho wants the deal unwound. **********Mr. Rowland and his lieutenants have charged that the Fayeds could not have made their acquisition without the backing of far richer allies, notably the oil-rich Sultan of Brunei, described by some as the world's wealthiest individual. In information fed to British newspapers, primarily the Lonrho-owned Observer, Mr. Rowland has claimed that the Government was given false information about the proposed acquisition. Mr. Rowland has further suggested that Mohamed al-Fayed transferred at least $300 million from accounts belonging to the Sultan of Brunei to accounts controlled by the Fayeds, using a power-of-attorney granted him by the Sultan in August 1984. **********Such talk has infuriated the Fayed group. ''The Fayeds did not just swan in,'' said Royston Webb, an attorney for the family. ''There were exhaustive checks made by the Department of Trade and Industry before the decision not to refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for further study.'' Last month the Sultan issued a blunt denial of any financial interest in any Fayed investment. The Fayeds have filed suit against The Observer, charging defamation. **********''Tiny Rowland underestimated me,'' said Mr. al-Fayed. **********Mr. Rowland's unwillingness to accept defeats in the various battles that have marked his business career is legendary here. But even his critics sympathize with his anger that the Government allowed the Fayeds' acquisition, carried out by a Liechtenstein-based holding company, without taking it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Three major Government investigations stymied Lonrho's own attempts to win control of the House of Fraser. More infuriating, Lonrho was given Government clearance to start a takeover attempt two days after the Fayeds' offer had been accepted by a majority of the House of Fraser's shareholders. **********Ironically, Lonrho unwittingly handed the Fayeds a platform from which to stage their bid. Mr. al-Fayed had several times expressed interest in Lonrho's 29.9 percent stake in the House of Fraser. Last November, shortly after the Government decided to extend its latest investigation of Lonrho, the frustrated Mr. Rowland abruptly agreed to sell the holding to the Fayeds for $190 million, netting Lonrho about $98 million. City analysts doubt that Lonrho will convince the Government to undo the deal, but if it does, they predict that Lonrho will resume its attempts to take over the House of Fraser. IN the ongoing battle, Kleinwort Benson has put its reputation on the line, saying that the Fayed family assets total about $3 billion, and it is satisfied they can finance the House of Fraser acquisition from their own resources. **********The Fayeds' known holdings span four continents. They have a shipping empire, said by Kleinwort Benson to consist of more than 40 ships, that is operated primarily from bases in Cairo and Genoa. Property interests in Britain include 60 Park Lane, a nine-story building on one of the city's most fashionable streets, and an adjacent office building; a castle in Scotland along with 32,000 acres of land, and an estate in the village of Oxted, southeast of London. Besides the Rockefeller Center building and the Ritz Hotel, the family owns an apartment building on the Champs Elysees in Paris, a home in the Alpine ski resort of Gstaad, and property in Alexandria, Egypt. **********The family has participated actively in a variety of construction projects, particularly in the Middle East, and joined major oil companies in exploration projects. **********According to Kleinwort, the family also has huge liquid assets built up over generations, and the merchant bank apparently offered sufficient evidence to convince Government investigators. Lonrho disagrees, and has shown journalists photocopies of documents that suggest Mr. al-Fayed and his brothers are the sons of what Paul Spicer, a Lonrho director, calls ''an impoverished Government education inspector.'' Mr. al-Fayed dismisses the papers as forgeries. From this starting point, Lonrho spins a string of allegations - so far, unsubstantiated by any public documents - that creates a picture of Mr. al-Fayed accumulating a modest fortune for the family through plentiful contacts with wealthy patrons and exceptional energy. **********Mr. al-Fayed's account of his life is one of honorable enterprise and duty to family. He was born in 1933 in Alexandria, into a family that prospered in the 19th century by growing cotton along the Nile and shipping it to the mills in northwest England. He delights acquaintances with recollections of an English nanny and an Egyptian education based on the British model, complete with canings. **********When Mr. al-Fayed graduated from the University of Alexandria with a degree in economics, he already had summer work experience in a building materials company and a bank. **********''These were not family businesses,'' he said. ''I never relied on my parents' or my grandparents' achievements. Banks were my main interest because you see everything moving from there. I started my own company, Middle East Navigation, when I was 21 to prove I could make it on my own.'' **********Middle East was one of the family businesses nationalized by the Nasser Government in 1961, according to Mr. al-Fayed, who found the experience traumatic. Last March he was pleased to attend Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's dinner for visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, but he is not ready to forgive his homeland. Although both his brothers have been back - indeed, Salah spends a good deal of time in Alexandria - Mr. al-Fayed has stuck to his vow never again to set foot in Egypt. When pressed to explain his strong feeling, Mr. al-Fayed preferred to expand on the bright side of the experience. ''It gave me a personal drive,'' he said. ''It was a challenge to prove that the world was open.'' **********Mr. al-Fayed's exodus took him first to the Persian Gulf. One of his earliest ventures was ferrying Moslems to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimages to Mecca. He established many contacts in the Gulf countries that served him well later in his career, most notably a close friendship with Sheik Rashidbin Said al-Maktoum of Dubai, and his family. **********In the late 1960's, he plunged into the construction developments that later served as his family's entree to British business life. In projects such as the construction of the port of Dubai and the Dubai Trade Center, both of which the Fayeds operate, British companies such as the Costain Group and Bernard Sunley & Sons Ltd. piled up about $2 billion worth of business. **********''We have every confidence in them, which you can't say about a lot of Mideast businessmen,'' said John Fryer, managing director of Bernard Sunley, summing up 18 years of working with the family. ''It's all been on the basis of trust, not small print.'' **********By all accounts, the Fayeds have developed a distinctive operating pattern. As head of the family (the reason he uses the title al in front of the family name), Mr. al-Fayed makes the major decisions. Salah concentrates on shipping and property interests in the Middle East, while Ali handles most of the detail work. **********''I'm lucky to have Ali,'' joked Mr. al-Fayed during an interview in which he wore a white turtleneck under a loose blue tunic, blue corduroy pants and black boots. ''He likes to put on a tie and go to the office. I hate it.'' Acquaintances note that Mr. al-Fayed's office is anywhere he happens to be, since most of his work is done on the telephone. The energetic six-foot executive keeps a battery of ten secretaries working in three six-hour shifts. **********Emad, who is Mohamed's son by a brief first marriage and is known to everyone as Dodi, has spearheaded the family's renewed interest in the film industry, some 40 years after the Fayeds first offered location services to Hollywood studios filming in Egypt. **********Associates are struck by the family's closeness. ''In general, if you speak to any one of the brothers, you have spoken to all of them,'' said Peter Costain, a director of the Costain Group. **********''We were brought up together and did everything together,'' said Mr. al-Fayed. The trio's three British homes and their residences in several other several other countries are all set up so the brothers and their families can occupy them simultaneously. Mohamed's wife, Heine, is a Finn, Salah's wife, Tracey, is English, and Ali's wife, Adriana, is Italian. Nonetheless, Egyptian tradition is being preserved within the clan and each family has at least one son named after one of his uncles. ONE distinguishing characteristic of the family, according to David Douglas-Home, head of the international finance division at Morgan Grenfell Ltd., a merchant bank that has helped organize numerous Fayed deals, is that it has always acted as ''a genuine agent'' and never as a fixer. This is a point of pride with Mr. al-Fayed, who bridles at the common image of a Middle East business executive as someone who survives by brokering deals. **********''All of my deals are my creation,'' he said. ''It's not getting something for someone else. If I do that for a friend, I do it for free.'' **********Recently, of course, Mr. Rowland has made the friendship issue a sensitive point. One deal Mr. al-Fayed arranged without compensation last year was the $85 million purchase of London's Dorchester Hotel by the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan, for his part, has established an annual fiction prize to commemorate Ernest Hemingway's association with the Ritz. Continuing publicity about their connection has made it harder for Mr. al-Fayed to convince skeptics that the Sultan, who has called the family ''trusted and respected friends and advisers,'' had no role in the Fayeds' purchase of the House of Fraser. Mr. al-Fayed resists discussing the subject: ''It's not my habit to talk about friends.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/world/photo-canadian-soldiers-taking-part-military-maneuvers-alberta-last-spring-ap.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1985-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1734, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Photo of canadian soldiers taking part in military maneuvers in Alberta last spring (AP) CANADIANS DEBATE A FEEBLE MILITARY: ITS ONE STRENGTH IS ITS NATO ALLIES", "print_headline": "Photo of canadian soldiers taking part in military maneuvers in Alberta last spring (AP) CANADIANS DEBATE A FEEBLE MILITARY: ITS ONE STRENGTH IS ITS NATO ALLIES", "body_text": " **********When the Canadian armed forces held their largest maneuvers in several decades in Alberta last May and June, they fielded all the tanks they had in the country - a total of 18. **********This is fewer than the number Britain and West Germany maintain at their own armored training centers in western Canada, according to Canadian officers. **********And as Canadians like to point out, their navy is now outnumbered in submarines by an amusement park at a shopping mall in Edmonton. The park had four submarines built to take customers on underwater rides. The navy has three obsolete diesel submarines. **********Subs Serve as Targets **********The Canadians also point out that the submarines are not used for patrol duties but serve as target practice for antisubmarine frigates. **********Canada lacks nuclear weapons, having given its nuclear-tipped Genie aircraft missiles back to the United States in 1984. It has fewer than 83,000 men and women under arms to defend a territory larger than the United States. And it spends less of its gross national product on defense, barely 2 percent, than any other NATO ally except Iceland, which has no army at all, and Luxemburg. **********The polar approaches to North America are so exposed that a Canadian Senate committee warned last January that Soviet bombers could fly undetected into the heart of North America. **********In September, Foreign Minister Joe Clark alluded to the presence of Soviet submarines deployed under the Arctic ice pack. Yet Canada's patrol aircraft performing maritime surveillance fell in number from 99 in 1955 to 36 by 1985. **********The Progressive Conservative Government, which took office in September 1984, has promised to rectify such weaknesses by spending more. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said during his campaign that a first-class nation needed a first-class defense force. But Canadians often seem unconcerned, knowing that the United States will guard them anyway. **********Incentives Are Small **********Its comfortable geography, with lots of snow and ice to the north and a friendly superpower to the south, has given Canada little incentive to do more. Any increase in defense spending is unlikely to enhance its security. Any reduction is unlikely to diminish it. Even so, the Canadian armed forces would be challenged to carry out their four conventional commitments to protect Canadian territory, join the Americans in defending North America, contribute forces to the Atlantic alliance and provide peacekeeping units for the United Nations. **********''If all my missions were pulled on me simultaneously, I would have some severe problems,'' said Lieut. Gen. Charles H. Belzile, the commander of Canada's land forces. **********Though Canada lacks the military tradition of some other countries, including the United States, the ability of Canadians to fight is not in doubt. **********War's Heavy Toll **********More than 100,000 Canadians died in two world wars. By the end of World War II, Canada had over half a million volunteers under arms, an air force as big as Britain's and the third largest navy in the world, with 200 ships. **********But as a Government report on foreign policy acknowledged earlier this year, ''after the war, we set a definite upper limit on our military capability when we ruled ourselves out of the nuclear club, and in the mid-1960's our conventional military power began a steady decline - in respect of both personnel and equipment.'' **********Today, with barely 8,000 combat troops, Canada can no longer field a full infantry division. Most of its 23 aging destroyers and frigates still run on steam in a navy that is hardly larger than Ecuador's. The air force has two squadrons of interceptors deployed in Canada's territorial defense, compared with nine squadrons in 1960. **********Forty percent of Canadians surveyed in a Gallup poll in October thought that Canada was spending too little on defense, while only 17 percent thought that the nation spent too much. Nearly a third thought that defense expenditures were about right. **********NATO Contingent Halved **********The squeeze on the armed forces began in 1964 when the first steps were proposed to merge the army, navy and air force into a single service to save money. Everyone ended up wearing the same green uniform. Separate uniforms are now being reinstated at a cost of over $40 million. **********After Pierre Trudeau became Prime Minister in 1968, he ordered further cutbacks. Mr. Trudeau wanted to bring Canadian troops home from Europe until his Defense Minister threatened to resign. Even so, Canada's NATO contingent was slashed in half, to 5,000 men. **********The Government mothballed an aircraft carrier that had been overhauled at great expense, canceled a program to build new frigates and bought cheaper F-5 jet fighters over more advanced F-4 Phantoms. Light armored cars were ordered instead of tanks, with an eye to civil unrest then brewing in Quebec. In the heyday of Soviet-United States detente, almost nothing was spent to replace worn-out hardware. **********By 1978, the Canadian armed forces had dwindled to 78,000 men from 126,000 15 years earlier. The Liberal Government tried to reverse the deterioration before it lost power last year. **********Canada has now ordered 138 new F-18 fighters and is building six frigates. The Mulroney Government announced last March that 1,200 more troops would be sent to reinforce its NATO contingent in West Germany and that another infantry battalion would go to the aid of Norway in event of war. **********Quality of Troops High **********These measures have not outdated the conclusions of a three-year defense policy study that the Business Council on National Issues made public a year ago. **********''Despite significant acquisitions of some major replacement equipment, it is fair to say that the Canadian armed forces have clearly been subject to benign neglect and an inadequacy of resources for almost 20 years,'' the study said. ''As a result, they are incapable of meeting the international military commitments which Canada has assumed and the broad range of national tasks assigned to them.'' **********In the lean years, the quality of Canadian servicemen has, if anything, improved. Canadian soldiers grew adept at improvisations, even down to elaborate camouflage. Their convoys can travel at night without any lights. And because of Canada's cold climate, the troops train more in winter warfare than almost any other army. **********''Every man in every unit in the Canadian Army is issued a pair of showshoes,'' said Brig. Gen. Keith Corbould, the commander of the quick-reaction Special Service Force. **********General Corbould's force of 3,200 men is assigned to repel any invasion of Canadian territory. But it also has one battalion deployed in Cyprus for United Nations peacekeeping and another battalion of 850 men is committed to defend northern Norway in a crisis. ''There's not a helluva lot of fat left,'' General Corbould said. **********Top-Heavy With Rank **********The army itself has become top-heavy with rank. Majors command infantry companies that captains would run in the United States Army. To become a master corporal - equivalent to a junior sergeant in the United States Army - takes an average of eight years. But the British tradition of a career spent in one regiment allows for fiercer loyalties. **********Like their United States counterparts, Canadian commanders are happy with the recruits they are getting. There are waiting lists at every recruiting station, partly because of the high unemployment. ''They are a helluva lot better than we were as young soldiers, flexible, intelligent, easy to train,'' General Belzile said. **********But their equipment often hampers them. With its new F-18 Hornets arriving, Canada's Air Force is in better shape than the smaller army, which will finally get its version of the M-16 rifle at about the time when the United States Army starts phasing it out. **********The Canadian press has called the navy a national disgrace and a laughing stock, although it looks better than in 1981, when 80 percent of its ships were laid up with cracked boilers. **********The Associate Minister of Defense, Harvie Andre, agreed that the navy was in ''the most deplorable state of all.'' **********As for the navy's NATO mission of protecting the North Atlantic sea lanes, Mr. Andre said, ''We can put the required number of ships in the field and some of them are able to protect themselves.'' **********Canadians Balk at Cost **********To augment the regular units, which operate at 60 to 70 percent strength, the armed forces rely on the 23,800-man militia, as Canada's reserves are called. Canadian reservists do not get paid for weekend training and unlike American reservists cannot demand time off from their employers. **********''If a guy doesn't show up, there isn't much we could do,'' General Belzile said. **********One of Canada's first priorities has been to cooperate with the United States in modernizing the obsolete North American air defense system. Canada's $500 million task includes supplying two squadrons of F-18 interceptors and 24 long-range radar stations. **********The biggest impediment to increasing the armed forces is lack of money. Defense spending consumes only 9 percent of the federal budget in Canada, compared with 29 percent of the United States budget. But any reallocation in the deficit budget would take money away from the extensive social welfare benefits that Canadians expect. **********Most Canadians, who pay higher taxes than Americans, balk at spending more for defense when they see no direct military threat. Mr. Andre dodged a question about where the money could come from. ''That's the nonglamorous part of politics,'' he said. **********Some Favor Neutrality **********Some Canadians have argued that their country should end its military alliances and become neutral. The New Democratic Party, which has 30 seats in the House of Commons, has advocated pulling out of NATO. But critics of neutrality have pointed out that Canada would have to spend more to defend itself and might have to introduce the draft, which was unpopular even in wartime. **********As the Conservatives tell it, a stronger defense posture would give Canada a greater voice in the strategic decisions made by the United States. **********Mr. Andre observed that every country had the option of being neutral, sovereign and ''armed to the teeth'' like Switzerland, or be neutral and vulnerable like Finland. ''Or you can be sovereign and pull your own weight,'' he said. ''That's what we want to do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/20/business/business-digest-friday-september-20-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 625, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1985", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********Textile and apparel imports would be cut by up to 40 percent by a bill approved by a House subcommittee.

The officials said they hope that more than half the employment cuts would be through attrition. **********Caterpillar officials said they have reached their goal of cutting costs by 22 percent since 1982 and now aim to reduce costs by more than 15 percent over the next three years. **********In a telephone interview, George A. Schaefer, chairman and chief executive officer of the Peoria, Ill.-based company, said the cost-cutting was aimed at making Caterpillar compete more effectively against foreign producers, especially Komatsu Ltd., the Japanese company that has grown rapidly to be No. 2 in the industry because of its low costs. **********'Right Near Komatsu' **********''What Cat is saying is they will cut their costs by 35 to 40 percent over seven years,'' said John E. McGinty, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''But Komatsu, which already had lower costs, could not cut its costs more than 15 percent. Thus, if the yen-dollar ratio stays near where it is, Cat's cost-cutting would put it right near Komatsu on a cost basis.'' **********In the view of several Wall Street analysts, Caterpillar's cost-cutting strategy has two main parts. The first part has been to cut variable costs, including labor and materials costs. As part of this step, Caterpillar - which has lost close to $1 billion over the last three years - has reduced its worldwide labor force from a peak of about 90,000 in 1979 to about 53,000 today. **********''The next step is to try to convert some of these savings into more permanent cost reductions,'' said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''That is done by downsizing and by changing manufacturing philosophy to accommodate lower volume and worldwide competition.'' **********Mr. Lustgarten said that under Caterpillar's modernization program, the company would seek to set up ''factory cells'' that would speed production and lower costs through automated materials handling and processing. **********He said that Caterpillar, which plans total capital spending of about $320 million next year, would focus on this phase from 1986 to 1988. In this way, Caterpillar's production of tractors and other heavy equipment would be transformed from a step-by-step assembly line into a system where work is done in stages in various factory areas. **********Another part of the $600 million automation program would focus on robotics, computer-aided manufacturing and flexible manufacturing systems. This would involve not only more automated materials handling, but also more robot welders, as well as additional foundry robots, which automatically heat and cool metal as it is shaped. **********The 'Hidden Evils' **********''In the first round of cost-cutting, you try to take care of white-collar costs, some factory costs and material costs,'' said Mr. McGinty. ''In the next round, you get rid of some hidden evils, such as inventory costs and indirect labor. You do that through flexible automation.'' **********According to Ray Adams, Caterpillar's director of manufacturing, the company hopes to reduce its inventory costs by 65 percent by 1989 through a ''just-in-time'' inventory system, which pegs the arrival of a stock item to the time it is needed. **********As another cost-trimming measure, Caterpillar is aiming to increase the percentage of parts it purchases from overseas suppliers to 25 percent within two years, from the current 16 percent. **********''We have long said that we would try to cut our costs by 5 percent a year for the next three years,'' Stephen E. Newhouse, a Caterpillar spokesman, said today. **********Caterpillar's cost-cutting is paying off. After losing money each of the past three years because of a sharp drop in demand, Caterpillar expects to be profitable in 1985. For the first nine months of this year, Caterpillar had net income of $111 million, on sales of $4.92 billion. In the comparable period a year earlier, the company lost $177 million, on sales also totaling $4.92 billion. **********Becoming a Low-Cost Producer **********''They have identified correctly that they are in a mature market where the probability of a substantial improvement in volume is not very high,'' said Mr. Lustgarten. ''They recognize that international competition is here to stay, and they're taking the necessary steps to become a low-cost producer.'' **********Mr. Lustgarten also praised a decision by Caterpillar to begin marketing farm tractors. While that move puts Caterpillar in a market that is ailing, the entry will not require huge new outlays for the company and it will give Caterpillar's dealers a wider line of products to sell. **********Caterpillar, which traditionally focuses on large equipment, also recently introduced a backhoe loader, a small piece of equipment often used in home and office building. Mr. Lustgarten lauded this effort because two of Caterpillar's traditional markets that use large equipment - oil drilling and mining - are depressed, while office and home construction are far stronger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/11/business/new-loans-near-for-argentina.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1985-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW LOANS NEAR FOR ARGENTINA", "print_headline": "NEW LOANS NEAR FOR ARGENTINA", "body_text": " **********The International Monetary Fund and about a dozen countries prepared today to make more than $1.6 billion of credits available to Argentina, based on fresh austerity pledges expected from it. **********The I.M.F. would provide $1.2 billion under a new agreement with the 18-month-old democratic Government of President Raul Alfonsin. The accord would replace one that was reached last year but was suspended by the fund on April 1 when Argentina fell out of compliance. **********Analysts were guarded in their assessment of whether the accord would achieve one of its principal aims: a sharp reduction in Argentine inflation. To achieve that, they said, President Alfonsin will have to win cooperation from the powerful Argentine trade union movement, which could be difficult. **********Emergency Financing Set **********Meanwhile, the United States, Japan and several governments of Western Europe and Latin America would provide a short-term loan of up to $450 million to give cash-starved Argentina immediate funds until it gets the new I.M.F. credits.

Brodersohn, Argentina's chief debt negotiator, postponed a news conference to Tuesday. **********Argentina, which owes foreign creditors $48 billion, had been under strong pressure to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund before today, when Washington bank regulators met to review the quality of foreign loans to about 20 countries held by American banks. But the regulators, comprising the Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee, put off any re-evaluation of Argentina's debts until later in the week, evidently to give the negotiators more time to resolve the crisis. **********Bankers feared that the regulators might downgrade their credit rating of Argentine loans held by American banks. That could make the banks set aside sizable reserves against the loans, cutting into their profits. **********Stretching Out Timetable **********This, in turn, would endanger efforts under way for some months to stretch out the repayment timetable for $14 billion of Argentine foreign debt and to provide $4.2 billion of new bank loans to Argentina. **********The Buenos Aires Government announced last Friday that an agreement had been reached at staff level with the I.M.F. But it still requires approval by the fund's managing director, Jacques de Larosiere. He then must forward it to the governing board for its final approval. **********Argentina has said that once the I.M.F. accord is approved, the nation will make a $600 million payment to its creditor banks. It is now more than 90 days late on interest repayments of about $1.5 billion, banking sources reported. **********Argentina had paid up through last Nov. 4, and two months ago it made a $50 million interest payment covering public sector maturities after Nov. 4. **********'Positive Sign' Welcomed **********At that time, William R. Rhodes, a Citicorp vice president and chairman of the steering committee for American banks' loans to Argentina, termed the payment a ''positive sign about the Government's intentions to meet its obligations.'' **********According to newspapers in Argentina, the I.M.F. agreement that was reached at staff level last week calls for Argentine inflation to be slowed to a monthly rate of 8 percent by next April. Consumer prices rose 25.1 percent in May, after increasing 29.5 percent in April and 26.5 percent in March. But prices at the wholesale level went up 31.2 percent in May, stirring doubt about the future. **********The Argentine newspaper reports also said the accord calls for stiffer tax measures, cuts in public spending, higher fees charged for Government services and a sharp reduction in the federal deficit. **********Meanwhile, the Argentine peso would be devalued to promote exports and reduce the nation's trade deficit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/21/world/cuban-defector-discusses-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1985-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CUBAN DEFECTOR DISCUSSES FUNDS", "print_headline": "CUBAN DEFECTOR DISCUSSES FUNDS", "body_text": " **********A Cuban defector who was the target of a Cuban kidnapping attempt here said in a published interview today that he collected nearly $500,000 in ''commissions'' in his Government job before fleeing Cuba. **********The defector, Manuel Antonio Sanchez Perez, an economic vice minister who oversaw much of Cuba's purchasing abroad, said in the interview in a Spanish newspaper, El Pais, that the commissions were illegal inside Cuba but that he considered them normal elsewhere. **********Spanish Foreign Ministry officials said Mr. Sanchez's remarks appeared to put new light on Cuban assertions last week that he was a ''vulgar thief.'' **********Spanish officials said they were awaiting the results of a police investigation on the defector's request for permanent political asylum. **********The officials said they still were unlikely to grant an oral request from Cuba for extradition because of Spanish anger over the kidnapping attempt, which they said also indicated that a fair trial in Cuba would be unlikely. **********Link to Sensitive Information **********The officials said the kidnapping attempt appeared to be related to sensitive information that Mr. Sanchez has on the Cuban economy, technological purchases and expenditures in places such as Angola.

The less time there is to go before Geneva, the stronger the expectation of positive practical results at the talks between the leaders of the two great powers. **********The latest meeting of this kind took place more than six years ago, and since then Soviet-American relations have sharply deteriorated - in the first place because of the tough confrontation policy of the Reagan Administration, which has from the very first days purposefully sought to dismantle the peaceful edifice of detente and started implementing the gigantic program of a buildup of the U.S. armed forces, having spent a trillion dollars on it in the course of four years. **********In the interview the American President readily repeated the words which he stinted so niggardly during his first months and years in the White House: ''We must learn to live in peace. A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. And this means that our countries must not fight any type of war.'' The Soviet people, just like the Americans and like all other nations, are of course prepared to welcome the hope, voiced by the President, that his meeting with the Soviet leader ''can start us on the road toward the goal our countries have set: the radical reduction of nuclear weapons and steps to achieve their complete elimination.'' **********Arbitrary Use of Facts Charged **********But however good general words sound, their true worth can only be known from practical actions and facts, from real manifestations and directions of policy. So let us first speak of arbitrary use of facts. The President says that his Administration has made dozens of concrete proposals to the Soviet Union, which ''cover every sphere of our relationship,'' but he sidesteps the fact that with his coming to the White House the U.S. Administration suspended Soviet-American talks on limiting nuclear arms in Europe and talks on limiting and reducing strategic arms for more than a year. It unilaterally terminated the operation of a number of agreements. **********The President makes propaganda for American proposals, covered with archive dust, for strategic arms reduction, but forgets to say that they are one-sided and give unilateral advantages to the nuclear forces of his country, while providing for undercutting the most important component of the strategic forces of the U.S.S.R. He recalls with praise his ''zero option'' concerning medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe, but does not specify that if it is carried out, the Soviet Union would indeed be left with a zero, while the Americans would be left with their nuclear-capable aircraft, their submarines with nuclear missiles and, besides, the nuclear weapons of Britain and France, which are also trained on Soviet territory. **********President Reagan speaks about the U.S. proposal to reduce the number of warheads on ballistic missiles (ICBM's and SLBM's) down to 5,000 on each side. On the face of it, it may seem that this is an equal number. But there is no equality here. In real fact, this proposal is a way toward a military advantage of the U.S.A. The American approach leaves open the channel toward a buildup of warheads on long-range cruise missiles. The American side is trying to place the cruise missiles outside the framework of negotiations and reductions. It is evading the Soviet proposal on a ban on such missiles, declaring in general form that the U.S.A. is prepared to limit somewhat only air-based cruise missiles. **********We would like to touch specially upon the American plans to militarize outer space and how they are presented in President Reagan's interview. These plans, which have been actively and perseveringly implemented after the U.S. President put forward his Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983, have become the main stumbling block in the way toward improving Soviet-American relations and the whole international atmosphere. This stumbling block can be neither passed over nor disregarded. **********In the interview with us, the President tried to present the case so as to show that the main obstacle to the strengthening of international peace is ostensibly the struggle for social and economic independence, the struggle which is being waged at a cost of tremendous sacrifices by countries and peoples that have freed themselves from the yoke of colonialism and imperialism. Reagan specially singled out such countries as Angola, Afghanistan and Kampuchea. **********One can share Reagan's indignation at the use of booby traps in Afghanistan. Those are made in the shape of toys which cripple children. However, it must be recalled that booby traps are a U.S. invention and they were used way back in Indochina. At present they are being used by the U.S.A.'s hirelings. **********The interview turned out to be contradictory. The good words about peace, about the striving for accord with the Soviet Union, went side by side with the unfounded accusations with regard to our country's foreign policy. Still, the very fact of the recognition of the need for extensive Soviet-American dialogue is a positive sign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/21/world/summit-what-fruit-will-it-bear-director-star-wars-predicting-speed-up-when.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1985-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  DIRECTOR OF 'STAR WARS' PREDICTING A SPEED-UP WHEN MEETING ENDS", "print_headline": "THE SUMMIT: WHAT FRUIT WILL IT BEAR?;   DIRECTOR OF 'STAR WARS' PREDICTING A SPEED-UP WHEN MEETING ENDS", "body_text": " **********The director of the Strategic Defense Initiative program said today that he expected to receive instructions after the Geneva summit to move ahead ''much more quickly and effectively'' with the design of a space-based defense against nuclear missiles. **********The director, Lieut. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, apparently seeking to counter speculation that the Reagan Administration would agree to limits on the research program, popularly called ''Star Wars,'' told military officials and defense industry executives at a space technology conference here that ''when the team comes back from Geneva, it will not be to say what we must give up, but rather that we must go ahead even faster.'' **********General Abrahamson also disclosed for the first time that the Pentagon had recentlly destroyed a mock-up of a Soviet SS-18 missile booster with a hardened plastic pellet fired at tremendous velocity. **********Showing a photograph of the splintered booster, he said that the test demonstrated the potential of electromagnetic rail guns, a highly experimental kinetic-energy weapon that could be based in space to cripple incoming nuclear missiles. In the experiment, the pellet was fired from a special air gun. **********'Only a Few Diehards Left' **********The disclosure marked the second time in recent months that Pentagon officials have declassified the results of a key experiment involving new strategic defense technologies. A few weeks ago, in what some industry officials said was an effort to demonstrate to Congress that ''Star Wars'' research is progressing rapidly, General Abrahamson released photographs of a Titan missile booster destroyed by a chemical laser at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. **********Yesterday, he cited the success of the two experiments and the results of several recent public-opinion polls to argue that support for the ''Star Wars'' program is growing quickly in Congress and among the public. **********''The S.D.I. debate is changing,'' he said. A year ago he had encountered numerous skeptics, he went on, but today ''there are only a few diehards left, sincere diehards, but only a very few, who still say this doesn't make sense, or who ask why we should do this to begin with.'' **********''The question,'' he told the conference, where a number of companies are promoting their potential contributions to the project, ''is no longer can we do such a thing, but when, how fast and at what cost.'' **********The general's comments about the results of the Geneva talks surprised many at the opening day of the symposium, which is sponsored by the United States Space Foundation, a group that supports space ventures. **********Program Not 'Bargaining Chip' **********In his talk, he said that the ''Star Wars'' program ''was one of the things that brought the Russians back to the table.'' **********Pressed by reporters, he said he rejected the notion that the Reagan Administration ever intended to use strategic defense research as a bargaining ploy. ''Your assumption is that S.D.I. is a bargaining chip to be thrown away or that it is an opponent of arms control,'' he said after his speech. ''That is not the case. There are shades of gray in between.'' **********Asked whether he thought that testing the space defense system would require modifications to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty, which was expected to be a critical topic at the Geneva talks, he repeated earlier statements that the basic research phase of the project could stay within the treaty's bounds. But in the 1990's, he said, ''there will come a time when, in order to have confidence in a developed system, we must have modifications of the ABM treaty.'' **********Details of the kinetic-energy experiment were sketchy, and analysts at the conference said they could not measure its significance. Pentagon officials said the experiment was performed at a Delco Electronics facility, part of the General Motors Corporation, and that the target was a scale model one third the size of an actual SS-18 booster."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/23/business/your-money.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1985-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YOUR MONEY", "print_headline": "YOUR MONEY", "body_text": " **********AMONG the many investments with tax advantages offered to individuals today, one of the least known is the simplified employee pension, or SEP. Yet this type of plan allows some workers to set aside as much as $30,000 a year of tax-deferred funds, with the income from the investment also compounded on a tax-deferred basis. **********The plans are, in effect, groups of Individual Retirement Accounts subject to the same early withdrawal penalties imposed on regular I.R.A.'s - and are therefore widely referred to as SEP- I.R.A.'s. In contrast to standard I.R.A.'s, for which the maximum contribution is $2,000 of earned income, the maximum contribution to the simplified pension plan is 750 percent greater. And individuals can have both an I.R.A. and a simplified pension account at the same institution or at different ones. **********However, an individual cannot establish a simplified pension plan alone. It must be created as a retirement program by an employer, who would then send the appropriate amounts to an account at an institution selected by each worker. While a company can encourage the use of the same custodian for all eligible employees in the simplified pension plan, it cannot require that any single bank or other trustee be used. **********Simplified employee pension plans were created by the Revenue Act of 1978 in an effort to provide an alternative for employers, particularly small concerns, that considered formal pension or profit- sharing plans too complex or too costly. No trusts are necessary, nor is special plan approval. Only a simple form is required, with the simplified plan deemed to be executed when the workers have set up their appropriate I.R.A.'s. **********For most of the time that the concept of the simplified pension plan has existed, relatively few companies have set them up. A major reason has been that the 1978 tax law also created salary reduction plans - the so-called 401(k) plans - another program that allows employees to save pretax dollars, also as much as $30,000 annually. **********''In theory you can have both, but in the recent past, employers have been opting for the 401(k) because it provides greater flexibility,'' said Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ''And you don't have the hardship withdrawal provisions with simplified employee pensions as you do with the 401(k).'' **********Beginning last year, according to the Internal Revenue Service, employees with simplified employee pensions have been able to deduct the lesser of $30,000 or 15 percent of earnings. This increase in the limitation on deductible contributions from the previous maximum of $15,000 - coupled with the provisions in the 1984 tax law that brought many of the reporting requirements of Keogh plans for the self-employed in line with the corporate pension plans - has stimulated greater interest in the simplified pension plan among businesses that previously disregarded the idea. **********''Another advantage is that tax-deductible contributions can be made to a simplified employee pension for workers who are over 70 1/2,'' said Harry J. Shlinger, tax partner of the certified public accounting firm of Weber Lipshie & Company. ''But you cannot make contributions to a regular I.R.A. when you are over 70 1/2.'' **********Employer contributions to a simplified pension plan must be reported by employees as income, but individuals can claim an offsetting deduction on tax returns. All such plans must be nondiscriminatory and so cannot favor officers, large stockholders or highly compensated employees. Thus participation must be made available to virtually all employees who are at least 25 years old and have worked at the company during a minimum of three of the five preceding calendar years, if any contributions are made for a certain year. **********That ''if'' is an important consideration, because even though employers have to develop a written allocation formula, they are not committed to make annual contributions to the simplified pension plan. As a result, an individual cannot determine in advance whether future contributions will be made since the employer does not have to state why payments are authorized in one year but not in the next. **********In addition, lump-sum distributions from a simplified pension plan do not qualify for the favorable tax treatment known as 10-year forward averaging and are therefore taxable as ordinary income. On the other hand, withdrawals from simplified employee pensions may be rolled over into other I.R.A.'s, with one rollover permitted annually, and unlimited direct transfers between custodians are allowed under the tax laws. **********The Treasury Department's tax-simplification proposals call for the elimination of 10-year forward averaging for many pension plans, though, which would remove that point of differentiation with simplified pension plans. Such proposals, of course, have not yet been enacted. **********Further details about simplified employee pensions can be found in a section of I.R.S. publication 590, ''Individual Retirement Arrangements.''

It was at that church that Pope John XXIII called Vatican II exactly 26 years ago today. **********John Paul said this year's synod would seek to ''relive, in some way, that extraordinary atmosphere of ecclesiastical communion that characterized'' Vatican II. **********To Leave for South America **********But he said the synod would also re- examine the changes wrought by the Council ''in the light of new needs.'' **********The synod will be held in Rome from Nov. 25 to Dec. 8, and its brevity suggested that its purpose would not be to rethink church doctrine. **********In his statement, made on the eve of his 12-day visit to South America, the Pope repeatedly praised the spirit of Vatican II, which he said ''remains the fundamental event in the life of the contemporary church.'' **********But his call comes at a time when he and other top Vatican officials have sought to reinforce church discipline and have warned against what they see as a growing laxity in the church. **********In New York, Archbishop John J. O'Connor welcomed the Vatican move and said he felt it reflected concern that the Council's work had been ''misinterpreted and perhaps misused.'' (Page 4.) **********Council's Sweeping Changes **********Vatican II, held from 1962 to 1965, brought about sweeping changes, both in church practice and in the way Roman Catholicism perceived its mission in the world. It stressed individual freedom, altered the Catholic liturgy and encouraged social action on the part of Catholics. **********In recent years, Catholics have argued, at times bitterly, over the meaning of Vatican II. Some traditionalists have contended that more liberal Catholics have used the council's spirit to dilute church doctrine and Catholic identity. Liberals, in turn, have accused the traditionalists of seeking to move away from the concerns and changes of Vatican II. **********Catholic leaders representing various points of view said tonight that the call for a synod might represent an effort by the Pope to further the cause of church discipline and back away from what some Catholics see as excesses bred by Vatican II. **********A high-ranking Vatican official said this week that the Pope was concerned about threats to church unity on essential doctrinal matters and that a move toward more authoritative church pronouncements was likely. **********Several recent Vatican actions have been seen as signs of greater discipline. They include a document criticizing the theology of liberation, a school of thought that calls for the transformation of society through political action. The influence of liberation theology is strong in Latin America. particularly in its emphasis on the church's commitment to the poor. The Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith criticized some advocates of liberation theology for using Marxist concepts, including the idea of class struggle. **********One of the most forceful expressions of the more traditional viewpoint came recently from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, the head of the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and a church leader often believed to speak for the Pope. **********In a widely quoted interview published late last year, Cardinal Ratzinger, a West German, warned that the spirit of the church after Vatican II had passed from ''self-criticism to self-destruction.'' **********'Unfavorable for the Church' **********''It is incontestible that this period has been decidedly unfavorable for the Catholic Church,'' the Cardinal said. **********He added that while Vatican II itself was not to blame, the post-Council ''anti-spirit'' embodied the belief ''everything which is new or presumed new'' would ''always and anyway be better than what already exists.'' **********Tonight, some conservative Catholics welcomed the Pope's announcement as a call to order. **********''Obviously, the Pope is concerned by some of the interpretations that have been placed on Vatican II, which he as an expert on the Council cannot bear,'' said Paul Johnson, a British Catholic and a historian who has written books on both John Paul and John XXIII. **********''One of the purposes of this synod,'' said Mr. Johnson, who strongly supports the Pope's approach, ''would be to remove some of the dangerous illusions and mythology that have grown up around Vatican II.'' **********'Stroke of Genius,' Novak Says **********Michael Novak, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a leading critic of what he regards as certain liberal tendencies in the church, termed the Pope's call ''a stroke of genius.'' **********''Many observers have been saying for some time that Catholicism is in crisis, a crisis of authority and a crisis of the deadly threat from seductive Marxist analysis,'' Mr. Novak said. ''Millions will welcome a fresh burst of probing and invigorating critique of what happened since Vatican II, both harmful and fruitful.'' **********More liberal Catholics, however, expressed guarded concern. **********Peter Steinfels, editor of Commonweal, an American magazine associated with liberal Catholicism, said, ''Some people in thartment of Agriculture estimates, poor weather kept the Soviet crop down to 170 million tons this year, some 70 million below target."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/15/business/no-economic-quarrels-face-reagan-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1985-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1035, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NO ECONOMIC QUARRELS FACE REAGAN IN CANADA", "print_headline": "NO ECONOMIC QUARRELS FACE REAGAN IN CANADA", "body_text": " **********Almost four years ago, President Reagan visited Canada on his first official trip abroad. He came to complain to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, then Prime Minister. **********The United States was angry with its neighbor over an energy policy intended to discourage foreign ownership and a restrictive attitude toward foreign investment in general and also over aggressive takeover moves by Canadian companies - abetted by the Government and big banks - against American concerns. **********Four days before that meeting, Washington underscored its displeasure by scrapping an East Coast fisheries treaty between the two nations. **********When President Reagan arrives in Quebec on Sunday for two days of talks with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, he will find almost all major economic disputes between the world's two biggest trading partners have vanished. What remains are the perennial smaller disputes about such matters as taxes paid by border broadcasters, licensing of pharmeceuticals and pricing of lumber. **********And this time, in contrast to the American abandonment of the earlier fishing pact, the two leaders are expected to sign a treaty governing exploitation of salmon on the Pacific Coast. **********Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mulroney are both of Irish descent and seem to like each other personally, so their St. Patrick's Day meeting is being dubbed the Shamrock Summit and it is expected to be cordial. **********''As far as resolving conflicts, there is no economic agenda,'' said Stephen Clarkson, a University of Toronto professor and author of ''Canada and the Reagan Challenge,'' a book about the early tensions between Ottawa and the Reagan White House. **********The major reason behind improved relations is Canadian concessions on major issues. Ottawa is in the process of abandoning an energy policy calling for the retroactive nationalization of 25 percent of any oil discovery it wanted. It has introduced legislation that would transform the agency that polices foreign investment into a bureau that promotes investment. And it has indicated a readiness to take unprecedented steps to reduce longstanding trade barriers. **********''Canada has, in fact, removed all the irritants,'' said James Laxer, a political economist at York University here. **********Many of the changes of Mr. Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party Government were haltingly begun under the Liberal Party administration of Mr. Trudeau and then accelerated under the short-lived Government of his Liberal successor, John Turner. **********The changes underline a growing consensus here that American trade and investment can help pull Canada out of an economic morass that finds its unemployment rate at 11.3 percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the United States. **********''Canadian business is concerned that our recovery is still fragile,'' said Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, an organization of 150 chief executives who administer more than $550 million in assets. **********Mr. d'Aquino's answer - and also that of the Mulroney Government - is to greatly increase trade. A third of all Canada's jobs are directly related to exports. **********In particular, exports to the United States are growing at such a rate that Mr. Trudeau's ''third option'' of directing trade to countries other than the United States seems increasingly forgotten. During the last year, the proportion of Canada's exports going to its southern neighbor has grown to nearly 77 percent, from 69 percent. This has produced a record bilateral Canadian trade surplus of more than $15 billion (United States currency). **********Much of that trade has been spurred by the strong American dollar and its weak Canadian counterpart. In the last month, the value of the Canadian dollar has plunged by more than 3 cents against the United States currency, with the Canadian dollar now worth about 72 United States cents. **********This year, the nations' two-way trade is exected to surpass $140 billion, outstripping the United States' total trade with both Europe and Japan. **********''We either export or we die,'' Mr. d'Aquino declared. **********A Timetable for Negotiations **********Accordingly, the two national leaders are expected to endorse broad moves to open up bilateral trade. From this declaration of principle, a working group will likely be formed to begin negotiations that some analysts estimate could last as long as two years. **********It is expected to get down to serious work in three months, when the Canadian Government has completed consultations with business and others. **********In the meantime, the leaders are expected to call for establishing formal procedures to deal with specific trade disputes - from forests to fish - that seem to arise constantly. **********United States officials say they are willing to entertain any changes the Canadians want. Freer trade with Canada, which offers a market the size of California's, provides considerable opportunity. Also, Washington views bilateral free-trade pacts, such as the one recently signed with Israel, as a way to prod other countries to resume multilateral trade talks. **********''The broader the arrangement the better, although we haven't said that in public,'' a United States economic official in Ottawa said. **********Provincial Interests Vary **********From Canada's perspective, the issue is complicated by conflicting regional interests, as reflected at a recent meeting of provincial premiers with Mr. Mulroney. **********Frank Miller, the new Premier of Ontario, which is the leading industrial province, is leery of completely abandoning the protection given to textiles, furniture, shoes and other industries. By contrast, Peter Lougheed, Premier of Alberta, a big exporter of natural resources, is pressing for complete free trade. **********But the differences appear to be mainly ones of degree. Canadians know that in any case most tariff barriers are scheduled to be almost completely removed by 1987 under multilateral reductions negotiated several years ago by the top Western trading partners. **********Now, the Canadians fear that they will be badly hurt by protectionist moves in Congress. The growing discussion of an import surcharge by the United States is only the latest worry. Current threats against Canadian fish, hogs, lumber and other products are representative of the concerns. **********For instance, there are proposals to restrict Canadian lumber shipments to 25 percent of the United States market, from 31 percent at present - a move that would cost Canada hundreds of millions of dollars.

The rebels released Miss Duarte and a companion, Ana Cecilia Villeda, who were abducted on Sept. 10. **********Mayors Also Freed **********The rebels also freed at least 23 abducted mayors of small towns. **********Miss Duarte's release was part of a broad agreement, worked out in weeks of halting negotiations. They concluded on Tuesday after three days of direct talks in Panama City between the rebels and Salvadoran Government representatives. **********The events began at dawn, when a cease-fire was declared by both sides and ''a vast delicate operation'' began, a Government spokesman said. **********Shortly before 6 A.M. ambulances fanned out across the nation to pick up the guerrilla war wounded in seven remote locations. At the same time, the spokesman said, rebels started to move the mayors from different places in the northern and eastern mountains to four towns. He said priests, diplomats and Red Cross officials traveled to all these locations to act as witnesses. **********At the International Airport of Comalapa, two planes, sent by the Governments of Panama and Mexico, were waiting to airlift the wounded rebels. Red Cross officials and diplomats had also gathered at the Mariona jail, where most of the prisoners to be released were held. **********Tensions were clearly high. Although Miss Duarte and Miss Villeda arrived with armed guerrilla escorts at Tenancingo at the agreed time of 10 o'clock, the rebels at first refused to release her, Government officials said. Only when the rebels received radio confirmation that the prisoners had left Mariona jail, shortly before noon, were the two women handed over. **********The whole episode has been not only a personal trial for Mr. Duarte but also a political test, with a number of senior military officers questioning whether he should have negotiated with the guerrillas. Some officers told reporters they deplored the virtual halt of Government antiguerrilla operations in the areas where rebels are most active and where the President's daughter might have been held. **********During the final talks in Panama, however, the military command was consulted by telephone and accepted the agreement, sources close to the talks said. **********''There is no question that the Government loses in this negotiation,'' one high Government official said. **********The public image of Mr. Duarte also seemed to have suffered as the kidnapping of his daughter appeared to dominate his activities and became a persistent topic in his declarations. **********Business executives and right-wing political opponents openly criticized Mr. Duarte, saying he put his personal interests above the nation's and was ''soft'' on the rebels. When Mr. Duarte sent several of his children and grandchildren out of the country after reported new threats of kidnappings, some critics said this added to their own sense of insecurity. **********Others in this country, where many people have had relatives kidnapped or killed in the long war, also expressed bitterness at the special treatment given the President's daughter. **********''My father was kidnapped for six months,'' said one woman, referring to an event in 1983. ''We begged the Government, we begged the military and no one did anything then.'' Her father, a doctor, was released after a large ransom was paid to a right-wing group, she said. **********Some of Mr. Duarte's supporters in recent days noted that the Government had not negotiated for the release of the kidnapped mayors until the President's own daughter became involved. **********There have been exchanges of prisoners between the rebels and the Duarte Government on at least two previous occasions. In one exchange that took place over several months last year, the rebels freed 8 army officers in exchange for 4 jailed rebel commanders and safe passage for 60 wounded guerrillas, who left for hospitals in six nations. **********A brother of Defense Minister Eugenio Vides Casanova, a pediatrian, was freed last year in return for at least three captured rebels. **********Of the 22 rebel prisoners released today, 18 wanted to remain in the country; they were driven in Red Cross vehicles Tenancingo, where rebels have long been active. **********Among them were two doctors, a former priest and Nidia Diaz, a rebel commander who sat down with Mr. Duarte at the peace talks a year ago in the village of La Palma. Another, Mauro Araujo, has been described as the second in command of the Communist Party's armed faction, which reportedly carried out Miss Duarte's abduction. A senior member of the Salvadoran judiciary said 19 of the 22 prisoners had been held on ''weak legal ground.'' **********By late afternoon today, it appeared the exchange had been concluded without major incident.

And while no one is accusing him of fabricating the more than 30,000 Tunisians who have been evicted from Libya in recent weeks, even the Prime Minister's associates breezily admit he has used the crisis to consolidate his position. **********''It's only normal,'' one of his close associates said. ''Mzali was weak after there were bread riots last year. Now he's strong.'' **********A Showcase for Development **********The maneuvering is crucial because Mr. Bourguiba, one of the last surviving third world independence leaders, is 82 years old. He suffered a heart attack last November. He still meets daily with his Cabinet, but his attention span is said to be waning. **********Under Mr. Bourguiba's 29-year-old stewardship, this pro-Western nation of seven million people has become one of the most politically tolerant Arab countries and a showcase for development. Per capita income has increased fourfold, to $1,200, and literacy has risen to more than 90 percent. **********But past accomplishments are being forgotten in current disillusion. Wages have been frozen for nearly two years to make up for dropping oil and phosphate income. Only 45,000 of the nearly 70,000 young people who entered the job market last year found jobs, the Government said. **********The opposition demands more democracy, fundamentalists demand more Islamic order and many members of the governing Destourian Socialist Party demand more authoritarian ''Bourguibism.'' **********Apprehension in the Cafes **********Over gritty Turkish coffee and strong mint tea in the coffee shops that are the buzzing center of political life in the country's cities up and down the Mediterranean coast, apprehension can be heard about Tunisia after President Bourguiba - and about Mr. Mzali. **********''He's a humanist, above all,'' said Abdelwaheb Abdallah, director of a Government daily, La Presse, and a Mzali loyalist. **********'We have been deceived by Mzali,'' said Ahmed Mestiri, Secretary General of the Social Democratic Movement, the main opposition party. **********Such differences are typical about a hearty, 59-year-old man who aides say jogs nearly three miles a day and does not smoke or drink. He is also, all sides agree, intellectual, ambitious and frustrated in the shadow of the President. **********''There is an Arab proverb,'' the Mzali associate said, ''that until you drink the water, you haven't gotten to the well. Mzali is still thirsty.'' **********Became Premier in 1980 **********Mr. Mzali was made Prime Minister by Mr. Bourguiba in 1980. Under the Constitution, the Prime Minister succeeds the President when he dies and holds office until the next parliamentary elections, after which Presidents are elected every five years. The next elections are due in November 1986. **********Among the many Tunisians who have been reported wishing to sidetrack Mr. Mzali has been Mr. Bourguiba's independent-minded wife, Wassila. But her favored candidate, former Interior Minister Driss Guiga, was purged from the Government after Mr. Mzali accused him of being responsible for the nearly 100 deaths in the riots last year. **********Mr. Mzali has since put more of his own men in strategic posts in the Government, the provinces and the military. He has kept the Interior Ministry for himself, denying it to Mohammed Sayah, the Minister of Housing and Public Works. Mr. Sayah is allied with the President's son, Habib Bourguiba Jr., who is said to be too sickly to be in the running. **********Mr. Mzali has taken command of the Libyan crisis. He cut most relations with Libya and drummed up outside support in what were ostensibly Arab League and trade visits to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Czechoslovakia. He thus established his clear pre-eminence over Foreign Minister Beji Caid Essebsi, another presidential contender. **********'We Will Triumph' **********Mr. Bourguiba could still replace his Prime Minister, but the President has a history of not doing so lightly. ''Be reassured,'' the President told the party central committee in March, ''as long as Bourguiba lives, and as long as Mzali lives, we will triumph, whatever the circumstances.'' **********It is a support born not in affection -the two men are said to be distant with each other - but in political calculation. Mr. Bourguiba, all sides say, apparently thinks Mr. Mzali is the best man for the job. **********Mr. Mzali has at various times been Minister of Defense, Health and Education, and has headed national youth and sports programs and the national television. **********The holder of degrees in philosophy and literature from the Sorbonne, he has published 13 books, two of them in French and three of them, works on North African history, translations from French into Arabic. **********Program of Westernization **********As Education Minister in the 1970's, he required that many Arab texts replace French ones in the schools, raising suspicions that as President he might reverse Mr. Bourguiba's program of Westernization. Tunisian women are among the most liberated in the Arab world, and fundamentalist groups have been banned from politics. **********The Prime Minister's loyalists scoff at the fears, noting that Mr. Mzali's wife, Fethia, is Minister of Family and the Promotion of Women and that his six children were allowed to marry as they pleased. **********Mr. Mzali, a proponent of an economic free market, also professes to favor political pluralism. He has freed political prisoners and legalized three small opposition parties. **********But opposition leaders boycotted municipal elections this year, charging betrayal. Some members of the opposition had been dismissed from jobs, some party offices burned and opposition newspapers shut down when criticism got too strong. Mr. Mzali has said overzealous loyalists were mostly at fault. **********Mr. Mzali turned on the powerful Tunisian General Union of Workers during the Libyan crisis. The confederation has patriotically canceled strikes so far. But it has refused to pledge to forgo strikes and raises over coming months, as Mr. Mzali demands. **********Virtually charging collusion with Libya, Mr. Mzali has retaliated by canceling salary deductions for union dues and ending union leaders' paid leaves of absence from their regular jobs. **********''Tunisians are politically mature,'' Taieb Baccouche, secretary general of the unions, said, ''and the succession will evolve normally. But the opposition and unions will grow after Bourguiba goes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/04/world/nicaraguan-rebels-said-to-get-missiles.html": {"writer_name": "James LeMOYNE", "pub_date": "1985-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUAN REBELS SAID TO GET MISSILES", "print_headline": "NICARAGUAN REBELS SAID TO GET MISSILES", "body_text": " **********Nicaraguan anti-Government guerrillas have recently acquired surface-to-air missiles and have moved out from their main camp on the Honduran border, according to two Western diplomats and a rebel official here. **********The rebel spokesman, Frank Arana, said the guerrillas had acquired supplies in the last month and would soon attack inside Nicaragua. But Western and Honduran officials here question the guerrillas' ability to mount an offensive, saying as many as 7,000 of the 13,000 armed rebels in the Nicaraguan Democratic Force are still inside Honduras. **********The reported acquisition of surface-to-air missiles would represent a major improvement in the weapons available to the rebels, who appear to be the first guerrilla force in Latin America to receive such weapons. An NBC News crew was allowed to film a rebel holding a missile in the main guerrilla camp on the Honduran border last week. An effort to reach the base was unsuccessful, and a rebel official said it was now closed to reporters. **********The vote in Congress last week rejecting renewed assistance to the guerrillas appears to have had less of an effect here than was expected. Rebel and Honduran officials said in interviews that they believed President Reagan would eventually win new assistance for the rebels and that Honduras remained willing to allow them to operate from its territory. **********Vote in Congress Called Farce **********''We consider the vote in Congress to be a farce,'' said a senior Honduran Army officer, who is considered a key adviser to the high command. ''Any U.S. corporation could come up with $14 million.'' **********Mr. Reagan telephoned the Honduran President, Roberto Suazo Cordova, after the vote last week to reassure him of the Administration's continued commitment to the rebels, Honduran and Western officials here said. **********A high-level Honduran delegation was in Washington discussing the guerrilla force, as well as increased American economic and military aid to Honduras, the officials added. **********''I do believe they are convinced of the determination of the Administration to prevail on this one,'' a Western diplomat in Honduras said. **********It appears that although the rebels may not have sufficient supplies to sustain an offensive, they have established a support network that allows them to survive as a fighting force, according to Honduran and other Western officials. **********Honduran officials said in interviews that their chief concern was that the rebels would remain inside Honduras, prompting Sandinista attacks that embarrass the Government and occasionally cause civilian casualties. A Western diplomat said he believed the coming rainy season would give the guerrillas a breathing space since Sandinista units would find it more difficult to operate and get supplies in the isolated northern provinces, where the rebels carry out most of their attacks. **********There appear to have been almost no guerrilla attacks inside Nicaragua in recent months as the rebels have waited for supplies on the Honduran border. The Sandinistas have taken advantage of the rebels' weakness to relocate thousands of people suspected of sympathizing with the rebels and to move about 6,000 troops to near the main guerrilla base, rebel and Western officials say. The Sandinistas have also begun to build a road to the area, they added. **********Rebel Base Is Attacked **********Sandinista forces attacked the rebel base with rockets last week, killing one guerrilla, according to Mr. Arana, the rebel spokesman. A television newsman who left the camp last week said the Sandinistas had also mined the road to the base. **********One of the guerrillas' chief worries is that the Sandinistas will soon use Soviet-made MI-24 helicopter gunships against them. The gunships are considered the most powerful combat aircraft in Central America, particularly effective in counterinsurgency operations. Mr. Arana said the rebels had acquired surface-to-air missiles to defend themselves against the helicopters, which he said the Sandinistas had not yet flown in combat. **********It is not clear how the rebels managed to acquire the missiles, nor is it certain that they will use them. The Salvadoran rebels have long debated buying missiles to use against the Salvadoran Air Force, which has recently received two American-supplied A-47 gunships. But the Nicaraguan Government is believed to have counseled the Salvadoran leftists that using missiles would be too great an escalation in the conflict. **********It is possible, however, that the Salvadoran rebels may find it easier to acquire missiles now that the Nicaraguan insurgents have them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/09/world/excerpts-from-speech-by-german-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1519, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY GERMAN PRESIDENT", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY GERMAN PRESIDENT", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from a speech to Parliament today by President Richard von Weizsacker, as translated by the West German Foreign Ministry: **********Many nations are today commemorating the date on which World War II ended in Europe. Every nation is doing so with different feelings, depending on its fate. Be it victory or defeat, liberation from injustice and alien rule or transition to new dependence, division, new alliances, vast shifts of power - May 8, 1945, is a date of decisive historical importance for Europe. **********We Germans are commemorating that date amongst ourselves, as is indeed necesary. We must ourselves find our own standards. We are not assisted in this task if we or others spare our feelings. We need and we have the strength to look truth straight in the eye, without embellishment and without distortion. **********For us May 8 is above all a date to remember what people had to suffer. It is also a date to reflect on the course taken by our own history. The greater honesty we show in commemorating this day, the freer we are to face the consquences with due responsibility. For us Germans, May 8 is not a day of celebration. Those who actually witnessed that day in 1945 think back on highly personal and hence highly different experiences. Some returned home, others lost their home. Some were liberated, whilst for others it was the start of captivity. Many were simply grateful that the fear had past and that they had survived. Others felt, first and foremost, grief at the complete defeat suffered by their country. Some Germans felt bitterness about their shattered illusions, whilst others were grateful for the gift of a new start. **********Liberated All of Us **********Yet with every day something became clearer, and this must be stated on behalf of all of us today: May 8 was a day of liberation. It liberated all of us from the inhumanity and tyranny of the National Socialist regime. **********Nobody will, because of that liberation, forget the grave suffering that only started for many people on May 8. But we must not regard the end of the war as the cause of flight, expulsion and deprivation of freedom. The cause goes back to the start of the tyranny that brought about the war. We must not separate May 8, 1945, from Jan. 30, 1933. **********There is truly no reason for us today to participate in victory celebrations. But there is every reason for us to perceive May 8, 1945, as the end of an aberration in German history, an end bearing seeds of hope for a better future. **********May 8 is a day of remembrance. Remembering means recalling an occurrence honestly and undistortedly so that it becomes a part of our very beings. **********Remembering Jewish Dead **********Today we mourn all the dead of the war and the tyranny. In particular we commemorate the six million Jews who were murdered in German concentration camps. We commemorate all nations that suffered in the war, especially the countless citizens of the Soviet Union and Poland who lost their lives. As Germans, we mourn our own compatriots who perished as soldiers, during air raids at home, in captivity or during expulsion. We commemorated the Sinti and Roman gypsies, the homosexuals and the mentally ill who were killed, as well as the people who had to die for their religious or political beliefs. We commemorate the hostages who were executed. We recall the victims in the resistance movements in all the countries occupied by us. As Germans, we pay homage to the victims in the German resistance, among the public, the military, the churches, the workers and trade unions and the Communists. We commemorate those who did not actively resist, but preferred to die instead of violating their consciences. **********Alongside the endless army of the dead, mountains of human suffering arose grief at the dead, suffering from injury or crippling or barbarous compulsory sterilization, suffering during the air raids, during flight and expulsion, suffering because of rape and pillage, forced labor, injustice and torture, hunger and hardship, suffering because of fear of arrest and death, grief at the loss of everything which one had wrongly believed in and worked for. Today we sorrowfully recall all this human suffering. **********Burden Borne by Women **********Perhaps the greatest burden was borne by the women of all nations. Their suffering, renunciation and silent strength are all too easily forgotten by history. Filled with fear, they worked, bore human life and protected it. It is first and foremost thanks to the women that nations did not disintegrate spiritully on account of the destruction, devastation, atrocities and inhumanity and that they gradually regained their foothold after the war. **********At the root of the tyranny was Hitler's immeasurable hatred against our Jewish compatriots. Hitler had never concealed this hatred from the public, but made the entire nation a tool of it. Only a day before his death, on April 30, 1945, he concluded his so-called will with the words: ''Above all, I call upon the leaders of the nation and their followers to observe painstakingly the race laws and to oppose ruthlessly the poisoners of all nations: international Jewry.'' Hardly any country has in its history always remained free from blame for war or violence. The genocide of the Jews is, however, unparalleled in history. Who Could Be Unsuspecting?  The perpetration of this crime was in the hands of a few people. It was concealed from the eyes of the public, but every German was able to experience what his Jewish compatriots had to suffer, ranging from plain apathy and hidden intolerance to outright hatred. Who could remain unsuspecting after the burning of the synagogues, the plundering, the stigmatization with the Star of David, the deprivation of rights, the ceaseless violation of human dignity? Whoever opened his eyes and ears and sought information could not fail to notice that Jews were being deported. The nature and scope of the destruction may have exceeded human imagination, but apart from the crime itself, there was, in reality, the attempt by too many people, including those of my generation, who were young and were not involved in planning the events and carrying them out, not to take notice of what was happening. There were many ways of not burdening one's conscience, of shunning responsibility, looking away, keeping mum. When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust then became known at the end of the war, all too many of us claimed that they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything. **********There is no such thing as the guilt or innocence of an entire nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective, but personal. There is discovered or concealed individual guilt. There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny. Everyone who directly experienced that era should today quietly ask himself about his involvement then. **********The vast majority of today's population were either children then or had not been born. They cannot profess a guilt of their own for crimes that they did not commit. No discerning person can expect them to wear a penitential robe simply because they are Germans. But their forefathers have left them a grave legacy. All of us, whether guilty or not, whether old or young, must accept the past. We are all affected by its consequences and liable for it. The young and old generations must and can help each other to understand why it is vital to keep alive the memories. It is not a case of coming to terms with the past. That is not possible. It cannot be subsquently modified or made undone. However, anyone who closes his eyes to the past is blind to the present. Whoever refuses to remember the inhumanity is prone to new risks of infection. **********Remember and Reconcile **********The Jewish nation remembers and will always remember. We seek reconciliation. Precisely for this reason we must understand that there can be no reconciliation without remembrance. The experience of millionfold death is part of the very being of every Jew in the world, not only because people cannot forget such atrocities, but also because remembrance is part of the Jewish faith. **********Seeking to forget makes exile all the longer; the secret of redemption lies in remembrance. This oft-quoted Jewish adage surely expresses the idea that faith in God is faith in the work of God in history. Remembrance is experience of the work of God in history. It is the source of faith in redemption. This experience creates hope, creates faith in redemption, in reunification of the divided, in reconciliation. Whoever forgets this experience loses his faith. If we for our part sought to forget what has occurred, instead of remembering it, this would not only be inhuman. We would also impinge upon the faith of the Jews who survived and destroy the basis of reconciliation. We must erect a memorial to thoughts and feelings in our own hearts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/business/business-people-telephone-chief-adds-another-title.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Telephone Chief Adds Another Title", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Telephone Chief Adds Another Title", "body_text": " **********The Southern New England Telephone Company, which provides telephone service to most of Connecticut, said yesterday that its board had elected Walter H.

In the midst of one of the nation's worst farming crises, many of those agricultural futures pits have turned into the equivalent of dust bowls. At the same time, while grain is no longer king, the financial futures markets have blossomed into the most vibrant commodity trading. **********There has been, in fact, a violent shift in the balance of trading. Agricultural futures have plummeted from 64 percent of total volume in 1980 to a mere 25 percent in the first 10 months of this year. Meanwhile, according to the Futures Industry Association, financial futures, including interest rate, equity and currency contracts, have rocketed from 18 percent of the total market in 1980 to 59 percent this year. Precious metals and petroleum futures make up most of the remainder of the market. **********Just One Sign **********This is just one sign of how the farm economy's difficulties have reverberated in the commodity world. Speculators, who add essential volume to the markets, have abandoned the grain pits. Many commodity brokerages have closed, merged or cut back operations. **********And the once-flourishing business of independent floor traders in grain futures has withered. It has grown so bad for many floor traders on the Chicago Board of Trade, the principal arena for trading and speculating in grain futures for more than a century, that they are pulling up stakes in the agricultural pits and migrating to where the action is, the financial futures. **********Recently, for instance, the small, amphitheatre-shaped pit where corn options are traded was almost deserted. Nearby, the pit for Treasury bond futures, the most actively traded futures contract, looked like a packed football stadium with the home team scoring a come-from-behind touchdown every play. **********The decline of the grain futures market has shaken some floor traders who had believed economics was permanently on their side. **********Wrong About the Chinese **********''We thought we'd always have this business because of the need to feed the starving people in the world, like the Chinese,'' said Robert S. Lerner, who holds a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago and worked for 10 years in the corn pit until July 1984, when he switched to trading stock index futures. ''But look now, the Chinese are the ones exporting corn.'' **********Susan Hackmann, a senior grain analyst at Agri Analysis Inc., stated: ''Futures, in general, have been in a slump because we've had low inflation, a stable economy and generally falling interest rates. The U.S. used to be the major exporter of grain. We still are, but our share of the market has fallen to about 26 percent in wheat alone, from 50 percent five years ago.'' **********America's share of the world market began to erode, analysts said, in 1979, with the embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union. ''Adjusting to all that is a process that is very painful and sad, but there will be more of it,'' Miss Hackmann added. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the average daily volume in corn is down 33 percent from last year, to 24,603 contracts; soybean trading is off 42 percent at 28,036 contracts a day, and wheat has slumped 33 percent, to 8,560 contracts. And those levels represent a 60 percent drop from 1983, a better-than-average year for grain futures because of a drought that disrupted supply and raised prices. **********The volume in financial futures, however, has been heading skyward. A record 387,262 Treasury bond futures changed hands on Oct. 30 and volume in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index contract, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hit a new high of 106,231 last Tuesday. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a set amount of a commodity or instrument at a set price at a future date. **********Hedging Continues **********Many commercial interests -farmers, processors and end-users of grain products - continue to rely on futures to hedge themselves against price uncertainty. **********''We will still go to futures when we need that protection,'' said Alphonse DiDominicis, manager of grain purchasing for CPC International, a corn miller. ''But over all, the volume in the grains is way down; I know traders who now have second or third jobs.'' **********What has drained volume has been the desertion of speculators, according to analysts. ''The day of the lawyer or doctor who liked to play these agricultural futures is gone,'' said Patrick O'Connell, a grain analyst with Refco Inc. ''The speculator's in the financials.'' **********Mr. O'Connell cited tax law changes that have made agricultural futures less attractive to wealthy individuals, as well as Federal price support programs that have encouraged overproduction of grains as key factors behind the slump. **********Not all agricultural futures trading is so depressed, though. John J. Conheeny, chairman of Merrill Lynch Futures, pointed out that cattle and coffee futures had been active. And several analysts said that the grains could revive if there was a change in Federal farm policies or a disruption in supplies. **********Price Fluctuations Needed **********For floor traders such as Mr. Lerner, such hopes are not enough. They can make just as much in a falling as in a rising market, but they need price fluctuations to ply their trade. The lack of those movements has left many confused. **********''I haven't figured these markets out,'' said Thomas M. Shuff, a successful soybean trader. Mr. Shuff is an optimist and has remained on his old turf. But he also described business as depressed, tracing the worst of the slump to early 1984. **********''When it hit for real, I began to understand the market less and less,'' he said in the gravely voice typical of a floor trader who is used to shouting all day long. ''There have been days when I have not made one trade.'' **********Mr. Lerner said that what finally drove him out of corn was a substantial loss he sustained 18 months ago that he attributed directly to the declining volume. **********He had developed a complex trading strategy, called a butterfly, in which he took a short or long position on some intermediate-term corn futures contract, say three months out. Then, he would take an opposite, offsetting, position of similar size. About half of this opposite position would be at a longer term, about six months, and the rest would be at a shorter position, say one month; these were the ''wings'' of the strategy. **********Trapped by Thin Volume **********The jolt came when the market turned sharply against the wings of his butterfly, where Mr. Lerner had sold huge amounts of corn short. Normally, he would have been able to quickly trade out of the short position. But volume in the corn futures pit had grown so thin that he could not get out. ''To me, not to be able to get out of a position was a shock, but the liquidity just wasn't there,'' Mr. Lerner recalled. ''I didn't trade for several weeks after that.'' **********That precipitated his move to trading stock index futures. It was not a simple switch to make, though.

It will be 12 hours long and will run on five consecutive nights beginning on Palm Sunday, March 31, and ending Holy Thursday. **********Produced by Vincenzo Labella, who had worked earlier with P.&G. on ''Jesus of Nazareth'' and more recently on ''Marco Polo,'' the new drama has been described by Bruce Cox, director of programming at Compton, as the ''biggest single advertiser-supplied mini-series in the history of television.'' There's that ''big'' again. **********It will also deliver 84 commercial minutes to the Cincinnati giant, which luckily for all of us will only be using 58 minutes because it allowed the host network, NBC-TV, to sell off the remainder to ''compatible advertisers.'' **********The star-filled mini-series is costing the advertiser at least $30 million, so that its plunging an additional $500,000 or so into the Digest ad to insure viewers for its advertising is not surprising. However, using the Digest is. Generally, a tune-in campaign is restricted to newspapers and TV Guide. And TV Guide, which carried a four-page insert for ''Marco Polo,'' also ran an eight-page tune-in ad in 1966, but it was for an entire week of programming on NBC not a single mini-series. **********Richard F. McLoughlin, publisher of the Digest, thinks the print blockbuster might open up a new advertising category for the magazine, whose domestic circulation is 18 million. **********During a recent interview, he stressed the series' compatibility with the spirit of the Digest, describing it as ''entertaining, decent, ethical and with high standards.'' He conceded that, when he described the programming as ''quality,'' he was not using the word as a critic might. **********The Digest advertising concept grew out of a dinner conversation last August between Stephen Fajen, senior vice president and media director at Compton, and Robert L. Wehling, associate general advertising manager at Procter. **********The other day, Mr. Fajen recalled that the two had agreed that the Digest audience was right and that the viewers would have the same values as the readers.

The eight-page ad has been designed therefore to interest and stimulate the viewers of ''Dallas'' and ''Dynasty'' to step up to what the ad characterizes as ''five evenings of the most gripping and significant television of our time.'' **********The first page of the ad will have a theater-program look, including pictures of some stars and the names of even more.

The Ambassador told reporters that he had put together his account of the killing after six hours of interviews. **********He said the killing of the tourist, Leon Klinghoffer, had taken place on Tuesday when the ship was near Tartus, Syria. **********Answer 'Slow in Coming' **********''The hijackers had asked to be put in contact with the Italian and U.S. Ambassadors in Damascus to demand the liberation of 50 Palestinians held in Israel,'' the Italian news agency, ANSA, quoted the Ambassador as saying. ''But the answer was slow in coming and to exercise further pressure, the hijackers decided to kill a first hostage.'' **********Mr. Migliudo said that all the American and British passengers on the ship were forced to lie on the deck. **********''The hijackers pushed him in his chair and dragged him to the side of the boat where - in cold blood - they fired a shot to the forehead. Then the body was dumped into the sea, together with the wheelchair,'' the Ambassador said. **********The Ambassador's story was one of many that emerged today as the ship, the Achille Lauro, lay under a searing sun in the Suez Canal harbor here. **********The Austrian Ambassador to Egypt, Franz Bogen, said he believed that Mr. Klinghoffer was chosen by chance when the hostages wanted a victim to pressure the United States and Israel. ''He was at a certain moment at a certain place available to them and they wanted to put pressure,'' he said. ''So he was the poor victim.'' **********Very few passengers left the ship, but late this afternoon a group of Americans was taken off on a small skiff, to avoid the crush of reporters, ferried over to a port terminal and taken from there by bus to Cairo. The most moving scene came early this afternoon when Marilyn Klinghoffer, the wife of the slain hostage, made her way to the shore. **********She was wearing a white flower print dress and was utterly downcast. She barely raised her eyes to look at the mob of reporters and cameramen who pushed and shoved their way around her. Finally, Mrs. Klinghoffer, looking disraught, looked up and said, ''Get away.'' **********She was accompanied by her friends, Neil and June Kantor, of Metuchen, N.J. Mr. Kantor said that Mrs. Klinghoffer was trying to make a phone call. **********Widow Returns to Ship **********Later, in order to avoid the crowd, the Egyptian authorities took her back to the ship in a small craft. **********As she came back aboard, the group of friends she and her husband had made the journey with stood on the third deck and watched sadly. **********A Swiss woman, Agatha Zollinger, told tonight how one of the Palestinian hijackers, in his 20's, gave her two-year-old grandson bullets to play with. **********''He gave him live bullets to play with. My grandson was very excited and amused,'' Mrs. Zollinger said. **********She said she thought she knew the moment at which Mr. Klinghoffer was shot. At one point, she said, Mr. Klinghoffer's wife came back and asked where her husband was. **********About an hour later, one of the guerillas appeared with blood on his trousers and his shoes. ''It was then I realized Klinghoffer had been killed,'' she said. **********Austrian Woman Hid in Cabin **********One of the most remarkable stories to emerge from the hijacking came today from an Austrian woman, Anna Hoerangner, who, upon learning of the hijacking, immediately locked herself in a cabin and stayed there until early this morning. **********Mrs. Hoerangner, wearing dark slacks and a brown and white silk shirt in a lively pattern, looked spry when she emerged from the ship this afternoon to tell her story. **********She said that she hid herself ''in the cabin, in the toilet, under the bed. I found space to cover myself.'' **********She said she knew the ship was being hijacked ''because I was the only one on the gangway when people came with guns. They started shooting. They threw me down.'' **********Passenger Eludes Gunmen **********Mrs. Hoerangner, who appeared to be in her late 40's and walks with the aid of a cane, said she managed to elude the hijackers because they were searching for other passengers. ''I headed for the next cabin while the hijackers searched for the others,'' she said. **********''First of all, I knew what was going on and I knew that we all had to take a walk in a certain place in the boat and I could not walk because I had been pushed. After I fell, I saw that the hijackers were going to other places and luckily enough, just the next cabin happened to be opened. **********''If it had been another cabin, I would not have reached it because it was too far away,'' she said. ''I was very lucky.'' **********She said the feeling of realizing the ship was being hijacked ''was awful, I could really not describe it.'' **********'Everything Was Very Silent' **********She said she thought the hijacking might be over ''because at 2 o'clock, everything was very silent and I thought that if everything kept silent until 4 o'clock my time, if everything remains like this it must be over.'' **********''But I didn't get out at 4 because I didn't dare get out,'' she said. ''Furthermore, the cabin was locked from the outside. Then somebody came to clean up the room and he saw me and wanted to leave the cabin, but I called him back. I asked him if everything was over.'' **********Mrs. Hoerangner said she found two apples in the cabin she had locked herself into. ''Everyday I ate half an apple and was drinking from the available water,'' she said. **********It was still not clear to what extent the passengers had a clear view of Mr. Klinghoffer's killing. For example, the Austrian Ambassador, Franz Bogen, told reporters after he had come off the ship this morning that the ship captain had tried to watch the killing, but had been pushed away by gunmen. **********Captain Kept Away **********''The captain was on the bridge and it happened on the deck below,'' Mr. Bogen said. The Ambassador said the captain wanted to move forward to see what was happening but ''they threatened to shoot him if he moved to look up.'' **********Later, however, Mr. Bogen said, ''He saw the victim with blood on his legs.'' **********''A couple of people told me that they could hear the shooting,'' the Austrian Ambassador said at another point. He said that the largest number of passengers on the ship were Austrian. **********The Austrian Ambassador said that the four gunmen were remarkably lightly armed. ''All the devices they had were rather simple devices.'' **********Mr. Bogen said Mrs. Hoerangner was not found until this morning. **********U.S. Envoy's Statement **********The American Ambassador, Nicholas A. Veliotes, appeared to corroborate assertions by the Egyptian authorities that they had not known about the killing on the ship until after they had made their deal with the Palestinians for safe passage. **********''When the Egyptian Government made the agreement, they did not know that an American or anyone had been murdered,'' he said. ''They were told that everyone was fine. That's what happened.'' **********But Mr. Veliotes, whose angry conversation over radio telephone about the hijackers was intercepted last night and published, repeated his statement in more mild terms today. **********''Our position is that these are murderers,'' he said, ''there should be a full investigation and they should be prosecuted according to the laws of Egypt like any other criminals.'' **********Hostages Called Heroes **********Mr. Veliotes described the hostages, led by Mr. Klinghoffer's widow. as ''heroes.'' **********The West German Ambassador reported that the six West Germans on board were in good condition. **********One American official who came off the ship, Janet Patritus, said that she was not sure that anyone had seen the Klinghoffer killing. ''I don't think anybody saw it,'' she said. She said she did not believe Mrs. Klinghoffer was with him at the time of the killing. **********An Italian naval attache, identified only as Mr. Pagnotella, reported that the negotiations with the hijackers had taken place under unusual circumstances. **********He said that Egyptians went out to the ship in a small boat and that the leader of the four terrorists had come down onto the small boat to discuss terms with the Egyptian officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/01/business/sec-charges-first-jersey.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1985-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 951, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C. CHARGES FIRST JERSEY", "print_headline": "S.E.C. CHARGES FIRST JERSEY", "body_text": " **********Just a year after settling one set of charges of securities law violations, First Jersey Securities Inc. and its chairman and owner, Robert E. Brennan, were charged yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission with a new series of violations. First Jersey and Mr. Brennan were accused, in the new suit, of defrauding customers of more than $9.6 million through manipulative stock recommendations that produced huge price markups. **********The civil charges, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, allege that the fraudulent activities took place from November 1982 through January 1983, but the suit adds that they could be continuing. **********The charges involve First Jersey's role in making a market for certain over-the-counter issues. The suit claims that First Jersey branches worked in concert in the purported scheme, with one recommending that clients sell shares in a company while another branch was telling other customers to buy those shares. Prices were artificially raised in this way, with First Jersey pocketing the spread, or markups, between the buying and selling prices, the S.E.C. said. It added that some markups exceeded 100 percent. **********S.E.C. Seeks Special Agent **********The commission is seeking to force First Jersey to return the profits earned through the purported scheme and to enjoin the company from further violations. It also asks that a special agent be appointed by the court to review First Jersey's records, for other violations. **********The scrappy, 41-year-old Mr. Brennan, as is his custom, replied to the S.E.C. charges by flinging some of his own back at the commission. He denied the allegations and said that the S.E.C. was being ''vindictive'' because last year's settlement involved no finding of a violation. Under that consent decree, the commission dropped its earlier charges in return for Mr. Brennan's agreeing to an injunction against certain future securities law violations. **********''They have been incredibly irresponsible,'' Mr. Brennan added. ''Somebody has to hold them responsible for this. If it has to be me, I'm ready, willing and able to do that.'' He said that he would vigorously fight the latest charges. **********The charges, which follow a two-and-a-half year investigation, are similar to some of the S.E.C. allegations that were settled in November. **********The settlement grew out of two complaints filed by the S.E.C. in 1979 and 1983. **********The first had alleged that First Jersey was, in effect, manipulating share prices, resulting in markups of as much as 125 percent. **********Four years later, the securities firm was also charged with illegally trading in the shares of companies at the same time it had offerings of the companies' shares under way. **********First Jersey, which now has 32 branches, was founded in New Jersey in 1974, but has since moved its headquarters to Manhattan. It is privately owned by Mr. Brennan, who has run into controversy ever since becoming a stockbroker in 1969. Within months of that start, he was suspended by regulators for misleading a customer about a mutual fund investment. And First Jersey has been investigated by regulators almost since it opened its doors. **********The new suit repeats charges that have been made in a class action lawsuit filed by a former First Jersey customer two weeks ago in a Federal court in Philadelphia. **********Units at Issue **********The S.E.C. suit traces several series of purportedly fraudulent transactions. One begins with the sale of stock in Sovereign Chemical and Petroleum Products, an over-the-counter issue underwritten by First Jersey. It says that, in early November 1982, First Jersey customers were sold 1.1 million units in Sovereign, each unit costing $3 and consisting of three shares of common stock and one warrant. **********Several weeks later, the suit contends, First Jersey's brokers encouraged their customers to sell the units back at a profit. First Jersey paid an average of $3.52 for them. The firm then split up the units into their component parts and resold them separately to different customers at an average price equal to $8.43 a unit. **********The suit argues that the customers had been told that the units could not be split up before May 1983 without the firm's approval, and were not later informed that First Jersey had gone ahead and broken them up. **********Meanwhile, the suit contends, many of the First Jersey customers who earned a profit on Sovereign were encouraged to put their proceeds into another stock, Rampart General Inc., which was passed from branch to branch in the same way. $38 Million Profit Seen As a private firm, First Jersey does not disclose its financial status, but Mr. Brennan said yesterday that he expects it to earn about $38 million this year on revenues of about $180 million. Last year, he said, the company earned just over $30 million. In addition to First Jersey, Mr. Brennan operates several horse racing tracks in New Jersey and a thoroughbred horse breeding business. **********Since the settlement last November, Mr. Brennan has sought to polish his firm's image.

The museum opening had, in any case, been postponed. There were optimistic responses to requests for interviews with Mrs. Binh, who became familiar to Westerners during the Paris peace talks. But then reporters were told, without elaboration, that Mrs. Binh, now Hanoi's Education Minister, was ''out of the country.'' Explanations were in short supply. **********Then there were the missing Russians.

But several events have sent biotechnology issues soaring to record prices - and later pulling back - this month. **********As portfolio manager of the Medical Technology Fund, a mutual fund based in Blue Bell, Pa., Jennifer L. Byrne keeps a close watch on biotechnology stocks. Nearly 17 percent of her fund's $70 million portfolio is invested in this group. **********''Over the near term, I would expect these stocks to digest their recent gains,'' she said yesterday. ''But over the next 18 to 24 months I remain very positive on their prospects.'' **********Biotechnology has been employed for many years to make cheese, beer, dyes and other processed items. But the recent flurry of excitement in the stock market stems from the industry's potential in the medical field, specifically in biologically derived products for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. **********One biotechnology holding in Medical Technology's portfolio, the Cetus Corporation, demonstrates the price volatility of these stocks that only a year ago were spurned by Wall Street. **********In over-the-counter trading, shares of Cetus finished last year at $8.675 and, by the end of October, had climbed to $15.25. In early December, the stock soared to a record $33.375. Last week alone, it jumped $8.75, closing at $29.675. Yesterday, the stock fell $4.125, to $22.75. **********Helping to fuel this meteoric rise were articles in Fortune magazine and the New England Journal of Medicine on a new experimental cancer treatment by scientists at the National Cancer Institute. Cetus, along with several other genetic engineering companies, is active in this area. **********While scientists took special care to voice cautious optimism about the test cancer therapy - a treatment called adoptive immunotherapy - the whiff of even a potential breakthrough sent speculators flocking to biotechnology stocks. Along with Cetus, these issues include Genentech, Amgen and Immunex - all climbing to record prices and later paring their gains. Another factor is the thought that profits can be made in the short term because of the boost the news gives the stock even if the treatment does not turn out to be successful. **********The sharp price moves - both up and down -also demonstrate the workings of the marketplace in issues with a relatively small floating supply of available stock. ''The entire biotechnology industry,'' Mrs. Byrne said, ''has a market capitalization of only $2.6 billion and Genentech accounts for $1.1 billion of that total.'' **********As a result, a sudden bulge of buying sent these issues considerably higher than would have been the case in a stock that has a big floating supply. Similarly, selling waves depressed these stocks unduly. In the rush to buy, speculators also seemed to forget momentarily Wall Street's recurring criticism of biotechnology, namely that for most companies the profits to date are either marginal or nonexistent. **********Pharmaceutical stocks make up the biggest industry weighting - 24 percent - in Medical Technology's portfolio. The fund's two largest individual holdings are Merck and Abbott Laboratories. **********Genentech, whose work focuses on recombinant DNA technology, is the next-largest holding. ''This company has developed two biotechnology products - human insulin and a human growth hormone - already approved by the Food and Drug Administration and ready for marketing,'' the portfolio manager said. **********Genentech, too, illustrates the wide price swings that have become a hallmark of biotechology stocks. As the hottest new issue to come to market in 10 years, it went public in 1980 at $35 a share and, within hours, climbed as high as $86, with eager buyers urging their brokers to get their hands on even 10 shares at a time. In 1982, taking into account a 3-for-2 stock split the following year, the shares sold as low as $17.375. On this adjusted basis, the stock last week traded at a record price of $75.25. Yesterday, it dipped 25 cents, to $68.75. **********So far this year, mutual funds specializing in health care stocks have been the best performing fund group, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Medical Technology shows a total return -market appreciation plus dividends and interest reinvested - of 35.93 percent, compared with 26.47 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********It was a far different story in 1984, when health care funds were out of favor.

Our negotiations are sometimes tough, but without work stoppages.'' **********'Don't Slaughter the Cow' **********''I don't need to carry around a mental picture of management as the enemy,'' he said. ''And we don't see our strategy as blocking roads and having street fights with the police in order to keep individual plants open. **********''Nor,'' he added, ''do we see our role as getting every pfennig we can in wages in difficult times like the last couple of years. There is a German saying, 'Don't slaughter the cow you expect to milk the next morning.' Our members understand why they have had to take token pay increases, less than the rate of inflation, to help the company recover.'' **********Mr. Weihs's union is IG Metall, which represents not only the workers in the Ruhr steel factories but also those in the auto industry and in countless small machine shops and garages across West Germany. With 2.5 million members, it calls itself the largest single free labor union in the world, and unlike other unions in Western Europe, it has lost relatively few of its members - about 200,000 - and little of its economic and political clout. **********The West German labor-union movement is, in fact, probably the outstanding single exception to the systematic decline of such movements in Europe in the last decade. **********Combination of Factors **********What makes West Germany so different? Interviews both in West Germany and elsewhere, where the German unionists are envied, suggest that it is a combination of history, national character and institutional innovation. **********Because the country had to be rebuilt after the war, and had to be rebuilt jointly by workers and management, a spirit of cooperation developed, entirely free from the polemics of class warfare. The unions, starting afresh, managed to stay unified, rather than splintering into politically or religiously oriented units. **********The national passion for security, for risk limitation, led to the creation of co- determination and to an extensive welfare network. And the national passion for hard work made it possible to pay for it all. **********Hans Gert W\"olke, the Thyssen director responsible for industrial relations, says he worries about whether the country's industries can afford ''quite so dense a social safety net'' and six weeks' paid vacation for most workers. **********That it has managed it up until now, he said, is a tribute to ''the fact that the German worker doesn't work very often, but when he does work, he works very, very hard'' - and to the attitude of the unions, which he calls ''most sensible, even if we do grumble.'' **********Worker Councils at Every Level **********To a visitor from Britain, where the wildcat strike and the slowdown are a key part of union tactics, the absence of such activity in West Germany is startling. By law, the West German unions are bound to insure that their members fulfill their contractual obligations. A complex system of worker councils, which exist at every level from the individual plant to huge conglomerates, is used to iron out disputes before they burst into flame. **********''It costs money, of course,'' Mr. W\"olke said. ''Somebody from my staff meets with representatives of one of our councils almost every day. But the system is so successful that if it didn't exist, I would be out campaigning for the establishment of something like it.'' **********In this climate, the West German union federation, which is known as the DGB, has grown steadily richer and more powerful while union groups abroad have suffered. It owns a bank, an insurance company, a big building company, a printing works and a travel agency. **********But it has not yet been able to do much about unemployment, which has reached record levels, and that rankled, especially with IG Metall. **********Pressing for Shorter Workweek **********The big union ultimately decided that the only way to put a real dent in employment was to shorten the workweek, in the hope that that would compel companies to take on more employees. Last year it struck some key automakers to press its claim for a 35-hour workweek, a goal dismissed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl as being both ''silly and dumb.'' **********Joerg Barczynski, the spokesman at the union's national headquarters in Frankfurt, put IG Metall's case this way: **********''More investment will not create more work. In the 1970's, the Social Democrats used to say, 'The profit of today is the investment of tomorrow and the jobs of the day after tomorrow.' But we found, as time went by, that most of the investment went into technological improvement, and the profit of today became the investment of tomorrow and the unemployed of the day after tomorrow. This world needs less and less working time to produce the goods that people want, so the working must be spread around.'' **********The Government proposed to shorten workers' working life rather than their working week, through a system of early retirement that could have been repealed after four years. But the union persisted and eventually cracked the 40-hour barrier. It gained for its members a 38 1/2-hour week with no loss in pay, to be organized flexibly. Some plants will grant more holidays, others may start later or finish earlier, and some may adopt yet another system. **********Optimism and Doubts **********Mr. Barczynski said he was confident the union would eventually attain a 35-hour week without further strikes, and he predicted that even the 38 1/2-hour week would help reduce the jobless rolls. But others are not so sure, including Wolfgang Vogt, a minister in the Labor Ministry. Any new employees taken on, he said, would reflect an improvement in business and not the effects of the shorter week. **********Prof. Bernd von Maydell, an expert on labor unions at the University of Bonn, says he sees IG Metall's achievment as a historic breakthrough, but warns that most companies will try to get more work out of the same workforce to compensate for the change, many by making even larger investments in work-saving machinery. **********In the Netherlands, where a somewhat similar agreement was reached, the unions in effect financed the change by forgoing pay increases that they would otherwise have been expected to gain because of inflation and increased productivity. IG Metall gave up only part of its raise, and hence the West German industries shared the cost of the shorter week. **********For Many, Moonlighting **********It is too early to tell what the effect on efficiency in West Germany will be, but many Dutch businessmen complain that the change has only driven more people into moonlighting to bolster their incomes and that it has caused chaos. **********In a newspaper office, for example, the bookkeeper responsible for issuing cash advances is now absent half a day a week, so advances are simply not issued then. **********Erwin Kristoffersen, head of the international department of the DGB, or Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, says he thinks the IG Metall strike has left a residue of bitterness that could poison the previously healthy relationships between labor and management in West Germany. **********''We have had very little class warfare here,'' he said, ''but perhaps the idea of class struggle was always in the back of the employers' minds, and now they think they can assert it. It was visible in the initial unwillingness of the employers even to negotiate on a 35- hour week, and it shows up in some key people in Government. You can see it in all the Western countries to one extent or another, an unwillingness to take joint responsibility for unemployment, an eagerness to cut the net of social support just when we need it. **********''We are not looking for, and certainly not hoping for, a new kind of class conflict here. We don't need it. But that sort of thing can be imposed from above, if people start behaving like robber barons.'' **********Still, that kind of development seems a long way off at Thyssen headquarters in Duisburg. Mr. Weihs says the time will soon come when workers will want to recoup some of the sacrifices they have made, now that the company has returned to profitability. **********Asked how he will react, Mr. W\"olke answers, ''Our attitude will be positive, because we have to take into account the way in which the work force has helped.'' **********NEXT: Union efforts, particularly in Britain, to regain power."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/business/credit-markets-revival-signs-upset-traders.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1985-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Revival Signs Upset Traders", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;   Revival Signs Upset Traders", "body_text": " **********Bond investors and traders have remained calm in the face of torrid growth in the nation's money supply, but signs that the economy is reviving are enough to give them the jitters and bring on a quick drop in prices and rising interest rates. **********Last week, for example, the bond market hardly reacted at all on Thursday when the Federal Reserve announced another very large increase in the money supply, which lifted the growth rate for the last six months to 11.8 percent. But on Friday, bond prices fell a point or more after the release of a few stronger-than-expected economic statistics, particularly one showing a decline in the trade deficit, which totaled $10.5 billion in July, compared with $13.4 billion in June. **********The trade deficit figure led analysts at Evans Economics to conclude that it is ''apparent that third-quarter gross national product may be a good deal stronger'' than previously anticipated. They raised their forecast for growth during the quarter to 4 percent, from 2 1/2 percent, adjusted for inflation. **********Move Called Exaggerated **********Some analysts said Friday's reaction to one month's trade statistics was exaggerated because of thin trading in advance of a long weekend. But others warned that the activity was a fair example of what to expect if fresh data confirm that the economy is outpacing the 1 percent growth rate of the first half. **********It is widely assumed that rapid money supply growth will not cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy and raise short-term interest rates, as long as the economy's growth rate is significantly less than 4 percent. **********The bond market's reaction to the trade statistics was magnified because the data followed other developments that pointed to a strengthening economy. Earlier in the week, for example, it was reported that new-home sales for July were up by 1.4 percent, and that sales in previous months were greater than initially reported. Economists are also revising their forecasts to account for an increase in car sales since the introduction of cut-rate financing last month. **********''Overall, it seems that the economy is stagnant and underperforming,'' said Victor Chang, a managing director at Ehrlich-Bober Government Securities. ''But the economic numbers in September are going to be more upbeat'' as lower interest rates seem to be stimulating sales of homes and cars. ''The data to be reported this month may only be a statistical rebound, and it may be borrowing from future growth,'' Mr. Chang said, ''but you have to expect that signs of an accelerating economy will be enough to cause some investors to pull back.'' **********The next major clue to the economy's health will be the employment statistics for August, scheduled for release on Friday. A gain of slightly more than 200,000 workers on non-farm payrolls is expected. Such an increase may not do much to clarify the outlook for interest rates, analysts said, since it would show that the economy remains weaker than desired, but not in danger of sliding into a recession. **********Early September is traditionally a time of increased activity in the credit markets, following the slow trading days of August. Investment committees reconvene after summer vacations, and many portfolio managers take a fresh look at their forecasts and their investment strategy. **********Yield on Treasury Bonds **********On the eve of those fresh assesments, the economic future remains uncertain enough that the 10.48 percent yield on 30-year Treasury bonds late Friday was well within the trading range of the last few months. Since mid-May, when the accumulating evidence of a weak economy caused the Federal Reserve to cut the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds has been less than 11 percent, but has not dropped below 10 1/4 percent. **********The Fed's most recent move toward lower rates, in mid-May, came at a time when money supply growth was well above target but the economy was weak. The same conditions now exist, and many economists expect that eventually the Fed will adjust monetary policy to foster lower interest rates. As it has already done, the central bank will say that the growth in money supply is not an inflation threat, since it represents a buildup of savings-type accounts, not money intended for spending on goods and services. **********''When the Fed weighs the risks of a worldwide recession in the near future against the more remote risk of some more inflation due to money supply growth, they must come out on the side of allowing more economic growth,'' said Francis H. Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. ''The Fed's top priority right now is to avoid a recession,'' he said, concluding that interest rates could fall by one-half to one percentage point by winter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/30/world/around-the-world-sri-lanka-india-talks-planned-next-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Sri Lanka-India Talks Planned Next Week", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Sri Lanka-India Talks Planned Next Week", "body_text": " **********President J.

H. Macy & Company is remaining at a high level, despite continuing skepticism that the company's management can carry out its proposed $3.6 billion leveraged buyout. **********Some analysts, investment bankers and retailers believe that the Macy's executives and their adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Company, are having a hard time obtaining financing for the cash deal, which was announced three weeks ago. One  possible financing package would consist of some $500 million in equity from a major investor and the remaining $3.1 billion furnished by lenders. Despite Macy's long-term growth potential, this group argues, lenders are put off by retailing's uncertain prospects next year and the deal may have to be reshaped,  postponed or dropped. **********Investors, however, are apparently not so pessimistic. Macy's stock jumped 16 1/8 the day of the announcement, to 63 1/4. That was still $6.75 a share lower than management's $70 offer, indicating trader uncertainty over the deal. But the stock has not slipped since then - it closed Friday at 64 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange - and its persistence at that level is being read as a qualified vote that the deal will come off. **********Meanwhile, numerous questions are being raised about the implications of the  Oct. 21 offer, which many people consider the most dramatic entrepreneurial play in retailing in some time. A number of conclusions are already being reached: *********** Even if the management buyout is realized, the resulting company would not  be wholly independent. Wall Street sources say that Macy's executive participants would probably wind up with a 10 to 15 percent ownership, five times what they now hold in stock, but they would be answerable to a well-heeled equity partner. That partner, whether it is a shopping-center developer, insurance company, financial services concern or pension fund, would keep a sharp eye on company performance and let its voice be heard. *********** Based on an expected financing of approximately $3 billion, interest payments should range between $300 million and $400 million a year, representing more than the $222 million net profit in Macy's best earnings year, which ended  July 31, 1984. In the following fiscal year, net income dropped 14.6 percent, to $189.3 million. The interest payments would be a burden that Macy's would have to bear for some years to come, putting pressure on its profits and expected growth rate. ''If the company earns less than $5 a share, or its growth falls under 10 percent a year, they will have lots of problems,'' observed one investment banker. *********** Macy's, of course, could raise its own equity by selling one or more of its valuable assets, such as a shopping center, a division or even its Herald Square building in Manhattan, which houses the New York division's flagship store. If a shopping center or a store were sold, then Macy's would have to lease the property from the new owners at or near existing rental-market rates, developers and others point out. Those rates are especially high in such prime locations as Macy's occupies. This, too, would have a negative impact on profits.  Most observers are intrigued by the statement by Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman, that a major reason for a buyout was to retain top management talent.  Some of Macy's brighter executives have drifted off to greener pastures. But some experts, such as Herbert Mines, a New York executive recruiter, are a bit skeptical of this explanation. **********''He doesn't need to go private to give stock options and other incentives,'' said Mr. Mines. ''He's been making some instant millionaires among Macy executives for the last eight years with stock options exercisable in four to five years. But in the end, it won't be personnel stabilization coming from going private as much as from opportunity. Department stores aren't showing the  growth rate that specialty stores are.'' **********In Macy's case, Mr. Mines said, consolidation of its Midwest division into the Atlanta division earlier this year resulted in the displacement of 23 executives: a chairman, a president, 9 senior vice presidents and 12 vice presidents. ''Some were reassigned elsewhere within Macy's, but most left,'' said Mr. Mines. ''Their opportunity was gone.'' **********Mr. Finkelstein declined, through a spokesman, to comment late last week on the progress of the buyout proposal. Goldman, Sachs officials were not available for comment. Macy's annual meeting will be held on Nov. 26, as scheduled. **********According to sources close to Macy's, Mr. Finkelstein confided that he had decided about six months ago to present a purchase proposal to the Macy board. His reasons, the sources said, were that he was ''getting to 60 years old,'' he  did not own much of the company after a long career there and Macy's was ''losing some good people.'' **********Despite the questions raised, some analysts believe that the buyout will materialize.

To supply parts for a seemingly insatiable computer industry, giants like Texas Instruments and Mostek raced to retool their plants for a new generation of memory chips. And three Silicon Valley stalwarts, National Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, spent hundreds of millions of dollars adding plant capacity - sure of a quick payback. **********This summer, in hindsight, those grand expansion plans look like they were assembled by brash river explorers who discover too late that the noise ahead is Niagara Falls. The industry's strategy of overcoming Japanese competition with a combination of new technology and greater manufacturing muscle has gone dramatically awry. A huge flow of Japanese-made chips, combined with slow computer sales and wild price cutting from Japan, have plunged American semiconductor makers into their deepest slump ever. More importantly, the downturn has brought permanent damage to one of the few manufacturing industries whose rapid growth had raised hopes of supplanting the declining rust industries. **********Even when the slump lets up, experts agree, America will have permanently ceded the biggest single portion of the market to Japan: dynamic RAM's, the tiny memory chips that store data in electronic equipment of all sorts, from computers to video cassette recorders. Already, several American companies have aborted plans to manufacture the newly-developed 256K RAM's, which will set the standard for memory chips over the next five years. And only a handful have made prototypes of the next generation of chips - the megabit RAM, four times more powerful. Meantime, half-a-dozen Japanese giants are racing ahead on the megabit RAM. **********''The battle in the RAM memory market is over,'' John J. Lazlo, Jr., technology analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said last week. ''The Japanese won.'' **********Boom-and-bust cycles in semiconductors, of course, are hardlynew. But for the first time a deep and long depression has been accompanied by remarkable gains in Japanese market share. The big Japanese companies - Toshiba, Matsushita, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and others - are also losing money on chips, of course. But they are more diversified than their American counterparts and they appear willing to absorb the losses, which they are offsetting with Walkmans, televisions, and V.C.R.'s. Their goal is to gain market share and perhaps discourage low-cost Korean producers from entering the memory chip fray. **********American industry officials said they garnered solid evidence of the strategy two weeks ago, when they came into possession of a memorandum from Hitachi's San Jose, Calif., field office, urging all Hitachi distributors to undercut competitors' prices by 10 percent - no matter what the cost. **********''I wasn't surprised at all,'' said Dave Gale, a salesman for Intel in Denver who was the first to obtain the document, and who has watched the prices of some of his memory chips drop 75 percent in eight months. ''It's exactly what we've seen happening. I was only amazed they put it in writing.'' Hitachi immediately disavowed the memo, saying it did not reflect company policy. But already, the Japanese inroads have prompted pleas to the Reagan Administration for quick trade action, perhaps through quotas that would limit Japanese memory chip shipments or tariff increases that would drive up Japanese their costs. **********In the past month alone, the shrinkage of the American industry has been dramatic. Texas Instruments has laid off 2,000 employees and forced its president into early retirement. Two thousand employees have gotten pink slips at National. Advanced Micro said Thursday that it was forcing all its workers into a four-day work week. Mostek, stemming losses of $40 million in the first quarter, has slashed its domestic payroll by one-third and mothballed its newest facility for the manufacture of the silicon wafers from which chips are cut. Locked and guarded in Colorado Springs, Colo., the four-year-old plant has suddenly become the electronic industry's equivalent of the abandoned steel mill. **********The downturn has hit virtually every segment of the semiconductor industry, even American strongholds such as logic chips, which process information stored in a computer's memory chips. But while those sales are expected to come back, large-scale memory chip production seems a thing of the past. **********No one doubts that Texas Instruments and Motorola, Intel and National, Advanced Micro and others with diverse products to sell will survive. Increasingly, though, they will be heading into specialty areas in chip manufacturing, where design is more important than production technique. ''We know very well that the emphasis has to be on adding value, in special niches,'' said Richard F. Gamble, acting chief of Mostek. That is a big change for a company that made its name in commodity chips. **********The bigger question is where the Japanese growth will end. Traditionally, Japan has not been strong in logic chips, where design is key and the barrier to entry is much higher. These microprocessors - which actually do the processing and number crunching - depend heavily on the quality of software available to exploit their power, and on the number of computer designers willing to build a specific chip into their systems. Memory chips, in contrast, are interchangeable, so price becomes a much bigger selling factor. For this reason, no one should be surprised that American manufacturers lost the war so easily. Early warning signs came in the late 1970's, when Japan grabbed about 40 percent of the market for 16K memory chips, which can store about 16,000 pieces of information, based largely on American circuit designs. When the Japanese share shot up to two-thirds of the market for the next generation, 64K RAM's designed largely in Japan, industry executives swore they had learned their lesson, and began their expensive revamping efforts. But after a year of shipments of 256K chips, which have four times more storage capacity, the Japanese market share is a whopping 92 percent. **********The danger is not that the whole semiconductor industry is lost; RAM's (the initials stand for Random Access Memory) accounted for only $3 billion of the $26 billion in sales last year of all integrated circuits. But memory chips are a cornerstone of semiconductor technology. Because they are a high-volume product, they serve as a testing ground for designers who need to pack more and more circuits on a tiny slice of silicon, and for manufacturers trying to perfect delicate manufacturing processes that can be disrupted by a tiny speck of dust. **********''Nothing focuses attention on detail like making memory chips,'' said Charles E. Sporck, the president and chief executive officer of National Semiconductor. ''They are the basis for technology used in every part of the industry.'' **********The Japanese, of course, excel at manufacturing technologies, and their skills are growing rapidly in circuit design - the talent that has kept United States makers ahead in the more complex chips. Thus, next to cars, semiconductors have become a major battleground in the growing trade disputes with Japan. On Friday the Semiconductor Industry Association petitioned the Reagan Administration for a ''dramatic improvement'' in United States sales in Japan. And Andrew S. Grove, the outspoken president of Intel, has gathered support for his calls for temporary import quotas or tariffs on Japanese-made circuits. **********''Sooner or later we are going to see Government action,'' Mr. Grove said. ''The question is when - sooner, while it can help, or later, when it doesn't make any difference.'' **********But many doubt whether the Administration will do more than voice strong protests to MITI, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. American industry executives have hardly stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the trade issue. Mostek, for example, opposes any trade barriers. At I.B.M., one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers, John F. Akers, the chief executive officer, expressed ''sympathy and empathy'' last week for beleagured electronics and computer companies. But he drew the line at quotas or tariffs. ''You won't see the I.B.M. company coming down for protectionist activity,'' Mr. Akers said. ''We just don't think it is beneficial for our business or our society.'' **********No matter what the outcome of the debate in Washington, the semiconductor slump seems unlikely to abate soon. The industry's critical ''book-to-bill ratio'' fell sharply again last month, to .72, meaning that companies were getting only $72 in new orders for every $100 in orders shipped. ''Worldwide, it doesn't look like the 1984 shipments will be surpassed until 1987,'' said Mr. Lazlo. ''We have 18 more months of pain.'' **********What aggravates the situation for American semiconductor manufacturers is their extraordinary pace of capital spending over the past three years. The fast-paced growth took two forms. First, many manufacturers hurried simply to expand capacity because of the computer boom. Chip makers also spent heavily to improve quality. **********Most of their existing plants were designed to etch chips with electronic circuits as wide as four or five microns. That is narrow - a human hair is a little more than 80 microns wide - but not narrow enough for a coming generation of super-chips. The new 256K chips pack more than one million transistors in the space that until now held only 250,000. Jamming them in requires shrinking the width of each circuit to one or two microns. **********Preparing for that day is critical to American competitiveness. It is also expensive. Retooling a wafer fabrication laboratory, where the circuits are etched on round wafers of pure silicon, can easily cost more than $100 million. The payback on each plant is calculated according to standard ''learning curves'' - estimates of how quickly the price of a given chip will drop as the manufacturer learns how to work defects out of the system and get a maximum number of perfect chips from each wafer. **********''The thing is, no one could have guessed that the curves would be all wrong,'' said Mr. Grove. What threw off the numbers first was an unexpected inventory glut that built up quickly last September, when computer makers first noticed a slowdown in their business. Soon Japanese firms - along with some of their American counterparts - began dropping prices far lower than usual to move their inventories. And as both sides jockeyed for market share, an all-out price war developed. The 64K RAM's cost about $4 each just a year ago; by last week, some big buyers in California said they could get their hands on the chips for as little as 50 cents each. **********The new 256K RAM's did little better. Eighteen months ago, they sold for as much as $45 each. But as the Japanese revved up their capacity, the price plummetted to about $3.95 - about half of what it should be. **********''The result is there's a much faster shift to 256K's than anyone in the United States expected,'' said Thomas Nunan, a former vice president of Mostek. But at that price, virtually no one in the industry - even the Japanese - can recoup their investment. The point was driven home with force two weeks ago: National Semiconductor announced that it would skip the 256K generation altogether unless the price came back up. **********''We spent well in excess of $100 million on a new wafer fab in Salt Lake City,'' Mr. Sporck said. ''But it was all premised on the chips staying above $5.'' Quickly, National has shifted its plan and will use the plant to make less vulnerable Eproms - Erasable-Programmable Read Only Memories - a specialized type of memory chip whose price has held up better. But according to the Hitachi memo, Eproms are the next Japanese target. **********No one is quite sure why the Japanese drove down prices so rapidly. One theory is that they were worried not about the Americans but about Korean companies like Daweoo Electronics, Gold Star and Samsung. Some have already begun making 256K chips, making Korea the third country with the necessary manufacturing capability. But daunted by the sharp price cuts, Gold Star has already dropped out - saying it will concentrate on megabit chips. **********Indeed, in the United States, the megabit chip is now also the last, glimmering hope - and success there is doubtful. Both I.B.M. and A.T.& T. have announced impressive prototypes. Most experts suspect that within a year, two at the outside, those giants will be producing the new devices in volume, ushering in a new era of enormous economies in computer memory. The two companies, however, use virtually all of their chips in the manufacture of their own computers. Already, the ''merchant'' chip makers seem far behind. **********The evidence was stark at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in New York in February. Among the American merchant-chip makers, only Mostek submitted a design for a one megabit chip. But Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Fujitsu all presented papers describing original designs, evidence that the days of imitation circuits based on U.S. designs are gone. **********The American chip makers, not surprisingly, say there is a big difference between publishing a paper and making a chip. ''Every year they make the same mistake,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, editor of the Technologic Computer Letter. ''And sure enough, every year the people who publish the papers become the market leaders making the chips. I've heard it all before and you can just see what's happening.'' **********Design aside, Americans continue to be amazed at the progress their Japanese competitors have made in manufacturing technology. Recently, reports coming out of Japan indicate that some yields (the number of useable chips from each wafer) on established products, like 64K RAM's, may be running as high as 90 percent. That is about 25 percent higher than most U.S. makers obtain. **********S. Joseph Van Poppelen, a vice president of National Semiconductor, who has spent much time in Japan, said he is not certain that Japanese firms get higher yields, but they invariably move up the learning curve faster. ''Eventually, it all comes down to discipline, dedication to detail and the work ethic,'' he said. ''Before they put a product into production, they have done so much detailed planning and review - much more than we have the dedication to do here - that very little goes wrong.'' **********DIVERSIFICATION: JAPAN'S BIG ADVANTAGE **********TOKYO Falling prices for memory chips squeeze profits in Japan just as tightly as they do in America. But the leading Japanese semiconductor manufacturers shrug off the pain, and churn out the tiny chips in ever larger numbers. Unlike their far less diversified American counterparts, the Japanese companies cover their semiconductor losses with profits from other lines of business. **********John P. Stern, senior representitive for the American Electronics Association, an industry group, said that the major Japanese semiconductor companies have all pledged to nearly double their current production of four million 256K RAM memory chips a month, despite price and oversupply problems. They are continuing to increase the money they invest in research and development: this year, most announced a rise of at least 10 percent. And although in recent weeks many makers have said they would decrease their investment in new facilities, the enormous level of capital investment last year made increases this year unnecessary. **********American chip manufacturers are worried that if the Japanese produce as many chips as they promise, they will be able to drastically reduce prices and increase their market share at a time when some of their American rivals are weak and in danger of bankruptcy. **********It is a strategy, Mr. Stern said, that the Japanese have successfully pursued before, in textiles, automobiles and steel. **********Yet the Japanese, with about 45 percent of their chips going for export - principally to the United States - have by no means been immune to the current slump. Carole A. Ryavec, a computer analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets here, said that she believes all major semiconductor makers will either lose money this year or just break even. **********However, the Japanese semiconductor manufacturers are better equipped to weather the downturn because they are part of larger electronics conglomerates. This financial cushion allows them to spend the large sums they need to meet the costs of innovation. **********By contrast, several American semiconductor companies only produce semiconductors, and many are outgrowths of small entrepreneurial companies. ''Only the biggest makers are going to survive,'' Mrs. Ryavec said. ''The very creative small companies can no longer fund the cost of creating. Americans are up against huge, diversified conglomerates that are dedicated.'' **********Mrs. Ryavec said that she believed Japanese manufacturers would continue their push toward the high end of the market, moving aggressively into logic chips. But she predicted that the slump would curb even the Japanese makers' grandiose plans. Mrs. Ryavec and Mr. Stern agreed that some of the announcements about production targets amounted to little more than posturing to scare competitors. In fact, the extraordinary competitiveness among Japanese companies is a major reason for the oversupply of memory chips; the Japanese hate to let a rival's production target go unmatched. **********Some of the frictions these policies have created, however, will be addressed this week in Tokyo, when top United States trade officials gather for another session of semiconductor trade talks. A United States Embassy official predicted that the agenda would include a discussion of Japanese progress in reducing barriers to the sale of American-made chips here, and a review of existing tariffs. **********Susan Chira"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/18/business/cetus-ends-pact-on-use-of-universities-patents.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1985-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CETUS ENDS PACT ON USE OF UNIVERSITIES' PATENTS", "print_headline": "CETUS ENDS PACT ON USE OF UNIVERSITIES' PATENTS", "body_text": " **********One of the nation's leading biotechnology companies has told two California universities that it has ended its agreement to use their patents covering the fundamental techniques of genetic engineering. **********The company, the Cetus Corporation, sought to minimize the significance of its action, saying it was purely a business decision. Cetus pays $10,000 a year to use the techniques, plus a small amount of royalties on any products produced from them. But the universities are worried that the Cetus action might lead to a new legal showdown over the scope and validity of the important patents, which are held by Stanford and the University of California, San Francisco. **********At stake are tens of millions of dollars in royalties the universities stand to receive if genetic engineering fulfills its promise of leading to new ways of producing drugs, chemicals and improved crops. **********Analysts and patent attorneys of biotechnology companies said it did not appear that other companies would immediately follow the lead of Cetus, which is considered one of the top three biotechnology firms along with Genentech Inc. and Biogen. Genentech, for instance, said it would continue its patent agreement. **********Nevertheless, patent attorneys said, Stanford, which handles the patent licensing for the two universities, would be obligated to take some action against Cetus to defend its patents or risk having other companies follow Cetus. ''It's really tough to have a patent and have people that openly flaunt it,'' said an attorney for one biotechnology concern. **********An action by Stanford would bring about a legal showdown over the scope of the patents. However, such action might not occur for several years because Cetus is not yet selling a product that could infringe on the patents. **********The two patents concern a technique known as recombinant DNA, which is the central technique for splicing genetic material from one organism into another. The pioneering work on such gene splicing was done by Stanley Cohen of Stanford and Herbert Boyer of U.C.S.F. Dr. Cohen of Stanford was actively involved with Cetus as a consultant in its early days in genetic engineering. **********Stanford, which maintains that the patents are extremely broad, has licensed 73 companies who pay $10,000 a year for the rights to use the techniques, plus royalties of one-half percent to 1 percent on the sale of products produced by the techniques. **********So far, since there are few products made by genetic engineering, revenues from the licensing agreements have been small, totaling less than $1 million last year. **********But with products getting closer to commercialization, the revenues could mushroom by the end of the decade, meaning there will be more at stake both for the universities and the companies. **********Niels Reimers, director of Stanford's office of technology licensing, called the decision by Cetus ''a disappointment'' and said the university was evaluating the situation and consulting with its attorneys. He also said the university had previously set aside $200,000 to cover possible litigation over the patents. **********Robert A. Fildes, president of Cetus, said today that the company terminated the agreement because it was not yet marketing any products covered by the patents and did not need the $10,000-a-year license. ''It's not a question of whether the patent is valid or not,'' he said. ''It's a simple business decision.'' He said in the future, if the company needed to use the patented technology, it would enter new discussions with Stanford. **********Nevertheless, Cetus has also suggested it thinks it will not be covered by the patents even when it does start selling products. In a letter to Stanford, Cetus's patent attorney, Albert P. Halluin, said: ''It is our opinion that Cetus's existing and prospective activities are not included within the scope of any valid claim of either patent.'' **********Cetus, based in Emeryville, Calif. is testing two anti-cancer drugs created by gene-splicing: beta-interferon and interleukin-2. The products are not likely to reach the market for several years, Dr. Fildes said. **********Questions about the patents have been lurking for some time. Even before the Cetus decision, Stanford was undertaking a comprehensive review of its patent position, according to its lawyer, Donald Dunner of Washington D.C.. **********The initial patent, covering the basic process of recombinant DNA, was granted in 1980 but a subsequent patent, covering a product used in the technique, were delayed because of questions raised about the patent's validity. **********The lead questioner at that time was Mr. Halluin, who was then working for the Exxon Corporation. Although the second patent was eventually issued in 1984, Mr. Halluin has continued to raise questions about the patents and his views are believed to have influenced Cetus's decision. **********According to some patent attorneys, many companies went along with the licensing agreement in the early days because they did not want to scare off potential investors by being in the position of possibly infringing on a patent and did not want to generate negative publicity by challenging a university. **********In addition, Stanford made the terms very attractive. Its royalties of no more than 1 percent are less than typical drug industry rates of 5 to 10 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/17/world/anti-sandinistas-are-curbed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANTI-SANDINISTAS ARE CURBED", "print_headline": "ANTI-SANDINISTAS ARE CURBED", "body_text": " **********Honduran Army officers said today that the Government had ordered the United States-backed Nicaraguan rebels to abandon three base camps near the Nicaraguan border and to resettle elsewhere. **********The officers said that the order, signed Wednesday by Gen.

Oman, which does not belong to OPEC, has been pricing its crude sold under term contracts this year in line with the declining prices on the spot, or noncontract, market, the traders said. Britain and Norway also have decided to let prices of their North Sea oil follow spot market trends. **********At the same time, OPEC leaders apparently are concerned that some members are not adhering to the group's pricing and production quotas.

The panel completed two days of closed-door talks today, but Sheik Yamani did not specify whether steps would be taken to bolster pricing and production discipline among its members. **********Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, said that, at the meeting of the watchdog panel, ''the central issue was how to defend OPEC and its price structure.'' **********The council includes the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.

They wander outside to look at the placid blue harbor, empty save for the white memorial building that spans what remains of the battleship Arizona, sunk that day long ago. **********In the memorial, they walk past the plaque listing the 1,177 names of the dead. Through the silence of one recent day came the sound of the water lapping the charred ruins. **********Here, in this quiet and understated memorial, the Japanese come to see and confront - some for the first time - the extent of the destruction of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. **********''Frightening,'' said Yoshitaka Ito, 24 years old, who visited the memorial recently with two friends. ''People aren't taught about this in school.'' **********A Remote Historical Event **********Pearl Harbor, like other Japanese actions in World War II, does not seem to weigh heavily on the Japanese consciousness, according to many Japanese historians and others. Those who are old enough to remember, they say, avoid the subject. For those who are younger, the war is a remote event. **********That there is not more public discussion of Japan's role in the war troubles some Japanese who see in their nation a sort of convenient collective amnesia, a striking contrast to Germany, which conducted a public soul-searching this spring. But hand-wringing is not Japan's style. **********''In general, Japanese tend to forget the past, thinking that it can be washed away,'' said Kiyoko Takeda, a professor of Japanese intellectual and social history at International Christian University in Tokyo. ''But I always tell my students that recognizing what we have done in the past is a recognition of ourselves. By conducting a dialogue with our past, we are searching how to go forward.'' **********Professor Takeda is by no means in the mainstream. Pearl Harbor is an event that for most Americans evokes emotional images of betrayal, a day that changed the lives of a generation. It does not loom that large for many Japanese. They see it as a necessary military operation, or as another chapter in the long war that began in the 1930's with Japan's invasion of China. **********'I Don't Feel Guilty' **********''Japan has had a long military history of surprise attacks, and this one was very successful,'' said one middle-aged woman who was a schoolgirl during the war. ''After the war was over, I was glad that we lost, because who knew how far the military would have gone? But although I am not particularly patriotic, Pearl Harbor is not anything to bow my head and apologize for.'' **********''I don't feel guilty about Pearl Harbor,'' said Mieko Hiratani, a 25-year-old magazine editor. ''Wars are often full of treacheries like that, aren't they? I don't think many people of my generation think about the war anyway. It is only one piece of knowledge for the entrance examination.'' **********The presentation of the war in Japanese schools reinforces this matter-of-fact attitude. Textbooks offer a straightforward chronological narrative, devoid of judgment or comment. Neither textbooks nor teachers' guides encourage reflections about the lessons of the past, although they do stress the need for peace. **********For Japanese, Pearl Harbor pales before the horror of Hiroshima. And although no one would deny that the atomic bomb wreaked unprecedented devastation, what concerns scholars like Professor Takeda is what they see as a failure to confront the symbolic importance of Pearl Harbor - Japan's role as an aggressor. **********Focus on Suffering **********This spotlight on the victim permeates most portrayals of the war years. Films about the war focus on Japanese suffering and enemy cruelty. The Japanese marked the 40th anniversary of the war's end this summer with official expressions of sympathy for the soldiers who died on the battlefields. Although some intellectuals raised questions of Japanese culpability for atrocities in Asia, there was little public discussion. **********Most Japanese share a profound sense of fatalism, a resignation to events encouraged by popular interpretations of Buddhism and Confucianism that stress a fixed, often predetermined, course of events, Professor Takeda said. **********Although the questions of individual guilt or self-examination are central preoccupations of the West, Japanese native religions like Shinto do not stress these ideas, Rokuro Hidaka, a professor of sociology at Seika University in Kyoto, said. **********''In Shinto, the priest can purify you and any blemish can be removed,'' he said. ''Also there is a very popular saying, 'Let the past drift away with the water' that fits Japanese sentiments.'' **********Many Do Visit the Memorial **********Nonetheless, many Japanese do brave embarrassment and possible hostility to visit Pearl Harbor. George Hogan, a tour guide at the memorial whose battleship left Pearl Harbor 46 hours before the attack, estimated that about one-third of the 1.4 million yearly visitors might be Japanese, although no official records are kept. **********The Japanese who visit mirror their nation's ambivalence about the war. **********For younger visitors, the memorial seems to spark new insights. The same woman who declined to condemn Pearl Harbor said that her 15-year-old niece was impressed by a short film shown at the memorial. The drama of the film contrasts with school textbooks, where Pearl Harbor is portrayed simply as a military action. In many cases, the school year ends before the class even reaches Pearl Harbor or the war. **********Tomohiko Teramoto, 28, said he decided to visit Pearl Harbor because he had no experience of war. ''It's bad to forget,'' he said. ''Japanese should remember Pearl Harbor, and Americans should remember Hiroshima.'' **********Other visitors, particularly older ones, seemed self-conscious at Pearl Harbor. Masahiro Anzai, 51, found it difficult to meet the gaze of a questioner. ''It's painful,'' he said quietly, and moved away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/07/world/nicaragua-seeks-jailed-rebel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUA SEEKS JAILED REBEL", "print_headline": "NICARAGUA SEEKS JAILED REBEL", "body_text": " **********Nicaragua has asked Honduras to extradite Steadman Fagoth M\"uller, the anti-Sandinista Indian leader who was arrested in Honduras last week. **********The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported today that Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto Brockman had made the extradition request to his Honduran counterpart, Edgardo Paz Barnica. **********Relations between the two countries are poor, and it was considered unlikely that Mr. Fagoth would be turned over to the Nicaraguan authorities.

[Page D11.]  Private analysts were somewhat less enthusiastic about the G.N.P. gain than the Administration was. ''The economy has shown some improvement here,'' said Walter M. Cadette, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, but he added, ''A lot of it is arithmetic.'' **********The nominal gross national product - the country's total output of goods and services before adjustment for inflation - remained at the same 6.7 percent growth rate that was estimated last month. Statistically, therefore, the upward revision in economic growth could be entirely accounted for by a slowing of inflation as measured by the G.N.P. price deflator. **********A 'Moderate' Gain Is Seen **********''It looks to me to be an economy showing moderate improvement,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. But he added that this could be ''more technical than anything else.'' **********Mr. Gramley, a member of the Federal Reserve Board until recently, said today's report made it seem less likely that the Federal Reserve would reduce the so-called discount rate - the interest it charges on loans to financial institutions - below the present level of 7 1/2 percent. **********''I don't think it was in the cards at all,'' Mr. Gramley said. He noted recent hints by the Federal Reserve that it still remained committed to preventing a revival of high inflation. **********The gross national product's third-quarter growth rate was significantly influenced by the strong output of automobiles. This reflected a demand for cars that was encouraged by Detroit's offers of bargain financing. These incentives also seem to have been a factor in suppressing inflation. The deflator now shows a 2.3 percent rate of increase, down from the 3.3 percent reported last month for the quarter. **********The fixed-weighted price index, however, has been revised upward to a 3.1 percent rate from an earlier 2.9 percent. Increasingly, it is considered a somewhat better price gauge because it does not include changes in the composition of the gross national product. **********Adjustment for inflation put today's upward G.N.P. revision at $4.1 billion, reaching an annual rate of $1,688,900,000,000. Most of this gain resulted from a rise in inventories, which grew at a 2.5 percent rate, and a rise in spending by Federal, state and local governments. Military spending was particularly strong. **********Trade Deficit Grew Wider **********This was partly offset by a further deterioration of the nation's trade deficit, which widened to $38.4 billion from $34 billion although the international value of the dollar continued to fall. Few analysts, however, had expected quick improvement in the trade figures. **********According to Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist, the one-point G.N.P. revision would have been twice as large had it not been for the continued weak trade performance. **********Like Mr. Sprinkel, Mr. Ortner expressed optimism about the economy's outlook for the next few quarters. ''I think we're going to see good growth rates through the coming year,'' Mr. Ortner said. **********Although consumer spending will probably slow, he suggested, a further rebuilding of inventories should promote growth. And capital spending, he said, should pick up as the International Business Machines Corporation begins selling its new 3090 computers, widely known as the Sierra line. **********''I.B.M.,'' Mr. Ortner said, ''is getting big enough to shove the economy around.'' **********Pattern of Savings Noted **********One reason economists think consumers will become more tight-fisted is the low level of personal savings that they may be trying to rebuild. Today's report showed that the savings rate fell to 2.7 percent in the third quarter, less then the 2.9 percent estimated previously. **********The economy's 4.3 percent third-quarter growth rate - the fastest expansion since a 7.1 percent gain in the second quarter of 1984 - compared with three-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent in the second quarter. The earliest, or ''flash,'' estimate for the third quarter, when issued in late September, was 2.8 percent, and this was revised upward last month to 3.3 percent. **********But Allan Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment house, said ''no one should be fooled'' by today's report. **********''There is little meaningful growth going on in the economy at the present time and little room for optimism that we have a lasting rebound under way,'' Mr. Sinai said. Much of the third quarter's vigor, he said, came from strong consumer spending - some of it for new cars, which spurted at a rate of 23.3 percent. **********The Government's Mr. Sprinkel, on the other hand, predicted enough growth for the present quarter to achieve the Administration's goal of 3 percent for the full year. **********''We certainly are not on the verge of a sump hole in economic activity, as some observers seem to think,'' Mr. Sprinkel said at a briefing for reporters. **********Data included in the revised figures for gross national product for the third quarter of 1985 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rate.

Hulce, president of the Manville Corporation, likens the impact of the past three years on his company to being hardened by fire. **********On Aug. 26, 1982, Manville took the unusual step of filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code to contend with claims from victims of asbestos-related disease. The move sparked a public outcry over what was then seen as a tactic by the company to avoid its product-liability responsibilities and even prompted Congress to amend the bankruptcy laws last year to prevent other companies from following Manville's example. **********Besides the grueling negotiations with asbestos claimants and other creditors, the Denver-based company has also had to fight like it never had before to reclaim market share from competitors who seized upon Manville's travails as a golden opportunity to steal its business. Manville, which sold its asbestos operations several years ago, is now mainly involved in fiberglass and forest products. **********The pressure has already burned out one generation of managers. Of Manville's 28 corporate officers listed in its 1981 annual report, only 13 remain with the company. John A. McKinney, 61 years old, the company's chief executive since 1977, remains in the top job. But by several accounts, Mr. Hulce, a 43-year-old lawyer who joined Manville in 1972, and two executive vice presidents, William T. Stephens and Charles J. DeBiase, are now the dominant forces in the company. The three were promoted to their present positions late last year. **********Looking to the Future **********By far the biggest challenge now facing this triumvirate - Mr. Stephens, 42, is executive vice president for finance and administration, and Mr. DeBiase, 58, is executive vice president for operations - is to figure out what kind of future Manville can have. **********If its proposed reorganization plan is accepted by creditors and the bankruptcy court, the company will effectively be mortgaging its future for years to come to pay off the asbestos injury claims. Manville has offered to create a trust to settle those claims and fund it with at least half of the company's stock and as much as $2.5 billion or more over 25 years. The company, however, does not expect the cost of settling present and future asbestos health claims to exceed $1.5 billion. **********The proposed plan, which is expected to win approval in some similar form, would mean that Manville will survive - something that was not certain when it filed for Chapter 11. But the heavy financial burden also means that if it is to grow again, the reborn Manville will have to be very different from the stodgy and complacent company it had been. **********''Manville, from top to bottom, is going to have to watch its nickels and pennies,'' said G. Earl Parker, the company's senior vice president for law and public affairs. ''It's going to have to really be sure it gets maximum value out of every asset it has. And that has not been the history of Manville.'' **********Frustrations Seen **********Management experts point out that the proposed plan of reorganization could easily create an operating environment that is as frustrating for Manville's managers as the one they have had to live with for the past three years. At issue is the role of the trust that would be created to settle the asbestos health claims. **********Manville managers are clearly hoping that the trust will content itself with distributing the fund and allow them to decide how to run the business. Indeed, most trusts that have held a large or controlling share of such companies as Hershey Foods and, until recently, Hughes Aircraft have taken this approach, according to several management consultants and academicians. **********But the asbestos trust will probably be a very different animal. Besides being Manville's controlling shareholder, with the right to appoint two directors to Manville's board, it would also be the company's largest creditor and have the right to set financial targets and covenants. After four years, it would also have the right to fire management. Such issues as the size of Manville's board after it has emerged from Chapter 11 and who the trust's five trustees would be have yet to be determined. **********The trust, as a 50 percent stockholder, ''will exercise all the powers that go with a stock position of that size,'' said one lawyer for asbestos-injury victims. **********Considerably Weaker **********There will be another big difference between Manville and other companies that have emerged from Chapter 11. Instead of being financially stronger than when it filed for protection from creditors, Manville will be considerably weaker, with a lower net worth and increased debt obligations, primarily to the trust. Its debt would be as big as its equity, a worrisome level for an American manufacturing corporation and one that would place it outside of all but the most speculative investment portfolios. **********Under Manville's proposal, it would be required to pay commercial creditors a total of $425 million to $475 million within three years. But that cost, coupled with the asbestos settlement, would mean that the company would be operating under a heavy financial burden for years after emerging from Chapter 11. Manville earned $77.2 million last year on revenues of $1.87 billion. **********''The key is whether the company is going to have enough capital to grow and take advantage of new markets and product opportunities,'' said William F. May, a Manville director and the former chairman of the American Can Company. **********Employee Morale **********That uncertainty - together with the uncertainty about the trust's role - could in turn make it difficult to attract and retain managers at a company where employee morale has been on a roller coaster for years. ''I don't know if I'd want to stay'' if the trust interferes in making strategic decisions, said Mr. Hulce. **********As Mr. Hulce and other Manville executives readily acknowledge, if Manville is to grow again, it will have to squeeze much better performance out of the company than in the past. And that will require significant changes in its business mix and corporate culture. **********The company has already embarked on a reorganization of its businesses. In 1982 and 1983, it sold its asbestos and pipe operations. That has left it with strong positions in fiberglass and forest products, two solidly profitable businesses that together accounted for 89.1 percent of operating income and 65.7 percent of sales in 1984. And it also has some promising smaller businesses, such as industrial lighting. But it still must deal with a slew of unprofitable or marginally profitable operations, such as residential roofing. **********Another legacy of Manville's asbestos business, which generated huge amounts of cash for much of the 127-year-old company's history, was a lethargy that the company can now ill afford. Said Mr. Parker, the senior vice president for law and public affairs, ''It's easy to become complacent about product improvement, customer needs and services and, in a sense, to become fat and happy.'' **********Expense Accounts Checked **********Hammered first by the housing slump of the early 1980's and then by the shock of Chapter 11, that attitude has changed. With the exception of the company's chief executive, Mr. McKinney, all senior executives, including Mr. Hulce, must now have their expense accounts approved by superiors. **********Whole corporate departments -ranging from industrial engineering to safety - have disappeared, with responsibilities assigned to operating units, in a drive to slash expenses to no more than 13 percent of revenues, down from about 15 percent currently. The company's employment, which peaked in 1979 at 32,500, has fallen to 20,000, with more cuts expected. And the company is trying to sell its lavish headquarters outside of Denver. **********Manville is also in the midst of reassessing virtually all of its remaining businesses. So far, a handful of relatively small businesses -ranging from specialty insulation to residential roofing - have been earmarked for sale or shutdown. But one source close to Manville's board added, ''They're going to be in a kind of housecleaning mode for the next couple of years.'' **********Near Paralysis **********Manville insiders credit Mr. Hulce, Mr. Stephens and Mr. DeBiase for shaking Manville from the near paralysis that gripped the company for the first two years after it sought Chapter 11 protection. **********Right before it filed for the protection, Manville offered a generous early retirement program to employees with more than 20 years of service who were 55 or older. But even the company was shocked at the number of people - 778, including Manville's president, Fred L. Pundsack, and its chief financial officer, Leo J. Bartolanzo - who accepted the offer. ''That hurt,'' acknowledged Mr. Hulce. **********What hurt even more was the leadership vacuum that these departures created, coming at a time when Manville needed strong direction. ''We ceased doing even perfunctory business planning after Chapter 11,'' said the company's assistant treasurer, Cecil Van Draper. **********Drain on Time **********One of the main reasons for the paralysis was the amount of time that Mr. McKinney had to devote to overseeing negotiations with creditors and lobbying Washington to assume part of the financial responsibility for the asbestos health claims. **********Associates say he became more withdrawn and rigid as the grueling Chapter 11 proceedings wore on and the controversy raged over Manville's tactic of using Chapter 11 to try to define and limit its asbestos liabilities. Mr. McKinney has granted few - if any - interviews in the past three years and declined to be interviewed for this article. And, according to one Manville insider as well as a negotiator for the creditors, progress in the talks stalled until Mr. Hulce and Mr. Stephens began to play a direct role. **********''After McKinney and I had worked on this for two and a half years,'' said Mr. Parker, and seen prospects for reaching a settlement ''disappear time and time again, one begins to run out of steam and lose that aggressive results orientation.'' **********Loss of Market Share **********Mr. Hulce, who before becoming president headed all of Manville's operations outside of forest products and fiberglass and who oversaw the sale of the asbestos and pipe operations, appears to be revitalizing Manville. **********According to analysts, Manville has reversed the erosion in its share of such markets as fiberglass insulation, where Manville estimates its share fell to 22 percent, from about 25 percent. **********''They've gained it back,'' but largely because of discounting, said Barbara T. Alexander, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. **********Others, though, suggest that product innovation and a dramatic improvement in service are responsible for the turnaround. ''They got leaner. They got meaner. They got more aggressive in the marketplace,'' said Dennis J. Ryan, a merchandising manager at The Home Depot, an Atlanta-based home-improvement retail chain. **********Mr. Ryan added: ''Before, if they said they'd ship an order in a week, it might be 12 to 14 days. Today, if they said they'd ship it in a week, it might be six days.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/business/thrift-unit-insolvency-in-florida.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1985-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THRIFT UNIT INSOLVENCY IN FLORIDA", "print_headline": "THRIFT UNIT INSOLVENCY IN FLORIDA", "body_text": " **********The Sunrise Savings and Loan Association of Boynton Beach, Fla., which had grown spectacularly in recent years by lending heavily to construction projects, was taken over and declared insolvent today by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. **********The board said it had replaced the board of directors of the $1.5 billion institution, brought in new management and formed a new institution under the same name to acquire all of Sunrise's assets and liabilities. The new institution has a mutual savings charter, while the former unit was a state-chartered stock association. **********The bank board also said that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation would issue promissory notes to the new thrift institution to insure it was financially solvent. It did not specify the amount. **********Takeover Was Expected **********The takeover was expected on Wall Street. ''The Federal examiners have been in there for a while, and everyone has known it's been in trouble,'' said Thomas Klingenstein, an analyst at Wertheim & Company. **********The bank board said in its announcement today that Sunrise had grown in assets at an excessive rate during its five years of existence -about 320-fold. It was formed in 1980 with only $4.7 million in assets. **********The bank board attributed Sunrise's problems to bad loans, particularly high-risk construction and development loans. In the past, high interest rates have troubled the thrift industry, but recently a more insidious problem has hit the industry: a rush to high-risk loans as thrift institutions have been given powers to make new kinds of loans. **********''I looked at Sunrise about two years ago and found 70 percent of their loans were in construction,'' said Jonathan Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Nobody does that and survives.'' **********Chairman Resigned in April **********Many of Sunrise's troubles appear to be a reflection of the personality and possibly the management of its 34-year-old former chairman, Robert C. Jacoby, who resigned in April. **********Mr. Jacoby was quoted last year as saying: ''I'm an ego-status person. I have a pretty wife, a Jaguar, a Mercedes, a beautiful home, a yacht. I want a Ferrari, a bigger house, a bigger boat. I want an airplane and an apartment in New York.'' **********Sunrise, whose base is 13 miles from West Palm Beach, drew on a large pool of deposits from retirees, money that Mr. Jacoby said was stable and of relatively low cost to attract. In turn the thrift unit, which has 15 branches, would lend the funds to construction projects. **********The bank board has undertaken a course of action at Sunrise that it has used before. Since the failure earlier this year of the Beverly Hills Savings and Loan, the bank board has several times replaced the managements of large failed institutions to get the units' lending practices onto a more conservative, prudent track. **********The bank board said it had hired Amerifirst Federal Savings and Loan Association of Miami to conduct day-to-day management of Sunrise. 15 Insolvencies This Year The bank board said it did not know whether any fraud or self-dealing was involved in Sunrise's troubles. Many of the failures this year among banks and thrift units have involved either fraud or self-dealing, such as loans to officers and affiliated companies. **********So far in 1985, the bank board has declared insolvent 15 thrift units. It has shut down four, merged eight into healthier institutions and replaced three managements, as it did today. Sunrise is the second-largest institution to fail this year, trailing only Beverly Hills. However, industry analysts note that many of the nation's thrift units are essentially insolvent. **********Over-the-counter trading in Sunrise's stock was permanently halted today as the price was hovering around $3.50 a share. The stock had reached nearly $26 in 1984. **********Since the bank board changed the charter into a mutual savings, it appears that shareholders will lose any equity they had in the institution, according to one bank board official.

But less attention was paid to the fact that electrical signals still have to be carried into and out of the chip. That function is performed by the plastic or ceramic packages in which the chips are housed. **********The mundane packages, which also protect the chips from damage, were much less exciting to work on than the chips themselves, and those who did were considered a lower caste among engineers. But now, it is the packaging that is emerging as a bottleneck, restricting efforts to increase the speed and shrink the size of computers. **********''Packaging is now a performance problem,'' said John J. Cox, vice president of operations of the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a consortium of electronics companies that finances university research on advanced microelectronic technology. ''Here's this beautiful little chip and you can't get out of it what it's capable of because of the packaging.'' **********The realization of the problem has set off a flurry of responses. The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, another industry research consortium, has picked packaging as one of its four major missions, along with more glamorous topics as advanced computer architectures, software and computer-aided design. **********The package is what many people envision when they think of a computer chip. The chip itself is a flat piece of silicon, no bigger than a fingernail, that is etched with tiny circuits. The package around the chip is black plastic or ceramic with many metal prongs coming out of it. The most common type of package, known as a dual in-line package, resembles a centipede, with the metal prongs arranged in two rows like legs. **********The metal legs attach to the printed circuit board, which contains wires that connect to other chips and other parts of the computer such as the display screens. In turn, the chip is usually connected to the package by wires that attach to the edge of the chip. **********One problem is that as computer chips become more complex, more wires are needed to carry signals in and out of the chip. Some of the most complex chips require a few hundred such wires. It becomes increasingly difficult to place all those wires around the edge of the chip without the signals on the wires interfering with one another. And a package with hundreds of metal legs becomes large and unwieldy. **********Hence, while cramming more functions onto a single chip should lead to smaller computers, that progress is partly nullified because the package around the chip must get bigger and bigger. The package becomes ''a great big overcoat, which is 10 to 20 times as big as the chip,'' said Barry H. Whalen, vice president and manager of the packaging program for the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. **********Moreover, as chips become faster, the speed of the computer begins to be limited by the time it takes the electric signals to travel between chips. Hence, the newer chips must be placed close together to realize the full benefits, which then brings up the problem of removing the heat that can build up and destroy the chips. In addition, engineers want packages that allow for automated manufacturing of computers. **********Several new types of packages have appeared on the market to address these problems, and more are on the way. Instead of two rows of legs in a rectangular package, packages known as chip carriers are square and have leads around all four sides. Another idea is to put the prongs underneath the package, rather than just around the periphery. Such a package, which resembles a bed of nails, is called a pin grid array. **********The National Semiconductor Corporation and others are promoting a new technology called tape automated bonding. This does away with the need for wires connecting the chip to the package and with the metal prongs. Instead, the connections are etched onto a thin sheet of copper foil. The space between the leads is only two-hundredths of an inch apart, five times closer together than legs are spaced on the conventional dual in-line package. **********For really high-speed computers, where the chips must be extremely close together, an option is to do away with the packages around each chip. The chips are connected directly to a surface containing multiple levels of wiring to link the chips together. **********The International Business Machines Corporation is well advanced in such multichip modules. One of the major advances in its mainframe computers is its thermal conduction module, an extremely sophisticated device that packs chips close together while removing the heat. **********Even competitors consider it a masterpiece they need to match. Trilogy Ltd., a company founded by Gene Amdahl that gave up its plans to build a sophisticated computer to compete with I.B.M. mainframes, is trying to make a business out of providing multichip modules to other computer manufacturers. **********The Japanese are also working on packaging and already dominate the market for ceramic packages. The Japanese are ''at least our equals if not our betters,'' said Donald B. Brown, president of D. Brown Associates Inc., a Fort Washington, Pa., consulting firm specializing in packaging. Because of their emphasis on manufacturing technology and miniaturization, he said, the Japanese engineers have tended to stress packaging more than many American companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/03/business/l-stock-trades-065815.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Trades", "print_headline": "Stock Trades", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In your Jan. 27 Business Forum (''Wall Street Speculators''), companion articles by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs and Warren Law of Harvard University present opposing views of the social value of short- term trading.

A.", "body_text": " **********The pre-April 15 advertising blitz designed to attract Individual Retirement Accounts is taking a different turn this year. The lavish promotions and interest-rate wars have given way to a strategy of seeking to broaden the appeal of the tax-favored savings accounts to millions of people who have not had $2,000 to put aside. **********In growing numbers, financial institutions are lowering the minimums required on I.R.A. deposits, and even providing loans for those who lack the cash to set up an I.R.A. by the April 15 deadline. Some institutions have adapted the Christmas Club concept to I.R.A.'s, allowing customers to make a series of small deposits throughout the year. **********''This will be viewed as the year in which the I.R.A. became a mass- market product, along the lines of a McDonalds or a Wendy's,'' said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor. ''The banks and thrifts have made it easy for everyone to get an I.R.A.'' **********All of this is aimed at expanding the I.R.A. market beyond the nearly 40 million Americans who already have I.R.A.'s, and erasing the misconception held by some that the $2,000-a- year-contribution limit is also a minimum that must be deposited. **********Under the law, a worker can deposit any amount up to $2,000 of earnings each year into an I.R.A., and claim a tax deduction for the amount. (A one-income couple can contribute up to $2,250.) Money in the I.R.A. grows tax free until withdrawal. **********An Expanded Menu **********At the same time, banks, brokers and other institutions are promoting an expanded menu of I.R.A. investment options for a public that, after four years of familiarity with the retirement account, has become more sophisticated in its approach and more willing to venture beyond the risk-free bounds of a bank certificate of deposit. **********''Special'' I.R.A. interest rates are still being touted by banks and other savings institutions, where the majority of I.R.A. money traditionally flows. But, on examination, investors will discover the rates are only slightly higher than those offered on regular accounts. **********The mass merchandising campaign to assure that anyone who wants an I.R.A. can easily get one is an effort to enlarge the market, rather than part of the ever-fiercer competition to attract new funds from taxpayers who already have I.R.A. accounts. These customers will find that financial institutions are offering greater convenience in making deposits and a wider choice of investment options - but not the promotional deals of years past. **********As Little as $1 **********A key to the mass merchandising effort, Mr. Heady said, has been a widespread lowering of minimum deposit requirements for I.R.A.'s, to as low as $10 to $100. At some credit unions, as little as $1 is all that is needed to open an I.R.A. **********As usual, the banks and other institutions are extending their hours and opening their doors on weekends. They are saturating radio, television, and newspapers with their advertising, but the emphasis is no longer on offering extraordinary interest rates. **********Indeed, financial institutions have discovered that costly cash bonuses and high interest rates are no longer needed to sell the merits of an I.R.A. to the public, which now appears quite familiar with the virtues of the tax-deferred retirement account. **********''The education is over; today everyone knows what an I.R.A. is,'' said Don Underwood, vice president for retirement plans and services at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. ''They're not just looking for the tax deduction anymore. Now they're looking at an I.R.A. as an investment. People are shopping around more than they did in the past. Now they're looking for a better yield. A lot of people want something better than a bank C.D.'' **********While banks and savings and loans remain the dominant investment arena for I.R.A.'s, the decline in interest rates and the recent improvement in the stock market have helped draw larger numbers of I.R.A. investors into stocks, bonds, mutual funds and real estate limited partnerships. **********''People are getting more aware of the different options,'' said Jane Jamieson, assistant vice president for Fidelity Investments, a Boston- based mutual fund company. ''With rates on bank accounts being much lower than in past years, a lot of people are looking at mutual funds for the first time.'' **********Mr. Underwood of Merrill Lynch said 25 percent of new I.R.A. accounts at the brokerage firm this year were transfers from banks and thrift institutions. That is up from 10 to 15 percent last year. **********To help encourage even larger defections, Merrill Lynch offices nationwide will be opening their doors next Saturday. Fidelity plans to open its offices next Saturday and Sunday. **********Banks Fighting Back **********But banks, whose office hours have traditionally been extended during the I.R.A. season, have not been sitting idling by. In addition to their usual variety of savings accounts, a growing number of banks and savings institutions have also been offering mutual funds, discount brokerage services and zero coupon bonds to I.R.A. customers. And many are this year offering a much wider range of maturities on their certificates of deposit, the staple for I.R.A. accounts. **********Much is at stake. For savings institutions, mutual funds, brokerage houses and insurance companies, the I.R.A. rush is the equivalent of the Christmas season for retailers. **********W. Wesley Howard, editor of the I. R.A. Reporter, a newsletter. predicts that up to $35 billion will flow into I.R.A.'s for the 1984 tax year, which would swell the total of I.R.A. deposits to more than $165 billion by April 15. An estimated $7.6 billion of it is expected during the April rush. **********Never More Eager **********Financial institutions have never been more eager to court I.R.A. depositors. In the last four years, many individuals have accumulated as much as $8,000 in deposits, plus earnings on their deposits. While some have chosen to diversify their annual I.R.A. investments among different institutions, many have been eager to consolidate investments in one place. **********As a result of the competition, Mr. Howard said, some of the aggressive marketing tactics that have not been seen since the initial I.R.A. promotion campaigns in 1982 have reappeared this year in some parts of the country - albeit in a much more restrained form. **********In Nevada, for instance, an interest-rate war has pushed rates on I.R.A. certificates of deposit to as high as 25 percent. But unlike 1982, when depositors could have locked in the high rates for months or even years, the 25 percent rate offered by the Nevada Savings and Loan Association of Las Vegas applies only through April 30. The rate paid on those deposits then drops down to the rate paid on regular C.D.'s, which is now around 10.5 percent, according to Lois Makowski, an assistant vice president at the institution. **********Aside from such short-term promotional incentives, where investors will reap only a few weeks worth of high-yield benefits, Mr. Heady of The Bank Rate Monitor, which surveys rates across the country, said that I.R.A. rates at banks ''tend to be in the same ballpark, give or take a quarter or half percentage point either way.'' And, he said, the I.R.A. rates are the same, or close to the same, as the prevailing rates offered on regular deposits at the banks. **********Taxpayers who temporarily lack the cash to make an I.R.A. deposit by the April 15 deadline to earn a tax deduction may be able to take advantage of a provision in the tax law that allows money to be withdrawn from an existing I.R.A. as long as it is reinvested in another I.R.A. within 60 days. This ''rollover'' provision will effectively give the depositor 60 days to come up with the money. **********Under the strategy, an individual could withdraw up to $2,000 from an existing I.R.A. and use the proceeds to set up by the April 15 deadline a new I.R.A. that will qualify for a deduction on the 1984 tax return. Within 60 days, however, the individual will still have to come up with another $2,000 to complete the initial rollover by setting up another I.R.A. **********Risk of a Snag **********But Peter Elinsky, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Peat Marwick, says the risk is that some snag could develop that would prevent the individual from completing the rollover within 60 days. At that point, the money would be immediately subject to income tax, and an additional 10 percent tax penalty for premature withdrawal if the individual is under age 59 1/2. Furthermore, withdrawing money from an I.R.A., for a rollover or any other purpose, could subject the individual to penalties from the institution involved, such as for early withdrawal of a bank C.D. **********Mr. Elinsky said a safer option would be to take out a short-term loan. Even with the interest charges, he said, individuals will generally still come out ahead because of the tax deduction that can be claimed for the I.R.A. deposit, the tax-deferred earnings on money in the account and the ability to claim an itemized deduction for the interest on the loan. **********Chemical Bank of New York has been offering such loans to fund I.R.A.'s since March 25, and has already attracted ''hundreds of applications,'' according to Kenneth B. Herz, a bank spokesman. I.R.A. loan applications are approved within two days, which is about half the usual time it takes to review a loan application, he said. Rates are 17.25 percent for unsecured loans, and 14.75 percent for secured loans. **********Credit Card I.R.A.'s **********Union Federal Savings and Loan Association in Los Angeles has been promoting the idea among customers of funding I.R.A.'s by requesting a cash advance on their credit cards. **********The short-term loans are generally intended to bridge the gap while individuals wait to receive their tax refund check in the mail. **********Yet another tool being used in I.R.A. marketing campaigns in some parts of the country is so-called I.R.A. completion insurance, which some institutions have been offering as a no-cost bonus to customers. It essentially guarantees that a depositor's I.R.A. savings goals will be reached - even if he or she becomes disabled or dies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/21/business/technology-enhancing-phone-lines.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1985-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 845, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology;   Enhancing Phone Lines", "print_headline": "Technology;   Enhancing Phone Lines", "body_text": " **********SAN FRANCISCO **********TELECOMMUNICATIONS lines are often **********said to be the highways of the computer age, **********moving information about in the way highways transport goods and people. **********But so far, most telephone lines are more like dirt roads. Designed to carry voice conversations in an era when computers did not exist, the telephone lines have become a bottleneck in the flow of data and video images today. The need to transmit data at speeds higher than telephone wires can handle is one reason large corporations are bypassing the local phone companies by building their own transmission facilities. **********Now, however, the phone lines are in for a vast improvement in the amount of information they can carry. Devices are being developed that will attach to each end of the phone line and allow the line to carry two telephone calls at the same time - and reams of data as well. **********The devices should speed the development of home information services. Right now, when people are using home computers to retrieve information from a data base or read electronic classifieds, others in the house cannot make or receive phone calls. With the new devices, they would be able to. Two people talking on a phone line would also be able to show each other diagrams. **********Even for those who do not use computers, the new systems should prove beneficial because two people in the house could make calls at the same time. The only way to do that now is to order two separate lines from the telephone company. **********Numerous companies are at work on such systems. Pacific Bell announced such a system last week. It plans to test it by providing an information service in conjunction with Apple Computer Inc. **********But others seem ahead of Pacific Bell. Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley developed such a device several years ago. Bell Laboratories is close to making semiconductor chips for the system, and is trying to recruit the Intel Corporation an alternate supplier. The GTE Corporation and others are also well advanced. So are chip makers, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the National Semiconductor Corporation. **********The first devices should be out on the market in about a year. **********The new transmission capabilities are part of a bold plan for the world telecommunications system of the future. The future system, known as integrated services digital network, or I.S.D.N., aims to turn the telephone system into a high-speed multimedia channel for voice, data, images, facsimile transmission and video. **********Signals traveling in the twisted pair of copper wires tend to fade and lose definition, just as the waves caused by dropping a pebble in a pond tend to lose their well-defined shape and disappear. **********The new devices that would be put at the end of the line would be capable of performing rapid calculations on the incoming signal, to try to reconstruct what the original signal looked like. In addition, a major boost in transmission speed will come from changing from the current analog transmission to digital transmission. **********To send data over the telephone lines today, digital pulses used by computers are converted into tones using devices known as modems. The most sophisticated modems generally available can transmit 9,600 bits of information a second; the modems generally affordable by personal computer users can do only 300 or 1,200 bits a second, equivalent to 30 or 120 letters a second. **********But I.S.D.N. would transmit data in digital form directly, doing away with modems. Planners say the copper phone lines will be able to carry 144,000 bits per second of data, 15 times as much as can now be done with modems. **********The capacity would be divided into two channels of 64,000 bits a second, and one of 16,000 bits a second. The two larger channels could each be used to transmit high-speed data, or a voice conversation, or even a crude video image, such as in a picture telephone. The 16,000-bit-per-second channel could be used for several streams of data. **********Two basic approaches are vying to be accepted as the standard. One, known as the Ping-Pong approach, involves sending data in rapid bursts in one direction, then reversing the line and sending in the other direction, and so on. **********The other technique involves sending in both directions at the same time. The problem here is that the incoming signal is very weak and tends to be drowned out by the signal being sent. It is like trying to hear a whisper while one is shouting. Moreover, the signal being shouted tends to echo, and the echo is much louder than the signal being received. To solve that problem, a device that can cancel out the echo is needed. It keeps track of the signals being sent out and, through a computer simulation, decides what the echos will look like. It then subtracts that amount from the incoming signal, leaving the original incoming signal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/business/carnation-chief-resigns.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Carnation Chief Resigns", "print_headline": "Carnation Chief Resigns", "body_text": " **********The Carnation Company announced yesterday that H.

Foreign Minister Goshu Wolde said the Red Cross had witnessed what he called the arrest of ''troublemakers.'' **********Western diplomats, believing the Red Cross account, speculated at the time that the famine victims were being moved as part of the resettlement program. **********One relief official interviewed about the latest reported incident said that the authorities might ''simply have wanted to move the drought victims to their native areas.'' **********In both the feeding and resettlement programs, the Government has tried to keep together tribal groups in this ethnically diverse country of 42 million. **********Rains Could Bring Harvest **********At a May Day rally today, Colonel Mengistu said rains now falling in the famine-stricken country could lead to a successful harvest this year, the state-run radio reported. **********''Even though the rainy season has started a bit late, it is assumed that the current amount of rains falling in most regions of our country is satisfactory,'' he said.

Nabi said yesterday. He is research director and executive vice president for investments at Bessemer Trust, which manages $3.8 billion for wealthy individuals and more than 60 pension funds and foundations. **********Last week, shares of the world's largest producer of distilled spirits and wines jumped 3 points, to 44 5/8, after trading Friday as high as a record price of 44 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Seagram basically tracked the action in shares of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Du Pont gained 4 5/8 points last week, finishing at 63 1/8, after selling Friday at 63 5/8 - its record high except for a brief spurt to 67 7/8 in October 1973. Yesterday, Du Pont eased 7/8, to 62 1/4, while Seagram fell 1 5/8, to 43. **********In 1981, Du Pont outbid Seagram in a contest for Conoco, the nation's 10th-largest oil company. As a result, Seagram's $3 billion stake in Conoco was transformed, more by accident than design, into its 22.5 percent ownership in Du Pont. **********Ever since, some outsiders have believed this could mean an eventual divergence of interests between two immensely wealthy families - the Bronfmans who control Seagram but might chafe at their lack of influence at Du Pont and the heirs who own 25 percent of Du Pont's stock. **********This reasoning has fostered recurring rumors on Wall Street that, as one alternative, Du Pont would buy back Seagram's interest, thereby permitting Seagram to diversify in other directions and ending whatever friction might exist between the two family interests. **********So far, although rumors of a possible buyback circulated again last week and helped to send both stocks higher, neither company has indicated it plans any change. **********''The relationship between the two companies is a very constructive one and, as far as I know, there is nothing going on to change it,'' John R. Malloy, Du Pont's vice president for external affairs, said yesterday. **********Mr. Nabi of Bessemer Trust believes that, within the next 12 months, ''either the Bronfmans will buy much more Du Pont stock or negotiate to sell their interest back to Du Pont.'' This alludes to his original thesis that ''some move'' ultimately will occur to enhance the value of Seagram's stock. His view is that, in the event of a buyback, the Bronfmans would want a minimum of $70 a share for their Du Pont stock. **********Robert F. Boyd, senior vice president of the Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company in Baltimore, sees two possible strategies for Seagram -either selling back its stock to Du Pont at a premium or trying to effect changes within Du Pont and thereby becoming a more active stockholder. **********''Since last spring we added between 25,000 and 50,000 shares of Du Pont to our account holdings at an average cost of $55 a share,'' he said. ''At that price, the stock looked cheap to us on a statistical basis.'' **********The possibility remains that Seagram simply will hold on to its Du Pont stake. In the face of health concerns and other factors, Seagram has found the demand for liquor declining. The contribution from its Du Pont investment accounted for 73 percent of Seagram's reported earnings in the fiscal year 1984, according to the Value Line Investment Survey. **********A month ago, when rumors arose again that Du Pont would buy back Seagram's holdings, Theodore S. Semegran, chemical industry analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers, said: ''There is no truth to that rumor, in our view.'' He recommended the sale of Du Pont's stock on its burst of strength at that time. **********William R. Young, who follows chemical companies for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimates that Du Pont will earn $4.95 a share this year, excluding major nonrecurring charges, and $6.75 in 1986. Last year's earnings were $5.93 a share. Mr. Young, who carries a ''hold'' rating on Du Pont, said: ''If I believed Du Pont would acquire the Seagram interest, I would raise my rating.'' **********Some analysts believe a repurchase of the Seagram holdings by Du Pont could be part of a major restructuring at the chemical company. **********As for Seagram's stock, Arthur Kirsch, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has carried a ''buy'' recommendation since August 1981, when the shares traded at 17.

Originally, the concept of convergence meant the ostensible tendency of capitalist and Communist economic systems to resemble each other more and more, with capitalist systems assigning more important roles to government bodies and Communist systems giving greater scope to markets. **********In the language of summitry, this meaning of convergence has been abandoned, as President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and others, with the exception of President Fran cois Mitterrand, seek to reverse the growth of government. **********Instead, convergence has been given a new meaning: the drive to make rates of inflation in the different capitalist countries converge to a common, low rate of inflation. Such convergence is now the holy grail of the monetarists. However, pragmatists and moderates (no one here is willing to confess to being a liberal or a Keynesian) think it remains necessary to pursue not only the goal of low inflation but also the goals of accelerating growth and reducing unemployment. **********Yet the rhetoric of new-style convergence inhibits actions to expand demand as a means of spurring faster growth and lower unemployment. Under the spell of convergence language, the old concept of ''reflation'' has become a dirty and unutterable word, since even pumping up the economy when its tires are flat is taken as risking inflation and stimulating demand instead of strengthening supply. **********Compatibility of policies. This phrase, lovely in its obscurity, seems to imply that, as nations seek convergence, they should follow policies that are harmonious but not necessarily identical. Indeed, the compatibility theory may imply a certain contradiction with the convergence theory. For instance, if the United States economy is slowing, other countries ought to pursue policies for speeding up, so that the industrial world will continue to be prosperous. But this may mean stimulating demand in some countries. **********World public sector borrowing requirement. This is a way of rationalizing compatibility of policy. The concept of a national public sector borrowing requirement, the money a government must borrow to finance its budget deficit, was born in Britain. The mandarins of Whitehall have now produced the world borrowing requirement, implying that if some governments shrink their deficits, there is room for others to increase theirs, to make global monetary expansion compatible with noninflationary economic growth. **********The world borrowing requirement is far-out stuff that has not yet achieved respectability. But it may yet give pragmatic activists a stick with which to beat passive monetarists. **********Target zones. The range within which currencies may be allowed to vary in relation to each other. The creation of such exchange-rate zones appears to be the main goal of the French for changing the world monetary system. Everybody else here is against target zones, arguing that international capital flows are so enormous they would wreck any attempt to keep currencies within the zones. **********But the French point to what they consider the success of the European Monetary System, a fixed-rate system with some flexibility, as evidence that a wider and more stable system can work. The French appear determined not to permit a date to be set, as President Reagan ardently wants, for a new round of trade negotiations. As this conference has evolved, a date in 1986, either ''early'' or ''during,'' has become absolutely crucial to prove that something of value happened at this summit conference. Hence, it seems likely that the United States and others will, before the summit conference ends, make a package deal with the French for both international monetary and trade talks to begin relatively soon. **********Though the odds are that a way will be found to oblige the French, at least rhetorically, the actual rhetoric employed will be vital, and the French will scrutinize it to see whether it implies action, and if so, what kind. **********Surveillance. The United States and the others may seek to simulate international monetary discipline by advocting greater surveillance of national policies for achieving more stable exchange rates. Surveillance means more than just looking at a nation's policies and budget deficits, in the case of poor Latin American and other third world debtors: It means cutting them off from loans, private as well as public, if they do not put their houses in order. **********That surveillance can be made meaningful for great powers, such as the United States, is dubious. No more than the Americans are the French or other summit meeting countries ready to subordinate their domestic fiscal and monetary policies to the discipline of international authority. **********Despite all the difficulties of reaching meaningful agreements on changing the world economy and monetary system, this Bonn summit conference cannot be allowed to fail openly and devastatingly. Even more than in summit meetings of the past, the genius of the communique writers at Bonn will be to achieve a positive tone to the outcome of this conference. Their brilliant, pompous, multi-syllabic and vague rhetoric will serve as an indicator of the limited and uncertain actions that lie ahead."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/29/business/reagan-s-tax-plan-exhortation-white-house-wisdom-people-emphasized-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  WISDOM OF THE PEOPLE EMPHASIZED AS PRESIDENT SETS POPULIST STRATEGY", "print_headline": "REAGAN'S TAX PLAN: EXHORTATION AT THE WHITE HOUSE;   WISDOM OF THE PEOPLE EMPHASIZED AS PRESIDENT SETS POPULIST STRATEGY", "body_text": " **********President Reagan today outlined the strategy he will use to sell his landmark tax simplification plan as he braced his senior aides for a long and difficult battle. **********Mr. Reagan, offering the image of his Presidency at halftime of a critical football game, said that the proposal would pit the wisdom of the American people against the wisdom of the Washington establishment. In the end Mr. Reagan reportedly said, the wisdom of the people would prevail. **********According to aides present at the private meeting, Mr. Reagan elaborated on his populist theme as follows: ''The premise the founding fathers built our government on is that over the long run the uncommon wisdom of the common people is far greater than that found in any gathering of Washington officials or politicians. **********Mr. Reagan presented at the private gathering and later in a national television speech the central themes that will govern the Administration's strategy for selling the proposal in what is expected to be a protracted Congressional battle. **********'Second American Revolution' **********The guiding theme, Administration officials say, is that the proposal represents the ''second American Revolution,'' in the sense that the first was fueled by resentment to unfair taxation. In promoting the tax plan in the days ahead, Mr. Reagan will argue that the current system is unfair because it is overloaded with preferential treatment for those individuals and corporations that should be paying higher taxes. **********In addition, the strategy calls for the President to portray the proposal as pro-family by emphasizing that it will nearly double the personal exemption and will reduce the taxes many currently are paying. Similarly, he will sell it as pro-growth by stressing that it contains incentives for new businesses and lowers the top corporate tax rate, officials say. **********Mr. Reagan will make such pitches in a variety of carefully planned appearances on Thursday and Friday when he travels to Williamsburg, Va., Oshkosh, Wis., and Malvern, Pa. **********Administration officials say the strategy will be aimed at forcing Congress into a ''binary choice'' of having to vote yes or no on simplifying the tax code. That strategy was successful in 1981 when Mr. Reagan went over the head of Congress to win support for his budget and tax reduction plans. **********Mr. Reagan, in the senior staff pep rally, said, ''All the people ever want of their elected or appointed leaders is that we go to them directly, give them the unvarnished facts and rely on them to make the right decisions.'' **********In addition, the President borrowed from his most famous movie - about Knute Rockne, the legendary Notre Dame football coach - as he portrayed his Administration at halftime and poised to begin a critical new round of battle. **********In the 1940 movie, ''Knute Rockne -All-American,'' Mr. Reagan played the role of George Gipp, a football star who died of pneumonia. On his death bed, the player told coach Rockne that if things got tough, that maybe someday he could tell the team ''to go out there and win just one for the Gipper.'' **********'Really Great Reform' **********Mr. Reagan told the aides that they are ''not winning one for the Gipper, but are winning it for the American people.'' He also called the proposal a ''really great reform.'' **********Over the next few days, Mr. Reagan will focus all of his public appearances on the simplification measure as Administration officials also seek support on Capitol Hill and through the airwaves. **********The Administration's strategy for selling the proposal will be to sketch in the public mind the broad themes of the 400-page package, a White House aide said. The aide said the effort would be designed to overcome possible confusion over what Mr. Reagan was proposing and what others have urged in a variety of tax simplification bills that have been floated on Capitol Hill. **********''We first want to sketch out an outline of what the Reagan plan means to the American people, to overcome the confusion,'' the senior official said. **********A Central Theme **********To accomplish that, Administration officials said, Mr. Reagan will devote each of his out-of-town appearances this week to a central theme. In Williamsburg, he will appear at the Virginia House of Burgesses, and assert that the plan reflects the ''second American Revolution.'' **********Later he will go to Oshkosh to suggest that the plan is aimed at middle America and that one of its central features is that it is pro-family and for working men. **********The third theme, that the plan is pro-growth, will be stressed on Friday when Mr. Reagan visits the high-tech community of Malvern, Pa., outside Philadelphia. Administration officials said Mr. Reagan can argue that the plan's features would offer increased economic opportunity and business growth. **********''What we will be trying to do is to say that the plan is for middle America, yuppies and for growth,'' said one senior White House official, who said that he believed that such an image could sell. **********Administration officials have said in recent days that Mr. Reagan hopes to use a populist appeal that has been common to his political arsenal since he first sought the Presidency in 1976 and that played a role in the passage of significant spending cuts and tax reduction measures in his first term. **********Mr. Reagan sounded that chord today when, according to one senior aide, he told his appointees that, ''We believe that the Founding Fathers believed that America's greatness and her economic and social progress comes from the people and not the artful dodgers who too often bring forth stealthifying monsters like our present tax code.'' **********But in going to the American public, the Administration will also be seeking to establish a coalition that can support the proposal and would in effect battle the Washington special interests that Mr. Reagan has said will be fighting the plan, the officials said. **********Briefings Scheduled **********With the release of the plan, Administration officials will begin on Wednesday a number of briefings. At one, there will be leaders from black, Hispanic, religious, veterans' and other groups, while two others will include representatives of trade associations, business groups and Washington lobbying groups. A fourth session will be devoted exclusively to ''pro-family'' type organizations. **********While focusing on these groups this week, the Administration is planning to reach out in an even more direct way to the business community next week with a briefing at the White House on Tuesday for the chief executives of a number of leading corporations. **********The strategy, which has been in the planning stages for several weeks, bears the marked imprint of Patrick J. Buchanan, who one official said has played a major role in the effort at forging the coalition behind the plan. **********But while Mr. Buchanan will be tested, whether the plan will ultimately succeed depends on Mr. Reagan, White House officials said. ''It is no longer Don Regan's plan or Jim Baker's plan; it is the President's plan,'' Mr. Regan said at the rally of senior officials as he introduced the President."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/31/business/the-executive-computer-is-optical-memory-next-from-i-b-m.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Sandberg-Diment", "pub_date": "1985-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1037, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  IS OPTICAL MEMORY NEXT FROM I.

Form this week's instant millionaire, to the latest corporate collpse in the making, to who is merging with whom, a steady stream of speculation, unparalleled since the heyday of Hollywood, emanates from the electronics industry.  Feaders of the trade weeklies Infoworld and PC Week turn first to John C. Dvorak's Inside Track and Spencer F.  Katt's Rumor Central before perusing the ''news'' of the industry. **********Now the Apple's assault on the office market has passed from the speculative stage to the more mundane realm of marketing, and most of the MacOffice components are actually being shipped, the scrutiny of industry watchers is once again focused on the colosus from Armonk, N.Y.  What will be Big Blue's next bombshell?  Or, more likely, what technological small-arms fire will it let off to rattle the industry once more? **********Considering the company's reputation for technological timidity in the personal computer arena - a track record marred only by the infared linded, cordless keyboard of the ill fated PCjr - the speculation surrounding I.B.M.'s supposedly forthcoming PC II is nothing short of staggering.  It centers on an expected improvement in both monochrome and color display resolution. **********The monochrome screen should offer a display boasting 640 by 400 pixels, which are the display dots making up its grainy image.  The color monitor's picture should be upgraded to 640 by 350 pixels.  Neither modification is likely to thrill the rapidly growing band of bifocal keyboarders, particularly those who have seen the crisp images produced by the Macintosh with its unique square pixels. **********the fact that the dimensions of the slimmed down console are rumored to be just small enough so that none of the add-on boards currently available can be shoehorned in does not startle anyone familiar with I.B.M.'s penchant for imcompatibility.  The truly intriguing rumor, however, is that the PC II will have optical disk storage, at least as an option. **********Optical storage is nothing new.  It has been around, at least in soon-to-be-released form, almost since the first Altair personal computer arrived on the scene in 1975.  The problem is that no version of this mass storage medium for the micro has ever reached the consumer.  That the International Business Machines Corporation might be the visionary in the memory race is startling. **********Yet the rumor refuses to die.  The optical disk technology involved is one developed jointly by I.B.M. and Matsushita of Japan, which markets home electronics products under the Panasonic brand in the United States.A four inch disk, slightly smaller than the 4.7-inch laser disk currently being used for compact audio recordings, or CD's , will allow I.B.M., or so the story goes, to set the standard for Optical Read-Only Memory, or OROM for short. **********One of the reasons for I.B.M.'s sudden rush toward the optical disk as a storage medium is supposed to be to pre-empt Sony.  The much heralded Japanese invasion of the personal computer market has never made it to the beachheads, except in peripherals. **********Certainly Epson has become the premier manufacturer of dot matrix printers; even I.B.M. merely sticks its three letters' worth on the company's printers.  Outside of the peripherals market and certain internal components, however, Japan Inc.  has never been able to sell computers.  It has not succeeded in marketing whole computers, that is, and thus it has been unable to reap the image, not to mention the profits, therefrom. **********BUT then enter Sony with its already standard 4.7-inch compact disk, which is ready to go as an OROM device.  Essentially, all that is required is a little hardware modification and plugging it into an expansion slot in either the I.B.M. PC or the PC XT. **********Unfortunately, there is a drawback to using sony's current CD.  The computer can't access both the standard magnetic medium, the floppy or the hard disk, and the CD at the same time.  Nor can information be exchanged between the magnetic and optical media.  This renders the CD in its current state virtually useless to computing. **********This singular state of affairs is not apt to last for long.  Mofifictions are in the works, and it is in the time lag for these refinements that I.B.M. hopes to roll out its own version of the optical disk, setting the standard once more as it did in introducing its first PC. **********With a sotrage capacity of around 300 megabytes, roughly 30 times that of the standard 10 megabyte hard disk, and a retail price of maybe $10 to $30 a platter, the optical disk seems bound to prove irresistible to the computer conscious consumer.  Well, I hate to be the one to throw cold water on all the enthusiasm but I don't think optical memory in its current form is going to work any better for I.B.M. than the PCjr did. **********When rumors first started circulating about the PCjr two years ago, I wrote that it simply wouldn't fly, that there was no market for it.  The same holds true for optical storage disks. **********Sure, one can store an incredibly large amount of information on one of these disks - an encyclopedia or two, for example, or a complete set of legal reference works - but the market for such applications is far more limited than might at first be supposed, particularly since the disk drive needed to utilize the optical ROM's will probably add $500 to $1,000 to the cost of the computer. **********In addition, a key element is lacking in the optical disk storage for the personal computer: the ability to write information to the disks as well as to read from them.  Without this dual read/write capacity, optical disks for its personal computers will take I.B.M. no further than the PCjr took the company - which is to say, not very far at all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/17/business/itt-computer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITT Computer", "print_headline": "ITT Computer", "body_text": " **********The ITT Corporation said it had introduced a high-performance personal computer, the Xtra XP, that features processing speeds 3.5 times faster than those of the International Business Machines Corporation PC- XT.

They lost money on that deal, but Mr. Feigenbaum became enamored with this form of investing and is now a partner in five standardbreds, the trotting and pacing horses used in harness racing. ''You're chasing a dream,'' he said. ''If I pay my bills every year and have some fun, that's good enough.'' **********Doug Warren, a New York marketing consultant, first bought a standardbred in 1973 and has owned 25 of them on and off since then. With one of these horses, Count Kef, he made a profit of more than $300,000 in five years. With a second, Margene Dillion, he lost almost $150,000, also in five years. **********''Owning a horse is like a poker game, because for every winner, someone else has to lose,'' he noted. ''But I'm a city boy, and it gives me an expression I can get no other way.'' **********Mr. Feigenbaum and Mr. Warren are two of the thousands of men and women who own all or part of standardbred horses. And with more than $360 million distributed to the first five finishers at races last year held by the 85 North American tracks, these investors are participating in a risky business with the hope of achieving a ''dream'' -standing in the winner's circle and collecting the big purse money. **********The risks of such investing are usually known to participants. For there is no assurance that any horse will be capable of earning purses, regardless of how skillful the selection and training process. There is always the danger of the horse being unable to run because of injury or illness. And there is certainly no guarantee that a horse can be sold at a profit or earn stud fees after its racing career ends. **********Nevertheless, there are many attractions that lure middle- and upper-income Americans into this field. Since most standardbreds can be purchased in the $30,000-to-$70,000 range, many individuals or groups can afford to buy one of these horses. In contrast, thoroughbreds, the horses used in flat racing, usually are considerably more expensive. **********There are also tax benefits available to those who own horses as a business, not a hobby. Mares and stallions that are 12 years old and under can be depreciated over five years, while older standardbreds can be depreciated over three years. Furthermore, expenses for items such as training, feeding, boarding and equipment - which typically run about $2,000 a month - are deductible. **********For most standardbred buyers, moreover, the intangibles are important. ''For $5,000 or $10,000, you may not be able to buy the Knicks or the Giants, but you can go to the Meadowlands and hear your name announced,'' said Stuart N. Garawitz, who has been acquiring interests in standardbreds for about three and a half years. And since harness racing is frequently a nighttime activity, owners can cheer their horses to the finish line in person after normal working hours. **********However, veteran standardbred investors suggest that certain precautions be taken before becoming financially involved with a horse. For example, a list of experienced trainers from which a choice can be made should be obtained from the local horsemen's association. Visits to harness racing tracks before, during and after races is also advised as a way to become more familiar with the animals and the people around them. **********Novices might also find it advantageous to join with others in group ownership of a standardbred. Some of these groups put an amount equivalent to a year's upkeep in a separate pool at the time the horse is bought, so that there will be adequate operating funds, whether or not any purses are won. **********In addition to direct purchases of standardbreds, investment in breeding or racing these animals is possible through limited partnerships and corporations. Both methods spread the risk of ownership, since the partnerships and corporations generally own a number of horses and are likely to have varying degrees of success with each. **********Limited partnerships often sell units for somewhere between $5,000 and $25,000 apiece. For instance, Lana Lobell Income Partners offered more than $18 million worth of interests last May with a $5,000 minimum subscription, an anticipated annual pretax return of 17.7 percent and the scheduled sale of its assets in 1990. On the corporate side, a recent entry in this business is Major League Standardbreds Inc. The company - which priced units consisting of one common share and one warrant at $1, with a minimum purchase of 500 units -hopes to profit by its horses' ability to generate income by earning purses. **********Whatever expections an investor in harness racing may have, a realistic appraisal would indicate tat the risk is still much greater than the potential reward. The lure of the track, though, is what brings new money to the standardbred business.

Stock trading resumed today amid continuing rumors about the company's financial health. **********Daiwa Bank, which has led a group of banks aiding the company, said Thursday that it has not yet decided whether to continue lending to Sanko. The banks have been providing about $21 million a month in emergency aid that is considered essential to keep the company running. Sanko lost $286 million in the fiscal year that ended in March. **********Sanko's troubles come at a time of worldwide recession in the shipping industry. Japanese companies, still the leaders in the field, have been particularly hurt by the general decline in the crude oil tanker business. They are also facing increasing competition from South Korean shipbuilders. **********At a news conference held Thursday after the Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading in the company's stock, Sanko's president, Yoichi Akishino, denied rumors that the banks were halting loans. He said he had been assured of continued financial support for the company, which also operates a large fleet of ships. **********A Bank's Viewpoint **********But public statements by the banks were not as encouraging. Akio Suzuki, a spokesman for the Daiwa Bank, said, ''The three banks are looking at Sanko's problems very seriously.'' **********The Japanese Government has been studying ways to help Sanko, which has accumulated the equivalent of $700 million in losses. The company has not yet received any direct Government aid, but the Ministry of Transport has been considering ways to scrap surplus tankers. However, the Ministry has reportedly decided against using Government money to buy the excess tankers. This decision, coupled with dissatisfaction about the progress of Sanko's own restructuring, appears to have prompted the banks to reconsider loans to Sanko. **********In April 1984, Sanko announced an ambitious restructuring plan, which called for retiring debt and canceling charter contracts. But it has asked for further financial help since then. **********Company's Ties to Politician **********Sanko's situation is delicate because the company has strong ties to Toshio Komoto, the State Minister for External Economic Affairs and a powerful politician. Mr. Komoto, who founded the company in 1937 and was its president until 1974, is its largest individual stockholder. He declined to comment Thursday on what actions the Government might take if Sanko were to face bankruptcy. Sanko has 1,674 employees, a relatively small number because the company subcontracts much of its work. **********Sanko has long been known as a loner in the highly competitive Japanese shipping business. In the 1960's the Ministry of Transport reorganized the industry into six major lines, offering subsidies and low-interest loans to finance the building of ships. But Sanko refused to participate. Sanko is not alone in suffering financial problems. In the last fiscal year only two of the six major shipping lines paid dividends and only three made profits. A recent report on shipping issued by the Transport Ministry predicted that the worldwide slump would continue but noted that Japan's major shipping companies increased their sales last year for the first time in three years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/14/world/soviet-drive-new-urgency.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1985-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 887, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET DRIVE: NEW URGENCY", "print_headline": "SOVIET DRIVE: NEW URGENCY", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a major speech on the economy this week, offered the most detailed insight to date on what he had in mind for the future. And he gave notice that he meant business. **********It was an economic program that struck Western diplomats more by its pace and urgency than by its content. The Soviet leader has made amply clear since coming to power three months ago that kicking the economy into high gear was his overriding priority, and he has talked before of the need for a radical ''intensification'' of industrial development. **********In the speech Tuesday, Mr. Gorbachev filled in many of the previous blanks in his economic blueprint. Capital investments, he said, would no longer be thrown at flashy new projects or scattered about like ''earrings for all sisters.'' Money would be channeled instead into modernizing old plants, into enterprises that produce and into machine-building, he said. **********The speech made it clear that Mr. Gorbachev had no intention of dismantling central planning. But he spoke of giving individual enterprises considerably more control over their profits and methods, and he proposed changing central planning agencies and ministries into something resembling the so-called think tanks of the West. **********Impatience on Foot-Dragging **********In setting out his goals, Mr. Gorbachev also signaled his impatience with any foot-dragging. In an unusual gesture, he demanded more work on a draft of guidelines for the next five-year plan, and he blasted four Government officials by name, giving in a signal that must have sent chills through all senior managers. **********Mr. Gorbachev said the Politburo had expressed ''serious criticism'' of the document, which was to give shape to the 1986-1990 planning period and through the end of the century. He did not specify what was wrong with the draft, but he made it clear that it failed to catch the spirit of the changes he was trying to inculcate, that its goals were too modest. **********The guidelines, Mr. Gorbachev declared, ''must contain new approaches to insure a sharp turn towards the intensification of the economy.'' The phrase is one Mr. Gorbachev has used repeatedly in referring to his major goal, which he calls intensification, a reference to raising productivity through greater efficiency, new technology, labor improvements and innovation, rather than through ever higher investments. **********To dramatize the point, he singled out two Government officials by name for repeatedly demanding more capital while trying to reduce their production goals. One was Konstantin N. Belyak, Minister of Machine Building for Livestock and Feed Production for the past 11 years, and the other was Aleksei I. Yashin, Minister of Construction Materials for six years. **********'Vast, Unjustified Spending' **********''I hope we are not traveling companions of those executives who hope to draw the country into vast, unjustified spending,'' Mr. Gorbachev warned. **********Elsewhere in the speech two other officials were singled out for reprimands. Ivan P. Kazanets, Minister of Ferrous Metallurgy, was chastised for channeling more than 50 billion rubles of capital investment into new construction while paying no attention to new technology. **********Viktor S. Fyodorov, the Minister of Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Industry, was accused of having a ''careless attitude'' about imported equipment. Mr. Gorbachev noted ominously that the Central Committee had ordered an inquiry into the matter. **********Western diplomats thought it was inevitable that the four officials would soon lose their jobs. **********Western analysts' initial assessment was that the speech Tuesday reflected an evolution of the new leader's plans - albeit a faster one than many expected - rather than the finished action program. ''What is striking in the speech is the tone, the urgency and specificity,'' one diplomat said. **********The main thrust of Mr. Gorbachev's program has been to sharply increase growth rates to sustain a high level of military spending while keeping social programs intact. Food supplies, consumer goods and services had to be improved, he said, while ''imperialism's aggressive policy'' imposed large military investments. **********New Spending Goals **********The strategy outlined by the Soviet leader was to restructure the investment policy. He proposed to increase the amount of money spent on modernizing plants from a third to at least a half of total investments. If necessary, he said, some current projects would be suspended or even abandoned. **********The proposal seemed directed at the practice long favored by Soviet leaders of launching large, dramatic projects with loud propaganda hoopla, while letting old plants grow obsolete. The key to the next stage of development, Mr. Gorbachev said, was new technology and better machinery. **********Mr. Gorbachev also lambasted the chronic waste in the Soviet economy. The country produced more steel than any other but was always short of metal, he said. Millions of tons of oil were being wasted on old-fashioned trucks and faulty boilers. **********One of the main questions for many Western diplomats was Mr. Gorbachev's plans for the central planning structure. He called for expanding individual enterprises' control over their money and perquisites, including some say over levels of pay, incentives and bonuses. He also talked of expanding the state planning committee into a source of broad directives and ideas. **********The ideas, however, remained somewhat vague, and Western diplomats found nothing to suggest any extensive moves toward decentralization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/15/business/insurers-face-big-losses-in-rash-of-jet-crashes.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1985-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 787, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insurers Face Big Losses in Rash of Jet Crashes", "print_headline": "Insurers Face Big Losses in Rash of Jet Crashes", "body_text": " **********The crash of a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 jumbo jet on Monday - following two other airline disasters in the last two months - will result in severe 1985 underwriting losses for the international aviation insurance industry, according to American aviation insurance experts who estimate that such losses may have already exceeded $150 million. **********''We're looking at a new record in terms of losses,'' said John Brennan, president of United States Aviation Underwriters, a consortium of American insurance companies. ''You can easily do a little arithmetic and see that we're losing money.'' **********The losses, industry experts say, will probably lead to higher insurance premiums for airlines. **********'Hull' Loss of $35 Million **********Coverage on the value of the Japan Air Lines aircraft and equipment -referred to as ''hull'' insurance -was $35 million, while liability claims by survivors and estates of the more than 500 people killed are likely to add at least $150 million to insurance company payouts. **********These sums are on top of the payment of about $150 million that the insurance industry expects to make for the Aug. 2 crash of a Delta Air Lines Lockheed L-1011 in Dallas, and the $135 million or so expected to be paid for the Air-India Boeing 747 crash off the Irish coast on June 23. Both sums are for hull and liability payouts. The Delta crash killed 133 passengers and crew; all 329 people on board the Air-India plane perished. **********So far this year there have been eight major civil aviation crashes, and insurance coverage on the value of the aircraft and equipment alone has amounted to $456 million. Those losses - over less than eight months of 1985 - already exceed the record set in 1983, when the amount paid out for hull coverage totaled $447 million. **********Liability losses for 1985, which have not yet been determined, will add at least $300 million, and possibly much more, according to insurance experts. In contrast, worldwide premiums paid by all airlines for hull and liability coverage were about $600 million. **********'The Pressure on Rates' **********''This obviously keeps the pressure on rates,'' said Peter O'Grady, president of the Aviation Office of America, another insurance consortium. ''One would anticipate that it would continue to push rate levels up, especially on the liability side, but we're going to wait and see.'' **********Another aviation insurance specialist, who asked not to be named, added: ''There had been a very sharp increase in premiums last year, followed by a leveling off this year. Now we would expect some upward adjustments, but not drastically.'' **********The crash in Japan was covered by insurance written primarily by the Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Company and other insurers in the Japan Aviation Pool. About three-quarters of this insurance was then resold to reinsurers in other countries. More than half of the reinsurance was handled by Lloyd's of London. The rest went to reinsurers in other countries, including the United States, where there are three aviation insurance consortiums consisting of many major property and casualty insurers. **********George Tompkins, a partner of the New York law firm of Condon & Forsyth, which represents Japan Air Lines in the United States, would not say how much the carrier had in total insurance coverage, or what its premiums were. He said only that ''Japan Air Lines is adequately insured.'' Insurance rates are generally based on the kind of aircraft involved and the safety record of the airline. **********Treaties Limit Payments **********Aviation insurance experts note that the amount that may be recovered from an airline after a crash is often limited by various international agreements. The limits are based on the origin and destination of each passenger. **********However, there is believed to be no limit on liability for passengers traveling on internal flights in Japan. Almost all those who died on the short-haul Japan Air flight were Japanese. **********Passengers whose flight itineraries included a stop in most other countries before or after the Japanese flight are limited to liability coverage of $10,000 or $20,000, depending on whether those countries signed one of the international agreements providing these limits. **********If a ticket was purchased in the United States, or an American destination is listed on a ticket, the individual's coverage is limited to $75,000 under the Montreal Agreement among international airlines. **********''In this crash, as in prior crashes, we will see situations where families of passengers who were seated side by side in the airplane will recover varying amounts, depending on how their airplane tickets happen to have been written,'' said Carl Oppedahl, a lawyer who specializes in aviation accident law."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/19/world/us-soviet-session-on-72-naval-accord-canceled.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Gelb", "pub_date": "1985-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 936, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET SESSION ON '72 NAVAL ACCORD CANCELED", "print_headline": "U.S.-SOVIET SESSION ON '72 NAVAL ACCORD CANCELED", "body_text": " **********For the first time in the 14-year life of a Soviet-American agreement on preventing dangerous incidents at sea, naval officers from the two nations have failed to hold their annual meeting. **********Reagan Administration officials said Moscow canceled the meeting after the Pentagon changed the terms for the session. The officials said the move could jeopardize what they see as one of the most successful military-related pacts between the two nations. **********Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, who as Secretary of the Navy was one of the negotiators of the 1972 accord, said today that ''It is imperative we proceed,'' with the meetings. ''We should not link the operation of the agreement to problems elsewhere in the world,'' he said. **********June Date for Meetings **********The meetings were scheduled for earlier this month when, officials said, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger decided the trip by Soviet naval officers to the United States should be shortened and shorn of all the usual social engagements in retaliation for the killing of an American officer by a Soviet soldier in East Germany in March. **********Pentagon and State Department officials said Mr. Weinberger made the decision against strong opposition from the Navy and the State Department and without regular high-level deliberations at the White House. **********These officials said Mr. Weinberger ordered the Navy to inform its Soviet counterparts of the new schedule without discussing the matter with Secretary of State George P. Shultz or with Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser. **********Response by Soviets **********On June 7, two days before the talks were to begin, Soviet diplomats told the State Department that their team would not be coming. The Soviet note charged the Administration with changing the schedule unilaterally and introducing ''extraneous factors.'' **********Mr. Weinberger, in a statement issued today by his office, said the two sides had at first agreed to hold the regular annual meeting this month in Washington, ''so as to continue the professional discussion that both sides agree are important to our mutual interests.'' **********But, referring to Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., a member of the American military mission in East Germany who was shot by a Soviet sentry on March 24, Mr. Weinberger said, ''In view of the murder of Major Nicholson by a Soviet soldier and the failure to apologize or even compensate the family for this tragedy, we did not think this was an appropriate time to include a larger social program. **********''The Soviet side informed us on June 7 that they had decided not to come for the talks at this time,'' the Weinberger statement said, ''apparently not wishing to have the substantive talks without a large social program.'' **********Other Meetings Still Possible **********He added that ''both sides agree to seek a mutually convenient date in the future when the talks can be held under appropriate circumstances.'' **********Despite the chance that the meetings will resume, other officials said they were concerned that the American move would be seen by the Russians as breaking precedent. That could open the way for Moscow to do the same and risk undermining a process that has worked well for both sides, these officials said. **********In 1972, Moscow and Washington signed an Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas. The purpose was to reduce the number of dangerous confrontations that stemmed from the regular contact between the two navies by setting up rules of the seas and regular meetings to work out details. **********Praise for Accord **********Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman has said the agreement ''worked very successfully'' in reducing serious incidents to only one or two a year ''way down from what it was in the 1960's and early 1970's.'' **********In a 1983 statement he also termed the pact ''a good example of functional, navy-to-navy process,'' that ''is helping to really stabilize the naval balance.'' He added that it is one area of Soviet-American relations ''that's getting better rather than worse.'' **********Administration officials said the Soviet delegation was going to visit the United States from June 9 to 17, with the formal talks scheduled for June 11 to 13. Officials said about week before the meetings were to begin, Mr. Weinberger and Fred C. Ikle, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, told the Navy to cut the schedule and tell Moscow of the new plan, but not to explain the change. **********''They would know it was because of Nicholson without our telling them,'' a high Pentagon official said today. **********Officers Raise Arguments **********Other officials said that Naval officers and American diplomats argued that Moscow would consider the unilateral changes as an American act of linking the naval talks to other events. They said such a breach of precedent would let Moscow do the same and might undermine a process that had worked well for both sides. **********They were also said to have noted that past meetings took place despite strained Soviet-American relations, such as last year's session in Moscow after the Soviet shooting down of a Korean airliner. They also noted that the pact was signed when the United States was mining Haiphong harbor against Soviet shipping to North Vietnam in 1972. **********State Department officials were also said to be worried about any move that might link arms control negotiations to other policy matters. Ever since a speech by Mr. Shultz last summer, the department has been trying to insulate talks on the military and on arms control from continuing conflicts with Moscow on other subjects."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/21/world/zia-hopes-to-ease-friction-with-india.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1985-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZIA HOPES TO EASE FRICTION WITH INDIA", "print_headline": "ZIA HOPES TO EASE FRICTION WITH INDIA", "body_text": " **********President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan said today that he hoped his meeting with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India on Wednesday would ''pave the way for a better, friction-free relationship'' between the two countries. **********''We thought we could meet here to explore the possibilities of how to get over the snail's pace of normalization of relations,'' he said in an interview. **********The two leaders, who are attending the 40th anniversary commemoration of the United Nations, have met twice before, at the funerals of Indira Gandhi, the slain Prime Minister of India, and of Konstantin U. Chernenko, the Soviet leader. **********On a separate matter, General Zia reiterated his pledge to sign the treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons and to open his country's nuclear plants to international safeguards and inspection if India agreed to do the same. He said a regional policy was necessary to deal with the nuclear abilities of the two countries. **********Asks Evenhanded Policy **********''Let's have an evenhanded policy from international agencies and also from countries like the United States to deal with India and Pakistan on the same plane,'' he said. ''Pakistan's offer is that if India agrees to sign a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, we will be signing one minute before.'' **********General Zia said he expected to discuss regional cooperation with Mr. Gandhi this week. **********Last month the United States sent a mission led by Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Donald R. Fortier, a member of the National Security Council, to help smooth relations between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since their independence in 1947. The mission, which urged the two nations to undertake ''regional initiatives'' to avert a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent, was praised in Pakistan and criticized in India. **********''Let's have mutual inspection of both nuclear installations, and if that is not acceptable, let's have a bilateral nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and if that is not acceptable, an international agreement,'' General Zia said. **********''What's good for the goose is good for the gander,'' he said. ''Why should Pakistan alone be put on the spot?'' **********Nuclear Issue Stressed **********The Pakistani military leader called the nuclear issue a ''major point of contention'' between the two nations, charging that in the last six months India had ''stepped up its propaganda that Pakistan is indulging in nuclear technology for military purposes.'' **********India maintains it has no program to produce bombs, and it charges that Pakistan is determined to have one. General Zia reiterated denials that his country is developing a nuclear bomb, saying, ''Pakistan has neither the resources nor the means nor the desire.'' **********He added, however, that his country had no intention of changing its policy on developing its nuclear ability. He characterized Pakistan's program to produce enriched uranium at the Kahuta plant as ''a very modest research program,'' necessary to help make the country self-sufficient in meeting future energy requirments. **********He dismissed as ''all fabrication'' Western intelligence reports that Pakistan has built a small reprocessing plant in Islamabad able to produce plutonium. He denied recent reports from India that Pakistan was on the verge of conducting a nuclear test with Chinese cooperation on its border with China, saying Pakistan's nuclear program is ''totally indigenous.'' **********Sikh Issue Expected **********Another subject that he expects to come up at his meeting with Mr. Gandhi is India's charge that Pakistan has aids Sikh terrorists at training camps in Pakistan, which he denied. **********''I'd not only like somebody to prove that Pakistan is training the Sikhs, but why should we,'' he said. At another point he said, ''You just don't soil your hands unnecessarily unless you can achieve.'' **********He said, however, that ''the odd statements of somebody saying he went across and he received training'' and ''the odd statements'' that result when prisoners are ''questioned under stress and strains and pressure'' are not ''proof of Pakistan's involvement.'' **********He acknowledged that the border between the two countries is ''open and easily accessible by smugglers or anyone wishing to get across.'' He added that ''we don't rule out'' that ''some Sikhs may have got across to Pakistan and some Pakistanis might get across to India.'' **********Indian officials have asked the United States to press Pakistan to stop what they say is an attempt to destabilize India. But General Zia said, ''It is not possible for Pakistan to seal off the borders.'' **********Discusses Opposition Figure **********Regarding Pakistan's internal policy, he characterized the opposition figure Benazir Bhutto as a ''young, emotional, misguided girl,'' whom the Government placed under house arrest in August for 90 days to prevent her from breaking the law. **********Acknowledging that ''political activity in Pakistan is restricted to suit our own political process,'' General Zia said, ''We like pre-emption rather than conviction afterwards.'' **********Miss Bhutto, 31 years old, is the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was ousted as Prime Minister in the 1977 military coup that brought General Zia to power. Mr. Bhutto was convicted of conspiring to kill a political opponent and was executed in 1979. **********Miss Bhutto, who has been proclaimed by her supporters as her father's heir as leader of the Pakistan People's Party, was placed under house arrest several days after her return to Pakistan for the funeral of her brother, Shahnawaz, when she made statements demanding that martial law be lifted. **********Said to Refuse Order **********The general said she was clearly told not to visit the families of political prisoners who had been executed, who he said ''were condemned and convicted by a court of law for acts of terrorism.'' But he said she refused the order and was placed under house arrest before she could make such visits. ''The only option left to us was to stop her,'' he said. **********General Zia said Miss Bhutto's house arrest would be extended past 90 days if she ''still gives an indication she is not prepared to abide by the law.'' Even without martial law, he added, she could be held under house arrest. **********He reiterated promises to lift martial law at the end of the year. **********''When martial law is lifted, the constitution is totally revived,'' he said. ''You'll have a free, independent, democratic government.'' **********Calls Himself Elected Leader **********He referred to himself as Pakistan's elected President, adding that Pakistan now has an elected Prime Minister, National Assembly and Senate from parliamentary elections in February. Before the elections, hundreds of political figures were arrested and a ban enforced on political parties, processions, rallies and loudspeakers. **********He described martial law as only ''an umbrella'' and a ''nominal'' concept. **********''What we are trying is a nonpartisan Government where political parties do not participate,''' he said. He added that would be up to Parliament to decide whether to lift the ban on political parties. **********The lifting of martial law is not expected to have much effect. President Zia is demanding that the new Assembly pass constitutional amendments to allow a military council to overrule any actions of the civilian government.

Making sharp gains yesterday in active European trading, it resumed the spurt of the past two weeks in which it repeatedly broke its own records. **********The dollar closed at 3.29 West German marks yesterday, up 4 pfennigs, while rising almost 1 pence against the British pound, which ended at $1.093. Currency markets in the United States were closed because of the Presidents' Day holiday. **********The two-week rise of the dollar - one of the sharpest in the dozen years in which foreign-exchange rates have been allowed to float - has defied Government intervention and, some people say, logic as well. By traditional standards, such as what it will buy in various countries, the dollar is overvalued and should sink, not rise. **********A Logic of Its Own, Some Say **********But some experts say the dollar's puzzling strength has a logic of its own, by which the currency is not overvalued but could remain at roughly its present level for years. Although this undoubtedly is a minority view among economists, it appears to be gaining ground. After repeatedly, and incorrectly, predicting that a plunge in the dollar was imminent, some economists may have wearied of being wrong. **********Many say that psychology, expectations and traders' speculation are underpinning the dollar now. This emerging view emphasizes that most dollars are purchased to invest or speculate with, not to buy goods. **********''It's so strong primarily because of the strength it already has,'' said Robert K. Ryan, manager of foreign exchange for the Irving Trust Company. ''People buy more dollars because they figure it's going to go higher. It feeds on itself.'' **********A 'Bigger Fool' Psychology **********This attitude may be the monetary equivalent of the stock market's ''bigger fool'' theory: An investor may feel that a stock is overpriced but will buy it anyway if some bigger fool will pay even more for it later. In the stock market, that notion tends to catch on just as a bull market is about to crash, but in currency trading no one has gone broke recently by betting on the dollar. **********And foreign complaints about the strong dollar are not universal. It has caused little handwringing in Japan, for instance, where the economy is flourishing despite the weakness of the yen. (Page D5.) **********Expectations about the American economy are also driving up the dollar. But these are confusing, if not contradictory. According to some experts, if the Federal budget deficit is reduced, the dollar will go up. According to others, the dollar will rise if the deficit is not reduced. **********Reasoning on Deficit Action **********If nothing is done about the deficit, according to one school of thought, interest rates can be expected to rise, making the United States a more attractive place to invest money. So investors would buy dollars, pushing its value higher. But if the deficit is slashed, foreigners may consider the American economy to be on a sounder footing, with better prospects for economic growth, and thus a safer haven for investment. So they would buy dollars and push its value up. **********Interest rates are generally seen as important in attracting foreigners' funds to this country, lifting the dollar rate. One element of this month's surge apparently was modest increases in American interest rates, with the expectation that rates would continue to rise. **********But high or rising interest rates alone are not enough to attract money from abroad. Interest rates have also risen in the past few weeks in Britain, West Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, but that has not stemmed the rise of the dollar. **********Traders' Short-Term View **********And last year the dollar showed a burst of strength just as United States interest rates were sagging. **********Another element is the typical currency trader's preoccupation with the short term. **********''If he's 99 percent certain that six months from now the dollar will be down but he's got a hunch that it's going to be up in the day, he's going to act on that hunch,'' said Gary L. Smeal, an international economist for the Chemical Bank. ''That's where they make their money. With all of them acting that way, you get the dollar out of whack.'' **********But in such an environment - where the dollar is valued not for the goods it will buy but for the gain it will realize - the concept of the dollar's being ''out of whack'' appears to lose most of its meaning. **********More and more, investment flows and speculation for short-term gains are determining exchange rates. Global trade in goods has increased steadily since World War II, to a level of about $2 trillion a year. But financial flows have increased far more rapidly, to a level of about $20 trillion or $30 trillion annually. **********Financial, Not Trade, Flows **********Because the dollar appears to be riding financial flows, rather than trade flows, its strength may not be temporary. More and more economists say the dollar could remain high for several years. **********''If you accept the reasoning that the dollar's strength is relative to the strength of the American economy, then I would say that barring any policy blunders the dollar should remain strong for a long period of time,'' said Mieczyslaw Karczmar, chief economist of the European American Bank in New York. **********Because the dollar is propped up by financial flows that can be volatile, many economists worry that the exchange rate could abruptly plunge. That would disrupt trade and unleash inflation by making imports more expensive. A 10 percent decline in the dollar's value, according to Citibank, would add 1.5 percentage points to this nation's inflation rate. **********''I believe it's very likely that the dollar will go down faster than it came up,'' said Mr. Smeal of the Chemical Bank. ''When the turning point comes, it'll be very quick - you're talking a 30 or 40 percent decline, within months.'' **********Money That Stays at Home **********But many other experts say this fear is overstated. They note that much of the strength of the dollar comes not from ''hot'' foreign money entering the United States but from American money no longer leaving it. Therefore, the financial flows may not be as volatile as is often thought. **********Moreover, many say that much of the investment in the United States is not in short-term securities and bank deposits but in long-term investments, such as real estate and time deposits. And the underlying economic conditions that make these attractive investments are unlikely to change very rapidly. **********''The dollar isn't going to collapse,'' said William A. Niskanen Jr., a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. ''It's not held up there by anything artificial. It's a function of very real conditions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/advertising-morgan-knitting-mills-counting-on-cold-snap.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Morgan Knitting Mills Counting on Cold Snap", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   Morgan Knitting Mills Counting on Cold Snap", "body_text": " **********The J.E.

Voting in June is considered likely. **********The Government spokesman said that on Thursday Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou would ask the new President, Christos Sartzetakis, to dissolve Parliament as soon as it approves Government proposals for constitutional amendments reducing the President's powers. **********The procedure requires two ballots on the amendments separated by 30 days and a second 30-day period between dissolution and elections. **********Before the announcement, a Government official and future candidate who is in contact with Mr. Papandreou said that elections in early June were probable. Traditionally, election campaigns do not take place in the heat of the Greek summer. **********Turkey is Top Issue **********In successive news conferences on Tuesday and today, Mr. Papandreou and the opposition leader, Constantine Mitsotakis, appeared to make relations with Turkey the main foreign-policy issue. **********Both conferences, which were seen as inaugurating the campaign even before it was announced, were televised in their entirety after the main evening news on the Government channel. The Government has been sensitive to opposition criticism in this election year of its dominance over the official news outlets. There are no private broadcasters. **********Elections were due no later than October when the four-year term of the Parliament, in which Mr. Papandreou's Socialist Party holds a majority, expires. **********Since Mr. Papandreou's rejection last month of the re-election of former President Constantine Caramanlis and the victory on Friday of his own candidate, Mr. Sartzetakis, Government supporters have been urging early voting to seize the supposed advantage of opposition disarray. The 78-year-old former President is the founder of the New Democracy Party, now headed by Mr. Mitsotakis, and the grand old man of Greek conservatives. **********A 'Paradoxical' Situation **********Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, the Prime Minister said Greece was in the ''paradoxical'' situation of being threatened by Turkey, an ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while perceiving no danger from its Communist neighbors, against which it is allied. **********''Let me stress that we are not threatened from the north,'' he said. ''We have excellent relations with Yugoslavia and Albania, and also with Bulgaria. The chief danger comes from the east, from an ally, Turkey. **********''It is paradoxical and perhaps unique in the history of mankind that one should be threatened by one's ally, but this is the case.'' **********Mr. Mitsotakis differed with Mr. Papandreou today in offering to open discussions with Turkey immediately after the voting, if he wins. When an independent state was declared in Turkish-occupied Cyprus in 1983. Mr. Papandreou broke off low-level talks that had been held occasionally. He has made withdrawal of the occupying army and Turkish acceptance of the Greek position on rights in the Aegean Sea prerequisites for their resumption. **********Turkish Demands Spurned **********Speaking of an invitation to a meeting by Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey, Mr. Papandreou said: **********''The leadership of Turkey must decide to put an end to its demands for vital space - remember Lebensraum? It goes back to the period of Hitler. If Turkey stops trying to acquire Lebensraum in the Aegean to the detriment of our continental shelf and our airspace, the problem will be dispelled.'' **********Mr. Mitsotakis said it was wrong for Greece to refuse to engage in a discussions as long as Turkey respected existing treaties and Greece's territorial integrity. ''The best way to help Cyprus is to promote such a dialogue,'' the opposition leader and former Foreign Minister said. **********Although the Prime Minister asserted that Communist countries posed no threat, he said in a subsequent reply that such a danger could arise in the space of 24 hours. He said this in explaining why he had publicly demanded the removal of American nuclear arms stored in Greece while submitting no formal request to the United States to do so. **********'Specific Policy,' He Says **********''Is this again show or concrete, specific policy?'' he asked, apparently alluding to his reputation for not always following strong words with action. ''The second is true.'' **********The Prime Minister suggested that he might use an offer to remove the American arms to promote his attempt to negotiate a Balkan nuclear-free zone. He said he did not know whether the Soviet Union had stationed nuclear weapons in Bulgaria or Rumania but asserted it could do so within 24 hours. **********American nuclear arms are stockpiled here under a secret agreement concluded in 1959, when Mr. Caramanlis was Prime Minister.

Res 106, the text of which is required by a law enacted last October. That text purports to release appropriated funds and free the Executive Branch from restrictions against the support of military or paramilitary action in Nicaragua. However, my intentions are founded on a different approach. **********First, I will provide assistance to the democratic resistance only for food, medicine, clothing, and other assistance for their survival and well-being - and not for arms, ammunition, and weapons of war. Second, I will not use more than the $14 million already appropriated during the current fiscal year for such assistance. No other U.S. Government funds would be spent for such material assistance to the armed democratic resistance. I will personally establish thorough procedures for the detailed management and accountability of the program in order to assure that these limitations on both the nature and amount of U.S. assistance are scrupulously observed. Two-Way Talks I intend to resume bilateral talks with the Government of Nicaragua and will instruct our representatives in those talks to press for a cease-fire as well as a church-mediated dialogue between the contending Nicaraguan factions. **********I must emphasize, however, that such bilateral talks must be in support of the Contadora process and the internal dialogue and cannot become a substitute for these efforts to achieve a comprehensive, verifiable agreement among all the nations of Central America. **********Also, as I said on April 4, peace negotiations must not become a cover for deception and delay. If the Sandinista Government shows bad faith by seeking to gain unilateral advantage, for example through a further arms buildup during a cease-fire or intransigence in negotiations, I would feel obligated to respond accordingly in our diplomatic efforts and would not expect the democratic resistance to continue to observe a cease-fire which was unfairly working to their disadvantage. **********While economic sanctions are unlikely by themselves to create sufficient pressure to change Nicaragua's behavior, the Sandinistas should not benefit from their present access to the U.S. market while continuing their intransigence on issues affecting our national security.istration will favorably consider economic sanctions against the Government of Nicaragua and will undertake multilateral consultations with other Central American states in this regard. **********Letter to Michel Today the House will vote on competing proposals on how to proceed with our policy in Central America. The choice to be made is a fundamental one that will have a lasting effect on the prospects for democracy, economic opportunity, and peace in this vital region. **********The proposal to be offered by Mr. Barnes and Mr. Hamilton would divert funds from existing economic assistance and refugee accounts for humanitarian assistance to refugees outside Nicaragua and for the expenses of implementing an eventual Contadora agreement. Members of Congress should be under no illusion about this proposal. Its adoption would damage our national security and foreign policy interests. **********The other proposal before the House, to be offered by Mr. Michel, would appropriate $14 million in new funds to enable the Agency for International Development to provide humanitarian aid for the Nicaraguan democratic opposition. This alternative meets most of the objectives in my effort to promote a dialogue within Nicaragua which regional leaders have recognized is essential for peace in Central America. **********If Congress approves $14 million for assistance during the current fiscal year, no other U.S. Government funds would be spent for such material assistance to the armed democratic resistance. **********I recognize the importance some members have attached to bilateral talks with the Government of Nicaragua. I am instructing my representatives to meet with representatives of the Government of Nicaragua. In their talks, the U.S. representative will press for a cease-fire as well as a church-mediated dialogue between the Sandinistas and the united democratic opposition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/02/business/patents-voltage-limiters.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-11-02", "snippet": "The Electric Power Research Institute Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif., received a patent this week for a method of making voltage limiters, especially for use in gapless lightning arresters.

The company had agreed in December to be acquired by the G. Heileman Brewing Company for about $69 million, but that bid was blocked by an antitrust lawsuit filed by two other brewers, and Heileman dropped its offer. Pabst then said it would support Mr. Kalmanovitz's offer because it was ''the only one on the table.'' **********The offer expired Monday, and Russell Houseman of the Kissel- Blake Organization Inc., information agents for the bid, said S&P now holds about 86.5 percent of Pabst's 6.3 million shares outstanding. **********Mr. Smith was brought to Pabst from the presidency of the Pittsburgh Brewing Company in 1981 to revive its flagging sales and earnings.

Industries that have already won protection, such as textiles and steel, want more. **********Many have become interested in proposals before the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to levy up to a 20 percent tax on all imports, a so-called import surcharge. The tax would raise prices of imports, thus chilling demand for them. **********Opponents and proponents are lining up for big battles expected later this spring and summer. Foreign governments are monitoring the debate. **********''We run a very big risk that something sudden, dramatic and unstoppable will take place this summer in Congress and that an import surcharge will be the result,'' Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, warned at a meeting of the Institute for International Economics. **********The Background **********Protectionism is a response to the trade deficit, which has been growing since the early 1980's. Last year the excess of imports over exports jumped 78 percent, to $123.4 billion. **********The deficit has been financed by foreign savings, attracted to this country by high interest rates, the relative safety of the United States as a haven for investments and a reasonable chance of making money. **********The huge flows from abroad combined with reduced foreign investment by Americans have suddenly shifted the United States in global accounts from a position as net creditor to one as net debtor for the first time in seven decades. **********The surge of imports has corresponded with the surge in the international buying power of the dollar, up 40 to 70 percent since 1980, depending on what measuring stick is used. **********Effect of Dollar's Strength **********A rising dollar pulls in foreign shoes, wines and other imports for the simple reason that it lowers their price tag. Conversely, it lifts the prices of machinery, farm products and other American exports, making those tougher to sell. **********The United States has faced substantial threats of protectionism in earlier postwar years. The most serious came in the late 1960's and early 1970's when inflation induced by the Vietnam War led to overvaluation of the dollar. **********The import surcharge is not a new idea. President Nixon and his Treasury Secretary, John B. Connally, put a 10 percent levy on all imports in August 1971 to enforce demands growing out of the refusal of other countries to revalue their currencies upward. **********Currency System Altered **********Currencies at that time were under a ''fixed rate'' system, pegged at relationships that rarely changed. Monetary upheavals led to its abandonment in 1973 for the present ''floating rate'' system in which currency values continually fluctuate. **********The Nixon-Connally surcharge, which drew heavy fire from America's trading partners, lasted four months - until other countries finally agreed to changes under the so-called Smithsonian accord of December 1971. Those changes helped the United States within two years to redress what in today's terms was a much more modest trade deficit - less than $10 billion. **********In that period, protectionist pressures were also manifested by the Burke-Hartke bill, mandating not only import ceilings but also curbs on American overseas investment, steel import limitations negotiated by the State Department and a widening of textile industry protection under the Multifiber Arrangement. **********For the Surcharge **********The appeal of the import surcharge is that it would reduce the Federal budget deficit while diverting production from foreigners to domestic industry. **********Advocates argue, moreover, that it represents the drastic action that is required to ''level the playing field'' of world trade, which they say is tilted against the United States because foreigners subsidize exports and invent import barriers. **********The expanding foreign presence has made the situation critical. Although the nation's economy is buoyant, manufacturing jobs are being lost - 2 million since 1980, according to a study by Data Resources. **********Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Economics, found that foreign producers were capturing 30 cents of every extra dollar spent on goods and structures in the last half of 1984. **********Burdened by intense international competition, the economy in the first quarter, according to the latest Commerce Department figures, was growing less than half as fast as in the final three months of 1984. **********Examples of Trade Barriers **********Advocates cite numerous examples of foreign barriers. The European Common Market levies tariffs of 16 percent to 18 percent against foreign semiconductors, against zero tariffs in this country. ''Buy Japan'' policies exclude a wide range of American- made telecommuncations products. **********The United States Government has complained that Nissan Motors wants to buy a Cray ''supercomputer'' but cannot because of domestic pressure to buy Japanese. **********Asked why Motorola Inc., one of the leading high-technology companies, has become the principal corporate advocate of a surcharge, Richard W. Heimlich, vice president and a former American Government steel negotiator, replied, ''The simple answer is we want to be able to continue manufacturing in this country.'' **********Another selling point is the impact of the surcharge on the Federal budget deficit. At 20 percent, on $400 billion of imports projected for 1985, it would yield $80 billion, or about 40 percent of the budget deficit. **********That would let both interest rates and the dollar fall, advocates maintain, while easing pressure for domestic spending cuts. **********Against the Surcharge **********Opponents of the import surcharge compare it with the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, warning that it could severely disrupt the trade and international financial system and touch off a new depression. **********''I'd give the European Community and Canada about a week to retaliate,'' saud Harvey Bale, assistant United States trade representative. **********Not only would it provoke retaliation, says the Congressional Budget Office, but also it would mean ''significantly'' higher interest rates, falling output and income and a ''skyrocketing'' Federal debt. It ''would unambiguously result in a net overall loss of worldwide economic efficiency and welfare,'' the Congressional agency said in a preliminary study. **********Retaliation against the Smoot-Hawley tariffs slowed world trade to a trickle in the 1930's, turning the 1929 financial collapse into the Depression, surcharge opponents say. **********Common Market's Position **********Dietrich von Kyaw, West Germany's Ambassador to Washington, served notice recently that the European Economic Commission ''would no longer be able to resist'' curbing imports of American soybeans and corn gluten, which represent more than a $4-billion-a-year market for American farmers in Europe. **********Unless developing countries were exempted, the surcharge would hurt their earnings and, in the words of C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ''ignite the oft-predicted onset of default.'' **********Opponents challenge the assumption of surcharge supporters that the dollar's value would fall. On the contrary, opponents believe it would rise, reflecting an increased demand for dollars as the American trading position improves. **********The surcharge, it is also argued, would aggravate inflation, imposing an income loss on consumers. **********The Outlook **********The Reagan Administration does not like the import surcharge and says so. ''It's just a bad idea,'' commented Bill Brock, United States trade representative, shortly before he was nominatated to become Labor Secretary. **********But two forces could keep it in the forefront of discussion. One is a weakening of the American economy. Despite the loss of manufacturing jobs, the economy has produced a net increase of 6 million new jobs since 1980, and unemployment has fallen to close to 7 percent. **********Economic weakness accompanied by increases in joblessness could intensify the search in Congress for a ''quick fix'' solution to the job, trade and budget problems - making the surcharge politically irresistible. **********The Conflict With Japan **********The second force is the growing conflict with Japan for more market access for American products. Should Tokyo rebuff Washington, a surcharge could be designed to affect only shipments from Japan. Such a bill, in fact, has just been introduced by Senator Heinz. ''The time is past for continued discussion and endless negotiation,'' he said. **********One Congressional staff member familiar with the Japanese problem commented, ''This bill could have strong appeal.'' **********Although the Administration does not like the surcharge, it is not altogether displeased by the talk about it, which has thrown a scare into America's trading partners and made them more amenable to a new round of trade liberalization negotiations - one of Washington's goals. **********So the threat of the import surcharge, paradoxically, could trigger more liberalization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/business/wheeling-to-seek-payment-waiver.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wheeling to Seek Payment Waiver", "print_headline": "Wheeling to Seek Payment Waiver", "body_text": " **********The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation said that, because of its deteriorating financial condition, it would be unable to make its $5 million pension fund payment due July 31.

But Syria, the American official said, had assured Washington that the issuing of the statement would induce the ing the Shiite Lebanese Shiites to free the Americans. **********The 39 Americans, who were aboard a Trans World Airlines jet when it was hijacked over Europe on June 14, were released today. **********Praise for Syrian Leader **********American officials praised President Hafez al-Assad of Syria for his part in ending the standoff over the hostages, and for what they said were his efforts in trying to find seven other Americans reported abducted or missing in Lebanon over the last 15 months. **********The officials said that no deals had been struck with Syria, but they said they hoped the ending of the crisis might bring a period of better relations between the two Governments. **********But they added that there continued to be be sharp disagreements between Washington and Damascus over Middle East peace efforts, with the United States firmly supporting the recent peace initiative of King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Syria strongly opposed. **********Concern Over Intervention **********Asked why Syria had become so involved in bringing about the release of the hostages, a senior policy maker speculated that Syria prefers calm in Lebanon and was concerned that the hijacking crisis might provoke American or Israeli military intervention. Syria, he said, is also concerned about a rise in Islamic fundamentalism, which it opposes. **********Syria has the closest relations to Moscow of any Middle East country, but the senior American officials said there was no indication that the Soviet Union had played any role in the crisis. **********The Syrian Government told Washington on Saturday night that the public reiteration of American policy would be enough to persuade the Lebanese Shiite groups to go ahead with the plan to free the Americans, the senior Administration official said. **********Shultz Expects Israeli Move **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz, at a news conference today at the White House, said the statement had been issued after Syria said it ''thought it would be helpful.'' **********He also said there was no connection between the freeing of the Americans and any Israeli decision to release 735 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees, as the hijackers demanded. But he said that since the detainees were being held only ''temporarily,'' he expected that Israel would release them. **********'There Is No Linkage' **********''There is no linkage there,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''And I think it is extremely important for us and others combating terrorism to see to it that the linkage doesn't exist,'' he said. **********But he acknowledged that the arrangement for freeing the Americans, and the expected release of Israel's detainees, ''didn't come out of the blue.'' **********''We had lots of discussion with many governments, including Israel, and of course, in recent days, especially Syria,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''And throughout, we made the point that these hostages and the others being held should be freed. And we also made the point that since Israel was in the process of releasing those prisoners before this happened, that it was quite clear that, if anything, the hostage taking was impeding a process that was already under way.'' **********Vice President Bush insisted that there had been no ''knuckling under to the demands of hijackers'' to gain the freedom of the 39 American hostages. Mr. Bush, speaking in Paris, also pledged continued efforts to gain the freedom of the seven kidnapped or missing Americans in Lebanon. **********''The United States Government is not going to give up, not going to rest content, until the seven and others are released, too,'' Mr. Bush said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' He noted that France and other countries also had citizens held hostage in Lebanon. **********Account of Discussions **********Earlier today, a senior Administration official gave the first detailed account of the diplomatic discussions over the last two weeks that finally produced an agreement. **********The official, who is involved in making Administration policy, said Syria had made ''an earnest effort'' to secure the release of other seven. But the effort has not produced results, he said. The United States has always included the seven in trying to end the captivity of the Americans, the official said, but this was not declared publicly until Mr. Shultz did so Wednesday night. **********The official also said an American threat on Tuesday to take economic and military steps if diplomacy failed had been intended to bring pressure on the hostages' captors from Lebanese factions that would suffer financially if Beirut International Airport and the country's ports were closed. **********Military Action Held Unlikely **********In addition, the official all but ruled out any specific military action in retaliation for the hijacking now that the hostages have been released, citing the difficulty of hitting the hijackers. **********According to his account, the Party of God, a pro-Iranian Shiite fundamentalist group that American officials believe was behind the hijacking, raised last-minute objections to the conditions for releasing the Americans. The group had been holding four hostages separately from the other 35. The conditions had been worked out by Syria and Nabih Berri, the leader of the mainstream Shiite movement Amal, who said he was acting as spokesman for the hijackers. **********Citing President Reagan's remarks on Friday in the Chicago area, in which he termed the hijackers ''thugs, murderers and barbarians'' and said they would ''be held to account,'' the Party of God told Mr. Berri that it wanted a specific pledge from the United States not to retaliate for the hijacking if the Americans were freed, the senior official said. **********'Something to Point To' **********The Party of God wanted ''something for internal purposes to point to,'' since the Syrian plan included no specific promises on the timing of Israel's release of 735 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees, the official said. **********''They focused on the fact that there might be reprisals,'' he said. ''I don't believe it was a central demand. They are not really vulnerable to reprisals and know they are not vulnerable because they live in highly concentrated urban areas.'' **********The senior official said that when the demand for a pledge of no retaliation was raised on Saturday, the United States replied ''with a firm no'' to Mr. Berri and to the Syrians. A similar demand had been made earlier last week and rejected. **********But at about 8 P.M., the Syrians ''came up with a formula, a verbatim of what we had said eight times in the last six months'' on Lebanon, he said. **********''The Syrians said they would portray that as sufficient reassurance,'' the official added, ''and we said, 'Do not make the mistake of thinking that this is an expression of intent to change our policies.' **********''They said: 'Roger, that. Let us handle the mind-set of the Hezbollah.' '' Hezbollah is the Arabic name of the Party of God. **********Reagan Confers With Advisers **********After President Reagan discussed the matter with Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, and with Secretary of State Shultz, he agreed to the release of the statement, the senior official said. It was issued at about 10 P.M. **********''With that,'' he said, ''the Syrians brought this to a close.'' **********In public and private remarks today after the Americans' release, Administration officials continued to assert that the freedom of the hostages had been achieved without concessions. They also maintained that they had never pressed Israel for a promise to carry out its stated pledge to free the 735 detainees. **********''At no time, from the first day to the last, did we ever urge, cajole, suggest, directly or indirectly, that the Isrelis alter their policy of no concessions,'' the senior policy maker said. **********But Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said today that the Administration had come as close as it could to ''asking'' Israel to release the detainees after the Americans were freed. **********Mr. Rabin, appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' said, ''We were not asked by the United States anything beyond the clarification of our known policy in regards to the Lebanese detainees, and we have made it clear in diplomatic channels exactly what we have made clear in public, what is our policy.'' **********Praise for Syrian Role **********Both Mr. Shultz and Mr. Reagan had praise today for Syria's efforts in the crisis. When asked about Mr. Berri's role, Mr. Shultz was noncommittal. He said that he had mixed feelings and that ''we have to do some sorting out'' about Mr. Berri. **********Asked if the hijackers had escaped scot-free, Mr. Shultz said, ''I think that they have paid a price, and this of course is an ongoing proposition, this fight against terrorism.'' **********''We will seek those individuals,'' he said. **********Asked what the United States would do if it found them, he said that efforts would be made to bring the ''processes of law'' against them, and that ''we would try to do everything we can to make sure they are enforced.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/08/world/egypt-ready-to-allow-bail-for-briton-in-plot.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1985-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 685, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EGYPT READY TO ALLOW BAIL FOR BRITON IN PLOT", "print_headline": "EGYPT READY TO ALLOW BAIL FOR BRITON IN PLOT", "body_text": " **********Egypt's Interior Minister said today that the Government was prepared to release a British citizen who was detained in connection with a purported plot to kill an exiled political opponent of the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi. **********The official, Ahmed Rushdi, said the Briton, Godfrey Shiner, would be freed from prison if he could raise bail set last week by an Egyptian court at 30,000 Egyptian pounds, about $36,000. **********''He will not be permitted to leave Egypt, of course,'' Mr. Rushdi said in an interview.

He declined to elaborate. **********''There is a very long border between our countries, with great stretches of desert,'' Mr. Rushdi said.

Both the lowering of interest rates and the recent direct intervention in the currency markets suggest a shift in policy. **********The difficulty is that the new posture could create as many problems as the overvalued currency itself. **********First, such attempts at financial engineering of the marketplace are an inexact science at best, economists say. Especially in the last few years, with the dollar having defied the standard influences on its movements, it is difficult to know what will affect it, and by how much. **********Second, even if the dollar does fall, its decline might well get out of control, bringing with it a number of negative side effects. **********''The most fundamental point is that we know it's easier to see sustainable economic growth in not just the U.S., but other countries, if the dollar comes down,'' said Ralph C.

The short answer is: not really.'' **********One of the most troublesome issues, in the view of some economists, is that efforts to shrink the dollar would work at cross-purposes to the principal factor behind its rise: the Federal Government's huge budget deficit.

In this view, slashing the deficit would be a more appropriate way to pull the dollar down. **********Intense Pressure **********There is little doubt, though, that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, under intense pressure domestically and from other countries, have subtly shifted their attitudes. The Fed acted by lowering interest rates, and the Treasury by direct market intervention. **********Preston Martin, the Fed's vice chairman, called the dollar's strength ''an increasingly important factor'' in the board's deliberations on monetary policy.

Previously, the Administration steadfastly resisted intervention, except in cases of ''disorderly'' markets. **********The Regan comment was subsequently followed by some coordinated intervention on a very modest scale. A French finance ministry official said the Fed had sold $46 million, in conjunction with dollar sales by European central banks. Small though that amount was for the currency markets, it was enough to signal that the Fed was ready to act, and frightened many speculators. **********A Matter of Nuance **********Even though the changes are a matter of nuance, and not major policy shifts, they reflect a growing concern about the damaging economic impact of the strong dollar, and have sharply altered perceptions in the market. **********The desire for a lower dollar is by no means unanimous. For many supply-side supporters of the Reagan Administration, the dollar's record- breaking surge has been a source of pride. They regard the huge inflow of capital into dollar-denominated assets as a vote for the President's economic policies. **********They also resist any suggestion that the dollar ought to be brought lower. **********''Americans live better today than they would otherwise because of the strong dollar,'' said Richard W. Rahn, economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Because other countries have failed with their economies, why should we suffer and bring the dollar down?'' **********Battered American manufacturers, though, have been increasing the pressure for the Government to set up protective import barriers. The pressure grows fiercer the longer the dollar remains so strong. **********''The worst enemy of free trade is the overvalued dollar,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, economist for Chase Econometrics. Added A. Gary Shilling, an economic consultant, ''If this economy does start to slow down, the protectionist pressures could be monstrous.'' **********A Double Edge **********Any dollar decline would have a double edge, though. One of the first results, economists say, would be higher inflation. The cost of imported goods would rise in dollar terms. **********Citicorp Information Services estimates that price inflation would have been one percentage point higher in 1984 than its 4 percent level, were it not for the dollar's ascent. The dollar rose 12 percent during the year against a trade-weighted index prepared by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. If the dollar falls 10 percent in 1985, Citicorp estimates, consumer prices will rise 5.5 percent for the year. **********Some analysts believe that inflation is moderate enough so that such an increase would not be damaging. Mr. Bryant of the Brookings Institution commented: ''There may be a feeling that, if you have to take it, this is not a bad time to take that higher inflation.'' There is still a fear, though, that any jump of that magnitude could alter inflationary expectations, and hence fuel an upward spiral not so easily stanched. **********Perhaps the greatest concern, though, is that creating a ''soft landing'' for the dollar is something no government can engineer, because of the size and volatility of the market. It is estimated that perhaps $100 billion or more changes hands every day in the largely unregulated world foreign exchange market. **********'There Are Limits' **********''The market is so large against the resources of governments that there are limits to what intervention can do,'' Henry C. Wallich, a Fed governor, commented. **********Intervention is also regarded as a high-risk, short-term tactic. **********''Failure in such an effort is not merely expensive,'' Albert M. Wojnilower, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation, said in a recent speech, ''but swings open the gates to even faster adverse change.'' **********Another tool conventionally used to turn the market is interest rates. Lowering rates tends to make securities denominated in that currency less attractive, pushing its value down. However, the dollar defied that formula in 1984, rising most when interest rates were falling. **********''The dollar does seem to have ignored the usual rules,'' Mr. Wallich noted. He said a sustained cut in American interest rates would be likely to bring the dollar down ''eventually,'' but added, ''We've seen that the link is not that powerful.'' **********Britain Has Raised Rates **********Of course, another route is for other countries to lift their interest rates, which Britain, in particular, has done aggressively, to halt the slide of their currencies. But that also crimps their economies. **********The final argument is that no effort can succeed like a reduction in the budget deficit. **********''The hard reality is that we are addicted to foreign borrowings, to reconcile our deficit and our investment needs with our limited propensity to save at home,'' Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, said in a speech last November. **********Yet, the growing sentiment for some action has not been matched with a clear strategy likely to work. **********''We are at sea on lots of aspects of this,'' Mr. Bryant said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/05/world/us-urging-a-credible-philippine-vote.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 639, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. URGING A 'CREDIBLE' PHILIPPINE VOTE", "print_headline": "U.S. URGING A 'CREDIBLE' PHILIPPINE VOTE", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration today called on President Ferdinand E.

He said the election would be held on Jan. 17, the anniversary of the lifting of martial law in 1981. **********The announcement, which Mr. Marcos made on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' caught the Administration by surprise, officials said. **********An aide to Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, said the Senator was in a visit to Manila on behalf of Mr. Reagan two weeks ago that Mr. Marcos would adhere to a schedule that called for local elections in May 1986 and presidential elections a year later. **********At that time, according to the official, Mr. Marcos said moving up the timetable would be too costly and would detract from plans to improve the country's economic situation. **********Although the Administration greeted Mr. Marcos's change of plans with caution, officials said it was important that the elections have credibility to prevent any widening of internal strife. **********''Elections in the Philippines must be based on credible, fair and broadly based in terms of participation,'' said Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman. **********Concern About Credibility **********Similarly, Charles E. Redman, a State Department spokesman, said the chief concern of the United States was not when the elections would be held, but whether they would be credible. **********''Whenever elections are held, our concern is that they be free and fair,'' he said. ''If elections are to re-establish competence, as President Marcos has stated, then it is essential that they be credible to the Philippine people, including satisfactory answers to constitutional questions.'' **********Mr. Redman said confidence in the electoral process required that the Philippine military conduct itself ''in a professional manner during such elections.'' **********''Additionally,'' he said, ''a fair election law, a truly impartial commission on elections and an accredited, independent citizen's election monitoring organization are essential.'' **********Last week, a report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that opposition parties would be at a disadvantage under a ''snap'' election because it could have difficulty lining up behind a candidate. Although the opposition to Mr. Marcos was significant, the report said, it remained questionable if it could ''unite behind one major presidential candidate when the chips are down.'' **********Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the election carried the potential of further ''polarizing'' the situation in the Philippines. **********''If the election is free and fair,'' he said, ''it could reverse the drift toward Communism. But if it is not genuinely honest, it could very easily boomerang. This is a very high stakes game.'' The aide to Mr. Laxalt said the Senator regarded the Marcos announcement as ''an exciting and positive development.'' **********The aide said that in a meeting between Mr. Laxalt and Mr. Marcos two weeks ago in Manila, the Philippine President ruled out any possibility of an early election.

BADGETT Jr., 42, **********had been laid off for the third **********time in his 20 years of working as a counselor in government and quasi- government agencies. **********Augustine J. Messineo, 40, was a facilities manager at the Digital Equipment Corporation, and felt he was on the fast track to nowhere. **********Inez Stewart, 28, was doing O.K. in human resources management, but felt she needed better skills and another degree to get ahead. **********Three different people, three totally different backgrounds and aspirations. But all of them turned to Cambridge College as a way to fire up their careers. **********The 15-year-old Boston school, which until 1981 was associated with Antioch University as the Institute of Open Education, is aimed at helping people - primarily women and minorities - ''make the next step in their career,'' explains Margaret Dulany. Mrs. Dulany is chairman of Cambridge's board of trustees as well as senior vice president of the New York City Partnership, a coalition of business, education and nonprofit interests formed by her father, David Rockefeller, to promote economic development. Much of Cambridge's funding, in fact, comes from the Rockefeller Foundation and members of the Rockefeller family. **********Many of Cambridge's students do not have undergraduate degrees, but most have at least five years of work experience. The college awards credits for life experience, and students can graduate after one or two years with a master's degree in education. Most of the students do work in education, but in the last three years Cambridge has offered specialties in three business areas: human resources, computerized manufacturing and facilities management. **********Each of these programs includes the study of traditional business skills such as statistics, marketing, accounting; a master's project, such as a study of how computers could be used in human resource management, and weekly professional seminars in which students assume roles, make presentations and evaluate and criticize each other. **********The mix of book learning and skills training is particularly important to those students with little business training. Mr. Badgett, for example, signed up for Cambridge's computerized manufacturing management program to learn about computers and management. **********As part of his program, Mr. Badgett worked as a management intern for three months with an Eaton Corporation subsidiary in Boston. After he graduated, Eaton hired Mr. Badgett as a manufacturing management trainee in a division that produces machinery for implanting ion particles on silicon wafers. **********According to Gail Eisencraft, Cambridge's business program manager, all 16 people in Mr. Badgett's class entered the program ''unemployed, underemployed or on the ropes,'' yet all had found jobs or received promotions by the time they graduated. **********The placement record should not be shocking. Cambridge carefully chooses the courses it will offer in terms of those areas that are ''hot'' in industry - areas where good jobs go begging because of a lack of people with the requisite skills. **********Since the vast majority of the student body consists of blacks and women, the courses tend to concentrate on fields heavily populated by people in these two groups. For example, companies have often ''dealt with affirmative action issues'' by placing women and minorities in personnel jobs, claims Gil Dube, co-director of Cambridge's human resource management program. This program, he says, provides personnel workers with the ''necessary skills to interact with line people about business,'' and thus qualify for upgraded jobs. **********Miss Stewart, for example, is a senior human resources specialist with Interactive Data Inc., a Chase Manhattan Bank subsidiary. The job has no management responsibilities, something she would like to change. Cambridge's program, she says, ''is giving me an overview of human resources at a management level.'' And she says that the role-playing exercises in particular have increased her confidence. ''I can in fact be in management,'' she said. ''All the qualities I had have been reinforced and enhanced. I know I can obtain those jobs I've been going after.'' **********Sometimes it is the students themselves who persuade Cambridge to put in a special program. Mr. Messineo, for example, saw himself as stymied, not through any sort of personal discrimination (he is white), but through what he perceived as discrimination against his entire field. ''I was in a nonprofessional-professional niche in the organization,'' he said. ''The facilities manager was never looked upon as a professional.'' **********In his opinion, facilities managers should be ''in the upper levels of decision making, impacting profitability by helping put in place cost reduction plans and energy reduction plans.'' But he could not find a college-level course that would help him develop the skills to fulfill such a mandate. **********He approached Cambridge and helped it develop a series of courses on topics ranging from waste water management to real estate law, all geared toward the function of facilities management. He became one of the first students. He did not have an undergraduate degree when he joined; today he has a master's in education with a specialty in facilities management - and a better job as a fdacilities manager at Micom-Interlan.

He said the switch, which was approved Tuesday by Prudential's board, would occur by the end of the year. **********As a result, the stockholders equity of Prudential-Bache will jump to $975 million, from $375 million, and its total capital will increase to $1.15 billion. That would mean Bache would rank sixth among brokerages in terms of capital, up from eighth. **********The change will affect the balance sheet of Bache, but not its profits. The brokerage will pay to its parent about the same amount in dividends on the preferred stock as it paid in interest on the short-term debt, Mr. Harfst said. But, he said, the change would sharply decrease the company's leverage - that is, its borrowings relative to its capital. That will make it easier to borrow money later if it needs to, he said. **********A number of brokerages and investment banks have built up their capital this year, including Salomon Brothers Inc., the First Boston Corporation and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.

The rise was well above the market's expectations. **********The news took away some of the strength of a bond market rally that was sparked earlier in the day by Government reports of weakness in the labor market. **********But the credit markets gave more credence to the employment statistics than to the unexpected spurt in the money supply and, despite a late-afternoon dip, bond prices closed a point and a half higher than on Wednesday, the previous trading day. **********Stocks Also Advance **********Stocks also responded favorably to the employment data, in the hope that interest rates would fall. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 8.06 points, to 1,334.45, just shy of its record close. Broader measures did set new highs. **********''The money supply numbers may not be quite as significant as the employment figures,'' said Lacy H.

''A lot of people went home early and there wasn't much activity,'' she said. ''Monday will tell whether the gains will be sustained. **********May Increase Shrinks **********Concerns about weakness in the economy were fed by yesterday's report that non-farm payroll employment grew by only 80,000 in June, and that the May increase was revised downward to 266,000, from 345,000. In addition, it was reported that unemployment remained unchanged at 7.2 percent in June, but mainly because fewer people were seeking jobs. **********Generally when the economy seems weak the Federal Reserve is generous in creating money as a means to stimulate business activity and to create jobs. That usually causes interest rates to decline. But because of the recent rapid growth in the money supply, underscored by yesterday's report, analysts said the Fed would be restrained in creating money. This restraint stems from the widespread belief that rapid increases in the money supply cause inflation. **********Several economists predicted yesterday that the Federal Reserve would take a neutral role in setting monetary policy, not trying to push interest rates in either direction. ''From now on,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, ''credit demand, not Fed policy, will determine the direction of interest rates.'' **********In contrast to the $2.6 billion rise reported yesterday, most market analysts had been expecting anywhere from no change to an increase of $1 billion. ''We were expecting zero growth,'' said J. Richard Zecker, senior vice president and chief economist of the Chase Manhattan Bank. **********The $2.6 billion rise brought M-1 -the measure of the money supply that consists of checking accounts in banks and savings institutions and currency in the hands of the public -to $591.9 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis, about $12 billion above the Fed's target range. The previous week it had stood at $589.3 billion. **********Despite the late-afternoon downturn, the Government's bellwether 30-year bond closed at a price of 108 29/32, still a point and a half above Wednesday's close. The markets were closed Thursday because of the Fourth of July holiday. The yield on the bond closed at 10.27 percent, down from 10.55 percent on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, following the employment reports, the bond price had soared to 109 13/32, for a yield of about 10.22. **********Short-term interest rates were not affected by the late money-supply report. The yield on three-month Government bills remained unchanged from earlier levels at 6.76 percent; the six-month bill at 6.81 percent, and the one-year bill at 6.91 percent. All were down about a quarter of a percentage point from Wednesday's close. **********Overreaction Seen **********Some economists thought that even without the sobering effects of the rise in the money supply the markets had overrected earlier in the day. ''The markets got carried away with the employment data; I don't think it was worth two points on the long bond,'' said Richard C. Green, president of Money Market Services in California. **********Several bankers and economists said that more significant than the money-supply figures was the drop in the dollar to slightly below 3 marks for a while during the day following release of the employment figures. Mr. Green said that could have important psychological effects and could cause the dollar to decline further. **********Most economists say that the United States economy, particularly the manufacturing sector, has been weak because the high value of the dollar makes it difficult for American producers to compete both at home and abroad. If the dollar were to decline in value, and American companies were to sell more, the economy would be stimulated and the Fed's policy difficulties would be mitigated, they say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/17/world/south-african-rand-takes-dramatic-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICAN RAND TAKES DRAMATIC FALL", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICAN RAND TAKES DRAMATIC FALL", "body_text": " **********South Africa's currency, the rand, fell dramatically against the United States dollar today, at one point reaching a record low.

Modern beds can - depending on how much money the would-be sleeper and relaxer is willing to pay - provide for raised feet, heat, gentle wave action, vibrations, even rocking. The menu of options makes simple horizontal, motionless beds look absolutely dull. **********Water beds, adjustable beds, futons and other new types of sleep surfaces now claim nearly 25 percent of the bed market. In fact, while sales of conventional box springs and innerspring mattresses went through periods of no growth or even decline in the 1970's, sales of specialty beds steadily increased. **********The trend has not escaped the notice of the Big Three bed companies - Simmons U.S.A., Sealy and Serta. Although Howard G. Haas, Sealy's president, insists that ''People want to sleep in the type of bedding their parents had at home - that's an innerspring mattress and box spring,'' his colleagues seem to disagree. Both Simmons and Serta have added specialty beds to their lines. **********So far, water beds, with 19 percent of the bedding market, are the major player. Once considered eccentric and grist for risque jokes, modern water beds feature mattresses with varying degrees of firmness. **********Conventional beds, by contrast, have moved toward an illusion of softness. The latest evidence on health and sleep surfaces discredits a long-held belief that hard sleep surfaces are the most healthy. Laboratory tests have demonstrated that a too-hard or too-soft surface will not allow the spine to stay properly aligned during sleep, said Dr. Robert G. Addison, the director of the Center for Pain Studies at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and director of scientific research for Sealy Inc. Thus, many mattresses now come with quilted tops and are sold as ''superpremium mattresses,'' said Roy Unger, Serta's president. **********As housing starts picked up in the last couple of years, so did sales of conventional beds. Last year, a record 25 million mattresses and foundations were sold, bringing $1.7 billion in revenues to manufacturers. And that was just wholesale - the retail value, according to Nancy Butler, an executive with the National Association of Bedding Manufacturers, is double that amount. **********More than 50 percent of the beds sold were under the Serta, Sealy or Simmons brands.

Altman & Company site in Manhattan appears to be shaping up, with a condominium-office structure fronting on Madison Avenue and the retail entrance on Fifth Avenue. The store would be reduced to about half its present size. **********The change is a part of the company's impending sale to an investor group that primarily consists of investors and lawyers specializing in real estate. **********Donald V. Smith, principal at Morgan Stanley & Company, which represents the Altman Foundation, the owner, said: ''We have a definitive agreement to sell the company's common stock to the investor group, and it has indicated that it will continue the retail business. We expect that the transaction will be closed within three months..'' He said that the investors had been talking with various retail concerns about operating the retail business. A retailer presumably would lease the store buildings and run the stores under the Altman name. It would also become a minor partner in buying the business. **********Other Retailers May Bid **********While Mr. Smith declined to specify what retailers were involved, the Allied Stores Corporation is ''looking at Altman to see what can be developed to make it attractive to us,'' said Howard E. Hassler, Allied's senior vice president for finance. Allied, one of the nation's largest retailers, operates in the metropolitan area the Stern's stores in New Jersey and Long Island, Brooks Brothers, Bonwit Teller, Plymouth Shops and Ann Taylor. **********B. Altman, which had sales of about $240 million in 1984, was put up for sale a year ago by the Altman Foundation, a charitable institution started by the store's founder, Benjamin Altman, who willed the business to the foundation. Explaining that it would sell the Altman stores to increase its assets for philanthropic purposes and to satisfy tax laws, the foundation selected Morgan Stanley to handle the transaction. A successful bid of about $115 million was made by a group of five investors who signed a definitive agreement last November. But problems arose when two retailers, Sanford J. Zimmerman, and then the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, terminated their interest in joining the investor group and taking over the Altman's retail business. **********Plans to Cut Store Size **********While the investor group remains committed to the purchase and is working through Shearson Lehman Brothers to find a retailing partner, plans appear to be firming up as to the conversion of the Altman flagship store. Sources close to the situation said that the real estate investors are planning to reduce the store by 25,000 square feet per floor, so as to provide at least 175,000 square feet for a condominium and office building with access on Madison Avenue. **********If the plan is carried out, the Altman store, reduced to about half its present size, would continue to have frontage on Fifth Avenue at 34th Street, while the residential-office structure would have frontage on Madison Avenue, the block immediately to the east. Earle W. Kazis, one of the five investors, did not return telephone calls, The problem for the retailers is apparently how viable and profitable the flagship store, as well as the other branches, will be, when a portion of each is converted to other use. As Mr. Hassler of Allied Stores put it, speaking about the Fifth Avenue store: ''The consideration we have, besides cost, is the new configuration the store will have. The investors are trying to accommodate both the store and the building for different purposes.'' **********Thomas M. Macioce, president and chief executive officer of Allied, is said to be particularly interested in a successful arrangement on Altman. It would give the large retail chain its first department store with high visibility in the nation's largest city, forming a Fifth Avenue link with the flagship store of Bonwit Teller, a specialty chain, at 57th Street.

Without them, interest rates undoubtedly would have been higher, and the economic recovery following the 1981-82 recession may well have been less robust. **********Now, however, economists say that the delicate balance these investors provide is threatened by the new American policy that aims to lower the value of the dollar against other currencies. And the concern is focusing a fresh look at where overseas buying is coming from, how important it is and to what extent it might dry up if a lower dollar lessens the attractiveness of Treasury securities. **********In the first six months of 1985, net foreign purchases of Treasury securities totaled $14.3 billion, more than 17 percent of all investment in new Treasury issues. As recently as 1980, net purchases for the full year were only $10 billion, accounting for less than 10 percent of the total increase in Treasury debt. **********'Vitally Important' **********The importance of foreign investment to financing the Federal deficit was recently pointed out in a speech by E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''We are vitally dependent on foreign savings flows,'' he noted. Directly or indirectly, he said, they are ''financing half or more of the budget deficit.'' Even when foreign investors put their money into corporate bonds or bank certificates of deposit, the United States Treasury benefits, because the general level of interest rates remains lower. **********Economists say that America's attempt to lower the value of the dollar could retard foreign investment in United States Treasuries if it results in a sharp jump in foreign interest rates and a common perception that the American economy is lacking strength. Then, the only way the Treasury could continue financing the budget deficit would be to raise the level of interest rates it is willing to pay to attract investors. **********For now, most economists and international financial experts believe that the United States can continue to attract foreign buyers for its debt at the same time it tackles the trade deficit and strong dollar. The key, they say, is that the fall in the value of the dollar takes place gradually, while, at the same time, the Federal budget deficit declines, thus reducing the need for such huge financing in the first place. **********'Walking a Tightrope' **********Still, there is the definite feeling that, with its new policies, ''the Government is walking a tightrope,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. **********And Richard D. Rippe, senior vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: ''We're trying to lower the value of the dollar to bring the trade deficit down. But we can't make changes so fast that the appeal of the United States as a stable haven for foreign investment is ruined.'' **********Last year, net foreign purchases of Treasury notes, bonds and bills totaled $25.5 billion, the most since 1977. Japan purchased nearly 25 percent of all United States Treasury securities sold to foreigners. The remainder was divided among British investors ($6.1 billion), oil-producing nations ($2.2 billion), Switzerland ($1.1 billion) and others. **********Japanese Investors Active **********The biggest turnabout in recent years has been the sharp decline in purchases by oil-producing nations, and the increase in buying by Japanese investors. Such activity in the past has been dictated, in large part, by the flow of trade-related dollars into their countries, much of which is then put back into the United States as investments. **********Several experts said that without foreign investment in Treasury securities, interest rates might have been higher, possibly by as much as one or two percentage points. A jump of that magnitude would redound throughout the financial markets, causing corporate and bank financing costs to rise, and leading to a slower pace of capital spending. **********''Foreigners are here because of a perception that the U.S. economy is stable,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief United States economist for Wharton Econometrics Inc., a Philadelphia-based forecasting company. ''If anything is done to shake that confidence, it would create problems. For instance, if there is a sudden decline in the value of the dollar, say 25 percent, I could foresee interest rates going up by 1 to 2 percent. Sure, the Government would continue to sell securities, but at a greater cost to the Treasury.'' $201.3 Billion in Holdings Even so, foreign investors are still ''a small piece of the pie,'' said Frank Cavanaugh, director of the Treasury's Office of Government Finance and Market Analysis. He and other experts note that outstanding foreign holdings of Treasuries totaled $201.3 billion in June, roughly $100 billion more than in 1980. Yet total Federal debt soared by $864.7 billion, to $1.779 trillion, during the same period. **********Of greater importance to the Treasury, Mr. Cavanaugh said, is total foreign investment in the United States this year, which is expected to be about $130 billion. ''This is the figure that needs to be watched,'' Mr. Cavanaugh said. ''As long as total foreign investment in the U.S. remains at current levels, or at levels slightly less, there would be little effect on Treasury interest rates, because the total volume of dollars in the economy would be stable.'' **********Mr. Cavanaugh said he did not expect the total foreign investment in the United States to decline anytime soon. Other experts agreed. The factors that have compelled foreign investors to buy Treasury securities and other American financial instruments, including low inflation and the high value of the dollar, are likely to remain largely unchanged over the next year, they predicted. **********'It's No Accident' **********''Foreigners are buying U.S. securities because they really do not have a better place to go,'' said Dan Napoli, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities. ''We have the largest, most dynamic, most liquid and safest markets in the world. It's no accident the dollars we're sending out of this country are coming back in security purchases.'' **********Japanese investors in recent years have flocked to Treasury bonds because they saw them as a risk-free investment, said Nobumitsu Kagami, chief economist for the Nomura Investment Management Company, The dollar, he said, had appeared impervious to efforts to weaken its value, and interest rates on Treasury issues offered about five percentage point higher yields than comparable Japanese Government securities. **********Nearly two weeks ago, a move by the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, to raise Japanese interest rates stirred concern among analysts and dealers, because it was initially seen as a signal that major Japanese investors might begin to pull their funds out of American securities markets. The move was viewed as a further step in the joint effort of the five major non-Communist industrial natons to lower the value of the dollar against their own currencies. **********Yields on Japanese bonds rose from 5.8, to 6.6 percent, as a result of the central bank's move. At the same time, American rates have been coming down, so much so that the interest differential between comparable 10-year Japanese bonds and United States bonds has narrowed to less than 3.5 percent. **********Investment Had Narrowed **********The total investment in foreign bonds by Japanese investors, including American securities, had already slowed from a record high of $8.4 billion in July to $2.6 billion in September, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance. Most of the slowdown took place before the drop in the value of the dollar, following the Group of Five's announcement in late September and the rise in Japanese rates. **********In recent weeks, Mr. Kagami said that Japanese interest in foreign bonds of all sorts has been subdued. Other Japanese financial experts said it was too early to tell, but noted that interest would return when investors in that country were confident that the yen had stablilized against the dollar. **********Japanese investors who purchase foreign bonds with yen funds are the most skittish, said Lokhi Banjeri, vice president and manager of funding and securities at Chase Manhattan Bank in Tokyo. **********Primary Purchasers **********He said that the primary purchasers of United States Government bonds were life insurance companies and trust bank pension fund managers who wanted to buy and hold the bonds as a secure investment. These investors were attracted by higher interest rates and tended to use yen funds to buy bonds. Since they are the most susceptible to currency and interest rate fluctuations, these investors have been more relucant about new purchases in recent weeks. **********But Mr. Banjeri said also that he had not detected any unwillingness to invest in United States Treasury issues among securities houses, commercial banks, corporations and investors with excess cash who buy with dollars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/25/business/washington-watch-message-from-the-vatican.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1985-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Message from the Vatican", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH;   Message from the Vatican", "body_text": " **********It came on elegant ivory paper with the crimson insignia and a large watermark identifying the sender as the ''Secretatus Status'' or Secretariat of State of the Vatican.

And the first 10 Brazilian-made Astros II rocket systems are already being used by Iraq in its war against Iran. **********That is not all. Last year, foreign defense attaches were surprised to spot Brazilian-made armored vehicles at a military parade in Peking. And last month, as evidence of the importance of the occasion, President Jose Sarney was on hand for the maiden flight of Brazil's new AMX subsonic jet fighter, which is being built in collaboration with Italy. **********A decade ago, Brazil barely had an arms industry. Now, analysts generally rank the country as the fifth-biggest arms exporter in the world, after the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain. Most of its 40 client nations are in the third world, where it often competes successfully with the big powers, but some of its more imaginative military equipment is also attracting the interest of members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********Perhaps most surprising, unlike other leading weapons makers, Brazil did not develop its export trade as a byproduct of a large domestic military establishment. Nor are exports being used to expand Brazil's political influence. Rather, this is all business - and good business at that. **********The Brazilian arms industry employs 100,000 workers in 350 companies, most of them privately owned; more than 90 percent of their production is destined for export. No official figures on arms sales are released, and the rules of successful arms dealing require that trade figures disguise how much of what is sold to whom. **********Nonetheless, industry sources say that arms exports should earn Brazil between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in 1985. The International Defense Review and other journals put the figure as high as $2.4 billion. By comparison, the Soviet Union delivered $9.4 billion in arms in 1984, and the United States $7.7 billion, according to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. **********But Brazil seems determined to export itself out of its $104 billion foreign debt crisis, and even $1 billion is no small contribution to a trade surplus that should top $12 billion this year. That contribution is likely to continue rising, for Brazil is the most successful of the ''middle income'' developing countries in entering arms markets long monopolized by the industrialized nations. **********Such is the economic importance of the weapons business, in fact, that Brazil's new civilian Government has not changed the wholehearted support for weapons manufacturing formerly provided by the military regime that stepped down last March after 21 years in power. The Government has maintained bans on arms sales to South Africa, Cuba and Iran, but no other countries are blacklisted as potential clients. A ministerial commission routinely considers each arms deal, but its liberal approach is one of Brazil's selling points: The country delivers the goods without political strings attached. **********Specifically, unlike the United States, Brazil does not require clients to sign an ''end users certificate,'' under which manufacturers can veto resale of their military equipment. So this has helped Brazil pick up clients unable to obtain American-made weapons either directly or through resale. Its largest client is Iraq, with Libya a strong second. Others in the Middle East include Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Even Iran is known to be using Brazilian armored vehicles that have either been captured from Iraq or obtained from Libya. THE country's other major market is Latin America itself, where politics also play a key role. Brazil won several new Latin customers, including Chile, when the Carter Administration refused to sell arms to their military regimes. But even civilian governments, aware of the danger of sudden suspensions of American military credits, have increasingly looked to Brazil as a reliable supplier. **********Equally important to its strategy, Brazil has adapted existing technology to develop no-frills weapons that are ideally suited to the needs of third world armed forces: They are simple to operate and maintain, with spare parts easily available around the world; they are strong enough to withstand rugged terrains. And they come at an attractive price. **********Brazil itself became aware of the importance of standard spare parts in 1977, when it canceled a long-standing military assistance agreement with the United States to protest criticism of human rights violations here. At the time, an estimated 80 percent of the equipment of Brazil's armed forces required American spare parts - many of which suddenly became difficult to obtain. **********This vulnerability gave Brazil a new incentive to build up its own arms industry. Today, 80 percent of the equipment purchased by the Brazilian military is locally made. **********Government encouragement has been an important factor in this build-up, not least in providing export financing. But apart from the aviation market, the surge in arms exports is principally a victory for private enterprise. Much of the credit for Brazil's assault on the world market goes to a handful of entrepreneurs -and chief among them is Jose Luiz Whitaker Ribeiro, whose company, Engesa, employs 10,000 people and expects to export $600 million in weapons this year alone - roughly half of the nation's total. **********Founded in the 1960's as an oil equipment supplier, the company first developed its own ''boomerang'' rear suspension system that enabled trucks and other vehicles to reach remote oilfields over inhospitable terrain. From that point, ''it was natural for us to build a troop carrier, since it was nothing more than an armored truck,'' Mr. Ribeiro said. **********Now the company's two best-selling products are the Urutu, a carrier that can transport 13 soldiers and is armed with machine guns or cannons, and the Cascavel, a three-man armored car that can be fitted with a 90-millimeter cannon. Subsequently came the Jararaca, an armed reconnaissance vehicle, as well as a variety of tank carriers. **********''Since the first sale to Libya in 1973, we've sold over 5,000 Cascavels and Urutus,'' said the 57-year-old Mr. Ribeiro, cradling a model of the Cascavel in his arms with undisguised pride during an interview at Engesa's headquarters here. ''We now produce 50 percent of all wheeled military vehicles made in the free world today, and the only ones coming off an assembly line.'' **********The relative simplicity of these vehicles enables Engesa to equip them to suit the client - who might, for example, be able to choose between German or American engines. Access to spare parts is always a prime consideration. Engesa offers a 12-month guarantee against mechanical problems and has its own small airline, AeroBrasil, to insure quick delivery of men and equipment to its offices and bases in 35 countries. **********''We have about 50 people stationed in Iraq permanently,'' Mr. Ribeiro said, ''and they even do maintenance work on the front line.'' **********The greatest tribute to the Cascavel and Urutu designs, however, is that Engesa has signed an agreement for their manufacture under license in the United States by the FMC Corporation. The hope is that the Pentagon will buy them for the American rapid deployment force. **********''Two years ago, the U.S. wanted combat-proven, off-the-shelf armored vehicles for the force,'' and it chose an American supplier, Mr. Ribeiro said. ''Now that deal fell through and they've turned to us again. The vehicles should be tested by the U.S. Army in January, but I'm confident that they will be sold.'' **********Until now Engesa has prospered by making wheeled military vehicles that had not been offered by existing arms suppliers. But the company's latest $52 million project - the 40-ton Osorio tank - brings it into direct competition with more experienced tank manufacturers in the United States, Britain and West Germany. **********The test ground appears to be Saudi Arabia, where the Osorio is undergoing extensive hot-weather desert trials, in some cases pitted directly against competing models. ''The Osorio has the same mobility, firepower and armor as the American M1 tank, but ours is 40 tons and theirs is 60 tons and therefore more expensive,'' Mr. Ribeiro said. ''We should make a sale. Three countries have taken options to buy 1,200 of them.'' **********The Osorio, in fact, symbolizes the way Engesa approaches the development of new weapons. First, it identified a demand for a lighter tank among third world countries where bridges and roads could not support 60-ton vehicles. Then it studied the best available suspension systems, armor, electronics, cannons and engines before building a model that gave purchasers different options without sacrificing power. **********Brazil's other new field weapon is the Astros II rocket system made by Avibras Aeroespacial, another private company that, under its president, Joao Verdi Carvalho Leite, has grown rapidly. Like Engesa and the rest of the arms industry, its plant is situated in Sao Jose dos Campos, a town 60 miles outside Sao Paulo. **********Making a wide range of rockets and bombs for export, Avibras has flourished in part because of the Gulf War. Saudi Arabia has apparently joined Iraq on the customer list for the Astros II rocket system, with a $300 million contract disclosed last week. Following Argentina's successful use of French-made Exocet missiles against British warships in the 1982 Falklands war, Avibras is also developing a similar surface-to-sea shore defense system known as the Barracuda. It also hopes to produce Brazil's first medium-range ballistic missile. Potential customers are said to provide some help with development costs for such projects. **********Most private companies in the industry here are suppliers for major manufacturers, but a handful also produce weapons. For example, Bernadini S. A., run by a 35-year-old entrepreneur, Flavio Bernadini, has recently built its own 30-ton Tamoyo tank, which it hopes will find markets abroad. D. F. Vasconcellos S. A. says it expects to win the license to build the new Piranha air-to-air missile, designed by the military's Aerospace Technical Center to compete with the American-made Sidewinder. THE state's role in aviation has been enormously successful. **********State-owned Embraer is the only non-American company among the top 10 general aviation producers in the West. The 16-year-old company has focused largely on civilian aircraft, developing first the 19-seat Bandeirante and now the 30-seat Brasilia for use by regional and commuter airlines, with American companies among clients for both. **********Its biggest ''hit,'' though, has been its single-engine Tucano military trainer, several hundred of which have already been sold. Eighty more are being assembled in Egypt for delivery to Iraq, while this year Britain chose it over the Swiss-made Pilatus, with 130 Tucanos to be built under license in Northern Ireland. Last month, a United States Air Force delegation visited Embraer to take a closer look at the Tucano. **********Recently, the company decided to build the AMX jet fighter in collaboration with Aeritalia and Aermacchi of Italy - and that strategy involves greater risks. With a total investment of some $600 million, Brazil will take 79 and Italy 150 of the planes, but the manufacturers are gambling that the AMX's low price tag, expected to be about $10 million, will appeal to many third world governments. **********The irony is that, with military spending accounting for less than one percent of the country's gross domestic product, Brazil's armed forces cannot afford Osorios, Astro II rocket systems and most of the high-tech materiel being produced here. Nevertheless, the arms industry is busily earning vital export dollars, and this fits well into Brazil's perception of its security interests. **********At the heart of this is the country's determination to achieve autonomy in all strategic areas. Having been battered by steep oil price rises in the 1970's, for example, it now anticipates energy self-sufficiency by 1990. More recently, even risking trade reprisals by the United States, it has excluded foreign companies from part of its computer market in order to develop its own ''informatics'' industry. Thus, while its armed forces have no current need to tap its weapons-building capacity, Brazil's leaders seem happy to know it is there. DO ARMS MAKERSMAKE PEACE? SAO PAULO,Brazil Earlier this year, one of Brazil's most respected and outspoken prelates, Paulo Evaristo Cardinal Arns of Sao Paulo, complained that it was ''shameful'' for Brazil to have become a major weapons exporter. ''He who manufactures armaments builds wars,'' he noted in a homily. **********An Army spokesman retorted that Cardinal Arns was free to make his remarks because, ''thanks to the arms we produce, we are a free country.'' And, he added, in a barely disguised slight, Communist countries often promote peace movements in the West to win time to arm themselves further. **********But more surprising was the general silence that greeted Cardinal Arns's admonition. It produced minimal echo in political circles here. Although democracy has finally returned after 21 years of military rule, neither the civilian administration nor political parties further to the left have voiced moral qualms as Brazil sells arms to dozens of nations. **********Opportunities to speak out abound. Middle East delegations on arms-buying sprees receive royal treatment here, while new arms contracts are well publicized by the local media. But the arms industry is simply viewed in pragmatic business terms, as an important source of dollars and jobs. **********When politicians are questioned, they show no embarrassment that the country might be profiting from prolongation of the Iran-Iraq war. Rather, nationalist pride appears to be stirred by the fact that Brazil is competing successfully in the marketplace with more developed nations. There is even an official War Materiel Day, celebrated on October 30. **********Asked whether peace between Iran and Iraq would not be a blow to the arms industry, Jose Luiz Whitaker Ribeiro, president of Engesa, Brazil's largest arms exporter, had a quick response: ''No. The best clients are those caught in a cold war situation, when they're preparing, when they're insulting each other. But once a war begins, they soon start having financial problems and business becomes more complicated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/14/business/briefs-091805.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********American Airlines, Dallas, said it had asked the Transportation Department for permission to start nonstop flights between Chicago and Manchester, England, in the spring of 1986. *********** **********Checkers Motors Corp., Kalamazoo, Mich., said shareholders had approved a proposal to merge the Checker Taxi Interim Corp., a subsidiary, into Checker Taxi Co.

The introduction of the water set off an uncontrollable chemical reaction that released the toxic fumes. **********The labor group, citing its interviews with workers, offered new details to support a theory that Union Carbide has rejected. This theory suggests that the water backed up through various pipes during a cleaning operation and was able to reach the tank by crossing a ''jumper line'' that was installed by the company a year before the accident for maintenance purposes. **********The jumper line is not indicated in diagrams of the plant issued by Union Carbide. A Carbide spokesman said today that the jumper line theory was discussed by company officials at a March 20 news conference but was discounted because it presumed water would have had to travel through several closed valves. The spokesman, Thomas Failla, confirmed today that the jumper line was a modification, made in India, to the original design. **********The labor delegation also charged that the storage tanks where the gas reaction occurred had been poorly designed and that the objections of engineers in India to them were ignored, that major safety systems were not kept in working order, and that personnel cuts intended to save money resulted in the remaining workers performing jobs for which they were not qualified. **********American members of the delegation described the group's 20-page report as ''the most detailed and complete analysis to date'' of how the accident happened. They contended that few, if any, of the conditions that caused the accident would be prevented by American health and safety regulations. **********Union Carbide's own report, released March 20, said that the there had been violations of procedures at the Bhopal plant that would never have been tolerated in its plants in the United States. **********Much of the information in the labor delegation's report was contained in a series of articles in The New York Times from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, based on interviews with plant workers and others with knowledge of the facility. Today's report, however, contained additional details, including a detailed drawing of the pathway along which water may have leaked to the tank, and the contention that the modifications were made in India. **********The investigative team was sponsored by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Federation of Chemical, Energy and General Workers' Unions. It included labor officials from Europe, India and the United States. **********The Indian Government would not allow the team to enter the plant in Bhopal, and Carbide officials in India refused to be interviewed by them. The team said it talked to more than 30 Carbide workers, including five or six who were on the scene when the accident occurred. **********The group's report was issued at a news conference here today at the headquarters of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and was released simultaneously in Geneva and New Delhi. **********Mr. Failla, the Carbide spokesman, said he could not respond to the labor delegation's report in detail because he had not yet received a copy and had only obtained a brief press release. ''In a general sense,'' he said, ''the design of the plant was a safe design.'' **********The Company's Contentions **********Mr. Failla also said that the company has been denied a full opportunity to inspect the plant's records and thus cannot draw firm conclusions about how the water got in. **********Union Carbide has suggested that water was introduced into the storage tank inadvertently or deliberately by workers who may have hooked up a water line to the wrong pipe. But the labor team's report said that workers insisted that no such connection was made on the night of the accident. **********Instead, the report said, the workers suggested that the water entered the tank by a roundabout route through malfunctioning valves and the jumper line. **********According to the account given by the workers, water was initially pumped into some lines to clean them out; this water was supposed to drain from some ''bleeder lines'' and was supposed to be blocked from entering the rest of the system by an isolation valve that was further sealed by a metal disk called a slip blind. **********However, according to their account, the bleeder lines were clogged, causing water to back up. The slip blind was never installed and the isolation valve leaked, allowing the water to enter a pipe known as the relief valve vent header. From there, it followed the jumper line into another set of pipes known as the process vent header and ultimately escaped through various valves into the tank where the chemical reaction released the gas. **********American Delegate's View **********Michael J. Wright, director of occupational health and safety for the United Steelworkers of America and a member of the team, said that he is not fully confident that the team's account of the accident is accurate. But he said it is the account that the Bhopal workers believe, and it is more plausible than others. **********The labor report also blamed management for the failure to install the critical slip blind. The report says it was the responsibility of a maintenance supervisor to see that the device was installed, but the supervisory position had been eliminated in an economy move a few days before the accident and the production supervisor who was apparently supposed to assume those responsibilities had just been transferred from a battery plant and knew little about the system. **********The group's report listed a combination of other factors as contributing to the accident, including a vent gas scrubber too small to handle a big accident, a shutdown of refrigeration units critical to safety, failure to repair a flare tower designed to burn escaping gas, leaking valves, broken gauges and cutbacks in manpower and training programs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/06/world/pope-addresses-ukrainians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE ADDRESSES UKRAINIANS", "print_headline": "POPE ADDRESSES UKRAINIANS", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II said today that he was saddened by what he called the persecution of Ukrainian Catholics in the Soviet Union and shared their grief as a Slav.

A handful of small houses used by rebel commanders strongly resemble the tropical huts built by United States troops at Palmerola Air Base in Honduras. A sign in one officer's quarters reads, ''Viva Reagan.'' **********Quarters for 4,000 **********While the radio operator chanted her codes, the guerrillas, estimated to number 4,000, prepared to bed down in thatched shelters and tents. **********The size of the base and its many installations offer a sense of how United States assistance to the rebels has been spent and where aid may flow if Congress votes to help the rebels again. **********Rebel officials allowed several reporters to stay at the camp on the condition that its location not be revealed. There were no other restrictions on the visit. **********Largest Rebel Group **********The guerrillas at the camp are members of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest of the three rebel groups seeking the Government's overthrow. The Reagan Administration is believed to have spent nearly $80 million in covert funds on the war, most of it going to the Nicaraguan Democratic Force under the supervision of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to rebel officials. **********Administration officials originally told Congress that the aid was for a small force of rebels who would intercept arms traffic to El Salvador. But a three-day visit to the guerrilla camp confirmed that what the Administration in fact helped build is a 12,000- to 14,000-man army dedicated to overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua. **********Base Cut Out of the Jungle **********Capt. Armando Lopez, the head of rebel logistics, said he had been ordered to cut the base out of a thick mountain jungle at the end of 1981 when Central Intelligence Agency financing of the rebels began to increase. **********Captain Lopez, who is second in command at the camp, said that when he first joined a small band of exiles after fleeing Nicaragua in 1979 he ''never imagined'' the guerrilla army would grow so large. Few others took the exiles seriously, he added. **********''When this started they called us crazy, absurd, dreamers,'' he said. **********A war map on the wall alongside him showed a giant arrow sweeping across northern Nicaragua from the Honduran border. Smaller arrows pointed down, toward Managua. **********The camp, which rebels said was briefly attacked by Government forces in 1983, is protected by eight Russian 2.7-millimeter antiaircraft machine- gun emplacements and squads of armed guards. It also includes a firing range and a reviewing stand overlooking a drill field, above which flies a large blue and white Nicaraguan flag. **********''More sweat in training, less blood in combat,'' admonishes a poster next to the drill field. **********Former Somoza Loyalists **********Like most senior guerrilla commanders, Captain Lopez is a former officer in the Nicaraguan National Guard, an army known for its corruption and loyal defense of the Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. The presence of the National Guardsmen has become an issue in the debate on helping the rebels. **********Imbued with the anger of defeat and fervently opposed to the leftist ideology of the Sandinistas, the exiled guardsmen said they were eager to accept C.I.A. money and training. **********''It excited me because we would continue to fight against Communism,'' Captain Lopez said. **********Although rebel commanders complained of a shortage of supplies, aging World War II army ambulances crept into camp each night laden with munitions. Rebel fighters said they were short of bullets, but all carried automatic rifles and their morale seemed high. They seemed much better equipped than anti-Government rebel forces in El Salvador. **********Nicaraguan Government gunners downed two rebel C-47 transport planes and a helicopter in 1983 and 1984, but two rebel officials said they had a growing air fleet in reserve that could carry supplies to their forces. **********Doctors Fly In From U.S. **********The war is never far away. Rebel combat units, soaked with rain and sweat, marched into the base each day during the reporters' visit. Some left wounded guerrillas at the camp hospital. Others sought fresh supplies. **********The wounded from a major rebel attack two weeks ago filled the main ward of the camp hospital. Most seemed to be recovering, including a guerrilla whose right leg had been amputated and another who had lost an eye. **********But one delirious fighter coughed dark blood from internal injuries caused by a mortar. And a pallid young rebel on a nearby cot died the next evening from the bullet that had split his liver. **********Five Nicaraguan doctors and several nurses manage the hospital, which is equipped with an X-ray machine, operating room, pharmacy and beds for 30 patients. Cuban-American doctors occasionally fly in from Miami for special operations, the rebels said. **********Wounded rebels usually have to walk or be carried for days before reaching the hospital, according to the doctor in charge, Dr. Francisco, who would not give his last name. Stomach wounds are the most frequent cause of death, he added, since those with severe internal injuries usually do not survive the trip. **********Adolfo Calero, the political head of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, arrived at the camp with an important visitor, Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, retired, former chief of staff of United States forces in South Korea. General Singlaub is the president of the World Anti-Communist League and the United States Council for World Freedom, based in Phoenix. **********General Singlaub said he would soon be sending ''substantial nonlethal aid'' to the guerrillas, including boots, ponchos and medical supplies. But if the rebels are to do more than hang on, he added, it will take at least twice the $14 million that President Reagan is seeking in Congress. If American aid is not renewed, rebel morale will fall sharply, he asserted. **********'This Great Cause' **********The top guerrilla military commander, Col. Enrique Bermudez, a former National Guard officer with close ties to the C.I.A., introduced General Singlaub to a parade of 2,080 rebels as a dedicated anti-Communist who had criticized President Carter in 1977 for considering a reduction in American forces in South Korea. General Singlaub was forced to leave his post after his disagreement with Mr. Carter. **********''Please accept my promise that I will do everything in my power to help this great cause,'' General Singlaub, 63 years old, told the rebel soldiers. ''You can be certain that the prayers of millions of Americans will be with you in the hope that our next major formation will be in Managua.'' **********Most rebel fighters seem to be peasants from northern Nicaragua strongly opposed to rationing in Nicaragua and Sandinista political control. Their anger appears to reflect growing unrest in the Nicaraguan countryside that is likely to send the rebels a steady supply of recruits. **********Many are veterans. Gerardo Alani, 25, said he became a combatant in 1982 when the police pursued him for feeding guerrilla units in Jinotega Province. Mr. Alani pointed to the scars of two bullet wounds suffered in ''countless battles'' and showed a small medallion of Jesus and a silver medal that he wore for protection. Mr. Alani said he intended to fight ''to the end.'' **********The silver medal commemorated the 100th anniversary of statehood in Nevada. Its legend read, ''It's lucky when you live in Nevada.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/16/business/business-people-cbs-fox-video-chief-will-leave-the-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;CBS/Fox Video Chief Will Leave the Venture", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;CBS/Fox Video Chief Will Leave the Venture", "body_text": " **********CBS/Fox Video, the largest video cassette distributor in the country. said yesterday that Lawrence Hilford, president and chief executive officer, would leave the company. **********Paul Wagner, a spokesman for the company, said Mr. Hilford's contract had come up for negotiation and was not renewed because of a disagreement over terms.

As servicing agent for the mortgage securities, Advance was responsible for collecting payments on the mortgages. **********Mortgages in Default **********According to the letter, many of the mortgages in the pool were in default, many appeared to be overvalued and an inordinate number of them had been made to only two borrowers. **********Advance said in the letter that it had ''ample reason to question the integrity of a number of the mortgage loans comprising the subject pools and therefore has grave doubts about the soundness of the pools themselves.'' **********It added that ''we are sharing our concerns with you in order that you may assess your position in this matter and formulate your course of action.'' **********In the letter, Advance gave 90 days' notice that it was withdrawing as the servicing agent because of the problems. **********There were reports today that Advance Mortgage had sent copies of its letter to some of the financial institutions that had invested in the mortgage participation. **********Wells Fargo said it relayed the charges from Advance Mortgage to Lord, Bissell as National Mortgage's legal representative. **********Betty Lattie, the spokesman for Wells Fargo, said that under the trustee agreement Wells Fargo ''had a responsibility to convey the allegations to N.M.E.C. and at that time we were in contact with N.M.E.C.'s attorneys.'' **********She added, ''The agreement specified that we were entitled to rely upon their opinion, and their opinion at that time was that the allegations made by Advance Mortgage were incorrect,'' although she said that there was general agreement that a large number of the mortgages were in default. **********Suit Is Threatened **********Wells Fargo said today that it had not been able to find a suitable replacement for Advance Mortgage, as stipulated in the trusteeship agreement, and therefore it appointed National Mortgage in that role, at least temporarily. A replacement was never found. The bank did not explain why it had difficulties in finding someone else. **********Wells Fargo did inform the investors that Advance Mortgage had withdrawn as a mortgage servicer, that it could not find a suitable replacement and than N.M.E.C. had been chosen as an interim solution. **********One of the savings banks that purchased some of the mortgage securities in question is now threatening to sue Wells Fargo for not alerting others to the allegations concerning the mortgage pools and their originator. **********Arthur J.

Millard, and his daughter, Barbara Millard, relinquished operating control to quell a dealer revolt. **********Mr. Faber, who was president of the Oakland, Calif., computer retailer until 1983, is wasting little time. He has already started a corporate reorganization to eliminate overlapping divisions. The reorganization is expected to reduce Computerland's work force of about 900. In an interview, Mr. Faber said he was thinking ''more in terms of tens than in the hundreds'' of jobs being eliminated. **********The cost reductions are aimed at allowing Computerland to reduce the payments from franchisees. Mr. Faber has already promised franchisees, who say that current payments at about 9 percent of sales are too high, to come up with a plan by the end of the month to reduce the rate. **********Mr. Faber said he has a different business philosophy than Mr. Millard, whose main mistake, he said, was allowing ''the loss of relationship trust'' with the franchisees, who operate more than 800 stores worldwide. **********''We are a service and support vehicle'' for the franchisees - ''not the other way around,'' he said. **********Asked how much authority he really has, since the Millards still own most of the company, Mr. Faber said he would not have taken the job unless he was given sufficient authority.

Mr. Faber became president of the operation as it grew to become the world's largest computer retailer. But as Mr. Millard wanted to become more active in 1983, Mr. Faber left, rather than have ''four sets of hands pulling on the steering wheel,'' he said. **********He has spent the last two and a half years fishing, hunting and traveling, living in both Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay area.

The Synod was called to examine the results of Vatican II. **********In a key sentence, the document sought specifically to end the belief, at times widespread among Christians, that the Jewish people were responsible for killing Jesus. **********The passage read: ''True, authorities of the Jews and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be blamed upon all the Jews then living, without distinction, nor upon the Jews of today.'' **********Rabbi Tanenbaum said in an interview before the papal audience that the revised teaching on Judaism had come to be accepted by more conservative as well as liberal elements in the church. **********He said reaffirming the doctrine at a time when Catholic leaders are perceived as becoming more conservative ''would go a long way toward making the enlightened view the universal consensus of the Catholic Church.'' **********In his statement to the delegation, made public later by the Vatican Press Office, the Pope reaffirmed the Vatican II declaration and condemned anti- Semitism in unequivocal terms. **********''Anti-Semitism,'' John Paul said, ''which is unfortunately still a problem in certain places, has been repeatedly condemned by the Catholic tradition as incompatible with Christ's teaching and with the respect due to the dignity of men and women created in the image and likeness of God.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/04/business/pickens-sued-over-phillips.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pickens Sued Over Phillips", "print_headline": "Pickens Sued Over Phillips", "body_text": " **********A class-action has been filed against T.

Last month the Intel Corporation, one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in California's ''Silicon Valley,'' announced it was laying off 900 employees, its first job cutback in 10 years. It joined several other computer-chip manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, National Semiconductor, which is trimming 400 jobs, Monolithic Memories, Zilog Inc., Seeq Technology and Micron Technology, which recently announced that it would cut up to half its work force of 1,250 employees. **********All this shedding of work force and production, industry analysts say, is part of a shakeout in the computer industry that has begun to affect the kinds of jobs available in the nation's high-technology fields. But experts like Robert K. Weatherall, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's placement office, believe that the computer and semiconductor industries are merely in a slump, a ''dip'' in the market. Other companies, outside the computer industry, have continued to hire computer-science majors and electrical engineers. ''If for the moment some of the computer makers are in a hole for a bit, it doesn't mean that the market for electrical engineers and computer-science students is turning down over all,'' Mr. Weatherall said. **********Before, layoffs seemed temporary. The first employees to go were the equivalent of blue-collar workers, those involved in production. And workers laid off at one company simply moved to another one. Now, industry analysts say, the turnover is not nearly as high, having dropped last year from nearly 40 percent in most companies to less than 30 percent. **********A number of professional and technical jobs have also been made obsolete by the changes in the computer industry. ''One very clear example is video games,'' said Peter Giles, the president of the Santa Clara Manufacturing Group in Silicon Valley. ''A lot of people were making their livelihood at it, but now it hardly exists. It employed 8,000 people at Atari, most writing software, and now you have considerably below 1,000.'' **********According to Mr. Weatherall of M.I.T., ''What is happening is that there are more and more companies, start-up companies, who are wanting students to do something with computers, sometimes just designing, sometimes putting them to use.'' For example, he said that for the last three or four years the investment- banking firm of Morgan Stanley had been recruiting computer-science majors to help program computers to track the behavior of stocks and identifiy which stocks to purchases or sell. Mr. Weatherall said he expected the same number of computer companies to recruit students, although he believed they would hire fewer this year than they have in the past. ''The number of firms visiting us is the same, but many of the firms will be taking fewer students this year,'' he said. **********Mr. Weatherall does not believe there has been any decline in the demand for students with expertise in computer science or computer-related fields, and in fact said that ''The fields they want to hire in keeps getting wider.'' For example, in 1983 one-third of the school's mechanical engineers were hired by electronics industries to design automated equipment. He said that semiconductor companies were hiring chemical engineers to refine the chemical process used to make silicon chips, and metallurgists and others with expertise in materials to work with silicon, as well as the usual complement of computer-science majors. **********Lynn Boone, the staffing manager for Intel, said that despite her company's layoffs last month, she would be hiring more computer scientists, electrical engineers, chemical engineers and other workers with backgrounds in microprocessors. ''We're not hiring at the rates we had in the past,'' she said. ''But you have to always make sure that you have that new influx of people coming into the company.'' She also said that with the increasing competition from automated factories in Asia, ''the kind of mechanical engineer would probably be more advanced in automation than the kind of mechanical engineer we hired 5 or 10 years ago.'' Intel has a number of offshore production and chip-testing plants, and the company is now building its first highly automated facility in Arizona. **********LEWIS H. YOUNG, the president of the Diebold Group Inc., a New York consulting concern that specializes in computers and telecommunications, said the company's 1984 study of computer activity in Fortune 500 companies showed that the demand for telecommunications specialists had increased, but the demand for other types of computer specialists, like programmers, had slackened. ''What's happening these days is that even the biggest users are buying packaged software so that you don't want programmers,'' he said. ''What you need are people who can act as consultants'' to the company's employees who are using that software. **********Mr. Young said that the hottest computer-related field these days is in artificial intelligence, in which program processes are developed that allow a computer to reason in the same way humans do in an effort to make better decisions about any given subject. To do that, the programmer must first understand the steps a human expert would follow in answering the question and then write a program directing the computer to follow those same rules. **********''If you studied this in college, majored in computer science and graduated last June with this skill, you would have been offered between $90,000 and $110,000 a year,'' Mr. Young said. ''Virtually everybody I know who is interested in doing something on artificial intelligence is looking for these people. They're as scarce as hen's teeth.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/22/business/futures-options-brokerage-fall-hurts-innocents.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Volume Investors, a respected commodity brokerage house, collapsed because several of its customers, who had sold a huge amount of gold short, were ruined that day by an extraordinary rise in the price of bullion. **********What has roiled the commodity trade since then was not so much the collapse of the brokerage house, which is not uncommon in that trade, but the plight of the ''innocent customers'' of the failed brokerage house. One such customer is Bob Wilson, who heads a bank and agricultural business in Wilson, Ark., and whose $225,000 of margin funds were frozen along with Volume Investors' other accounts. **********''Ours is a bizarre story because we had nothing to do with the Comex, or its gold futures or options market,'' Mr. Wilson said in a telephne interview Friday. ''We normally use the Chicago Board of Trade's grain and soybean futures markets to hedge our crop purchases and sales. Volume Investors had a good reputation in farm crop hedging and that's why we also opened an account with them.'' **********But before Mr. Wilson and his associates could put on any soybean, cotton or other hedges for the season, Volume Investors went under and he found his funds frozen by the Comex's clearinghouse. **********''We always knew that the much publicized segregation of funds by brokers is an industry myth, and that when you do business with anyone you, in effect, become that person's partner,'' Mr Wilson said. ''What we can't understand is why the Comex's clearinghouse didn't take the 'innocent' accounts and transfer them to other brokers, which has been the practice in the past when a broker fails. Above all, how could any futures exchange let such a mess happen.'' **********The ''mess'' came about when several traders on New York's Commodity Exchange who cleared their business through Volume Investors sold 13,000 ''naked'' gold options calls, which was the same as selling short 1.3 million ounces of gold they did not own in the hope that the price of gold would not rise. **********For options buyers, the purchase of a call represents the right to buy the underlying commodity at a fixed price within a specified time. The purchase of a put gives the buyer the right to sell the goods under the same terms. In either case, options buyers need not exercise their rights. The cost of the option is known as the premium, and buyers are limited to the premium paid. **********But for those who sell options, also known as grantors or writers, the reverse is the case. When they write a call, they are, in effect, selling the underlying commodity short; when they grant a put, they are going long in the particular market. And the risk taken by options sellers is theoretically unlimited. **********Yet, for more than a year, traders who sold option puts had profited handsomely because bullion prices declined throughout 1984, and thus few buyers of call options had occasion to exercise them profitably. On March 19, when the large short options positions were well known among Comex's gold traders, a sudden flurry of buying sent gold up as much as $39 an ounce. Volume Investors's three major gold options writers were wiped out and declared bankruptcy. Volume Investors could not cover their clients' obligations, and the Comex clearinghouse immediately seized and froze all the brokerage house's accounts. **********What concerns Mr. Wilson and others in his situation is whether they will ever see their margin and other funds held by Volume Investors. How much they recover depends on Comex's clearinghouse, which has dug into its funds, raised member clearing fees to $2.50 a trade, from $1.50, and also obtained a short-term loan from the Chemical Bank to assure that all Comex's gold options would be honored. **********The prime functions of an exchange clearing entity is to guarantee the transfer of the debits and credits of its members. Although clearing systems vary among the exchanges, all require their broker members to stand behind every trade made by their individual customers. Clearing officers are not concerned about the problems brokers may have in collecting debts from customers. **********At the Comex, only 68 of its 951 full members qualify as ''clearing members.'' Most of them are the prominent Wall Street brokerage houses. The other Comex members clear their business through them. Above all, the fees received by an exchange's clearing member for handling the paperwork of others can be rewarding, especially since computers have made this task simpler. **********''No one is happy with the Comex situation because it has exposed the Achilles' heel of all futures and options exchanges,'' said John S. Stoppelman, partner in the Washington law firm of Stoppelman, Rosen, Eaton & DeMartino, and a specialist in commodity regulation. ''The Comex problem has also alerted regulators here in Washington.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/23/world/around-the-world-5-in-india-reported-to-recant-confessions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  5 in India Reported To Recant Confessions", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   5 in India Reported To Recant Confessions", "body_text": " **********Five suspects in India's espionage scandal were reported to have retracted their confessions today, charging they were tortured into making them. **********The Press Trust of India said all 17 Government officials and businessmen arrested since the scandal started a month ago appeared before a magistrate today and were ordered held until March 6. **********The news agency said S.

The previous record had been the $450 million that the Hearst Corporation agreed last week to pay to Rupert Murdoch and Marvin Davis for WCVB-TV in Boston, which is part of a package of seven stations that Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Davis are buying from Metromedia Inc. **********The Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News and WPIX-TV in New York, is buying KTLA from a group led by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, a New York investment concern. The group acquired the station two years ago for $245 million in a leveraged buyout that included KTLA's management. **********The proposed deal comes at a time of upheaval in the ownership of media properties, including a buyout of the American Broadcasting Companies by Capital Cities Communications Inc., a hostile takeover bid for CBS Inc. by Ted Turner, the cable television entrepreneur, and the purchase by Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Davis of Metromedia's stations. **********Analysts attributed the soaring prices and the rash of acquisitions to the generally high profitability and growth prospects of broadcasting concerns, the prestige and visibility of owning television outlets and loosened Federal regulations on how many stations a company can own. Since April 2, the Federal rules have allowed a single entity to own as many as 12 television stations, 12 AM radio stations and 12 FM stations, up from 7 of each previously. **********Top Three Markets **********The purchase of KTLA would give the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based publishing and broadcasting concern, ownership of independent television stations in each of the nation's three largest markets - New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The Los Angeles station ''fills the missing link we've had in our operations,'' said John Madigan, the Tribune Company's executive vice president. **********The company said the acquisition would make its broadcasting operation the industry's fourth largest in terms of revenue and fifth largest in potential audience, reaching 19.6 percent of the nation's households. **********The sale of KTLA, along with the Murdoch-Davis purchase of Metromedia's independent stations, underscores the increasing attention being given to stations not affiliated with one of the three major broadcast networks, analysts said. **********Original Programming **********Gaining access to high-quality programming at a reasonable cost enables independent stations to be more competitive with the network-affiliated stations, analysts said. The Tribune Company already produces original programming, and the purchase of KTLA includes additional production facilities. **********Besides WPIX in New York and WGN in Chicago, the company owns independent TV stations in Atlanta, New Orleans and Denver. In addition, it owns The Chicago Tribune, The Daily News of Los Angeles and other newspapers, 5 radio stations, 15 cable television systems and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. **********''It's a high price, but the Tribune Company knew that they had to pay it in order to get it,'' said Howard Stark, a television-station broker, of the Los Angeles purchase. **********Mr. Stark said KTLA has been the leading independent station in Los Angeles, but that it is coming under increasing competition from two other independents. **********May Have to Sell Paper **********The purchase, which is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission, will probably require the sale of The Daily News of Los Angeles and two cable systems near Los Angeles to meet F.C.C. limits on cross-ownership of media properties.

The company acknowledged that the acquisition would reduce 1986 earnings by 10 to 15 percent. **********Cash Flow **********Scott Smith, vice president for finance of Tribune's broadcasting division, said that KTLA has projected revenues for this year of about $100 million and operating cash flow in ''the upper 30's'' of millions of dollars, indicating a purchase price of 13 to 14 times cash flow. **********Analysts noted that those multiples were slightly higher than the 9 to 11 times cash flow that independent stations have historically commanded, but that it was lower than the estimated 15 times cash flow that Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Davis paid for the Metromedia stations. Those stations, however, are considered to be undermanaged and have greater potential for earnings growth. **********The other bidders for KTLA were reportedly Cox Enterprises, based in Atlanta, and the Gaylord Broadcasting Company, based in Oklahoma City. The station's owners had hired Morgan Stanley & Company to conduct an auction of the property in early March after receiving several unsolicited offers that were surprisingly high, according to sources close to the transaction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/27/world/segregated-south-africa-changes-have-been-few.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 362, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEGREGATED SOUTH AFRICA: CHANGES HAVE BEEN FEW", "print_headline": "SEGREGATED SOUTH AFRICA: CHANGES HAVE BEEN FEW", "body_text": " **********Although some forms of racial segregation have been eased in South Africa, as President Reagan noted in an interview made public today, there is still widespread segregation in many areas, enforced by law. **********One law, the Group Areas Act, delineates the areas where people of each racial group - black, white, Indian and mixed race -may live. **********Buses are segregated in most cities.

Students are asked to study a corporation and come up with ideas about what should be done to improve its prospects. What follows below is a variation on that approach. The company under examination is the Miller Brewing Company of Milwaukee. The recommendations come from a variety of concerned voices. **********Miller High Life is not experiencing the good life these days. The beer is in trouble. Once the nation's No. 2 beer, it has tumbled to the third position in an industry where downturns are usually irreversible. Sales have eroded - from 23 million barrels in 1981 to 14 million in 1984, and even fewer barrels are expected to be sold this year. Market share has fallen from a high of 13 percent in 1980 to 7 percent today. All this leaves Miller executives in the unenviable position of having to revitalize a faltering flagship product. **********It isn't only Miller High Life that is ailing. So is the industry. Concern with physical fitness and dieting has flattened beer sales to the core audience of 18-to-49-year-olds. Industry sales have stagnated at slightly over 180 million barrels a year since the start of the 1980's, and the number of breweries continues to shrink. In 1970, there were 93 breweries in America. Today, there are only 43, reflecting the demise of some smaller brewers and mergers and sales of many others. **********And Miller High Life has been hurt, in particular, by arch-rival Budweiser. Much of Miller's initial growth came while Anheuser-Busch, maker of Bud, was on strike in 1976. But, once that strike ended, Bud steamrollered its competition with a sophisticated ad blitz that increased Bud's market dominance. Bud now accounts for about 25 percent of all beer sales, and manages to grow handsomely each year while the industry declines. Imports, too, are taking their toll. Though still modest, imported beers have grown by about 16 percent annually to take some 4 percent of the market. **********To remedy High Life's problems, Miller has turned to advertising and has just begun a $55 million campaign from J. Walter Thompson USA that is filling the airwaves with the theme: ''Miller - Made the American Way.'' The new campaign comes after a seven-month search to replace its former agency, Backer & Spielvogel, after the brewer decided that its traditional ''Miller Time'' campaign had become dated. ''Miller Time'' - which showed hard-working men rewarding themselves with a High Life at the end of the day - made advertising history 10 years ago and brought about High Life's best years. The new campaign takes a different tack and stresses such traditional American virtues as honesty and integrity, and by inference, assigns those same values to High Life and the people who drink it. **********The campaign is of critical importance to Miller. While sales of its Miller Lite product have been skyrocketing - Lite's 18.1 million barrels sold in 1984 put it in the No. 2 position with about 10 percent market share - High Life is of paramount importance to Miller. High Life still represents about half the company, and its troubles have slowed Miller's performance. Operating profit margins shrank to a meager 4 percent last year from a healthier 7.8 percent the year before. **********Miller has a huge investment in High Life, and should the beer falter, the company would have to slash production and become a far smaller concern than it is today. The marketing might of Philip Morris **********, **********which acquired the brewer in 1970, has helped Miller introduce several new beers - low-alcohol Sharp LA, low-priced Meister Brau and Milwaukee's Best, and high- priced Lowenbrau. But these beers still account for only about 5 million barrels a year and cannot be relied on to offset High Life's losses. **********Nor can Miller hope to gain much through cheapening the product: The sad saga of Schlitz, which never recovered after trying to cut costs by temporarily tampering with the brewing process in 1974, has become an industry legend. **********Miller traces its history back to 1855 when it was founded in Milwaukee by German brewmaster Frederic Miller. The sleepy brewery was run by the Miller family for over 100 years before it was sold to tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris. From then on, neither Miller nor the beer industry was ever the same. **********Philip Morris pumped millions into promoting Miller, raising the stakes in the industry and, in the late 1970's, turning High Life into America's second most popular beer. The beer that was once billed as ''The Champagne of Bottled Beer'' was taken from the champagne bucket and put into America's lunch bucket. And Philip Morris further shook up the industry by introducing Miller Lite, the first successful low- calorie beer. The ''Miller Time'' ads put High Life on the map and the Lite commercials, featuring burly athletes, made America laugh, and buy Lite. **********Things began to unravel for High Life in the early 1980's. The company pushed through a price rise, just as the recession hit. High Life's loyal blue-collar following fled to cheaper beers, and many never returned. After spending $1.2 billion on a building spree to increase capacity to 54 million barrels, Miller found that as demand fell, so did production. **********Last year, Miller's plants operated at only 69.4 percent of capacity - compared to rival Anheuser- Busch, whose 66.5-million-barrel operation ran at 90 percent of capacity. Miller was even forced to take a $140 million after-tax write- down in 1984 on a spanking new $450 million, 8.5-million-barrel brewery in Trenton, Ohio, that it built but never used. **********This overcapacity has pushed down Miller's financial performance - Miller earns $2.93 for every barrel sold, compared to more than $5-a-barrel profit for Anheuser- Busch. In 1984, Miller had an operating profit of about $116 million on revenues of $2.9 billion. **********Miller has its task cut out. It must win a bigger part of a shrinking market that is increasingly dominated by only two players, Anheuser-Busch and Miller. It cannot expect to pick up volume through industry growth. ''Since the beer industry in total is not growing,'' said Alan G. Easton, Miller's vice president for corporate affairs, ''the market battle is for market share.'' **********And that is a battle for the beer drinker. Beer is still a male beverage. Of those who drink it, 65 percent are men and 35 percent are women. But men represent the biggest volume, consuming about 85 percent of all beer sold. And some 20 percent of all male drinkers consume about 70 percent of the product. About two-thirds of all beer sold is drunk in the home, with women doing the buying - but men selecting the brand. Miller's new ''Made - The American Way'' campaign has a solid male tone: an upbeat anthem to American virtues as portrayed by men relishing each other's company and sharing a High Life. It's a far cry from Miller's campaign at the turn of the century, which showed a man offering a beer to a woman while the two of them romantically paddled a canoe in the moonlight. The question facing Miller now is - will this work? And, even more fundamental to Miller's future is the more troubling question: What to do if it doesn't? **********FIVE OUTSIDE VOICES TELL MILLER WHAT TO DO **********BURT MANNING, CHAIRMAN, J. WALTER THOMPSON USA, NEW YORK **********People don't always drink the beer; they drink the advertising. **********The brand selected by beer drinkers is in some ways a badge. People tend to associate certain characteristics with a brand, and that becomes their statement to the world: This is what I believe. This is my badge. When you see me drinking this beer, this is something you know about me. **********Miller is one of the oldest breweries in America, and the man who founded it said a lot of things about quality, integrity, honesty, purity and other things we see as part of the resurgence of American values. **********If we are correct, and we have a lot of research to back us up, there is a lot of confidence and pride in having those traditional characteristics - especially among the people most important to Miller, men and women in their mid-20's and a little older. **********And Miller says all that. The man who drinks it says, ''Here is my badge.'' These ads show some of those good things about this country, and through non-rational integration it comes out as ''Hey, I think I'm going to try some Miller.'' **********If this campaign works, it will not be because of a simple-minded association with America. That stuff doesn't work. We're dealing with a personality and a brewing tradition at Miller. We've worked long and hard on this campaign, and anyone else will have a hard time trying to capture its quality in a credible way. Besides, copying is not an American virtue. A copy cat is seen as a copy cat - and I don't think that beer drinkers would think that was so great. **********People really, really associate advertising and the beer they drink very closely. If they feel good and strong and involved in the advertising, they like that beer and they get involved in it. **********The real market for beer, the great expertise is seen at the basic grass-roots level. People in health clubs and out jogging take the cue on what is good beer from grass-roots America - the skilled man, the craftsman. He is seen as the real expert. This is the choice of people we are portraying, and through them, we make an appeal to other groups. **********We'd be delighted to see the first 30-day reports on Miller sales go through the roof. But, in general, this is a long term proposition. We expect it would be a 6-to-12 month process before the ads begin to affect people's attitudes. **********It will work. We simply don't go into campaigns with the idea that it won't work. **********TOM KELLY, BARTENDER, MUMBLES RESTAURANT, NEW YORK **********I find that few bars carry Miller High Life. When people come to our bar and say Miller, they mean a Miller Lite. They order Miller Lite a lot, but Miller High Life they don't. **********I don't know why so few bars carry High Life. I guess when the boss sees one beer is not moving, he'll move it out and get another. Right now, our big ones are Miller Lite and Bud. **********Bud's got a good taste. I think the whole country has heard about Bud. They've cornered the market. It's like the Yankees and apple pie. Bud is national. **********I've been bartending 16 years, and personally, I think High Life is very bland. It has no significance at all. No character. It's a little watery. And the Miller Time commercials, they're bland too. Especially when you see the other ones, the Miller Lite commercials. They've got spunk and some creative entertainment to them. They have Rodney Dangerfield, who can make the whole country laugh on Johnny Carson. He'll make you laugh, and you keep that on your mind and order a Miller Lite. **********People who come in here are very weight- conscious. They're into jogging. People come in here after running and they'll have a Miller Lite. They feel that they're owed a beer, but why run and then put a heavy beer into you. **********Miller's got to do something earthshaking with High Life. I don't know what, 'cause if I did, I guess I'd be working on Madison Avenue instead. **********EMANUEL GOLDMAN, ANALYST, MONTGOMERY SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO **********The beer consumer is a very unforgiving animal. Once a brand has lost its luster, it's hard to shine it up again. There's peer pressure in beer. You're making a statement about yourself. **********It is particularly hard to turn around a brand undergoing an accelerating erosion. In the history of the brewing industry, it hasn't been done. Bookmakers in London or Las Vegas, in making book, would say that High Life won't be able to turn and give you points besides. **********But Miller doesn't have to turn High Life around to be successful. It just has to diminish the rate of erosion to able. The 18 percent decline last year and the 15 percent the year before are unacceptable rates of erosion. If you can dampen that to 3 to 5 percent, you can make some good money on the brand for a long time. **********If they don't stem that rate of erosion, they will have big problems. If you give it your best shot and it doesn't work, what do you do? That becomes much more difficult. Then you may have to start discounting the price or accelerating new product development. **********I saw the commercials. Do they knock your socks off? Even if your socks have lost their elastic, I don't think they will knock them off. Now, will it work? I don't know. Maybe it will. That's the thing in advertising. You don't know what it will do until after the fact. **********HAROLD H. BEONING, MILLER DISTRIBUTOR, LONG ISLAND **********It's not going to turn around overnight. The new campaign is tremendously upbeat, but it will take time. We had a meeting of 4,000 distributors in Chicago last week and the response was tremendous enthusiasm. **********Look at the last election and see how people respond to upbeat things. One candidate talked about how bad things were, and the other about how good they were. Miller used that thinking. We distributors are as competitive as hell with Anheuser and we enjoy the competition. We feel we can match them toe-to-toe distribution-wise. I think the Miller guys work harder. But right now, the key right now is the advertising, and I really believe that in my heart. **********Miller is an older beer than Bud, but you may not realize that because those Bud horses have been around forever. What's good about Miller is the clear white bottle. I tell my bartenders they can see when the bottle is empty and get another to the customer. They can push more goods that way. **********Beer is a fascinating business. It needs change sometimes. It needs enthusiasm among its sales people and I think that quality message will come through. It's a broad campaign and it will work. I feel confident they will turn it around, I'm putting money on it. **********MARK ALBION, PROFESSOR, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL, BOSTON **********There have been tremendous shifts among traditional beer drinkers in the 21-to-35 age category. They've become more health and nutrition conscious. Many of them have switched to wine.The three- martini lunch has given way to the 30- minute workout. This is the grazing society, the people on the go. Miller has to get aligned with them. But Miller is still in the lunch bucket while America is in the health clubs. **********You are talking about an industry where the consumer moves around and you have to make the product stand out - a distinctive brand image. That's the name of the game. Tell me what a Miller High Life is. You can't. **********The new commercials are plain vanilla. They do a nice job of tapping into the American values. So is everyone else. The commercial I saw was no big deal. They're playing the value of ''made in America.'' Bruce Springsteen established it earlier and it is so easy to copy. Bud is already saying ''Here's to You, America.'' **********Miller has to take a chance and start something new. They've got to target two groups: new users and switchers.

The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said the President's decision means ''the ball game is over.'' **********The stalemate over the budget deficit is likely to make the United States increasingly dependent on the inflow of capital from abroad as a means of providing enough national savings to finance this country's rapidly growing debt. In his recent testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said he was worried about the mounting cost of servicing the nation's rising debt, which would soon make the United States the world's biggest debtor. But he said he saw no practical way to increase domestic savings enough to obviate the need for heavy borrowing abroad. **********Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. asked Mr. Volcker whether there was any parallel to the piling up of debt by the Government, business and consumers. The Fed chairman replied, ''There is none.'' Senator Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, then said: ''It seems to me that we are putting ourselves in a highly vulnerable condition financially, and to say that the trade deficit in any manner of speaking helps us, I think, is just wrong thinking. I think what it's doing is masking the problem.'' **********''I accept your interpretation that we're masking the problem,'' said Mr. Volcker.

Or is the price one pays for a free society based on the principle of self-interest? From the days of Adam Smith on, many economists and political philosophers have contended that the hidden strength of capitalism is that it receives a powerful thrust from the pursuit of self-interest and does not rely on public spirit. In a famous essay, ''What Does the Economist Economize?'' the late British economist Dennis Robertson said the capitalist system economizes on ''love,'' a term he used to represent civic spirit, morality, benevolence and a concern for the well-being of others, all of which were virtues in very short supply. **********But in an article in the first issue of a new journal, Economics and Philosophy, published by the Cambridge University Press, Albert O. Hirschman of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton argues that ''love,'' or civic spirit, is not a scarce resource that shrinks with use. Rather, he says, public spirit will atrophy if it is not used enough. **********''The less the requirements of the social order for public spirit,'' says Professor Hirschman, ''the more the supply of public spirit dries up.'' **********This is a danger that goes far beyond the current stalemate over the budget deficit and taxes. It extends to such areas as the overcharging of the public by General Dynamics and other military contractors, the concealment of huge financial transfers abroad by the Bank of Boston and the guilty plea by E. F. Hutton, the brokerage firm, to 2,000 charges of fraud as well as gambling, tax evasion and growth of the underground economy. **********Without love, benevolence and social concern to hold the society together, the pursuit of self-interest runs riot - and in increasingly dangerous directions. Civic spirit may atrophy if used too little, but it may be destructive if relied on too much. The two danger zones, says Mr. Hirschman, correspond roughly to the complementary ills of today's capitalist and centrally planned societies. **********The danger zones are not stable: An administration that in wartime or other time of stress may call forth the greatest efforts of its people in the name of the common good may be well advised to appeal more to private interest in less exalted times. But such a change may also give rise, as Mr. Hirschman puts it, ''to anomie and unwillingness ever to sacrifice private or group interest to the public weal, so that a move back to a more community-oriented regime would be called for.'' **********China and the Soviet Union are looking for ways to improve their economic performance by relying less on public goals and more on motivating individuals and groups to pursue their self-interest. Does the United States require a shift in the opposite direction?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/02/business/markets-closed-stock-and-commodity-markets-banks-and-government.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 14, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Closed Stock and commodity markets, banks and Government", "print_headline": "Markets Closed Stock and commodity markets, banks and Government", "body_text": " **********offices were closed yesterday **********in observance of New Year's **********Day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/08/world/incident-called-common.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Witkin", "pub_date": "1985-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Incident Called Common", "print_headline": "Incident Called Common", "body_text": " **********Aviation experts in the United States said yesterday that the off-course flight of the Japanese airliner was not unusual, and that there had been scores of similar navigation errors over the years. **********They said there was little reason for the Russians to have suspected that the stray plane might be a military craft on an espionage mission because Moscow was the announced initial destination of the J.A.L. plane. **********The Russians would have been notified it was coming although they would not have expected it to veer from the prescribed airway.

An executive vice president and general manager at Marsteller in New York at the time, Mr. Calvillo let word of his availability get out to the head-hunting fraternity and that resulted in number of propositions, including one from Nadler & Larimer, which he put at the bottom of his list. **********''It was an obscure agency and I knew nothing about it,'' he said. **********Seeing the agency's reel of commercials, however, was an eye opener for him, when he discovered the number of familiar, good ads that had emanated from the shop. **********''They have a reputation with creative people but not with advertisers or account people, and the reel told me why,'' he said. **********He talked about the wooing: ''Arch gave me a sense of the business as it was. Jim Marlas gave me a sense of how it could be. **********''I like their hands-off attitude, but I know how well they run the financial side.'' **********Nadler & Larimer, according to Mr. Calvillo, is billing about $55 million, down from a high of about $63 million a few years ago. Although there has been growth with existing clients, there were also some relatively spectacular losses, including a big piece of Faberge, which continues as the agency's biggest client. **********Mr. Calvillo feels that the agency has reached a plateau and plans to do something about it. **********Ricardo C. Calvillo is the full name. He is the son of Jose, from Barcelona, Spain, who established Calvillo Associates, a company that supplied illustrators for advertising. After graduating in 1962 from Principia College in Elsah, Ill., the son - by this time an able illustrator himself - joined the father. **********However, when the junior was named general manager and the entrepreneural and managerial juices began to flow, he realized that a management career was calling out to him. So seven years later, after studying at night at both Michigan State and Wayne State, he pulled in an M.B.A. **********About this time the Calvillo shop acquired a small ad agency, which it named Advertising Unlimited, and Calvillo the younger's education continued. But before he tried the world of the big agency he was an owner of Design Workshop, a manufacturer of disposable furniture, and an assistant professor at Michigan State. Of that latter adventure he said, ''I hated it and left after a single semister.'' **********Then came big agency time and the biggest thing in Detroit was Campbell-Ewald, which for years served the General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet account. That is the account that Ric Calvillo worked on, at least until he got the opportunity to go to Young & Rubicam's Detroit office and be an account man on Chrysler- Plymouth. **********When the agency got Chrysler's corporate advertising assignment, he got to come to New York to work on it. So he was there when the Lee A. Iacocco bomb fell and all the Chrysler assignment went to Kenyon & Eckhardt. Then Mr. Calvillo worked on the team that pitched for the Lincoln- Mercury business, and got it. **********After that he was an account supervisor for such well-known clients as Kodak, Johnson & Johnson and General Electric. **********''I loved it,'' he recalled yesterday. ''I viewed it as an extension of college. Yet, while I loved it I was restless with the biggness of the agency.'' **********In 1982 he communicated with top management his desire to run a business rather than only an account.

Moreover, the mere presence of 84 North Koreans in the South Korean capital - 34 Red Cross officials and 50 journalists - was itself a landmark event. **********Not only was it the first such delegation here since similar talks under Red Cross sponsorship collapsed in 1973, but it also was the largest contingent of any kind to visit Seoul from North Korea since its troops swept across the South at the start of the Korean War in 1950. **********The two sides have scheduled two days of discussions, with the North Koreans due to return home on Thursday. **********Since the arrival of the North Koreans on Monday, both Koreas have seemed intent on gaining a psychological edge whenever possible. Squabbles, for example, broke out over technical arrangements for North Korean reporters and over South Korean sightseeing plans clearly intended to show off the country's accomplishments. **********North Koreans Cancel a Tour **********The North Koreans canceled a city tour that their hosts had arranged, including a stop at the sports complex where Seoul will hold the Olympic Games in 1988. The visitors gave no reason, but it appeared that they did not want to do anything that might be interpreted as lending support to the Seoul Olympics, a prize deeply valued by the South Korean Government. **********On Monday night, the South Koreans scheduled what was billed as a ''cultural film presentation.'' This turned out to be a movie about the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, which were boycotted by North Korea and other Communist countries. The North Korean delegation refused to attend the screening. **********In the last 17 months, the bitterly divided Koreas have had more direct contact than at any other time in the last decade. Their discussions have moved at a stutter-start pace, and progress has been difficult to measure, but foreign diplomats here are encouraged that there has been even a willingness to meet. **********Talks Go on Two Tracks **********The talks have followed two tracks -economic matters and humanitarian issues. **********On May 17, at Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, negotiators discussed possible trade and economic cooperation, but agreed only to meet again in June. **********The Red Cross talks are essentially picking up where they broke off 12 years ago, with the two sides saying that long-separated families should be reunited, but with neither moving beyond an agenda set in 1973. Unlike the situation with East and West Germany, the Koreas have not permitted any contact between such families, not even letters. **********On Monday morning, amid a surge of camera crews and security agents, delegates from the North crossed into the South at Panmunjom. They were greeted by their South Korean counterparts and driven in 20 limousines and buses to Seoul, 35 miles away. **********The delegates were taken to the Sheraton Walker Hill, a Las Vegas-style hotel far from downtown Seoul."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/31/business/the-revival-of-us-exports.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1062, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE REVIVAL OF U.S. EXPORTS", "print_headline": "THE REVIVAL OF U.S. EXPORTS", "body_text": " **********Amid the nation's economic anxiety about becoming uncompetitive in world markets - a fear intensified by the $123 billion trade deficit reported yesterday for 1984 - the good news is that American exports are rising again after a two-year pause. **********Especially in high technology, American companies showed that they could overcome the adverse price effects of a rising dollar, and still sell more products abroad. Exports rose 8.7 percent last year, although imports outstripped them by jumping 26.4 percent and producing the record trade gap. **********Troubled exporters, such as the Caterpillar Tractor Company of Peoria, Ill., which have had to slash employment because of faltering sales and mounting losses, get most of the attention. But other sectors are booming: computer exports, for example, rose about 28 percent last year and broadcasting apparatus soared 20 percent. **********Still Below 1981 Peak **********To be sure, the resurgence in exports comes after a substantial dip in 1982 and 1983, and total exports are still below their peak in 1981. And some companies are maintaining their sales abroad at a cost of dwindling profitability. But it is a source of some satisfaction that foreign sales have increased despite a sharp dollar rise that has made American goods more expensive abroad. **********The dollar rise is not the only reason for the trade deficit, however. Economists typically attribute between one-third and two-thirds of the deficit to other factors, such as faster economic growth at home than abroad. Moreover, it is often said that some traditional sectors of the American economy are no longer competitive abroad, even aside from exchange rate issues - though the companies involved dispute this. **********Indeed, newer industry groups - such as producers of business machines, scientific equipment, and electronic machinery - were among the most important beneficiaries of increased exports last year. In these sectors, there often is no exact foreign equivalent of the American product, which means that they may still sell even if a rising dollar makes them somewhat more expensive. And, like other exports, they benefited from the general improvement of the world economy. **********The improvement suggests that American manufacturers have been forced to pare costs and improve efficiency, which will benefit them in the long run. But not everyone would agree this is the case. **********''People are saying this is making American business leaner and meaner,'' said Howard Lewis 3d, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. ''But it can become only so lean and so mean. After a point the patient crosses a line and is no longer mean and lean. He's dead.'' **********A Hungry Look **********Certainly some companies have a hungry look about them. Construction machinery exports are down 41 percent since 1982. Fuel exports have dropped 28.7 percent. Exports of industrial supplies are off 14 percent. **********Moreover, these figures may understate the economic pain. Many companies say they have tried to maintain market shares abroad by cutting prices. Steady exports thus may not mean steady export profits. **********''We've maintained, or in some cases increased, our tonnage'' of exports, said George D. Kennedy, president of the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, of Northbrook, Ill. ''If you look at our margins or our profitability, that's another story. We've had to cut them to make up for the strong dollar.'' **********The levitating dollar, which has risen about 60 percent over the last five years compared with most other currencies, is blamed by many exporters for their troubles. After treating its rise as an anomaly, and waiting for it to fall, many are wondering if perhaps it will stay high. Some say they may lose patience soon and move more operations abroad, where costs are lower. **********Omark Industries, for example, will decide within the next six months whether to build a factory in Europe, according to the company's director of planning, Donald Pope. There Omark, a manufacturer of chains for chain saws that is based in Portland, Ore., might compete on a more equal footing with its principal rival, the German company Stihl, he said. **********Even the most diligent cost-cutting sometimes cannot remove the impact of the rising dollar. This is especially so in the case of goods, such as commodities, that have little product differentiation. **********''I think wheat and timber are hurting more,'' said Dean D. Thornton, a senior vice president of the Boeing Company, ''because wheat from Argentina is just as good as our wheat, and a log from Canada is just as good as a log from Oregon.'' In contrast, a plane from Boeing is substantially different from a plane from Airbus Industrie in Europe. **********Price is relevant in choosing between an Airbus and a Boeing, but there are many other factors as well. Boeings are chosen, he said, because of a technological edge, and a support program after the planes are sold. **********Quality Is Important **********The same is true, to some extent, of electronics. Price often matters less than quality and capabilities, especially in state-of-the-art equipment. **********''We've got a lot of export problems,'' said William K. Krist, director of international trade of the American Electronics Association. ''I don't think the high dollar is one of the biggest.'' He said that trade barriers abroad and domestic export restrictions for supposedly sensitive equipment were more of a problem. **********These disparities suggest to some economists that America's future export mix will include more high-technology goods and more services, but fewer basic goods, such as commodities and machinery. Agricultural exports - traditionally a mainstay - showed some growth in 1984, but remain weak. That weakness is one reason why some say the farm economy is in its worst shape in 50 years. **********Michael W. Keran, chief economist of the Prudential Insurance Company of America, said service exports - such as banking and restaurants - would thrive, as would exports of ''knowledge intensive'' goods. **********But some experts reject the notion that high technology is doing much better than traditional exports. ''It's a myth that the exchange rate doesn't matter for hi-tech,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It matters a lot.'' **********Mr. Bergsten noted that although high-technology companies had increased their exports, they were also fighting a flood of new imports, so the overall trade balance in high-technology areas had deteriorated sharply as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/22/world/poland-said-to-arrest-clandestine-publisher.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poland Said to Arrest Clandestine Publisher", "print_headline": "Poland Said to Arrest Clandestine Publisher", "body_text": " **********The fugitive director of a major underground publishing house has been captured by the police and led off to detention with his head wrapped in a bloody hood, according to sources close to the outlawed Solidarity movement. **********The arrest of the man, Maciej Polewski, has not been announced by the authorities. **********The Solidarity sympathizers reported that he was seized April 13 as he visited with his children in a Warsaw apartment.

They watched with bewilderment as five Lubavitcher rabbis linked arms, sang and danced in front of the wooden altar upon which an etching of Maimonides hung. **********Rabbi Hecht, who was sent from Brooklyn to Israel eight years ago, said he and several other Lubavitchers had spent the last year memorizing three chapters a day of the ''Mishneh Torah,'' which they finished on the Rambam's birthday. **********Only the first stage of the synagogue's restoration has been completed, and Egyptian Jews said they doubted it would ever be fully repaired, given Egypt's diminishing numbers of Jews. Once 100,000 strong, their numbers have dwindled to no more than 250. **********The small synagogue, closed after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has no roof; it collapsed in the early 1970's. The marble bimah, from which services were read, remains broken and cracked. **********Only Five Remain **********At the turn of the century there were 5,000 Jews and 10 synagogues in the Haret El-Yuhud, or Jewish quarter of Cairo. Now only five Jews remain; the synagogues are all in disrepair, some barely identifiable as former places of worship. **********The quarter is inhabited mostly by Moslems, Egyptian peasants from the countryside. But there are remnants of the old community: every now and then a Star of David can be seen above an old, scarred wooden door. **********The ceremony was an event in the neighborhood. Curious children clustered around the visitors, giggling, pointing the way to the synagogue. **********Asher Almagor, a visiting scholar at the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, virtually the only Israeli cultural institution to take root here in the wake of the Camp David peace treaty, was deeply moved by the ceremony. But he argued later that the ceremony had been misplaced. **********Disagreement Over Synagogue **********Mr. Almagor argues that the Rambam - an acryonym for the Rabbi Moses ben Maimon - complained in writing about the distance he had to travel between his synagogue and the palace, where he was physician to the Moslem ruler Saladin. **********''He said it was two miles away from his home and took him an hour each way,'' Mr. Almagor said. The distance corresponds to that between Saladin's palace and an area known as Fustat, or Old Cairo, not the Jewish quarter. **********Mr. Almagor has concluded that the Rambam's synagogue was Ben Ezra, in Fustat, believed to be the oldest synagogue in Egypt. Many of the Rambam's remarkable writings were found there. **********Wrote a Study on Asthma **********As a doctor, Maimonides wrote one of the first definitive studies of asthma and a treatise on blood circulation. **********As a philosopher, he was primarily an Aristotelian, one who expressed a profound respect for Greco-Arabic tradition. He was above all, an ''ethical pragmatist,'' as a biographer, Fred Gladstone Bratton, described him, a man who insisted on intelligence in religion. **********His determination to reconcile the study of science, the arts and philosophy with the teachings of Judaism fueled a debate in Jewish circles after his death that continued for more than a century. **********But to the Egyptian Jews at the ceremony Sunday, Maimonides was ''the doctor,'' a healer for the ill of all religions. **********''My grandmother told me that once her friend was ill, and she brought her here, near the cave where he was buried,'' Mimi Rossano said. ''She put a little oil on her friend's stomach, and the woman was cured. **********''Just a dream of the Rambam could make you well,'' she said, speaking of Maimonides as if he were her neighbor. **********''You are scholars and know great things about him,'' she said. ''I'm just a simple person, and we know simple things.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/28/world/arafat-is-reported-ill-and-in-need-of-rest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Is Reported Ill And in Need of Rest", "print_headline": "Arafat Is Reported Ill And in Need of Rest", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, is recovering from an illness, and his doctor said he required ''many days of rest,'' according to the Palestinian press agency Wafa. **********The agency was quoting Dr. Ashraf al-Kordi.

It is assuming the form of interactive video, and the concept behind it may well resuscitate what several years ago appeared to be a losing technology: the video disk player. **********That machine, as many recall, lost out to the ever-more-popular video cassette recorders in the home market for showing movies. The reason: Why purchase something that only could play a movie when you could get a machine that could record one as well. **********But there is one thing the video disk players can do that the VCR's cannot. They can be ''read'' by a computer in the same way as a floppy disk. And that opens up a new arena for computer training - and for overcoming computerphobia. By letting the trainee learn about the computer via a ''show'' on his computer TV screen - certainly an unthreatening, familiar medium -the instructions themselves may be more palatable. **********Thus, video disks are an incredible boon to companies using personal computers. In addition, they can be used to store data, and the data can be accessed randomly, a little here, a little there, as needed. In addition, the optical storage principles employed by video disks permit far more data to be kept on one disk than on even the most dense of floppies. ALTHOUGH the promise of video disks is as yet unfulfilled and will probably remain so for another couple of years, interactive video tutorials, which couple a video disk player and a personal computer, have arrived. The symbiotic combination of the personal computer and the video disk player not only offers one of the best ways to train computer users, but opens up a whole new future for employee training in fields from accounting to automobile repair to remote medical training and treatment. **********The benefits to be gained from interactive video training are now limited primarily to larger corporations that can afford to dedicate at least one personal computer to full-time training. In addition to the cost of the computer, a company must bear the expense of a special color monitor-television, as well as that of the disk player and a dedicated interface. **********Typical of the packages now on the market that incorporate all the necessary components of video disk instruction is the set available from Active Learning Systems (Minneapolis, 55409, (612) 922-0672). The hardware package sells for $2,500, or can be leased at $395 a month. The software-video disk combination rents for $99 a month or $990 a year per program. **********Among the tutorial offerings available from Active Learning is PC Mentor, a very basic guide to the rudimentary operation of a personal computer. The program includes such tasks as using the keyboard, moving the cursor, using the ''end'' and ''home'' keys and incorporating tab functions. **********After viewing PC Mentor, I first thought it was a waste of computer power. Here was a sophisticated video show, albeit with a polyestered used-car salesman as on screen spokesman, covering material so elementary that only someone who had never touched a personal computer could possibly profit from it. **********On a little reflection, however, I decided that this is precisely what is needed for most people. For a large company with a steady flow of employees at the training level, the program could be quite useful. There would always be someone who would benefit from the tutorial - and it could represent the difference between acceptance and rebellion toward a computer. **********Active Learning Systems tells of a bank president who sat down to try out the PC Mentor tutorial program during one of the company's workshops. The tutorial contains a very simple maze through which a student guides the cursor, all the while becoming more familiar with the concept of cursor keys. On a scale of sophistication, Pac-Man would be 9 and the maze 2. Yet the bank president spent some 10 minutes scooting the cursor around. When asked why he spent so long on such a simple exercise, tioned about his enthusiasm, the company said he replied, ''It's the first time I have ever controlled a computer, rather than the computer controlling me.'' ON a more complex level than PC Mentor is Active Learning's Lotus 1-2-3 tutorial. Again the program does not attempt to cover everything one might want to know about the subject. But with the tutorial video disk, the user is taken through a quite helpful introduction to this spreadsheet program. **********The image of a pair of hands on screen activates the pictorial keyboard, and the spreadsheet displayed above it responds. Then the user is given the opportunity to run through the routines of maneuvering the cursor to various locations on the spreadsheet grid and entering data. **********I found some of the interactions between man and machine a bit inflexible and inhibiting to exploration. For instance, after pressing the ''Page Down'' key to make the cursor take a 20-column leap, I would have liked to practice the maneuver a few times more, out of natural curiosity and to gain more of a feel for these giant steps. But the program would not let me repeat the process. Pressing the ''Page Down'' or any other key more than the dictated number of times produces nothing, not even an error message. **********The multiple-choice questions posed by this Lotus tutorial also seem a trifle simple, their answers so obvious that a friend unfamiliar with spreadsheets guessed four out of five correctly. Still, the questions are supposedly based on the company's research indicating the most common stumbling blocks found in learning to use the program. **********All in all, running through the Active Learning Systems program is like having a very patient teacher at one's side. And unlike the more common floppy-only interactive computer programs, these, with their familiar video images accompanying the lessons, help to make personal computing comfortably commonplace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/04/business/debt-crisis-seen-as-ending.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEBT CRISIS SEEN AS ENDING", "print_headline": "DEBT CRISIS SEEN AS ENDING", "body_text": " **********When Brazil and its bank creditors conclude an agreement in the next couple of weeks, as is expected, to reschedule the largest foreign debt in the developing world, the flowing champagne will celebrate not just this $45 billion deal, but also a milestone. **********For when Brazil joins the ranks of Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, the four largest debtors in the third world will have agreements to stretch out their debt payments to make them manageable. More than three- quarters of the $350 billion in Latin American debt - much of it held by large American and European banks - is accounted for by these four debtors. The agreements, coupled with improving economies in many debtor countries, suggest that although problems will remain for several years at least, the worst is over. **********''The debt crisis in its short-term, sharp manifestation is over,'' said Michel H. Bouchet, an economist with the Institute of International Finance in Washington. ''The debt difficulties are not.'' **********The atmosphere has changed markedly since this time a year ago, when the buzzwords of international finance were ''debt bomb'' and ''debt crisis,'' and some analysts were painting bleak scenarios of Latin American debtor cartels that would repudiate their foreign debts. A debtor cartel never materialized, and last year produced economic growth for Latin America after two years of sharp recession. **********Problems in Smaller Nations **********Most experts agree that henceforth the problem countries are likely to be smaller ones - such as Peru, Chile and Bolivia - that have borrowed much less and hence provoke less unease in New York banking circles. **********Other concerns do remain, however: that Argentina's economy could fall apart; that plummeting oil prices could substantially weaken such oil exporters as Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador; and that a recession in the United States and other industrialized countries could end expansion of the market for Latin American exports. **********But notwithstanding these doubts, ''it is very difficult to deny the sharp improvement that has taken place in international debt,'' said William R. Cline, a senior fellow of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. **********Moreover, although analysts agree that falling oil prices would hurt the Latin American oil producers, many say the problem is not as significant as it first appears. Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador principally produce heavy crude oil; so far, most of the deterioration in prices has been in light crude. **********A Rising Dollar Could Hurt **********A further rise in the dollar against other currencies could also hurt the debtors, who would then have to scratch together more pesos or bolivars to pay back the same amount in dollars. On the other hand, a rising dollar also makes their exports cheaper in America, and so they can sell more goods and earn more cash with which to pay their debts. **********Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, divides the debt drama into three acts. Act 1, the balance of payments difficulties of major debtors, is now over, he said. Act 2 will see the debtors try to restore order in their own economies, particularly by reducing inflation. In Act 3, which may not begin for another five years or more, Mr. de Vries expects the debtors to be able to resume normal borrowing. **********Here is the debt situation in six major Latin American countries: **********Argentina **********Hyperinflation and internal political divisions had led skeptics to conclude that a workable restructuring of Argentina's debt would be almost impossible. But Argentina and its lender banks last month did agree on a package, at the price of considerable concessions by the developing world's third-largest debtor. **********The banks agreed to provide Argentina with $3.7 billion in new loans at an interest rate of 1 1/4 percentage points above the United States prime rate, to be repaid over 10 years with a three-year grace period. An additional $500 million in trade credits will be repaid over four years at a slightly lower interest rate. **********In addition, the banks will also lengthen the terms and reduce the interest rates they charge on $13.4 billion in public and private debt maturing between 1982 and 1985. **********Brazil **********Brazilian officials and bank creditors currently meeting in New York say they have ironed out major diffences in a multiyear restructuring of about $45 billion in debt maturing between 1985 and 1991. The debt will be repayable over 16 years at a variety of interest rates. **********A few problems remain, however. They include the role of the International Monetary Fund in monitoring the Brazilian economy and restructured loans that for accounting reasons are in Brazil's central bank but may be passed on to other debtors. **********Colombia **********Colombia is the only major Latin American nation except for Paraguay still servicing its debts as originally scheduled. Although some bankers are skeptical, Colombia still says it will not need a rescheduling of public debt in 1985. **********To avoid restructuring its debt, which is $366 a person, one of the lowest figures in Latin America, Colombia says it needs about $1.2 billion in new loans in 1985 and 1986, mostly for development of coal and oil projects that will generate revenue. **********Ecuador **********The newly elected government of President Leon Febres Cordero reached a preliminary agreement late last year with creditor banks to restructure $4.3 billion falling due over the next five years. This part of Ecuador's debt will be repaid over 12 years, after a three-year grace period, and the banks will provide $350 million in fresh loans and maintain credit lines for trade of at least $700 million. The rescheduling is conditional on Ecuador meeting certain economic targets as time goes on. **********''For 1985, we're not requesting a cent from the banks,'' Francisco Swett, the Finance Minister, said in an interview after the agreement was reached. He added that although Ecuador expected its exports to pay for imports and debt service, if a shortfall developed it would borrow on its own, without going to its creditor banks for a rescheduling. **********Mexico **********Last September creditor banks reached agreement on a restructuring of $48.6 billion, roughly half of Mexico's total foreign debt. The package calls for spreading payments originally due between 1985 and 1990 over 14 years, after a 12-month grace period. The interest rate will float an average of 1.125 percent over the London interbank rate. **********Both sides had intended for the pact to be signed by the end of 1984. But an innovation - allowing banks to convert their debt into other currencies - has proved very difficult to draft in precise language. Sometime this spring, lawyers hope, everything will fall into place. **********After two years in which the economy shrank and urban workers found their wages losing 30 to 40 percent of their buying power, the Mexican economy appears to be returning to health. Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates of Philadelphia said Mexico returned to modest positive growth in 1984, and it forecast strong growth from 1985 to 1989. **********Venezuela **********One of South America's richest countries, Venezuela agreed in September on a rescheduling of $20.75 billion, equivalent to almost all of the public debt maturing between 1983 and 1988. This will be repaid over a dozen years at interest rate of 1.125 percent over the London interbank rate. **********However, registering the debt of private citizens and companies and verifying it is taking much longer than expected, and the agreement may not be implemented before summer. Venezuela last month tried to simplify the registration procedures, and officials say the process will now go much more smoothly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/business/ameron-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERON INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "AMERON INC reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/09/business/trade-gap-with-japan-is-expected-to-grow.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1985-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1035, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRADE GAP WITH JAPAN IS EXPECTED TO GROW", "print_headline": "TRADE GAP WITH JAPAN IS EXPECTED TO GROW", "body_text": " **********Despite a higher-valued yen and new moves by Japan to open its markets, the trade deficit between the United States and Japan is expected by many analysts to continue rising, sharpening frictions between the two countries. **********Trade relations have improved since open conflicts last spring over autos and telecommunications. But new clashes appear likely as Congress drafts legislation in telecommunications and other areas and as the Reagan Administration pursues its declared policy of moving aggressively against unfair trade practices. **********Only last Friday, the Commerce Department began an investigation of complaints that Japanese semiconductor producers are selling high-capacity memory chips, the building blocks for computers, at prices that Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said might be ''substantially below'' the cost of production. **********The Office of the United States Trade Representative has prepared a list of 41 products, said to include optical fiber cables and electric typewriters, in which the United States would curb Japanese access here in reprisal for Japan's refusal to open its leather market to foreign suppliers. **********Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States Trade Representative, said the leather restrictions alone are causing American exporters to lose nearly $300 million a year in foreign sales. **********In the background is the projection of many analysts that the currency changes and market-opening moves will work only to slow the growth of the trade deficit. Few see the deficit actually shrinking. **********Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass., a leading forecasting concern, sees the deficit rising at least through 1988, although at a slower pace than the nearly one-third increase this year. Data Resources projects a deficit of $46.3 billion for this year, against $37 billion in 1984. It sees a deficit of $49.5 billion in 1986 and $52.8 billion in 1987. **********Kathleen S. Molony, the forecasting company's senior Japan analyst, said she did not yet have a fixed forecast for 1988, but ''we don't see a change in the trend.'' She noted that ''it takes a while for volume to respond to relative prices.'' **********Stephen D. Cohen, international economics professor at American Unviersity, said he thinks the deficit could approach $60 billion next year. **********''I don't think the Japanese market has a high price elasticity for American goods,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''On the import side, we have an inelastic demand for many Japanese goods, such as automobiles, consumer electronics and cameras.'' **********Yet some analysts do find encouraging signs. They point to the greater willingness of the United States to manage the relationship of the dollar with the yen and other key currencies. They also point to limited victories recently in getting greater access to Japanese markets, including breakthroughs in radio-operated communications equipment and in some pharmaceutical and medical products. **********''There are continuing signs that the Japanese Government takes very seriously the concern in the U.S. about both the level of imports and Japan's willingness to import from the U.S. and the rest of the world,'' said R. K. Morris, vice president for international trade at the National Association of Manufacturers. **********The tensions, others say, reflect the breadth of the trading relationship. ''I just see the problems going on and on,'' said Noel Hemmendinger, co-founder of the United States Japan Trade Council (now known as the Japan Economic Institute) and partner in the Washington law office of Willkie Farr & Gallagher. **********Unrest in Congress Seen **********The rising trade deficit is expected to produce legislation in Congress that would strike at Japan. **********''I would anticipate another big flap in Congress once members realize that the numbers will not improve, but continue getting worse,'' said one key trade strategist in the Senate. **********An early test may come when the House votes on a bill from its Energy and Commerce Committee authorizing the President to deny regulatory certification of telecommunications products from countries that keep out such equipment from the United States. **********The Senate has a similar bill sponsored by John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, chairman of the Trade subcommittee. Chances of passage are considered good. The bill is aimed chiefly at Japan, but it could affect countries in Western Europe. **********Although the President is expected to veto a protectionist textile import bill that recently cleared Congress, Administration officials said he may well sign a telecommunications bill. Backers of that legislation insist it is not protectionist. **********The White House's principal concern is that the Presidential authority be discretionary, not mandatory. Both versions appear to give the President the flexibility he wants. **********The bill reflects strong resentments in the telecommunications industry against Japanese import barriers, especially since the Bell system's breakup two years ago has given the Japanese easy access to the United States market. **********Similar resentments have been expressed by the semiconductor industry, which has complained not only of aggressive pricing practices by Japanese companies, but also of ''cartel'' arrangements that keep American companies from penetrating the Japanese market. **********The High-Technology Sector **********In the battle over high-technology products, American executives say that they could face near-fatal competition if the Japanese are allowed to continue operating from a protected market while the American market remains relatively open. **********They argue that such an arrangement denies them the sales volume and economies of scale that nourish not only profits but the research and development needed to come up with future generations of products. **********''This is a struggle for survival,'' said Alan W. Wolff, counsel to the Semiconductor Industry Association, which brought a complaint that has led to negotiations over semiconductor access in Japan. **********American executives cite the case of Houdaille Industries, a machine tool company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which several years ago asked the Federal Government to try to persuade the Japanese to stop subsidizing computer-operated machining centers that were being sold in the United States. **********The Reagan Cabinet was divided over the issue. In April 1983 the President, against the recommendation of his chief trade negotiator, decided not to take up the case. Recently, Houdaille said it would close a machining-center operation in Los Angeles that had once employed 500 people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/03/world/around-the-world-vietnamese-guns-pound-rebels-in-cambodia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Vietnamese Guns Pound Rebels in Cambodia", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Vietnamese Guns Pound Rebels in Cambodia", "body_text": " **********Vietnamese gunners pounded Cambodian Communist rebels today in a continuing offensive. **********Rebel and Thai military reports said Vietnamese heavy artillery and mortars attacked Khmer Rouge guerrillas Friday night and today in mountains south of here.

''Nobody buys them because of their quality. We know that.'' **********Dr. Gromeka acknowledged the shoe problem in order to make the point that markets exercise a discipline in the Eastern bloc as well as in the West, that executives in socialist countries face problems similar to those faced in the capitalist world. **********These common frustrations helped bridge the cultural and linguistic gaps during a two-day conference on East-West trade held last week at Duke University. Delegates from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary and a lone representative from Poland exchanged views and toasts with Americans and they all discovered a common antagonism toward bureaucracy and a common interest in profits. **********''I heard someone use the phrase 'non-market economy,' '' Dr. Gromeka objected at one point. ''But we have centrally planned economies, not non-market economies. We try to use the market mechanism. We appreciate that market relations have a tremendous importance for the development of the economy.'' **********Soviet and American executives, he said later, are alike in that they trade for profit, at least when they trade with each other. ''Profits are a reality to us,'' he exclaimed. ''We are guided by profit.'' **********A General Agreement **********It was a meeting marked by candor, spiced with moments of indignant posturing, but it also reached a consensus among the 80-odd participants that East-West trade could be expanded substantially from the levels at which it has stagnated for the last five years. **********Last year, the United States exported $3.2 billion in goods to the Soviet Union and imported only $556 million in Soviet products. Both import and export levels are well below their levels of 1979, when political relations soured after the deployment of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. **********But the conference participants predicted that the mutual benefits of increased trade were leading to a modest increase in business in both directions. Some of the optimism derived from last week's announcement in Washington that the first ministerial-level trade talks in seven years will be held in late May. **********Some delegates, especially the Americans, also were encouraged by the selection this month of Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the new leader of the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev, 54 years old, is popularly perceived in the West as more pragmatic and more enthusiastic about economic change than his predecessors in the Kremlin. The Russians and East Europeans, however, seemed more guarded in their assessment of Mr. Gorbachev's impact. **********''You don't understand,'' said Aleksei Voskoboy, an official of the Soviet State Committee for Science and Technology. ''In the Soviet Union, it is the party that governs, not a person. Of course, he is young, energetic, very vigorous, and we like him. But he is a person, and the party makes policy.'' **********Some Common Complaints **********Complaints about party bureaucracy from the Eastern bloc representatives bore a strong resemblance to the sentiments many American executives have about their dealings with the Federal bureaucracy. **********''We are also not happy with what is in our country,'' Ognyan Panov, director of a Bulgarian business school, said one evening. ''I can cite the central committee of the party, in which the General Secretary, Todor Zhivkov, said one of the things we must fight is bureaucracy. If you cite Lenin, I must tell you that one of the most important things he said was the problem of bureaucracy.'' **********Professor Panov also stressed that neither East nor West was familiar enough with the other. Those at the conference appeared to be trying to overcome that as they quizzed each other over lunches and dinners. One American asked several Hungarians if private construction and ownership of an apartment building would be permitted in Hungary. They consulted and decided that although a hotel would be permissible, a large apartment block would be too capitalist a venture. **********Eastern Europe's increasing flirtation with incentives and decentralization - local decision-making in Bulgarian companies, encouragement of foreign participation in small Polish enterprises, formation of a venture capital firm for Hungarian entrepreneurs - was a frequent subject of conversation. **********While the Soviet delegates stressed the possibilities of expanding trade, the Hungarians emphasized opportunities for joint ventures. For example, Magdolna Csath, a director of a business school in Budapest, announced that she would like to develop an exchange program with an American business school. **********Some Disagreements **********Intermingled with the confessions about such shortcomings as shoe quality was a measure of self-righteousness on both sides. Some Americans bristled at suggestions that the United States Government was most to blame for the low level of trade, and they retorted that at least they had a representative government that they could influence. **********The Russians, for their part, resented suggestions that they were the ones who would gain technologically from greater trade. They noted with pride their scientific achievements. **********William C. Norris, chairman and chief executive of the Control Data Corporation, said that his company had imported from the Soviet Union technologies for crushing stone and for hardening machine tools. **********''What the Soviet Union lacks is a marketing capability to efficiently commercialize its research,'' he added.

I think the main cause is that this is the first time we have had a merchandise trade imbalance to the degree we have. This year it will be close to $150 billion. That can't but weaken the nation's manufacturers. **********Do you think the softness in manufacturing is cyclical? Or is it more than that? **********When you look at the weakening of manufacturing, you have to recognize that there is global competition. Many manufacturers' habits were based on the assumption that we were competing just against other American companies. **********That has certainly changed. Now we're in global competition, with Japan being the centerpiece. But you can't minimize the role of Taiwan or Korea either. Managers just didn't recognize that this global situation would be as severe as it has been. **********The strong dollar has made it more difficult to compete. Some companies have made enormous cost-cutting efforts by infusing capital, automating or making new work-force arrangements. Some have cut costs as much as 25 percent, but that has been wiped out by the appreciation of the dollar. **********But hasn't the dollar's recent decline helped? **********It's moving in the right direction. But if you've been losing business because of the strong dollar, a time frame of 60 days is of no value. A lot of the business we lost, we won't get back that fast. The 15 percent drop helps, but it's not going to make a big difference. What would you do about the strong dollar? The dollar is our mechanism for international trade, yet we believe that less than 5 percent of the dollar's movement is related to merchandise trade. The other 95 percent is related to our high interest rates and our nation's stability, both of which attract investment. The dollar has become a means of exchange for the world, but it hasn't created a level playing field for manufacturers. **********We have to start addressing international trade mechanisms. We should re-examine the currency changes made at Bretton Woods. **********What is your outlook for the manufacturing sector in the second half of 1985? **********I can speak only for my own company. We don't anticipate any appreciable downturn. Unit production might be about the same, with a slight upturn. **********But there's pressure on our margins. Some costs have increased, but we can't pass that on. Our difficulty is learning to run a business in a low-inflation environment. A price increase is not an option. **********How does one run a business in a low-inflation environment? **********Our greatest problem with the oil crunch in 1973 was that most of us professional managers had been trained to operate in an uninflationary environment. In the 1950's we found more efficient ways of running our business to keep costs down and increase market share. Then the oil crisis came, and inflation began moving so fast that even if you were efficient you couldn't overcome inflation. So we trained people how to use price increases as an option. **********Now we come to a period when inflation and expectations of inflation are whipped. As a result, we're telling our people: ''You must find a better way to make your product. You must eliminate layers of management. You must do everything to keep costs down so you can get a reasonable return on investment without increasing prices.'' **********What do you recommend doing about the nation's economic problems? **********We're the only country that doesn't have a strong public-private partnership. Philosphically we have had an adversarial role between the two sectors. I think the public sector is ready to talk about this partnership because they see that the trade imbalance is causing enormous dislocations. But the private sector is not ready to talk. They think it would be synonymous with national planning, which they see as being inconsistent with free enterprise. **********I disagree. I think you can keep the best of democratic capitalism with a public-private partnership and at the same time you can facilitate fairness in international trade. **********We need something like a National Security Council for economics. I think our economic relations are as important as security. I'd start with trade. We should elevate our trade representative to a position of much more prominence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/business/key-rates-188505.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/18/business/futures-units-set-merger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Futures Units Set Merger", "print_headline": "Futures Units Set Merger", "body_text": " **********In two votes today, each more than 7 to 1 in favor, members of the Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange approved the merger of the two Chicago-based futures exchanges. **********Officials of the two exchanges will reveal details of the combination Friday, but it is expected that the 105-year-old MidAmerica will retain its independent trading status as a division of the giant Chicago Board of Trade. **********Under the anticipated merger agreement, the Board of Trade would appoint the MidAmerica's board of directors, and Board of Trade members could trade as well on the smaller exchange, bolstering its volume."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/25/world/zia-says-he-ll-yield-many-of-his-powers-after-assembly-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1985-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 326, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZIA SAYS HE'LL YIELD MANY OF HIS POWERS AFTER ASSEMBLY VOTE", "print_headline": "ZIA SAYS HE'LL YIELD MANY OF HIS POWERS AFTER ASSEMBLY VOTE", "body_text": " **********President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq promised tonight that he would soon relinquish many of his powers in governing Pakistan to the National Assembly that is to be elected this week. **********At a news conference in Islamabad, General Zia also said that after the elections the Government would release those detained on charges of trying to disrupt the voting.

He hoped to become the company's president. **********But when that appointment did not come through, Mr. Watson left. Now, he and his wife, Maggie, who also left an executive job at Olin, own and operate the Miller Press, a commercial printing house in Jacksonville, Fla., with 65 employees. **********The Watsons are among an increasing number of executives who are leaving large corporations to start or buy their own businesses. Career counselors said people such as the Watsons are playing a growing role in the country's entrepreneurial boom. **********To be sure, while executives have left corporations for years, most have been junior employees who wanted more independence than corporate life could offer. But now, counselors said, more senior executives are leaving as well. **********Goals Symied **********Some are employees in their 40's and early 50's who have lost their jobs as the result of mergers or reorganizations, and have chosen not to risk the same fate at other companies. Others, such as Mr. Watson, are high- level officers who leave when their career goals within a company are stymied. Many have never worked anywhere else, and the sudden independence can be traumatic. **********''It can be a terrible decision for most people,'' said Dr. James Gallagher, head of J.J. Gallagher Associates, a New York counseling company. ''It can be a great decision for a few.'' **********''There's been tremendous compression in the middle-management ranks caused by decreased production and increased automation,'' said Andrew A. Sherwood, a partner in Goodrich & Sherwood, a New York firm that specializes in counseling executives dismissed by large corporations. ''You need fewer executives to manage fewer people. So where do those people go?'' **********Starting Own Businesses **********Dr. Adela Oliver, president of Oliver Human Resource Consultants Inc., another New York counseling company, said 10 percent of the several hundred executives she counsels each year now go into business for themselves instead of joining other corporations, up from 2 percent five years ago. Other counselors cited similar increases. **********Counselors said larger severance packages - ''golden handshakes'' that can equal more than a year's salary for senior employees - had given more executives the financial independence to start their own businesses. Still, counselors discourage the vast majority, noting than 90 percent of new businesses fail within five years. **********When executives do start businesses, they are often closely related to the ones they leave. ''For instance, the banker will talk about venture capital, the manufacturing guy will want to do a leveraged buyout of a small company and the marketing guy will want to become a consultant,'' Dr. Gallagher, the New York counselor, said. **********Lost Promotion **********But other people change to careers that are related to hobbies or outside interests. Frank Morgan, 46 years old, worked at the Sun Company for 18 years in various marketing jobs, rising to president of overseas operations for the oil refiner and marketer. In 1982, the company reorganized, and he did not get a promotion he wanted. Instead of taking the job the company offered, he left. **********''What came along with that was a pretty generous severance package,'' said Mr. Morgan, who was earning $123,000 a year plus benefits. The severance pay and his savings gave him the freedom to choose his next job. He had interviews for management positions at other oil companies, but said he was unenthusiastic at the prospect. ''I wanted to be my own boss,'' he said. ''I wanted the freedom to make my own decisions.'' **********Mr. Morgan had sailed as a hobby for about a dozen years and on a visit to St. Michaels, Md., a resort town of 1,300 people on the Chesapeake Bay about 70 miles from Baltimore, he saw the St. Michaels Town Dock Marina and decided to buy it. **********He now employs eight people at the peak of the summer, and said the business is supporting him completely. With partners, he has also started a real-estate investment company and is negotiating to buy a marine- supply company with annual sales of $3 million. **********Another Dramtic Change **********Mr. and Mrs. Watson also made dramatic career changes. Mr. Watson, 51, spent 25 years at Olin, and eventually became a vice president and head of its specialty services group, which included its ski business. **********Mrs. Watson, who began her career more than 20 years ago as a chemist for the Stauffer Chemical Corporation, left her job as director of employee relations for Olin's Winchester Group about the same time her husband left the company in 1982. **********They spent two years traveling around the country visiting Chambers of Commerce and talking with local business people before using their savings to buy the press in Jacksonville, Fla. last February. They helped finance the purchase by finding a local attorney who became a partner. **********The business is turning a profit on sales of $5 million a year, but Mrs. Watson said the change has been difficult at times. ''We're working just as hard but we're sleeping less,'' she said. ''Meeting payrolls and worrying about what to do next is an experience I thought I was prepared for, but I was surprised by the psychological and emotional energy that it took.'' **********'Scared to Death' **********Indeed, there are risks. John Hart, 47, said he was ''scared to death'' when he first left his job as president of the Congen Realty Advisory Corporation, a subsidiary of the Connecticut General Corporation, and started his own real estate investment advisory business. ''I'm still nervous. It drives you,'' he said. **********Mr. Hart, who had managed about 150 people, decided to leave Congen when Connecticut General announced it would merge with the INA Corporation in 1982. The company gave him six months with pay to consider his options. **********After talking with contacts in the real estate industry around the country, he started his business in Hartford. He shared office space with a friend to reduce overhead. In the beginning, he persuaded several developers he had worked with before to pay him retainers, and did consulting for them in exchange. **********Now, he works on a fee basis, counseling developers seeking capital for projects and institutional investors looking for real-estate holdings. He has a staff of three and said he is making ''a lot more money'' than he did at Congen, where he had a six-figure salary. **********Contacts Helped **********Other executives, especially those who start consulting businesses, said their corporate contacts had helped them get established. **********As a vice president of operations for Katharine Gibbs, Kay Redditt was responsible for creating an office-automation training program for the nationwide chain of secretarial schools. After she set up the program two years ago, she decided not to stay and run what had become a ''mundane, paper-shuffling job.'' **********She left the company and started a consulting business, the Cognitech Services Corporation, in her home in Easton, Conn. She counsels businesses on office automation and financial planning. She said she had her first clients two weeks after she started the business, and has since consulted for insurance companies and other concerns, including Gibbs. **********''It was not difficult at all,'' Miss Redditt said, ''because I had an expertise that through my networks was well known and was needed.'' **********''There is just a lot of satisfaction,'' Mr. Watson added. ''There was at Olin, too. But the satisfaction here is much closer to us personally because it's not only our company but our money. It'll be what we make it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/22/business/banks-post-strong-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1985-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 939, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKS POST STRONG EARNINGS", "print_headline": "BANKS POST STRONG EARNINGS", "body_text": " **********The second quarter was a period of strong earnings for most of the nation's major bank holding companies, despite a continuing high level of loan losses. **********Twelve of the 15 largest bank holding companies showed increases in per-share net income over the second quarter of 1984. The increases ranged from 75 percent for Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank Corporation, to 7.1 for the Crocker National Corporation of San Francisco, which is still trying to overcome serious problems of recent years. **********The three whose net income did not rise were extraordinary cases: the BankAmerica Corporation, which reported a $338 million loss for the quarter, the second highest ever; the First Chicago Corporation, whose net income plunged almost 96 percent because of a special $115 million reserve established for a Brazilian affiliate, and the Continental Illinois Corporation, whose change in earnings could not be calculated because of its $1.2 billion loss in last year's second quarter, the largest loss ever by an American banking company. **********For most others, however, the quarter was a good one, helped by lower interest rates, strong foreign-exchange and bond-trading results, and higher fees from both consumers and corporations. **********Morgan Tops List **********J. P. Morgan & Company continued to hold the first place in terms of basic profitability. At an annual rate, net income applicable to its common stockholders amounted to 93 cents on each $100 of average total assets. It is rare that a major bank holding company achieves a return of more than 80 cents,  but Morgan's latest quarter, despite its strength, was down slightly from its two spectacular previous quarters, when the return exceeded $1. It was up sharply, however, from the 65 cents earned in 1984. **********In a dramatic recovery from relatively low earnings of recent quarters, Mellon Bank came in second, with an 86-cent return. Its earnings had been dragged down for a while as a result of its acquisition in 1983 of the Girard Bank in Philadelphia. In last year's second quarter, for example, its return was only 53 cents. But its strong-willed restructuring of Girard - some analysts call it ruthless - appears to have paid off. **********The Bankers Trust New York Corporation remained among the top three, with a 74-cent rate of return on net income applicable to common stockholders, compared with 64 cents in the period a year earlier. **********And the Chemical New York Corporation, whose basic profitability has been improving significantly, placed fourth with a 70-cent return, up sharply from the 48 cents earned in the comparable period of 1984. **********A Key Reason **********A key reason for the strong profitability has been the continuing decline in  interest rates: On loans to small businesses and consumers, in particular, the banks have not been reducing the amount of interest they charge on loans as fast as their own interest costs have been declining. **********Robert B. Albertson, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, says that the relatively high interest rates being charged have been discouraging borrowing. ''For the larger banks there is no loan growth,'' Mr. Albertson said, and he predicted the future profitability of the banks will depend partly on their ability to put more loans on their books. **********Another problem they will have to deal with, he said, is the continuing high  level of loan losses. ''Much depends on whether the loan-loss provisions will come down,'' Mr. Albertson said. ''If we're going into another recession, I'd be concerned.'' **********Although the economy may be slowing down, and might even be entering a new recessionary period, most banks reported high provisions to loan losses during the second quarter. Usually loan losses are low in this phase of the economic cycle. **********Even Morgan doubled its provision for loan losses to $90 million in the latest quarter, from $45 million in the second quarter of 1984. **********Most other large bank holding companies also showed large increases in their  loan-loss reserves. Like Morgan, both Citicorp and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation doubled their loan-loss provisions in the year-to-year period; Citicorp to $280 million, from $139 million, and Manufacturers Hanover to $161 million, from $80 million. **********With the exceptions of Wells Fargo & Company and Continental, all the other 15 largest bank holding companies reported steep rises in their loan-loss provisions, ranging from 28 to 84 percent. **********Reserves Bolstered **********In part, the higher loan-loss provisions were used to bolster reserves. To the degree that the provisions are higher than the amount actually charged off,  the loan-loss reserves are strengthened. **********The amount allocated to the loan-loss reserves is deducted from a bank's profits. Actually charge-offs do not directly affect profits, but by reducing the reserves they pressure banks to increase their loan-loss provisions. **********Banks have extra incentive to increase their loan-loss reserves, because these reserves, together with the equity investment of their shareholders, are counted as primary capital. As a result, increases in the reserves help the banks meet the growing demands of bank regulators for less leverage - that is, that primary capital represent a larger proportion of total assets. **********Bank regulators have been asking the large bank holding companies to make sure that primary capital represents at least 5 1/2 percent of their total assets. Largely because of the hefty allocations to the loan-loss reserves, all  the bank holding companies far surpassed that target at the end of the second quarter.

The examiners, who may start as soon as Tuesday, will also try to help thrift institutions obtain Federal deposit insurance, the Governor said, because depositor confidence has been shaken in the private corporation that provides insurance for 102 Maryland thrift units. **********He added that he hoped that the state's privately insured thrift units would be admitted to the Federal insurance program ''in a short time. By that I mean a period of days.'' **********Run at Merritt Commercial **********In a news conference late this evening at the Maryland state house, Mr. Hughes disclosed that the Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan Association of Baltimore had agreed to cede control to a conservator - essentially, a temporary caretaker who protects a financial institution's assets - after negative news reports resulted in a run today on Merritt's deposits. Merritt's deposits totaled about $380 million. No estimate of withdrawals was available tonight. **********The Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation, which provides private insurance for the 102 thrift institutions, was named as conservator for Merritt as well as for Baltimore-based Old Court Savings and Loan Association, which went into conservatorship late Sunday night, Under the conservatorship agreement, withdrawals will be limited to $1,000 per account every 30 days. **********The Governor, a Democrat in his second term, insisted that the problems at Merritt and Old Court were not spreading. He implored depositors to have faith in a financial system that he said remained sound. **********A run on deposits at Old Court began Thursday, after reports were published of possible irregularities. According to thrift industry sources, Old Court, which until recently had deposits of $670 million, has lost $50 million since the run began. **********The conservatorship was requested by Maryland's Attorney General, Stephen H. Sachs, after negotiations over the weekend failed to find a buyer for Old Court. **********''What I am asking the people of Maryland to do is remain calm,'' said the Governor, who cut short a trip to the Middle East. ''Fear is the worst thing that could happen here.'' **********At another point, the Governor said: ''Just because we have identified two S&L's that have problems, it doesn't mean the others have problems. These are sound, well-managed institutions.''

According to local news reports over the weekend, Merritt paid for about one-third of the cost of building its downtown headquarters. Late in the day, however, Merritt officials held a news conference to announce they had found a buyer for the tower.

''Autonomy Is Choosing Our Own Leaders,'' says another. **********A few years ago, advocating autonomy for the coast region was enough to land several Indian activists in jail on suspicion of being separatists. But in a turnaround, the governing Sandinista Front has now come to embrace the idea fervently. **********Government acceptance of at least the notion of autonomy comes as the Sandinistas have taken a new tack in their relations with Miskito Indians, many of whom have been involved in active revolt against the Government. The Miskitos are the largest group among coast people, as residents of the Atlantic region call themselves. **********Sandinistas Concede Errors **********Sandinista officials have conceded that errors in their policies toward the Indians were partly responsible for encouraging the Indian rebellion. **********The Government recently created a National Autonomy Commission and charged it with drawing up a draft law that would grant autonomy to eastern Nicaragua. Interior Minister Tomas Borge is its chairman. **********The dense, swampy expanse that would become autonomous includes half of Nicaragua's territory but is inhabited only by scattered groups of Indians, Creoles and other non-Spanish ethnic groups. It is racially and culturally very different from the rest of Nicaragua. **********Mr. Borge has said the autonomy law will give unusual powers to coast people. But he has warned that the law must not subvert Nicaragua's territorial integrity or the authority of the central Government. **********Demand by Indian Group **********Leaders of Misurasata, one of two Indian organizations that have taken up arms against the Sandinistas, recently demanded that the Autonomy Commission be abolished. They fear it will issue a law in which all real power will remain with the central Government. **********Rebel groups hope to issue their own autonomy proposal this year. The final version of the law is to be determined by the National Assembly, which is dominated by the Sandinistas. **********In Bluefields and Puerto Cabezas, the two largest towns on the Atlantic coast, Sandinista officials are urging residents to take part in meetings at which, they say, the shape of the autonomy law will be determined. **********One night recently in Puerto Cabezas, the local Sandinista Governor, Dr. Mirna Cunningham, denied that the Sandinistas had their own preconceived and limited notion of autonomy. **********''The Sandinista Front is not hosting an autonomy project,'' she told more than 100 Indians and others in the auditorium of a religious school. ''We are going to discuss the project with all the people of the Atlantic coast.'' **********'A Different Kind of Government' **********Dr. Cunningham said no decisions had been made about ''what powers we will have under this project.'' But she said the coast region would be granted ''a different kind of government.'' **********''We will be able to elect our own government, and to decide what kind of government we will have,'' she said. **********A Sandinista member of the National Assembly who is from Bluefields, Ray Hooker, said in an interview that under the autonomy law, coast people might be allowed to hold local elections before the rest of the country. There have been no local elections in Nicaragua since the Sandinistas came to power in 1979, but the Government has pledged to hold them in the coming years. **********The Government has eased its effort to impose, in the coast region, the same structures that exist in the Spanish-speaking Pacific half of the country. It has also given permission to more than 30,000 Indians forcibly removed from their villages along the Coco River in early 1982 to return home. **********Sandinistas' Sincerity Doubted **********Indian rebel leaders doubt the sincerity of the Sandinista commitment to autonomy and have condemned the commission headed by Mr. Borge as an effort to co-opt and dilute popular sentiment favoring autonomy. In a letter this month the Misurasata leader, Brooklyn Rivera, said he would agree to resume peace talks with the Sandinistas, which broke down in May, only if the commission was abolished. **********''They are trying to do this autonomy project without the participation of the Indian leaders and the Indian organizations,'' Armstrong Wiggins, an aide to Mr. Rivera, said by telephone from Washington.

He also rejected another of Mr. Rivera's demands, that peace talks be held in a neutral country. **********Neither the Sandinista Front nor rebel leaders have yet given details of what they believe autonomy should entail.

Labor leaders have always disagreed, obviously, and now many unions are working with managers to eliminate waste and stretch the health dollar. **********Labor spokesmen prefer to talk about improving quality of care for their members, a longstanding concern for some unions. But they also recognize that burgeoning health costs are cutting into the resources available for wages and other benefits. Beyond that, they are aware that health-care inflation is a drag on American businesses trying to stay competitive. Ultimately, jobs are at stake. **********''What has changed,'' said Karen Ignagni, a health benefits specialist with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington, ''is that labor and management are beginning to work together to manage the flow of health-care dollars.'' **********Some of labor's giants are talking of enormous savings. In the 1984 General Motors contract now taking effect, the United Automobile Workers agreed to help slice $220 million a year from G.M.'s $2.2 billion health-care bill. **********And in another bellwether action, the Teamsters Central States Welfare Fund recently contracted with Voluntary Hospitals of America Inc. for discounts through a ''preferred provider'' arrangement aimed at cutting 10 percent from the fund's $350 million medical bill. ''These dollars will be available for wages and other things if we don't utilize them for health,'' George Lehr, the teamsters fund executive director, said. **********Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., has been touring the country discussing health-care issues with his regional officers. **********Some members of the Communications Workers of America are dialing ''800'' numbers for second opinions before surgery, in an experiment in cost-containment to be extended eventually to 800,000 employees and retirees at A.T.&T. and its spinoff telephone companies. The United Rubber Workers and the bakery workers have also been getting into health-cost controls. **********''The cost of health care is an issue in every negotiation, including some where it doesn't have to be,'' John J. Sweeney, chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new executive council committee on health care, reported. Mr. Sweeney is also president of the Service Employees International Union, with 300,000 members in hospitals and nursing homes. So he looks at cost-containment from sometimes conflicting sides. Interestingly, jobs lost to his union because of empty hospital beds have been more than made up by new recruits in the office, as record-keeping grows, and at expanding outpatient facilities. **********Union and management representatives still have sharp disagreements, of course. One of the sharpest is over cost-sharing or cost-shifting. The Business Roundtable recently surveyed 122 companies with 7.5 million employees and found 98 percent required employees to share health costs through some form of co-payment. **********At Rockwell International, 18,000 U.A.W. members pay a $100 deductible on their hospital bills plus 10 percent co-payment (up to $500) and have the usual choice of doctor and hospital. Or they may choose first-dollar coverage in a health maintenance organization, often known by its initials as H.M.O., or a preferred provider organization, known as a P.P.O. But the union emphatically rejected similar cost-sharing proposals at G.M. and Ford. **********Joseph A. Califano Jr., the former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and now a director at Chrysler, said ''big bucks'' could be saved in the automobile, steel and aerospace industries if unions would agree to ''some kind of deductible and/or co-payment, along with the alternative of first-dollar coverage through H.M.O.'s and P.P.O.'s.'' **********Devices for cost-sharing ''put all the burden of cost containment on the worker,'' Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a nationally known health consultant, said, arguing, ''They are not an answer.'' Harvard Prof. John T. Dunlop, who was President Ford's Labor Secretary, agrees. **********While rejecting co-payments, the G.M. and Ford contracts offer incentives to join an H.M.O. or P.P.O., including paid doctor's office visits and additional child-care coverage. Auto workers also obtain second opinions before non-emergency surgery and utilization reviews that steer them away from unnecessary hospitalization, often to outpatient care. The union argues that cost-sharing leads employees to delay in obtaining needed care, which can result in the worsening of a condition until even more elaborate and expensive treatment is required. **********How to divide the savings is also controversial. The unions want to convert health-care savings to other benefits; managers would rather use the money elsewhere. And for small local unions, size can also be a handicap. Health insurance companies offer the best discounts to larger groups, where liabilities are spread thin. So the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and many unions urge a larger role for state and Federal governments in controlling costs. **********As voting trends have shown, union members often see national issues in much the same terms as their employers do. Health care provides ample room for labor-management infighting, but many unions seem to be discovering a self-interest in joint approaches to the broader question of bringing the system under control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/08/world/aids-in-africa-a-pattern-of-mystery.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Altman", "pub_date": "1985-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3914, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIDS IN AFRICA: A PATTERN OF MYSTERY", "print_headline": "AIDS IN AFRICA: A PATTERN OF MYSTERY", "body_text": " **********AIDS appears to be spreading by conventional sexual intercourse among heterosexuals in Africa and is striking women nearly as often as men, according to researchers here. **********These scientists are involved in two related battles: controlling the incurable disease and fighting suppression of information crucial to the international search for its origin, cause and cure. **********Perhaps of greatest long-term importance in Africa, where birth rates are booming, is that a continued unchecked spread of AIDS among sexually active women has caused many babies to be born with the disease and could lead to many more such births. The AIDS virus can pass from mother to fetus in pregnancy and through breast milk to an infant after birth. **********A Major Medical Mystery **********Why the pattern of communicability seems to differ so drastically in Africa from that elsewhere is one of the major mysteries of one of the most confounding medical stories of this century. **********Medical scientists believe that far more research, testing and reporting on the disease in Africa need to be done before those patterns can be fully understood and before any conclusions can be drawn from them for people in other parts of the world. **********Africa has been the focus of attention for some time, in part because some scientists have suggested that the disease may have originated there. However, others point out that it was first recognized, not in Africa, but in the United States, and that no scientific evidence has proved any theories about where it originated. **********Lessons Vital for World **********But what is clear is that the disorder has become a major public health concern in central Africa, that it is emerging as one in East Africa and that scientists now generally believe the African experience, however it is ultimately diagnosed, will almost certainly contain lessons vital to the health of people throughout the world. **********The epidemiology of AIDS in Africa, where homosexuality does not seem to be common, contrasts radically with findings elsewhere. Except for Haiti, AIDS has occurred in other areas of the world mostly among homosexual men, although some experts are concerned that it may become an increasing risk among heterosexuals there as well. **********In the United States, more than 70 percent of the more than 14,000 AIDS victims have been homosexual or bisexual men. The Federal authorities attribute only 1 percent of the nation's AIDS cases to intimate heterosexual contact, and nearly all these cases involve women who were apparently infected with the AIDS virus through sexual contect with an infected man. **********Jump in Reported Cases **********Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, which was discovered in 1981, has been known to be a worldwide public health problem since 1983, and there has been increasing recognition of the dimensions of the problem in recent months. The number of countries reporting AIDS to the World Health Organization in Geneva jumped to 71 in October from 40 in August, with the case count nearing 17,000. **********Although individual doctors have reported in various medical journals on AIDS cases among residents of almost 20 countries in Africa, no country in central, East or West Africa has reported any cases to the World Health Organization. So it is not possible to obtain an accurate total count of cases on the continent. South Africa does report to the international agency. **********To this reporter, who is also a physician and who has examined AIDS patients and interviewed dozens of doctors while traveling through Africa, the disease is clearly a more important public health problem than many African governments acknowledge. In trying to explain the dimensions of the problem, and his frustrations in dealing with it, one physician picked up two thick packs of green hospital record charts, one for AIDS cases, the other for suspected cases, and said quietly: ''They are growing thicker each week.'' Yet, he said, the director of the hospital has told him to tell officials that he has diagnosed only two cases of the disease. **********Access to accurate information has been shut off in many cases. Some expatriates working in central and East Africa have said they feel threatened with expulsion from their host countries if they talk freely without government approval. Some African countries have refused visas to journalists inquiring about AIDS. **********And in at least one government, according to Western diplomatic sources, a rift has developed between ministries that want to suppress information about AIDS and health officials who, in the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, are eager to provide more public education to stall the epidemic. **********In some important ways, Rwanda is a notable exception to the suppression of information. Its doctors have been permitted to publish in journals and grant a limited number of interviews. According to new data provided by one expert, the number of cases in Rwanda, although an incomplete total, has surged each year since 1982 in a pattern similar to that in the United States and elsewhere. Most cases have occurred in Kigali, the capital, with a preponderance among those in the middle and upper class who earn the equivalent of $3,000 to $6,000 each year. About 40 percent of the cases have been among women. **********The total number of AIDS cases has risen sharply since 1982, when a single case was reported. There were six reported cases in 1983, 86 in 1984 and 224 so far this year. **********Children accounted for 70 of these 317 cases, or 22 percent, a proportion that contrasts sharply with that of the United States. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta report that children accounted for only 206 the 14,519 AIDS cases in the United States, or 1.4 percent of the total. Babies With AIDS Prompt Great Concern The childhood afflictions in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa are of particular concern to medical researchers. ''Since nearly half the cases of AIDS in Africa occur among women in their reproductive years, and since these women are having many babies, perinatal transmission is a very important problem, said Dr. Peter Piot, a professor of microbiology at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is helping coordinate African research projects on AIDS. **********Thus, there is the potential of a possible health menace of staggering proportions for future generations of Africans. **********Nevertheless, the Secretary General of the Rwandan Ministry of Health, Dr. Francois-Xavier Hakizimana, says the disease, although a threat, is not at present the No. 1 one public health concern. ''We prefer to talk about malaria, diarrhea and parasitic diseases and malnutrition, which are our major public health problems,'' he said in an interview. **********He said his government had addded AIDS to its educational programs against sexually transmitted diseases, although it did not plan a specific campaign against AIDS. **********The importance of public education is underscored by the supposition among physicians in Africa that just one conventional sexual encounter may be sufficient to transmit AIDS, if one is to believe the sexual histories that patients have given their doctors. However, the risk of AIDS appears to increase with the number of different sexual partners. **********Scientists believe that although the communicable nature of AIDS in Africa is markedly different from what it is in the rest of the world, the disease itself is the same. They come to that conclusion primarily because the virus HTLVIII/LAV seems to be equally incriminated as the cause of the disease the world over, although they can detect seemingly minor variations from within various countries and from continent to continent. Disease Is Spread Through Sexual Contact Sexual contact and blood are two of the most common ways AIDS is spread the world over. **********Doctors here regard heterosexual transmission as by far the most important factor in the spread of AIDS in Africa, and they base these conclusions on studies of victims and interviews with them and their families. **********The possibility exists that unadmitted homosexuality may be a factor, but researchers, although they admit that the studies and scientific research must go further, generally discount homosexuality as significant to the spread of the disease. Knowledge about blood transmission is more limited still. **********One difficulty in blood analysis is that most of these countries do not have the expertise and advanced laboratory equipment needed to test for evidence of the AIDS virus in blood. Specimens must be sent to Belgium, France and the United States for virus testing, which, although a slow process, eventually does help in overall research findings. But the consequence of the lack of proper testing is that AIDS-contaminated blood may often be transfused every day into patients who for various reasons are in need of donated blood. According to one study of about 100 donors in Rwanda, 20 percent had antibodies to the virus and presumably could pass on the virus. **********Because of the costs of disposable needles and a somewhat less than strict attitude toward the problem, doctors and health workers in Africa often re-use needles without sterilizing them. **********Doctors studying the transmission of AIDS acknowledged on close questioning that no study had yet been done to determine the frequency by which the disease is spread by contaminated needles. Physicians in Rwanda, responding to a suggestion, said they would now collect needles used in everyday medical practice and send them to Europe and the United States for tests to detect the frequency with which they are contaminated with the virus. **********However, they cited one important factor weighing against the predominance of needle-transmitted AIDS. It is the relative absence of cases among children 4 to 12 years old, a period when some are exposed to several needle injections for immunizations and common infections. For the most part, the children found to have AIDS are under 4. **********Doctors in this country, who spoke on the condition that they would not be identified, said that AIDS was now a predominantly urban phenomenon, mainly striking upper-income groups. But the disease affects all social classes and threatens to spread to the families that toil the steep, lush hillsides of Rwanda. **********Although many people living on the hillsides have never traveled more than a few miles beyond their local markets, Rwanda has an unusually fine road network for Africa, making it possible for someone to travel from Kigali to almost any area of the country within about three hours. Traffic jams are short by Western standards. Almost any message directed at a person over the state-controlled radio station, particularly one sent by a doctor, will get a rapid response. Nowadays, Rwandans joke that when they hear the names of a few particular doctors summoning patients, they presume these people must have AIDS. Prostitutes Suspected As a Prime Source Kigali has little entertainment and few discotheques, unlike Bujumbura, the capital of neighboring Burundi, which is noted for its livelier nightlife. Rwanda is a heavily Roman Catholic country where in 1983, before doctors recognized the epidemic of AIDS, the government rounded up prostitutes and Rwandan women who consorted with expatriates. The small number of prostitutes who are inconspicuously present on the streets, are believed to be a prime source of spreading AIDS. **********A study of 33 women who are prostitutes in Butare, Rwanda, where the national university and an important military camp are situated, found that 29, or 88 percent, had been infected by the AIDS virus. The researchers also found that 25 men who were customers had a median number of 31 different sex partners each year with a range from 2 to 119, including a median of 30 prostitutes. Evidence of infection with the AIDS virus was found in 7 of the 25 men. The researchers found little evidence of anal intercourse and concluded that frequency of sexual contacts with different partners was more important than the type of intercourse. **********In another study, prepared earlier and being published in the United States in The Journal of the American Medical Association, several Belgian physicians working in Rwanda and Belgium together with American scientists from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., also reported finding high incidence evidence of AIDS infection among prostitutes; they said they found the virus in 80 percent of a group of 84 prostitutes surveyed in Rwanda. The scientists concluded that ''female prostitutes are highly susceptible to infections'' with the AIDS virus and ''could be an important reservoir of the AIDS agent among the heterosexual population of central Africa.'' **********In a study of 90 prostitutes in Kenya by a team of Kenyan, American and Canadian doctors 49, or 54 percent, were infected by the AIDS virus and more than three-fourths of these women had evidence of significant illness such as swollen lymph nodes throughout their bodies. The figure for the prostitutes compared with 3, or 9 percent, of 35 sexually active men who attended a medical clinic and two, or 5 percent, of 42 medical personnel who served as a comparison group for study purposes. Number of AIDS Cases May Be Much Higher The figures cited for AIDS cases in Rwanda, as in other African countries, must be regarded as minimal because not all AIDS victims seek medical treatment; physicians do not recognize all cases of AIDS as such; intensive care units either do not exist or rarely meet American standards; few autopsies are performed in most African countries; most doctors in Africa have less chance to compare notes with their colleagues practicing elsewhere, even in the same country; and it is difficult to keep up with medical advances because American and European scientific journals do not circulate widely in Africa. **********AIDS apparently can go by different names in different regions. What Ugandans call Slim disease, because of the severe wasting that results, appears to be AIDS. **********Whatever the name, officials of African governments fear that irrational fear will jeopardize tourism and deprive their economies of a leading source of foreign exchange. **********In Kenya in East Africa, government officials say there are only a few cases of AIDS. But doctors say privately that there are many more, though the numbers do not approach the levels in Rwanda, Zaire and other central African countries. **********Some other studies have found about 10 percent of healthy adults in parts of central Africa, including areas of Rwanda, Zaire, Zambia and Uganda, to have AIDS virus antibodies in their blood, a sign of probable ongoing infection with the virus. These studies, cited the Journal of the American Medical Association, also have found that ''heterosexual contact is probably the predominant mode of transmission of the AIDS agent'' in Africa, and that AIDS patients here are far more likely than others to have a history of multiple heterosexual partners and visits to prostitutes. **********Rwanda studies are done for the most part by small teams of Belgian and Rwandan doctors who work on AIDS on their off-hours because their primary responsibilities are to care for patients sick with the vast array of tropical diseases. They have found, among other things, a high incidence of subtle inflammatory reactions near the blood vessels called perivascular sheathing in the peripheral part of the retina in the back of the eye of people infected with the AIDS virus. **********Because the eye is an extension of the brain, an eye examination, in a sense, can provide an important window into the central nervous system: The doctors here are trying to learn whether, in the absence of advanced laboratory tests, intense examinations with the standard hand-held, lighted ophthalmoscope, could be a simple, accurate tool with which to diagnose AIDS in children. **********Many doctors believe that yet-to-be-detected co-factors that act in conjunction with the AIDS virus are what determine whether an infected person remains without symptoms or becomes ill and dies from the disease. Rwanda researchers are studying two such possible co-factors, one being whether male circumcision protects infants against AIDS and the other whether alcoholism enhances its development. **********The doctors also said they were eager to participate in experiments to evaluate experimental therapies. **********The opportunistic infections that strike AIDS patients vary somewhat according to geographic regions and one that occurs perhaps more often in Africa is shingles, or herpes zoster. The practiced eye of this observer recognized the sores and scars of shingles on the faces of several patients in hospitals, even on the streets. Some victims were blinded in one eye because shingles scarred the cornea. **********The cryptococcus fungus that causes a type of meningitis is now a common opportunistic infection and its identification through examination under the microscope of a specimen of spinal fluid gives doctors in Africa a simple and inexpensive way to detect some cases of AIDS. **********One doctor, recalling his shouts of surprise when he saw this fungus in a specimen from a patient for the first time two years ago, now says it has become an unfortunate routine; he has seen the organism in three cases in the last three weeks. Anger Is a Factor In Suppression of Data Part of the suppression of information about AIDS cases reflects the anger of many Africans who are incensed about a theory that the disease started on their continent. They perceive themselves as being blamed for starting a disease that is an act of nature and that they believe concerns the United States and other industrialized countries more than Africa. **********Several Africans have expressed vehement criticism about a widely circulated statement by Dr. William A. Haseltine of Harvard University and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, and a leading researcher in AIDS. Dr. Haseltines was quoted in a recent Newsweek interview as saying that African health, with the crumbling of colonial health structures, the massive relocation of people and the ecological disturbance, was seriously deteriorating, and the world would suffer the consequences. **********Some doctors familiar with medicine in Africa contend that health care in Africa, though not generally up to the standards of industrialized nations, has improved significantly in the decades since independence. **********Dr. Haseltine recently testified before the United States Congress that more than 10 million people living in central Africa, or one-tenth the population there, are infected with the AIDS virus and that as best as can be determined the epidemic of AIDS now affecting the world started in Africa. ''AIDS is but one of a series of diseases that we can expect to spring from this continent in the future,'' Dr. Haseltine said. He based his assertions on extrapolations from surveys published in the medical literature. **********The official Ghanaian Times, published in Accra, charged that such blame was unscientific. An editorial published in the paper said it was necessary to caution the African mass media against being unsuspectingly used in ''this shameful, vulgar and foolish attempt by white supremacists to push this latest white man's burden to the doors of the blackman.'' **********The Kenyan press, which has generally accepted the government version, is now asking pointed questions. Referring to the theory that AIDS began in Africa and charges that the disease is more widespread than people are told, Mike Njeru of The Kenya Times asked: ''Where are the African doctors to clear the air for us and why should the task of exonerating us be left to the politicians and others who may not be qualified enough to give a professional rejoinder?'' **********In the wake of the furor, experts who have been reporting their findings about AIDS in Africa in medical journals have expressed deep concern about the prospects of not being allowed to continue that standard practice. Already, scientists have criticized the validity of some data that have been reported in the world's leading medical journals and have raised serious questions about the absence of other data. A Crucial Need To Avert Censorship Rapid dissemination of pertinent scientific data is crucial to protecting public health throughout the world and any interference in the traditional practice would amount to a form of political censorship rarely seen in medicine. **********For example, Burundi and Zaire have decided against presenting data at a meeting on AIDS in Africa sponsored in part by the World Health Organization that more than 500 scientists are expected to attend on Nov. 22-23 in Brussels, according to Dr. Nathan Clumeck of St. Pierre Hospital and the University of Brussels, one of the organizers. Though there is some dispute about the wisdom of holding a meeting on AIDS in Africa in Belgium, researchers working in Zaire, acting on government orders, have reversed their decision to present some of their findings. **********AIDS came to be recognized as a new phenomenon in Africa indirectly when doctors in Belgium and France diagnosed many cases among wealthy black Africans who had flown to Europe for treatment of what turned out to be opportunistic infections resulting secondarily from the paralysis of the immune system caused by the AIDS virus. **********Spurred by these findings, a team of Belgian and American doctors went to Zaire in late 1983, found 38 cases in a three week period, and estimated the annual incidence of AIDS cases in Kinshasa to be 170 per million people. By all accounts the disease continues to spread unabated there. Despite the report, which was published in The Lancet, the Government has denied the existence of AIDS in Zaire. **********Yet research on AIDS is being done in Zaire by American, Belgian, French and Zairian scientists. Doctors familiar with the results have said privately that only a small fraction of what has been learned there has been communicated formally to other scientists, apparently because of Government suppression. **********Among the points being learned in Zaire, according to uncomfirmed reports reaching other countries, are these: *********** AIDS has had a heavy impact on workers in some of the country's leading institutions. About one-half the staff of a bank in Kinshashasa has been stricken by AIDS. Political and community leaders, too, have been among the disease's victims. *********** Some reports say about 10 new cases of AIDS are being seen each week at a hospital in Kinshasa and that up to one-half of the patients in that hospital are infected. *********** Doctors are recognizing with increasing frequency that renewed attacks of malaria and fulminant tuberculosis, which are very common infections in Zaire, are additional examples of the so-called opportunistic infections that kill patients with AIDS. In the past most such deaths would have been attributed to malaria and tuberculosis, not AIDS. French doctors have also recognized an extraordinary incidence of various types of acute leukemia in a hospital in Zaire, according to Dr. Robert C. Gallo, a leading American researcher. **********The importance of a finding a solution to the AIDS patterns of mystery is enormous. **********AIDS erodes the strength of its victims, most of whom are in the prime of their productive lives. Beyond their personal tragedies, AIDS bleeds the economies of countries that are heavily dependent on labor. **********Also, since AIDS tends to affect upper-income Africans most often, including many of the continent's most competent and highly trained people, the disease threatens to decimate the segment of the population that developing countries can least afford to lose."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/18/world/a-spain-morocco-bridge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Spain-Morocco Bridge?", "print_headline": "A Spain-Morocco Bridge?", "body_text": " **********Spanish and Moroccan delegations discussed proposals today for a permanent link across the nine-mile Strait of Gibraltar, a project that could take 30 years to achieve at a cost of at least $3 billion.

Mount, senior economist at Merrill Lynch.  ''But the housing situation is not as rosy as the figures indicate,'' Mr.  Mount continued. For one thing, most of the January gain was in single-family residences to be used as a family's principal home.  The building of vacation homes has practically halted because of the Administration's proposed tax law changes, which would prohibit the deduction of mortgage interest costs on such homes. **********However, construction of single-family homes should continue strong because of the sharp rise in housing permits issued in the last two months, Mr. Mount said. **********A Market Harbinger **********Last Wednesday's upward ''spike'' in stock prices came as no surprise to some analysts, who say they were tipped off by the movements of the Value Line and the S.& P. 500-stock indexes. **********''Basically, we have found in 90 percent of the cases in recent years that whenever the 1,700-issue Value Line index trades at a big premium over the Standard & Poor's 500 index, it is a clear indication that the market is about to explode,'' said Jack A. Barbanel, director of futures trading at Gruntal & Company. ''And when the reverse is true, we can expect a market break.'' **********He noted, for example, that early last Wednesday morning the spread of the Value Line index over the S.& P. 500 suddenly widened dramatically. The breadth and depth of the spread was a clear indication that stock prices were about to move up sharply, he said. **********One reason for this pattern is that the Value Line index is composed largely of the more volatile ''secondary'' issues, while the S.& P. has a greater percentage of the slower-moving blue chips, Mr. Barbanel said. ''And recently, institutional investors have been moving in and out of the secondary issues faster than the blue chips.'' **********Women's Interest Income **********Many women, particularly widows and the elderly, are feeling pinched by the recent decline in interest rates. The reason: Women have been receiving an increasing percentage of their income from interest-bearing investments, such as money market funds and savings accounts, said David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, Chicago. **********That is particularly the case for older women, Mr. Hale said. ''We found in 1983, for example, that the liquid assets of women in the 24-to-34 age bracket averaged $4,274, peaked at $30,666 for those aged 65 to 74 and declined to $26,481 among those 75 and older,'' he said. **********In 1984, women in all age groups were holding a total of $435 billion in liquid assets, most of them interest- bearing, according to Kemper's estimates. That was up from $266 billion in 1980 and $123 billion in 1975. Because of relatively high interest rates since 1975, the yield from these investments, as a percent of total personal income for women, rose to 14.4 percent last year from 12.2 percent in 1980 and 9.7 percent in 1975. **********''If interest rates continue to fall, it would cause many women more financial harm than any freeze on increases in Social Security benefits,'' Mr. Hale said. **********Strong Hospital Stocks **********The pressure to cut back on medical costs is squeezing companies in the health care industry. But there is at least one exception: companies providing hospital care for the acutely ill, particularly psychiatric patients. **********Since Oct. 1, for example, shares of ''general acute- care'' hospitals have collectively risen 9 percent, against a gain of roughly 6 percent in the Dow Jones industrial stock average. But shares of companies catering to psychiatric in-patients have soared 23 percent. **********John F. Hindelong, who monitors the health care industry for Dillon, Read & Company, observed that the earnings of companies that provide in-patient services for the acutely ill would have been stronger but for the fact that the cost of hospitalization continues to rise, despite the cost-cutting efforts, along with the ''co-payments'' required of those seeking care. **********''In many cases, people are unable to afford to pay hospital costs for family members needing acute-care services for their physical ills,'' Mr. Hindelong said. ''But they usually have little choice when it comes to care for mental illnesses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/11/business/rise-requested-in-debt-limit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rise Requested In Debt Limit", "print_headline": "Rise Requested In Debt Limit", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration asked Congress today to raise the national debt limit above $2 trillion and predicted that without new borrowing authority, the Treasury would run out of cash by Oct. 15. **********John J.

Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, held the hearing to show the economic harm that he contended would arise if the deduction was repealed. **********Representative Obey said states would be discouraged from raising sufficient taxes to pay for education, health care and environmental protection. Representative Obey also said that businesses and industry would be discouraged from relocating in states with high taxes. **********Three experts on local government finance agreed. **********Deduction Opposed **********But Representative Fortney H. Stark of California, a senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee and an ally of its chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, attacked the deduction as ''elitist,'' and said, ''There are no good reasons for keeping it.'' **********Representative Stark argued that a several-thousand-dollar-a-year change in a resident's overall tax burden would not be sufficient to cause him to move. He also said that many states, including New York, link their income tax to the Federal definition of taxable income and so would get higher revenues because the Administration plan would broaden the tax base. **********One witness at the hearing, William Oakland, a professor of economics at Tulane, is the author of a study for the Treasury that says ending the deduction could force high tax states to raise their local taxes on businesses. Under the Admininstration proposal, business would still be permitted to deduct such taxes from their returns. **********Henry J. Raimondo, a professor at Rutgers University, told the committee that the loss of the deduction would dramatically effect the choices of businesses that are relocating. Mr. Raimondo said the tax differences could be a major part of a company's decision, just as a homeowner might chose not to move to a community with high taxes. He said that abolishing the deduction would intensify competition between cities and suburbs. **********States With Highest Taxes **********Wisconsin and California are among the 10 states with the highest taxes in the country and their residents now take among the largest Federal deductions for their state and local taxes. **********New Yorkers, who pay the highest state and local taxes in the country, use the deduction more than residents of any other state. Although a majority of New Yorkers would pay lower taxes under the Reagan proposal because of the higher personal exemptions and lower rates, some middle-income residents, particularly those with high property taxes, would owe more Federal taxes. **********The deduction is worth about $34 billion a year and 18 percent of that benefit goes to New Yorkers. **********Meanwhile, a coalition of national groups, including the National Association of Counties, the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees, the National Association of State budget officers, and representatives of New York, New Jersey and Minnesota, met to outline plans for fighting to keep the deduction. **********''Essentially, we'll focus on the House Ways and Means Committee for now because that will be a receptive place, unlike the Treasury Department, which wouldn't even meet with us,'' said Matthew Coffey, executive director of the National Association of Counties."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/20/business/peak-grain-output-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peak Grain Output Seen", "print_headline": "Peak Grain Output Seen", "body_text": " **********World grain production this season should break records, despite a downward revision in forecasts for wheat harvests, the International Wheat Council said today.

Shareowners of one fund in a ''family'' can switch some or all of the assets in an account to another fund in the group. But every transfer is a separate sale and purchase that must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. **********''The fact that a switch is commission-free doesn't mean that it is tax-free,'' said David S. Rhine, a partner in the certified public accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman. ''You're taking on a new holding period every time you switch.'' **********Most funds, moreover, distribute at least 90 percent of their net investment income and net realized capital gains in order to achieve ''conduit'' status and avoid taxation on the fund. Even if a stockholder's distributions are automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund - a service provided by many mutual funds - the reinvested amount is considered as reportable income. **********''Basically, the whole idea of taxation of mutual fund shareholders is to put the shareholder in the same position as he or she would be if he or she owned the underlying securities themselves,'' said David Silver, president of the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association. ''That's why there is no double taxation.'' The total of all distributions during a calendar year are normally disclosed to stockholders on I.R.S. Form 1099 in January of the following year. The type of distribution, though, is identified separately so that it can be properly listed on the holder's tax return. **********Dividends, representing net investment income minus allowable fund operating expenses, are taxed as ordinary income. Dividends from a mutual fund usually qualify for the income tax exclusion of $100 for single taxpayers and $200 for married couples filing jointly. On the other hand, dividends from money market funds - a classification of mutual funds - do not qualify for the exclusion because this income is actually interest income. **********Mutual funds that invest in municipal securities pass along the tax-exempt proceeds they receive on the same tax-free basis to their stockholders. Certain states also provide for the exemption of municipal bond fund interest from their taxes, particularly when the bonds are issued by that state or one of its units. **********Short-term capital gains are also treated as ordinary income and lumped together with dividends in the same box on Form 1099. But long-term capital gains, shown on a separate section of the form, are subject to more favorable taxing treatment. **********Whatever amount is credited to an investor's account as a long-term gain has to be reported as such, regardless of how long the investor may have owned the shares, for it is the fund's long-term gain, not the stockholder's, that is the consideration here in determining the period for tax purposes. **********Various states treat capital gain distributions differently - some as long-term capital gains, some as ordinary income and some calling for no tax at all. The majority, however, follow the Federal taxation policy, with these distributions subject to preferential tax rates. **********Any capital gain that may be achieved when mutual fund shares are sold is based on the difference between the selling price and the adjusted cost. This adjustment is typically made by subtracting the capital gains distributions on which taxes have already been paid from the absolute gain on an account. **********In computing the gain or loss when information regarding purchase dates and prices are no longer available or when fractional shares have been acquired through dividend reinvestment, two averaging techniques are available: the single-category and double-category methods. Whichever procedure is selected, it must be used consistently. **********Under the single-category method, the overall cost of the shares in an account is divided by the number of shares to obtain the average cost per share.

All were interviewed today at Poland's Embassy here. **********The economists were in Washington to attend a private conference on the Polish debt situation. **********Since the United States lifted its objections to Polish membership last Dec. 14, in response to the freeing of political prisoners in Poland, the I.M.F. has sent three missions to Poland to study its membership bid. **********''We are on the last leg of the procedures,'' said Jozef Soldaczuk, director of the Foreign Trade Research Institute in Warsaw and a professor at the Institute for International Economic Relations. **********Mr. Soldaczuk was joined by Stanislaw Raczkowski, professor of international financing relations at the Central School for Planning and Statistics; Zbigniew Kamecki, professor in the department of international trade at the same school and a deputy member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party, and Michal Dobroczynski, head of the chair of world economy and international economic relations at Warsaw University. **********They insisted that Poland, which has drastically cut inflation in the last four years, achieved a trade surplus through brutal suppression of imports and taken measures to create a ''dynamic'' economy, has already met conditions that the I.M.F. would be expected to impose in making a loan. **********Membership in the International Monetary Fund, which makes short-term balance-of-payments loans, is a prerequisite to membership in the World Bank, which makes loans generally to support long-term projects in energy, agriculture, transportation and other fields. **********There are fewer strings tied to loans from the World Bank, formally known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. **********The I.M.F. said it never comments on situations involving a specific country. But a monetary source close to the institution said, ''Clearly things are moving forward in terms of the membership application.'' **********Officials cautioned, however, that it could be many months before Poland actually draws any money. Any program would have to be approved by the I.M.F. board, where the United States has a 20 percent vote. **********An American official said the Reagan Administration would consider events in Poland at the time a proposal is put before the board. ''If they're behaving themselves and not arresting a lot of people, we'd probably go along with it,'' he said. **********Although the United States has lifted its veto against Polish membership, it still maintains trade sanctions against Poland and bans extension of any new official credits from the Export-Import Bank or the Commodity Credit Corporation. **********The trade sanctions, which involve suspension of the ''most favored nation'' tariff cuts that the United States grants most countries, were imposed in November 1982 when the Polish Government outlawed the Solidarity labor movement. The trade sanctions are not expected to be removed soon. **********Professor Raczkowski, who is also a debt negotiator for Poland, said it owes $31 billion to Western commercial banks and governments. He put the amount owed to the United States at $2.8 billion - about $1 billion of it owed to American banks. **********He said Poland had worked out debt repayment plans with both its official and commercial creditors. **********''We are once more becoming good boys and have gained a breathing space for the economy,'' he said. **********But to pay interest on its debt, Professor Raczkowski reported, Poland has paid out in hard currency $1.5 billion more than it has taken in for each of the last three years. ''This is a very painful fact,'' he remarked. **********Professor Kamecki added, ''We are the only debtor country that has not been helped by its creditors.'' They have given Poland no new credit. **********It is not clear how much Poland might be allowed to borrow as a member of the International Monetary Fund. The amount is based on a complex formula related to the size of a country's economy. Hungary's I.M.F. quota, which determines the access to loans, is about $500 million. A country may borrow up to 345 percent of its quota over three years. **********Poland was a founding member of the I.M.F. in 1945. Five years later it withdrew from the organization.

This will mark a major step in the huge and proliferating market of stock options that allows investors and speculators alike to trade contracts at a fraction of the cost of the underlying securities. **********An options contract allows its holder to buy or sell a stock at a set price within a specific period of time. **********''We were the first exchange to announce our intentions to trade options on over-the-counter stocks and we hope to start on or about June 1,'' said Kenneth R. Liebler, senior executive vice president of the American Stock Exchange. ''We picked options on 10 stocks which we feel will attract broad investor interest.'' **********The underlying stocks are Apollo Computer, Apple Computer, Cipher Data Products, DSC Communications, Intel, Intergraph, Lotus Development, Tandem Computers, Mylan Laboratories and Network Systems. Except for Mylan, a producer of generic pharmaceuticals, this group is geared to various sectors of technology. **********''We will begin trading options on over-the-counter stocks concurrently with the other exchanges,'' said Ivers Riley, executive vice president in charge of options at the New York Stock Exchange. ''June 1 may be too optimistic, however, as a starting date. We plan to start with a handful of options - perhaps five or six.'' **********At the nation's two largest exchanges and other exchanges, these options will be traded by specialists and competing independent market makers. **********''Initially, we lose a competitive edge, since the exchanges will be the first to trade the options,'' said Gordon S. Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers. The N.A.S.D. regulates the over-the-counter market in unlisted securities and, through its Nasdaq subsidiary, op-erates an electronic network for more than 4,000 issues. **********Nonetheless, the N.A.S.D. will reap other benefits. Options trading historically has the effect of increasing activity in the underlying securities, thanks to various strategies created by options. In one popular strategy known as ''covered writing,'' a person buys a stock and simultaneously writes, or sells, a call option on the stock. The writer immediately receives the ''premium,'' or the price of the call. **********Moreover, N.A.S.D. dealers expect to begin trading themselves this summer - possibly in August - in the first index option devoted to over-the-counter stocks. Known as the Nasdaq-100 Index, this instrument will consist of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks traded over-the-counter. **********Index options have gained a tremendous following among speculators in the last two years. With these vehicles, people can bet on the direction - up or down - they believe an entire market will take over a short period of time. The most popular index option by far is the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index option, which is traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. **********Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for exchanges to begin trading options on over-the-counter stocks. In another and far more controversial matter, the commission conditionally approved an N.A.S.D. pilot project to permit so-called side-by-side trading. This would allow N.A.S.D. firms to make a market in both the option and the underlying stock of six over-the-counter issues, starting in late 1985. **********But the commission, citing competitive fairness, unexpectedly voted also to permit stock exchanges to engage in side-by-side trading of over-the-counter securities. As it so happens, both the Big Board and the Amex oppose the concept of side-by-side trading. ''We've long been opposed to it,'' Mr. Liebler of the Amex said. By way of explanation, he cited ''the potential for manipulative activity when options and the underlying stocks are traded by the same market maker.'' **********For exchanges to participate in side-by-side trading, the commission would first have to approve some form of unlisted trading privileges -which the Big Board, for example, also does not want. The commission plans to address itself to this matter in June. Approving unlisted trading privileges would allow exchange floor personnel to act as market makers in stocks not listed on the exchange. **********Such approval, according to industry sources, might potentially create tremendous problems for, say, the New York Stock Exchange. If Big Board specialists, for example, were allowed to trade over-the-counter stocks, they would be competing directly with many of their own member firms, such as Merrill Lynch, E.F. Hutton and Prudential-Bache Securities, which already make extensive and profitable markets in unlisted issues. **********Carried to its logical extremes, the approval of unlisted trading privileges could conceivably open the door to wide-open competition in the trading of securities and fundamentally change the way business is transacted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/22/world/mexican-rejects-ousting-sandinistas.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1985-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MEXICAN REJECTS OUSTING SANDINISTAS", "print_headline": "MEXICAN REJECTS OUSTING SANDINISTAS", "body_text": " **********Mexico's Foreign Minister today criticized sentiments in favor of overthrowing the Nicaraguan Government, saying such an action would have ''very unfortunate consequences'' for Latin America. **********The Foreign Minister, Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, was responding to a report that some Reagan Administration officials are saying that United States differences with Nicaragua cannot be resolved so long as the Sandinistas remain in power. **********''We do not believe that the solution is by way of the removal of a legitimately constituted Government,'' Mr. Sepulveda said.

Aquino's responses in an interview today with The New York Times: **********On New People's Army Well, maybe what I can do is refer you to this priest, Father Tabora of the Jesuit Society. He is supposed to be one of our experts on Communism. But he works with the squatters in poor areas. In fact, I asked him one night to come here and brief me on Communism and how we go about fighting it and all that. And he was telling me, ''You know, Cory, Communism has no chance in this country because it goes against the grain of Filipino culture,'' and you could just give him a call. **********My thinking on this is I will ask for a cease-fire for six months so we can have a dialogue, because Marcos keeps on saying that many of the N.P.A.'s keep on surrendering by the droves - that's what he keeps on saying. But my understanding of it is usually it's the same people who keep on surrendering because there is prize money for every N.P.A. that you bring back to the fold. And since Marcos has no way of checking who these surrenderees are, maybe there are some people in the military who keep on saying so many surrendered in the week and the next week and so on. And it is they who get the reward money. **********I think that the reason why many have gone over to the Communists is they cannot obtain justice under Marcos. And that is why it is so necessary to change Marcos, so that we can offer the people - all I can offer them really is just a hope, that we will be able to bring about the changes that they are looking for, that we are all looking for. **********My husband, when he was Governor of the province of Tarlac, used to dialogue often with them, but I don't feel I am that competent, especially not now. Maybe when I am in power then it will be that much easier to talk with them, so that I can ask them. I would talk with the leaders of the N.P.A.'s or maybe assign somebody, you know, from my side to talk with them and just ask them what it is that we can dialogue about and ask them if there are any solutions to their problems. **********And definitely, I have already said that I am against violence, so that they will have to renounce all forms of violence if they want to come back to the fold. Of course, I know I won't get the real hard-core N.P.A.'s. But I would like to get the majority that are with them, simply because they are so desperate, and the only way they can obtain justice is if they side temporarily with them. With the hard core I guess it's a losing proposition. But then the majority who are not really Communists or who do not espouse violent methods, maybe we can still win them over. Definitely they want justice. Many of them have lost husbands or wives because of the abuses of the military. **********On American Bases **********Some in my group just want a complete, how do you say that, they just want the bases out after 1991. Doy would like to call for a plebescite and to ask the people what they think of it. Mine is for having negotiations before the expiration of the agreement, and then maybe after the negotiations have been made we present this to the people. I will see what the conditions are by that time. As I said, so many things can happen between now and then, and so whatever I believe will be to the interests of the Filipino people and that is what I will do. **********I am for the removal of the bases but I have not set a date, O.K.? I am for the removal of the bases for our sovereignty, and we are part of Asean, and we are for maintaining a zone of neutrality. You see it was just an agreement, it wasn't a treaty. I mean, you know, we had no Senate to ratify it and your Senate did not ratify it. It was just strictly between Marcos and Reagan. **********But as I said, while I am for the removal of the bases, I have not set my mind on the actual date. My husband always said this: While he was for the removal of the bases, he was not for the immediate removal, but depending on the situation in this country and I guess elsewhere, we can plan accordingly. **********On Electoral Promises **********Look, Marcos promised so many things. He had such a beautiful program. And yet look at what happened to this country. I mean, why am I being thought of as being probably the next president? The only thing I can really offer the Filipino people is my sincerity. I mean, they are fed up with people who keep promising them so many things, and yet not being able to fulfill these promises. My campaign speech will be: I cannot promise you anything because it would be dishonest of me to promise you a better life will be there a week, a month or even a year after I have been in office. **********What is very necessary is that all of us be involved in our country. Before, people just left it to the leaders, you know, ''You take care of everything and we'll just follow,'' you know, and people were so indifferent, people did not really care. And it is only now, after my husband's assassination, that suddenly you have a great many Filipinos thinking really seriously about what they can do to improve this country of ours. And I am not about to tell them, ''Look, forget it, there's no hope.'' I mean, if they think I can help them bring about those changes, I mean, that's the reason I am in this, because I have already told them a long time ago, ''What on earth do I know about being president?'' **********I mean, I was as honest as that, and up to maybe two months ago I was still hoping that the opposition could unite behind somebody, preferably not me. And this was part of the prayer of my children that, ''Dear God, help us to accept your will, but please let it not be our mother.'' But unfortunately, or fortunately, I don't know, it seems that I was perceived as the unifier, and I guess I was the unifier. **********On Land Reform **********As far as a land reform program is concerned, I think we have to seriously examine that, because from what I have heard from the people who first acquired the titles to the lands, the original tenants of the lands, they no longer own those lands themselves. So there must be something wrong with the land reform program, and I've heard people say that maybe we should look into farm cooperatives rather than simply transferring title of land from one person to another, especially in our area in Tarlac. Somebody was telling me that in a particular town a certain tenant who had acquired the land under the land reform program no longer owns the land. He has already either sold it or somebody has already gotten it from him from the money he has borrowed. So there had to be a re-examination of the land reform program. **********But more than that, I think we'd have to be geared toward industries in order to give greater employment to the people, because as somebody was explaining to me - you know, I'll have to admit to you I'm getting so many crash courses at this point in my life - they were saying that before our, it wasn't really a genuine industry, you know, making use of our natural resources, it was just a cosmetic thing that we were doing here, so Marcos did not care so long as his cronies or so long as he was making money. **********And so we will have to be very clear on our policies as far as the economic and the business was concerned, because as I was asking these businessmen, ''So what went wrong?'' So they said, ''Well, look, Marcos dictates on every single thing, and anything which involves more than one million pesos has to be referred up to him.'' I mean, how can a President run a Government if every little deal, you know, involving a million pesos or more has to be referred up to him. So we will have to consult not only with the entrepreneurs but for all the people who have a direct interest in whatever the subject may be."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/22/business/finance-new-issues-philadelphia-unit-begins-an-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Philadelphia Unit Begins an Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Philadelphia Unit Begins an Offering", "body_text": " **********A $245 million issue of 10 1/2 percent pollution control revenue bonds for the Philadelphia Electric Company was offered yesterday at a price of 100 through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Bonds of the utility, which has a large exposure to nuclear projects still under construction, are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB by S.&P. **********Since the start of the week, the size of the financing was increased from $150 million at the same time as the yield was reduced from about 10.61 percent.

Shultz today conferred at the State Department with Tariq al-Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who had been at the United Nations in New York. **********After the session, which had not been previously announced, the State Department avoided accusing Iraq of using chemical weapons, but officials who asked not to be quoted said intelligence analysts had no doubt that Iraq was using the chemical agents again. **********Bernard Kalb, the State Department spokesman, said: **********''I am not going to get into the specific nature of the evidence that is available to the United States at the present time. Let me say this, though, that the Iraqi Government is well aware of the fact that the U.S. Government strongly condemns the use of lethal chemical weapons and feels there is no justification for their use by any country.'' **********The spokesman said that Mr. Shultz, in the meeting with Foreign Minister Aziz, reiterated ''the absolute firm opposition of the United States to the use of chemical weapons, in violation of international conventions, wherever and whenever such use may occur.'' **********When Mr. Aziz was asked by reporters later whether Mr. Shultz had mentioned chemcial weapons, the Iraqi said, ''I don't recall that.'' **********Iraq has denied that it has used chemical weapons ever since the question was first raised last year. **********There was no immediate explanation why the United States did not publicly disclose its information about Iraq's use of chemical weapons.

The United States firmly supports practical and balanced international efforts toward this urgent objective.'' **********In March 1984, American officials said that Iraq had been using mustard gas and that Iran had been using nerve gas and was building up a capacity for full-scale chemical warfare attacks. **********As a result, the United States announced that it was imposing restrictions on the sale to Iraq of five chemical compounds that could be used in making mustard or nerve gas. **********The European Economic Community and Japan later said that they, too, were putting controls on the export of those chemicals, but Administration officials said today that there was evidence that there had been violations by some Western companies. **********Part of the evidence, in fact, for the conclusion that Iraq was using the gas was based on shipments to Iraq of chemicals vital for poison gas production.

Real gross national product should increase at an annual rate of between 6 percent and 8 percent over the next four to five quarters - nearly triple the consensus forecast. **********Among the many factors that are widely viewed as impediments to a meaningful reacceleration of growth are high real interest rates, a strong dollar, the potentially retardant effects of various budgetary and tax proposals, farm credit and banking problems, a low savings rate and a consumer sector presumably overburdened with debt. **********But these factors - even when taken together - pale in significance next to the basic forces that control the business cycle and that are propelling us upward. Just as in early 1983 - when many of the above-mentioned problems existed - imbalances between final demand and inventories together with stimulative macroeconomic policies should trigger a boom. **********During business expansions, the economy does not grow smoothly from quarter to quarter, or even from year to year. Ninety percent or more of our economic history may be readily classified into one of three phases: booms (6 percent to 8 percent growth), sluggishness (1 percent to 3 percent growth) or recessions. **********Recessions happen because a shock of some kind befalls the economy. Typically, inflation accelerates, the Federal Reserve Board raises its interest rate targets and housing and autos retreat. (Although other shocks - most notably, a tight fiscal policy - could be the principal cause of a recession, one must go back to the sharp drop in military expenditures that occurred at the end of the Korean War to find a recession that was not principally the result of rising interest rates.) During the 80 percent to 85 percent of the time that the economy has not been in recession over the past generation, G.N.P. growth has averaged 4.5 percent to 5 percent. However, the economy rarely grows at a constant rate and individual quarterly growth rates are not clustered around the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range. Rather, they are bimodal, with one cluster centering on the 6 percent to 8 percent range, the other on the 1 percent to 3 percent range. **********Economic growth alternates between booms and sluggish periods during expansions because swings in inventory policies accentuate whatever is happening in the economy. Often, at the outset of a boom, inventories are not growing at all. By the end of the boom, they are growing at least at a rate of 5 percent (in real terms) and sometimes as rapidly as 9 percent to 10 percent. In slowdowns, the pattern is reversed. **********Economic performance during the current business expansion fits neatly within this historical framework. There were two very sluggish quarters at the outset of the recovery, when economic growth averaged just under 2 percent. We then entered a very powerful economic boom - one of the strongest in our history - with G.N.P. growing at a compounded rate of 7.9 percent between the spring of 1983 and the middle of 1984. **********By the end of that boom, inventories were increasing at a 9 percent rate. Currently, we are at the tail end of a slowdown in which G.N.P. growth is expected to average just over 2 percent, and the pace of inventory accumulation has slowed markedly. The latest data, just released last week, show no inventory growth at all in July. **********Although the alternating strength and weakness of the economy over the past several years has been perfectly normal, scarcely anyone expects such normality to continue. Some believe that the economy will muddle along at the 1 percent to 3 percent growth rates that have prevailed over the past year. But such a forecast is totally unrealistic. Over the past generation, no phase of any business cycle has lasted longer than five quarters. The dynamics of the business cycle militate against any economic tempo lasting very long. **********But to say that sluggish growth will not continue indefinitely does not mean that a period of economic sluggishness has to give way to a boom -it could be followed by a recession. But again, when we look back at the past 25 years or so, we find that the only slowdowns that turned into recessions were those in which demand was weak enough to frustrate businesses' attempts to correct the excessive growth of inventories. These episodes, in turn, were confined to the slowdowns in which interest rates rose a great deal. The Fed, in effect, drove us into each recession. **********There were several slowdowns -1962-1963, 1964-1965, 1977 and 1978 - in which interest rates rose but by small enough amounts that the slowdowns were followed by boom conditions rather than recessions. But most significantly, every time interest rates have fallen during a period of sluggish economic growth, a boom has ensued. The fact that interest rates have declined by more over the past year than during any other period of positive G.N.P. growth in our history very strongly suggests that this period of sluggish growth will be followed by a boom rather than a recession.

McGowan, MCI's chairman and chief executive, was thus elated over the alliance with the International Business Machines Corporation. ''It gives us money from a stockholder interested in our success,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''It gives as an organization interested in data communications. And it gives us tremendous credibility.'' **********At the same time, analysts say, the alliance between MCI and I.B.M. virtually assures a continued shakeout in the telecommunications business, with only a handful of companies likely to survive. The partnership should, for example, put further profit pressure on other long-distance companies such as GTE Sprint and Allnet Communications. **********And the alliance is expected to put pressure on the Federal Communications Commission to fully deregulate the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Although the phone giant is now free to sell a range of business equipment, including computers, it still cannot sell them jointly with its long-distance phone service. It has spent millions trying to get the rule changed and will now likely lobby harder than ever for a change. **********''This announcement should put to rest any remaining questions about the strength of the competition in the telecommunications business,'' said Randall L. Tobias, chairman and chief executive of AT&T Communications, the company's long-distance arm. ''There now is scant reason for maintaining regulatory restraints imposed on A.T.&T. even before the divestiture.'' **********Of all the implications for telecommunications, however, the biggest changes will likely be felt at MCI. If I.B.M.'s proposal to acquire 16 percent and possibly as much as 30 percent of MCI receives regulatory approval, the computer giant is almost sure to begin sharing with MCI its knowledge of business data processing, analysts predict. **********Similarly, they say, I.B.M. should provide an entree for MCI to the big corporate accounts that have eluded the long-distance company because of its reputation as a free-wheeling, sometimes undependable carrier. And I.B.M. will become a deep pocket for MCI, having agreed to provide more than $400 million in capital to the long-distance company in coming years. **********These resources - knowledge, customer access, and cash - could not come at a more opportune time for MCI. Although MCI has a reputation on Wall Street as one of the best managed long-distance companies, the long-distance phone business itself is unhealthy. Costs have been rising as all the companies forced to pay higher ''access charges'' to connect to customers. Calling prices have fallen as A.T.&T. has shown extrodinary willingness to to cut its own prices to maintain its market share. So everyone's profits have plunged. MCI, no exception to the trend, has been in need of a partner, analysts say. **********''It's a concession on MCI's part that they need help if they are to go head to head with A.T.&T.,'' said Robert B. Morris 3d, the telecommunications analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc., a San Francisco brokerage firm. **********For its part, MCI has steadily disputed the notion that the long-distance business is in trouble. In the interview yesterday, however, Mr. McGowan agreed that teaming up with I.B.M. would provide his company with important new dimensions. **********To hear analysts tell it, the data communications may be the most critical. In particular, Mr. Morris and other analysts argue that the long-distance telephone will never be the prosperous business it once was. The big money, rather, will be made in data transmission and in networking of computers - in short, in products and services that involve telecommuncations but that require familiarity with computers. **********''The real money will be in what I like to call information distribution for sophisticated business users,'' Mr. Morris said. ''I.B.M. has experience with that market. MCI has experience too, but certainly not as much as I.B.M.'' **********Although Satellite Business Systems, the long-distance company that MCI is acquiring from I.B.M. as one part of yesterday's deal, has never made a profit since it started in 1975, Mr. McGowan said that S.B.S., in MCI's hands, would soon be in the black. MCI will not be assuming S.B.S.'s debt. Further, S.B.S. will go on MCI's books at a much lower amount than on I.B.M.'s books, with the result that depreciation charges on MCI's income statement will be lower. **********Together, MCI and S.B.S. will have one of the largest computerized transmission network in the nation for voice, data and pictures. Consisting of optical fiber, microwave radio, and three of S.B.S.'s satellites, the network will serve about 2.7 million customers.Most of S.B.S. clients are big businesses that MCI has long coveted. **********If I.B.M. raises its stake in MCI to 30 percent - which many analysts view as likely - the combined company can be expected to become an integrated supplier of regular long distance phone service, business computers, and data transmission services, analysts interviewed said yesterday. As such, the two companies would compete directly against A.T.&T., which over the past year and a half has been attempting to build its own computer business. **********But A.T.&T. continues to be subject to a host of F.C.C. regulations that it contends impede it from competing effectively. Unlike competitors, for example, A.T.&T., cannot change prices without regulatory approval. And under a ruling issued about three years ago by the F.C.C. (known as Computer Inquiry II), A.T.&T. must not only separate sales of its computers from long distance service, but also must sell the machines through a separate subsidiary. **********A.T.&T. has said that the latter requirement has cost it more than $1 billion, and yesterday it renewed its call for elimination of the rule. **********Arguments continued to be made, however, to keep A.T.&T. under Government limits. GTE, for example, has been arguing for months that A.T.&T. should remain regulated until GTE's Sprint long-distance unit and the other long-distance competitors establish themselves more firmly in the market. **********Sprint, which has been losing money, is expected to face even greater profit pressures as a result of yesterday's announcement, analysts said, because it does not have a true computer business that customers may come to expect. Late yesterday, GTE issued a statement renewing its call for continued regulation of A.T.&T. **********''The action I.B.M. and MCI have taken today demonstrates the severity of the problems in the long-distance marketplace and the needs for changes in the transition to effective competition with A.T.&T.,'' a spokesman said. On the New York Stock Exchange GTE closed at $41, down $1.625."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/08/world/poll-shows-skepticism-on-arms-pact.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1985-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLL SHOWS SKEPTICISM ON ARMS PACT", "print_headline": "POLL SHOWS SKEPTICISM ON ARMS PACT", "body_text": " **********As talks begin in Geneva, the American public is deeply skeptical that President Reagan will achieve an arms agreement with the Soviet Union during his second term, although it backs his handling of relations with Moscow and voices confidence that he wants an agreement, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News survey. **********More broadly, the poll reveals that the public's fear of nuclear war has diminished somewhat over the last four years and that more people now believe that the two superpowers are roughly equal than held such a view in 1981. In addition, the public voices broad doubts that adding more nuclear weapons will help either side. **********The survey, taken by telephone among 1,525 Americans from Jan. 2-4, indicates that in spite of the wide publicity being given to the current arms talks in Geneva, public expectations are modest. It found that only a tiny fraction expects the Geneva sessions to produce more than arrangements for further negotiations. Over the longer run, moreover, only one-fourth of the public believes an arms agreement will be achieved within four years. **********The President's plan for an antimissile defense system, a central issue in the talks, met ambivalent reactions. Despite challenges from some scientists and politicians that a full space- based defense shield is not feasible, the survey found that most people believe the plan would work. Yet majorities also fear that the program, which has been dubbed ''Star Wars,'' will make the arms race more dangerous and will not be worth the cost, projected at $26 billion over the next five years. **********65 Percent Approve of Reagan **********Evidently accepting the notion that this program could become a bargaining chip with the Kremlin, a modest plurality said they feel it will make negotiating with Moscow easier. But considerably more people feel the chances of agreement would be substantially increased by annual meetings of Soviet and American leaders. **********Yet apart from specifics of arms control issues, the survey indicates the strength of President Reagan's political position as he tries to revive Soviet- American arms talks. **********65 Percent Approve **********Mr. Reagan won his strongest approval ratings for his handling of the Presidency and his handling of foreign policy since the early weeks of his first term. His ratings, although not so strong as President Eisenhower's after his re-election in 1956, were considerably higher than President Nixon's after his re-election in 1972. **********Overall, 65 percent of the respondents approve his handling of the Presidency; 54 percent on foreign policy and 60 percent on relations with Moscow, all notable improvements from just before his re-election in November. His political support was so broad that Mr. Reagan even received approval from 51 percent of the people who say they are liberals, from 30 percent of blacks and from 20 percent of those who voted for Walter F. Mondale. **********By contrast, the survey reveals substantial wariness toward Soviet leaders. Although 55 percent blame both the United States and the Soviet Union for the failure to reach any new arms agreement since June 1979, Americans are wary of the Kremlin's intentions. **********Fifty-one percent voice doubts that Soviet leaders really want an agreement (36 percent said the Soviet leaders did), 59 percent say they do not think the Soviet Union would live up to an arms accord and 67 say they believe Moscow has violated past arms treaties. Among the last group, only one- third thinks Moscow gained importance advantages by cheating, and two- thirds think the violations did not make much difference. **********Reagan Effort Called Sincere **********By contrast, President Reagan won a strong vote of confidence with nearly three-fourths of the public crediting him with sincerely seeking an arms agreement and 7 in 10 people saying the United States would keep its word in an arms accord. **********Despite overwhelming endorsement of the President personally, attitudes on his policies and the promise of his current diplomacy are mixed. **********Only 27 percent say they think an agreement can be reached within four years, and 36 percent say it will take at least five years, 14 percent say it will never happen, one percent say agreement will come when the world changes and the rest voiced no opinion. **********In his first term, President Reagan said his acceleration of military spending would improve chances for an arms agreement, and close to 4 in 10 people agreed. But a larger body, roughly half of the public, said the Reagan buildup had either made an agreement less likely or had made no difference. **********Nonetheless, public jitters about nuclear war have eased, the nation seems slightly more at ease about the nuclear balance and there is less public pressure for more nuclear arms. **********The New York Times/CBS News survey found, for example, that 29 percent of the people consider nuclear war either very or fairly likely in the next decade (down from 47 percent in a Gallup poll in June 1981). Similarly, 52 percent now think the military threat from Moscow ''is constantly growing,'' down from 64 percent after Soviet jet fighters shot down a Korean airliner in September 1983. **********Rough Nuclear Parity **********One possible reason is that more people now think there is rough nuclear parity than in 1981. Right now, 46 percent regard the superpowers as rough equals, compared with 39 percent in a New York Times/ CBS News survey in June 1981. Now, 29 percent see the Soviet Union as stronger, down from 42 percent in 1981, and 17 percent see the United States as stronger, up from 11 percent in 1981. **********Moreover, in early 1981, 52 percent of the public favored seeking superiority over Moscow, but today 50 percent say parity should be the nation's goal, and 37 percent still favor seeking superiority. In addition, roughly 60 percent now say both sides have so many nuclear weapons that it does not really matter which country has more. **********For all the publicity given arms control and military issues, just one person in 12 correctly knew both that there are Soviet-American arms agreements in effect and that the Pentagon budget constitutes roughly one-fourth of the Federal budget. **********This group was more likely than the public at large to approve of the President's handling of the Russians, to blame the Russians for the failure of past arms negotiations, to think the Russians got significant advantages from violating past arms accords and to think both sides have so many weapons that a few more will not make much difference. They are also less likely than others to think the Geneva talks will lead to agreement. **********Generally speaking, men were considerably less likely than women to fear nuclear war, more inclined to believe that the ''Star Wars'' defense would work and provide useful leverage in current arms talks, more prone to think that the Reagan arms buildup had increased chances for agreement, but also considerably more willing than women to believe that Soviet leaders really want an arms agreement now."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/03/business/briefs-213425.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 334, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Motors Corp., Southfield, Mich., said it would close its Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant next week for one week because of slow sales of the Alliance and Encore subcompact cars built there. *********** Beneficial Corp., Wilmington, Del., said its Beneficial National Bank unit had agreed in principle to purchase the credit card portfolio of BancTexas Group Inc. of Richardson, Tex.

In fact, 15 states have ''incentive'' rate programs covering about 35 reactors that let the utilities earn more if their nuclear plants operate reliably, and less if they are shut down for refueling and repairs for long periods. **********But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is growing increasingly nervous that the incentives for reliability may stop utilities from shutting reactors for necessary maintenance. ''This so-called incentive plan,'' wrote John T. Collins, an N.R.C. regional administrator, in an internal memorandum, ''may actually be a disincentive plan insofar as public health and safety is concerned.'' **********Such concern prompted the N.R.C. to study the relationship between utility finances and reactor performance last summer. ''Economic regulation can influence the spirit with which a licensee approaches reactor safety issues,'' that study concluded. ''Short-term economic interest may cause utilities to hurry work, take short cuts, or delay action in order to meet a deadline, a cost limitation, or other factors.'' **********The commission is not raising a straw man issue in drawing a link between corporate balance sheets and safety programs. This spring Toledo Edison's Davis-Besse nuclear plant suffered an accident involving the failure of all systems capable of providing cooling water to the reactor. That bore a strong resemblance to the early stages of the Three Mile Island mishap six years earlier. Improvements to the Ohio reactor had been under discussion for nearly all of those six years, with the company arguing that the changes proposed by the commission were not cost-justified. Now, the N.R.C. lists Toledo Edison's financial weakness as a factor in the accident - an unprecedented finding for the N.R.C., and one that the utility hotly contests. **********The N.R.C. is also getting worried about safety at the two reactors at the Arkansas Nuclear One generating station in Russellville because of the ''financial strain'' on the Arkansas Power and Light Company. Charles L. Kelly, a spokesman for the utility, insists that ''we have informed the N.R.C. that we will take no actions that would possibly have any impact on the safe and efficient operation of a nuclear plant.'' Still, in July the N.R.C. said it was keeping a ''close watch'' on the situation. **********The N.R.C. says that both companies are in financial trouble in part because they are building other reactors, which have run well behind schedule and over budget. But the commission's concern is that the proliferating number of incentive rate programs may cause financial - and thus safety - havoc even to utilities with no outside drain on their cash. **********Commission officials and others offer solutions of sorts. They suggest incentives tied to the grades that utilities receive on N.R.C. performance reports, which include safety criteria as well as down time. And they suggest that incentives be graduated, thus ruling out any precipitous difference in income to a reactor that is down for a few days more than a state has deemed allowable. **********But state regulators seem unimpressed with the N.R.C.'s concerns and suggestions. ''This is a political process,'' said one state regulator, adding that the N.R.C.'s protestations about the deleterious effect of financial incentive programs on reactor safety are ''a nice smokescreen.'' INDEED, the signals the commision has been sending lately have been mixed. While the state public utility commissions control the rates a utility can charge, only the N.R.C. can grant an operating license for a reactor. And earlier this year the N.R.C. dropped its own requirement that applicants for such licenses prove that they are financially stable. The N.R.C. has stated that part of the reason for its new rule was that ''no correlation has been shown between financial qualification and safety.'' **********But that was before the David-Besse incident. Since then, Representative Edward J. Markey, the chairman of a House subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the N.R.C., has formally asked that the commission justify its new rule. In a letter to Nunzio J. Palladino, N.R.C. chairman, Mr. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, noted that ''the facts, as documented by the commission, raise serious questions about the relationship of safety to finances.'' The letter stressed that the states and the commission should present a united front in making sure that plant managers do not sacrifice safety for financial reasons. In fact, he suggested that utilities be ''severely fined or otherwise penalized'' if they cut corners on safety to win bonuses under incentive ratemaking. **********Whether any utilities have already taken such shortcuts is conjectural. Utility executives deny they would ever do so. Their vehemence is understandable and predictable, in that any executive who admits to violating safety rules would open his company to heavy penalties, and might even face jail. **********Existing records paint at best a murky picture of the relationship between incentive programs and safety. Utilities are frequently cited, and sometimes fined, for violating rules and thus increasing their operating time rule violations that increase operating time - for example, for failing to perform certain tests before putting a reactor into service, or operating with an insufficient number of backup systems in working order. But the utilities usually ascribe these failures to oversights or procedural problems. The commission has never accused a company of breaking its rules to win a bonus or avoid a penalty under a state's incentive rate-making policy. MEANWHILE, the brouhaha has not dampened the state's ardor for incentive programs that enhance utility reliability. ''More and more states are looking favorably at incentive regulation, trying to create some artificial carrots and sticks,'' said Michael D. Foley, the director of financial analysis at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. ''I can understand the argument that a utility wants to run a plant for an extra week when it should be down for maintenance, but I don't think that's an issue the states have focused on.'' **********Instead, the states are homing in on the fact that existing reactors typically run only about 60 percent of the year. Utilities can readily switch to alternate fuel sources so that power is not interrupted when the reactor is down. But the switch, particularly when the substitute fuel is oil, can mean a fivefold increase in the operating costs of an electrical generating system. The incentive programs are aimed at preventing the utilities from passing that cost to customers. **********So far, says James C. Peterson, a senior analyst in the N.R.C.'s office of state programs, the existing state incentive programs have not really had much of an impact on utility finances. ''I get the feeling that what the public utility commissions are doing up to this point, although they don't say so, is setting the penalties and rewards low enough so they don't make a horrendous difference, at least for the time being,'' he said. But the N.R.C.'s worry, he continued, is that this ''could change in the future, as they become more confident.'' **********It has already changed in Colorado, where regulators recently established an incentive plan that could cost the Public Service Company of Colorado $3.8 million for each month that its Fort St. Vrain reactor, about 35 miles north of Denver, is closed. **********Under the Colorado system, which is on hold pending the results of a court appeal, the company would collect about 5 cents from customers for each kilowatt-hour produced. That places the reactor's effective breakeven point at 53 percent of the time in operation - that is, if it produces an amont of energy equivalent to 53 percent of the theoretical round-the-clock maximum at which it is rated, its revenues under the incentive plan would be identical to the revenues it would achieve by simply charging its usual rates. **********Below 53 percent, its revenues begin to drop precipitously. But going above 53 percent does not mean extra income. ''We will not give them a windfall for doing what they are in the business of doing,'' said Warren L. Wendling, an engineering analyst for the commission. **********If the system were in effect already, the company would be in financial pain. Since the Fort St. Vrain reactor went into operation in July 1979, it has been down so often that it has produced less than 17 percent of the power that it is rated as capable of providing. EVEN utilities with a fairly stable record of performance are not immune to hefty penalties. State utility commissions are taking a microscopic look at the construction history of some of the extremely expensive reactors now coming into service. Several have ruled that cost overruns - often running into the billions of dollars - from ''imprudence'' or mismanagement cannot be passed on to consumers. **********For example, Kansas's Corporation Commission has told two investor-owned utilities, Kansas Gas and Electric of Wichita, and Kansas City Power and Light, that of their combined investments of nearly $3 billion in a reactor at Wolf Creek, $160.4 million will not be chargeable to customers because of imprudence in construction. Another $944.4 million was judged to be excess capacity, which the commission said could be collected from ratepayers over 30 years, but with no return on the investment over that period. **********In addition, the commission ruled, for the portion that was spent prudently and is not excess capacity, recovery will be allowed at the normal rate of return, but only on an amount equal to what the companies would have had to spend to build a coal plant of the same capacity - that is, the company's guaranteed profit will be measured on an investment of $1,290 per kilowatt of capacity, instead of the roughly $2,500 actually spent. That cuts out another $232.9 million in recoverable expenses. **********Although this is a financial wound of the magnitude that the N.R.C. fears can cause lax safety programs, Gary L. Haden, an executive with the commission, says he is certain that the utilities will continue proper maintenance of the reactor, no matter at what cost. ''We don't think they're going to take any shortcuts at Wolf Creek,'' he said. ''Their financial life depends on running that plant safely and smoothly. We think they recognize that that is the worst place they could cut back.'' **********Lyle Koerper, a spokesman for Kansas City Gas and Electric, would not comment on the proposed financial plan. But he did say that his company has asked the commission for a rehearing on 71 separate points. **********Southern California Edison may soon be in an equally uncomfortable financial position. Hearings started in San Francisco last week on a proposed disallowance of about $1 billion of the $4.5 billion construction cost of the San Onofre reactors, which are also subject to penalties if they run at less than 55 percent of capacity. David M. Barron, a utility executive, said his company stood ready to trot out a panel of ''nationally known experts'' to rebut any charges of imprudence in building the reactors. **********The Long Island Lighting Company is facing an even larger disallowance of construction costs associated with its reactor in Shoreham. The New York State Public Service Commission has ruled that 30 percent of the $4.5 billion it cost to build Shoreham was due to mismanagement, and thus cannot be passed along to ratepayers. The regulators have gone to great lengths to document their case: The ruling was the result of a five-year study of Shoreham that cost $3 million; the written results filled 3,775 pages. Lilco contests the findings. **********In many ways, Lilco's current woes represent a microcosm of many of the financial issues being brought on the table by the N.R.C. and the states right now. The utility was judged financially sound by the N.R.C. when it received a construction permit more than a decade ago. It is in precarious financial condition now - a fact that proponents of the N.R.C.'s decision to drop its financial qualification rule for licenses point to in arguing that financial strength at the time a permit is granted is irrelevant. **********That argument may be moot, in that no company has applied for a permit to build a new nuclear reactor in 10 years. More pressing is the question of whether Lilco, faced with absorbing $1.35 billion in costs it thought it could pass along as well as with continuing difficulties in getting an emergency evacuation plan acceptable to the state, will ever be able to get Shoreham operating at full speed. If it does, both the N.R.C. and Congress may have their test case for whether severe financial difficulties do wind up affecting safety."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/04/business/advertising-geer-dubois-shows-how-to-reduce-costs.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Geer, DuBois Shows How to Reduce Costs", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   Geer, DuBois Shows How to Reduce Costs", "body_text": " **********Back in the old days when Geer, DuBois was a midtown agency, it created Dry Dock Country for a bank client. **********Now that it has opened up the nether regions of the borough to agency migration as a way of escaping the high costs of leasing, we see that the agency has staked out a part of the new real estate for its very own.

In addition, the securities that CBS is offering its shareholders in exchange for their stock carry terms that restrict the amount of debt that CBS could assume in a merger. **********Mr. Turner's offer would increase CBS's debt far beyond the level permitted in the new offering. **********Analysts generally praised the plan, saying that CBS, without hurting itself financially, had managed to buy itself protection from takeovers that involve a high level of debt. [Page D4.]  Announcing the offer to analysts at a meeting yesterday in New York, Thomas H. Wyman, CBS's chairman, said, ''It is evident that our health will remain quite solid,'' **********''I think this will fend off Mr. Turner and allow CBS to go back to running its businesses,'' said Joseph Fuchs, a vice president and media analyst at the Wall Street firm of Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Turner Challenges Plan **********In Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting System said it would vigorously challenge CBS's buyback program. Late yesterday, a Federal Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted Turner Broadcasting's request for an expedited hearing, set for July 24, to seek an injunction against the CBS offer. **********CBS was the most heavily traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $118.625, up $1.125. The stock price is well below the $150-a-share value that CBS placed on its bid, reflecting Wall Street's assessment that, with no takeover in the offing, the share price would decline after the buyback was completed. **********Mr. Turner made his offer, which he valued at $175 a share in notes and securities, on April 18. Under the offer, the merged company would have to pay interest on the $5.4 billion in notes that he was proposing to exchange for CBS stock. In addition, it would have to pay off the principal. CBS maintained that the offer would add so much debt to the merged company that it would be forced into bankruptcy. **********Initially, Wall Street was skeptical of the Turner bid, questioning both the value of the securities and whether regulatory approval would be obtained before the offer expired. Some analysts said the value of Mr. Turner's bid was much less than $175 a share. **********But speculators were intrigued by the offer, which came when other takeovers in the broadcast industry, notably the purchase of the American Broadcasting Companies by Capital Cities Communications, had focused attention on the unrealized value of media companies. **********Interest in CBS had already been provoked by reports that a politically conservative group, Fairness in Media Inc., was urging conservatives to acquire a stake in the company. **********Aggressive CBS Response **********CBS's recapitalization program indicates that despite Wall Street's initial impulse to dismiss Mr. Turner's bid, it proved sufficiently serious to provoke an aggressive response from CBS. **********Yesterday's move marked the company's most definitive effort to thwart Mr. Turner, capping a three-month campaign both on Wall Street and at the regulatory agencies. In documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission, CBS had questioned the viability of the offer and questioned Mr. Turner's fitness to take over the broadcasting licenses held by CBS. **********''The Ted Turner offer was not financially strong enough to be successful,'' Mr. Fuchs of Kidder, Peabody said. ''Nevertheless, the threat of this hostile offer, and the possibility that others might improve on such an offer, forced CBS to restructure.'' **********Under the terms of the CBS offer, which was valued at a total of $954.8 million, shareholders would receive $40 in cash and $110 principal amount of a 10 7/8 percent senior note due 1995 for each share tendered. CBS estimated that, taking into account dividends, interest from the notes and interest from investing the cash, the annual yield of the package would be nearly double what shareholders are currently earning in dividends. **********CBS Borrowing **********To raise money for the cash portion of the deal, CBS is borrowing $137 million in short-term debt. The balance will be raised through a $123 million private placement of preferred stock convertible into common stock. The $10 convertible series B preference stock would be issued to five institutional holders. It would be convertible at a rate to be determined during a specific period after the exchange offer. **********The repurchase program would increase CBS's debt from $386 million at the end of 1984 to $1.3 billion. To reduce this debt, Mr. Wyman said that the company would begin a program of asset sales expected to produce $300 million in after-tax proceeds. At the same time CBS would attempt to reduce its corporate overhead by $20 million by 1987, he said. **********Mr. Wyman declined to specify what assets would be sold, but said they would include properties from various operations. **********Mr. Wyman said that, despite the buyback, earnings per share in 1985 would be about the same as in 1984, when CBS earned $212.4 million, or $7.15 a share. **********Edward Atorino, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said; ''The offer has a lot of defensive characteristics including the addition of significant debt, the issuance of debentures, the issuance of preferred shares in friendly hands as well as restrictive financial covenants that would make it difficult for an acquirer who is attempting to buy the company with debt.'' **********Covenants, or restrictions, relating to the $700 million in notes do not permit CBS's debt-to-capitalization ratio to exceed 70 percent without approval of the continuing independent board of directors. **********In addition, covenants associated with the preferred stock put a 75 percent limit on the debt ratio that cannot be waived by the board. **********CBS said that after the buyback, its ratio of total debt to total capitalization plus short-term debt would rise to 66 percent, compared with the 83 percent that CBS says would result from a Turner buyout. CBS's debt ratio was 19.9 percent before its purchase of the Ziff-Davis consumer magazine group earlier this year.. **********Although all board members are expected to tender their shares, Mr. Wyman said that William S. Paley, the founder of CBS Inc. and its retired chairman, would not tender his 6 percent stake. As a controlling shareholder, if he were to tender, his profits on the sale would be taxed as dividends rather than at the lower capital-gains rate, under tax law. Instead, Mr. Paley has the right under the offer to sell 21 percent of his shares to CBS at any time between 1988 and 1995 for $150 a share in cash. **********The buyback, which some Wall Street analysts are calling a ''poison pill,'' was orchestrated by Morgan Stanley & Company, CBS's investment banker. **********''The poison pills in the form of debt limitations attached to both the senior notes and preferred stock issues seem virtually certain to prohibit takeovers that include significant debt in the offering package,'' Mr. Fuchs said. **********CBS executives said they do not foresee problems in gaining approval for the offer from the Securities and Exchange Commission."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/21/world/minorities-in-new-zealand-push-for-equality.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1985-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MINORITIES IN NEW ZEALAND PUSH FOR EQUALITY", "print_headline": "MINORITIES IN NEW ZEALAND PUSH FOR EQUALITY", "body_text": " **********At first glance, it might seem that blond hair and blue eyes are almost a residency requirement in New Zealand, so dominant are the descendents of the English immigrants who came here by the boatfull in the mid-19th century. **********Yet New Zealand is a decidedly mixed racial society, and nowhere is that more evident than in Auckland.

But those familiar with the situation say high unemployment among Pacific islanders and Maoris and animosity between the youths and the police fueled the trouble. **********New Zealand is experiencing its equivalent of the civil rights movement of the 1960's in the United States, including the division between the moderates who want to work within the dominant white system and the radicals who want to drastically alter it. **********One manifesto of the radicals is a book called ''Maori Sovereignty,'' by Donna Awatere, a child psychologist. ''We Maori,'' she wrote, ''are engaged in an epic war. There is, at this time, no blood involved, no shock of physical combat, so the nature of the battle is disguised. Its life and death quality is lost.'' **********New Zealand, in her view, is a ''confrontation of two ways of life where one side determines the rules.'' **********The radicals call for affirmative action to redress injustices, a return of land to Maoris and separate development within a system of communal tribes. **********Hiwi Tauroa, a 57-year-old former high school principal, is the Government's race relations conciliator and a leading Maori moderate.

There have been modest political gains as well. In the October 1983 election, five Polynesians won seats on the 21- member Auckland City Council, up from two. **********The political improvement has been outpaced by the greater cultural recognition recently for New Zealand's Polynesians. There has been an increase in the teaching and popularity of the language, arts and customs of the Maori people, whose history says they came here in fleets of sea-going canoes hundreds of years before the first European explorer, Abel Tasman, arrived in 1642. **********The separate development idea appears to have only a small following. Mr. Tauroa said it was more practical to work for smoother race relations through education and hard work on both sides. **********''The European has never really had to sit down and consider why he occupies the positions of advantage in this society,'' Mr. Tauroa said. **********''But on the Maori side,'' he added, ''there is sometimes too much excuse- making.

Adding Texas Oil and Gas would lessen steelmaking's contribution to revenues to 25 percent. **********Texas Oil and Gas, based in Dallas, is known as a top low-cost performer in its industry, with an entrepreneurial management structure. **********Rumors for a Few Weeks **********A U.S. Steel acquisition of Texas Oil and Gas has been rumored on Wall Street in the last few weeks and Texas Oil and Gas stock has jumped more than $4 a share as a result. **********But after the announcement of the talks yesterday, Texas Oil and Gas stock dipped by 37.5 cents, to $19, and U.S. Steel stock fell $1, to $28. Analysts said the drop in Texas Oil and Gas stock indicated that investors believed any offer might be in stock and not cash, or at least not all in cash. **********They also thought that the price U.S. Steel would have to pay might not be so high as some original estimates. ''Reality is setting in,'' an analyst said. Some suggested that a merger might not be in the offing, and that some other form of business combination was planned. $21 to $25 Share Price Seen Analysts are now talking about a price of $21 to $25 a share for Texas Oil and Gas. An acquisition at $25 a share for the 210 million common shares outstanding of Texas Oil and Gas would cost U.S. Steel $5.2 billion. **********In 1982, the company paid more than $6 billion for Marathon, and U.S. Steel's oil and gas operations accounted for more than half of the Pittsburgh company's $19.1 billion in sales last year, while steel and related resources contributed 35 percent. **********Nevertheless, U.S. Steel has not abandoned steel, nor does it seem about to, although some analysts have raised that possibility for a few years from now. ''They have improved themselves dramatically as a steel company,'' said an analyst, David Fleischer of Prudential-Bache Securities. ''They can make money in steel when most of the rest of the industry cannot.'' **********But even as the steel unit has been whipped into a smaller and more efficient operation, David M. Roderick, U.S. Steel's chief executive, has long been looking for a further acquisition in his drive to reshape the traditional steel company. **********Analysts yesterday praised the choice of Texas Oil and Gas. ''They've had one fantastic growth rate,'' said John W. Hughes, an analyst at Rotan Mosle Inc. in Houston. The company had 27 years of unbroken earnings gains until the last fiscal year, ended Aug. 31, when it recorded its first decline. **********The natural gas industry is suffering from weak pricing and an oversupply of gas as it moves toward a free market and is undergoing drastic regulatory changes. **********Texas Oil and Gas said its profit fell 20 percent, to $277 million, or $1.32 a share, from the previous fiscal year. Analysts said it might well show another earnings decline in fiscal 1986. **********This raises the question: Could U.S. Steel, with a natural gas acquisition, end up dependent on three depressed businesses if energy prices drop further and steel fails to recover? **********U.S. Steel's Long-Term Focus **********But analysts said that U.S. Steel in its choice of acquisitions was acting for the long run. Mr. Fleischer, who said he had recently visited Texas Oil and Gas officials, said ''the deal probably does make sense for both sides when given a long enough time horizon.'' He said he had the impression Texas Oil and Gas had an interest in being acquired by a company such as U.S. Steel that would allow it independence in operation, as it does with Marathon. **********Texas Oil and Gas management might have feared that it would become the target of an unfriendly takover if its earnings dropped again next year, he said. Its stock came down from a high of $28 last year to about $14 a few weeks ago when the takeover rumors began. **********Some analysts said U.S. Steel paid a high price for Marathon and would be paying a high price for Texas Oil and Gas. ''If you pay $25, you're overpaying,'' said John J. Jones, analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''But the mentality of U.S. Steel is that they want to build assets away from steel and don't care what it costs.'' **********Eugene Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, suggested the maximum takeover price might be only $20 to $21 a share. He said the firm of John S. Herold, which appraises energy companies, had valued Texas Oil and Gas at $17 a share, and that most energy companies had sold at a discount to the Herold appraisals. **********Any purchase using stock or debt -unless structured in some innovative way - would not be in the best interests of U.S. Steel shareholders, some analysts said, because it would dilute U.S. Steel's earnings. **********''With long-term debt of $5.7 billion, I don't know if U.S. Steel could go for a cash deal,'' Mr. Hughes of Rotan Mosle said. ''You can see a tremendous dilution and that's what people are looking at.'' U.S. Steel's stock has dropped recently to $28 from about $32, possibly reflecting shareholder discomfort with the costs of a new acquisition, analysts said. **********Marathon Oil and Texas Gas and Oil have little in commmon. Marathon's great strengths are its half-interest in the Yates field in Texas and 38 percent stake in the Brae field in the North Sea. Texas Oil and Gas focuses on natural gas. Three-quarters of its business is in the production end, with much of the rest in its gathering and transmission operation. 79% of Supplies From Others The company operates 56 intrastate gas gathering systems, which generally hook up wells to pipeline systems. Last year, it purchased 79 percent of its supplies from independents and took the rest from its own wells. **********Under a new ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, interstate pipeline companies will have to transport gas for intrastate companies to markets, and some analysts have suggested that under the circumstances Texas Oil and Gas would be a takeover candidate by an interstate pipeline company. **********That has not happened, however, and Mr. Hughes of Rotan Mosle said he believed, before the U.S. Steel announcement, that Texas Oil and Gas was looking to make an acquisition, not be acquired. **********Government regulations will soon allow companies such as Texas Oil and Gas to enter the interstate market, but this opportunity is clouded by the drop in gas prices. Mr. Hughes said they have fallen to $2.09 per thousand cubic feet this year, from $2.78. **********One thing Marathon and Texas Oil and Gas do have in common is a strong cash flow. Marathon's cash flow of more than $1 billion has been a boon to U.S. Steel's operations. Texas Oil and Gas said it generated cash flow of $725 million, in the fiscal year 1985, just 4 percent below cash flow in the fiscal year 1984."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/07/business/data-bank-april-7-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data Bank;   April 7, 1985", "print_headline": "Data Bank;   April 7, 1985", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/15/business/aug-1-10-car-sales-fell-10.1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUG. 1-10 CAR SALES FELL 10.1%", "print_headline": "AUG. 1-10 CAR SALES FELL 10.1%", "body_text": " **********New-car sales fell 10.1 percent in the August 1-10 period, the major American automobile manufacturers said here today.

TIMBERS, a New York money manager, plans to apply a Shakespearean quotation, ''The better part of valor is discretion,'' to the stock market. His strategy is to prepare to take some profits. As chief investment officer of the Portfolio Group Inc., an independent subsidiary of the Chemical New York Corporation, Mr. Timbers manages $1.5 billion for clients, mostly individuals. **********Many portfolio managers, he said, are facing a common problem, albeit a pleasant one, thanks to the spirited advance in stock prices since early January. ''In simple terms,'' he said, ''the dilemma is this: Should a manager sell out, lock up the profits and go on vacation for the rest of 1985?'' **********Obviously, he added, most professional managers will not embark upon such a drastic course of action. For one thing, many professionals believe they can beat the market during the rest of 1985. In addition, most managers were whipsawed by the stock market in 1984 and are eager to show clients - and themselves - that they can perform handsomely in an equity market that, so far this year, has shown a surprisingly strong recovery. **********On Wall Street, moreover, there is increasing talk that the ''second leg'' of the bull market that lasted from August 1982 to mid-1983 is finally making its long-delayed, widely predicted appearance. **********On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 1,297.92. In early trading yesterday, the closely watched barometer was above 1,300, but selling pressure in the afternoon made the Dow finish at 1,287.88, off 10.04 points. **********Mr. Timbers, however, plans to take some profits and build up his cash position. **********At present the typical balanced portfolio under his direction consists of 45 percent stocks, 45 percent bonds or other fixed-income securities and 10 percent cash. Although the Portfolio Group executive believes the equity market can still make further headway, his intention is to build up the cash position to about 25 percent before the end of March. ''It's basically a question of when you move,'' he said. ''Later this year I expect interest rates to rise, and that could spell trouble for the stock market.'' **********One challenge, according to Mr. Timbers, is that the equity market has run ahead so far and so fast this year that it has become difficult to find new ideas for investing client money. ''Virtually the only stocks already in our portfolios that we continue to buy are Ford Motor, Roadway Services and R.H. Macy,'' he said. ''However, we have made new commitments in the Wackenhut Corporation, the nation's largest publicly owned security company, and the Lotus Development Corporation, a leading manafacturer of application software for personal computers. Another recent portfolio addition is Russ Berrie & Company, which markets impulse gift items.'' **********As for the problem facing numerous money managers, Mr. Timbers said he wonders whether 1985 might turn out to be a year like 1976. ''This is the first time since 1976 that we've seen such a run-up in stock prices early in the year,'' he said. **********In January 1976 the Dow industrials rose 122.87 points - the biggest point gain ever for a single month - to finish the month at 975.28. It amounted to an advance of 14.4 percent. But by the end of 1976, when the industrial average closed at 1,004.65, the total gain for the entire year came to only 17.9 percent. Thus, the bulk of that year's advance occurred in January. Furthermore, after the end of 1976, it took nearly four years for the Dow to climb back above the 1,000 mark. **********In support of his intention to increase the cash position in the portfolios he manages, Mr. Timbers cited a computer printout prepared by the Indata Services Company. It recorded the performance of 691 pension and profit-sharing accounts with a total of $86.5 billion under management. **********From the start of 1985 through last Friday, the median return of all managers, according to Indata, was 9.7 percent. This total return - market appreciation plus dividends - compared with 7.1 percent for the Dow industrials in the same period. **********''My thesis is that it behooves you as a money manager to lock in some of that return,'' Mr. Timbers said. ''At the Portfolio Group, we run a commingled stock fund for pension and profit-sharing clients that is ahead 14.5 percent so far. **********''Now if we were to lock in that gain and simply invest in Treasury bills for the remainder of this year, we would be assured of a total return of around 22 percent for all of 1985. I submit that most money managers would be satisfied with that kind of performance.'' **********Furthermore, pension funds and other institutions generally are not required to pay income taxes on their market profits. Mr. Timbers said a major difference in managing money for individuals, as opposed to institutions, was that the time horizon in stock selection tended to be considerably longer for individual investors, who must pay income taxes on their gains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/23/business/industry-uncertain-on-newsprint-costs.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1985-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Industry Uncertain On Newsprint Costs", "print_headline": "Industry Uncertain On Newsprint Costs", "body_text": " **********After four recent postponements of price increases, the newsprint industry is wondering whether the latest rise, scheduled for July 1, will take hold. **********Newspapers had to cope with a 6.7 percent wholesale price increase last summer, and were expecting another 6.6 percent rise in January.

McMaster, executive vice president of the Bowater Paper Company's pulp and paper group in Greenville, S.C., said: ''Foreign competition is a real concern to us, particularly with the strong dollar. The best newsprint market in the free world is in the United States, and overseas competitors are really coming out of the woodwork.'' **********Indeed, the strength of the dollar has apparently altered historical newsprint supply patterns. Newsprint from Sweden, Finland and Norway, which accounted for five-tenths of 1 percent of American consumption in 1983, jumped to 1.5 percent of last year's use. Analysts estimate that Scandinavian newsprint will make up 3 percent of American supply this year. What is more, they predict that exports from Britain, West Germany and France, typically a minuscule piece of the American market, will increase this year to about 1 percent. **********Still, many North American manufacturers have continued to report healthy sales. Abitibi, which produced two million of the 27 million metric tons of newsprint used worldwide last year, said its sales increased about 4 percent in the first quarter. Bowater, one of the largest American producers, said its revenue from newsprint increased 5 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/15/business/norman-lear-in-new-effort.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Norman Lear In New Effort", "print_headline": "Norman Lear In New Effort", "body_text": " **********Norman Lear, who with his partner sold TV production holdings to the Coca-Cola Company for $485 million earlier this year, said today that he had formed a new company, Act III Communications, to create or buy new entertainment and communications businesses. **********Randy Reiss, who has been president of domestic television and video programming at the Paramount Pictures Corporation, was named president and chief executive of Act III. **********In an announcement, Mr. Lear said only that Act III had been ''formed for the acquisition and/or creation of businesses within the entertainment and communications spheres.'' **********In August, Mr. Lear and his partner, A.

Haughey, today attacked the agreement between Britain and the Irish Republic to give Dublin a limited voice in the affairs of Northern Ireland, and he vowed to fight its ratification in Parliament. **********By taking a consultative role in the affairs of the North, Mr. Haughey said, Dublin would be assuming responsiblities for security matters without having any power, since Northern Ireland would remain ruled by Britain. This arrangement, Mr. Haughey said, would conflict with the Irish Constitution. **********Moreover, Mr. Haughey said he vigorously opposed the agreement's recognition of Northern Ireland's status as an integral part of the United Kingdom. This, in his view, undermines efforts to unify Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic eventually. **********''This is a severe blow for Irish unity and Irish nationalism,'' Mr. Haughey said. **********Ahead in Opinion Poll **********Mr. Haughey's attitude toward the agreement is important because his party, Fianna Fail, is the largest single grouping in the Parliament. And in the most recent public-opinion poll, Mr. Haughey led Garret FitzGerald, the Prime Minister, by 19 percentage points. **********Mr. Haughey's opposition to the agreement is a greater threat to its long-term survival than to its ratification. The two parties in the ruling coalition met today and agreed to ratify the accord. Mr. FitzGerald's Fine Gael Party and the Labor Party together hold 86 seats in the Parliament, compared with 75 seats for Mr. Haughey's party. **********''It looks like we have a comfortable majority,'' said Peter Prendergast, the Government's press secretary. ''But there will certainly be emotional and divisive debates over this issue.'' **********Mr. Haughey said his party would try to change the agreement if it came to power. ''We will certainly not be prepared to accept it in its present form,'' he said. **********Given Mr. Haughey's high rating in the polls and the fact that an election must be held within two years, many political analysts say it is likely that the opposition will come to power, unless the troubled Irish economy picks up soon. **********Accord Called Reasonable **********But the early reaction here to the agreement has been cautiously favorable. Under the accord, the Dublin Government is given a mechanism for pressing its views on virtually all matters touching the Roman Catholic minority in predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland. Thousands of people have been killed in the province in sectarian political violence since 1969. **********The agreement states that Northern Ireland will remain British until a majority of its inhabitants want a change in that status, which most today say they do not. But the delicately worded accord also accepts the legitimacy of the nationalist position, provided those seeking a unified Ireland press their case through persuasion rather than violence. **********In a front-page editorial today, The Irish Independent, Dublin's largest daily, called the agreement ''reasonable, balanced, restrained,'' adding, ''It occupied the middle ground in which peace and reconciliation will be recovered.'' **********The Irish Times said: ''The Irish-Anglo agreement is a reasonable deal. It is not a solution; it is a beginning. It has to be welcomed.'' **********The Cork Examiner termed the pact ''one small move toward sanity and peace.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/14/world/capitol-hill-gets-a-new-plea-on-mx.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1985-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAPITOL HILL GETS A NEW PLEA ON MX", "print_headline": "CAPITOL HILL GETS A NEW PLEA ON MX", "body_text": " **********The Secretary of Defense and the senior adviser on arms control urged Congress today to approve continued production of the MX missile, both to encourage a new agreement on reducing nuclear weapons and also because such offensive power will be needed long after a proposed defense against missiles begins to take shape. **********Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and Paul H. Nitze, the Administration arms control adviser, appeared before a defense policy panel of the House Armed Services Committee to press for release of $1.5 billion, frozen last year, to procure 21 MX intercontinental missiles. The full Senate will vote on the issue next week and the House during the following week. On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense voted 7 to 4 to approve releasing the funds. **********Today, the witnesses before the Armed Services Committee policy panel defended the MX program and President Reagan's proposal to seek a high-technology strategic defense, based partly in space, against Soviet ballistic missiles. The concept is commonly referred to as ''Star Wars.'' **********Less Optimism on 'Star Wars' **********In answer to a question, Mr. Nitze said that he was not sure that a failure by Congress to vote for the MX production would make any ''immediate and dramatic difference'' in the arms talks in Geneva, but he added that the Russians might believe the MX would later be revived. He made clear he thought long-range chances of achieving a treaty were better with the missile. **********Mr. Nitze did not display the enthusiastic and unqualified optimism of Mr. Weinberger that a foolproof ''Star Wars'' defense can be devised. **********Instead, Mr. Nitze, who has served as a maker of national security policy much of the time since the 1940's, said that ''should new defensive technologies prove feasible,'' the United States would ''hope'' to shift from the present strategy of nuclear deterrence through retaliation to one in which defenses ''play an increasing role.'' **********Show of 'Resolve' Urged **********Both witnesses told the panel that a vote to approve spending the frozen funds, and later a vote to approve another $4 billion for another 48 missiles, would constitute a signal to the Soviet Union of United States ''resolve.'' This, the officials argued, would encourage Soviet officials to agree to a new arms reduction treaty at the Geneva talks, which resumed yesterday. **********The votes this week are increasingly expected to favor the Administration position, but some doubt about the outcome remains. **********Mr. Weinberger dismissed questions about whether the Soviet Union could overcome a strategic defensive shield with more offensive ballistic missiles or with measures to destroy or to parry the defensive devices. **********''I don't think it can be saturated'' by more offensive weapons, he said, adding, ''it can't be overwhelmed.'' He offered no explanation. **********Military Value Stressed **********Mr. Nitze, like Mr. Weinberger, stressed an opinion that the 100 MX missiles that the Administration wants to deploy are needed for their mililtary value more than as a bargaining inducement during arms control talks. **********''Even in the first stages of a possible transition to a more defense-reliant balance,'' Mr. Nitze said, ''offensive nuclear forces and the threat of nuclear devastation will remain the key element of deterrence.'' The word ''key'' was underlined in the text of Mr. Nitze's statement. **********At one point, Mr. Nitze's more conservative approach about strategic defense seemed to embarrass Mr. Weinberger. In answer to a question, Mr. Nitze said that if the defensive research is ''not successful,'' the United States would have to continue to rely on deterrence based on devastation of an attacker. **********Mr. Weinberger interjected that ''we don't know if we can get it,'' but the United States faced an ''almost certainty'' that the Soviet Union would eventually develop an effective defense. **********Survival of System an Issue **********Mr. Nitze said he had accurately reflected Administration policy in a speech in Philadelphia last month in which he said that even a technologically feasible defense would not be deployed unless it could survive a Soviet attack and could be built as inexpensively as Soviet countermeasures. **********The Defense Secretary was asked if the MX, which is to be based in missile silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, could be made more capable of surviving an attack by what is called ''point defense,'' or an antimissile shield for a limited area. **********''Point defense is not what the Strategic Defense Initiative is all about,'' Mr. Weinberger said, saying the goal was a ''thoroughly relilable, nonnuclear'' defense that could ''protect the entire nation and Europe.'' **********In answer to questions, Mr. Weinberger said several times that the defense initiative was not designed to prevent the incursion of ''air breathing'' threats such as bombers and pilotless cruise missiles. He said, however, that the missile defense would be worth the effort and money, and he indicated that additional effort might later be given to continental air defense. **********On the question of the vulnerability of the MX, Mr. Weinberger said an ''engineering breakthrough'' had been found in ways to further reinforce silos that would ''enormously'' increase the ability of MX missiles to ride out an attack. **********This was a reference to scale-model tests in which conventional explosives were used. Representative Charles E. Bennett of Florida, the most senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, remarked that this was a research program and that military officers had indicated it might take $15 billion to build better silos. **********Mr. Weinberger also cast more doubt about the quality of the current United States land-based Minuteman missiles than has any previous Secretary of Defense. He said the present missiles had ''nothing remotely resembling the accuracy of the MX'' and indicated he believed Minuteman posed no serious threat to Soviet missiles on the ground."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/business/beatrice-debt-cut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beatrice Debt Cut", "print_headline": "Beatrice Debt Cut", "body_text": " **********The Beatrice Companies said that it had lowered its debt by $522 million with proceeds from a recent 14.4-million-share offering of its stock and the sale of its STP Corporation unit to the Union Carbide Corporation.

That would leave workers with a 1.2 percent average real wage gain. For the current year, he estimates, raises have averaged roughly 5 percent, against a C.P.I. of about 3.2 percent - a real wage gain of 1.8 percent. **********Even if inflation does not worsen next year, white-collar workers, who generally beat the averages, may feel disappointed by the increases in their pay envelopes in 1986. Managers' raises next year will average 6.3 percent, down from 6.8 percent in 1985, says Lance Berger, an economist with the Hay Group, a Philadelphia management consulting firm. The rest of the white-collar sector, including professional and clerical workers, will get average raises of 5.9 percent, also less than in 1985. ''As corporate performance continues to be pedestrian, more companies are taking a stronger containment approach to their people costs,'' said Mr. Berger. **********The Politics of Platinum **********The United States has banned imports of South Africa's gold Krugerrand, but this country imports 84 percent of another precious metal from South Africa - platinum. That metal is used by the aerospace industry for rocket fuel cells, by the auto industry for controlling car emissions, and by gasoline and fertilizer producers in myriad ways. **********Platinum may have a more glittering future than gold, says Jeffrey Christian, a metals analyst for J. Aron, a unit of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Not only are its uses growing, but the turmoil in South Africa, which produces 90 percent of the world's platinum could disrupt supplies, causing the metal's price to soar. This is the major reason platinum has been rising the last six months,'' he said. Prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have risen from a low of $250 an ounce this summer to about $330 last week. **********With investment demand growing worldwide, Johnson Matthey & Company, an international refiner and fabricator of precious metals with offices in Malvern, Pa., will offer a platinum medallion in January as part of its ''Freedom the American Way'' series. **********Riskier Business **********Cameroon made the list. So did Egypt, the Ivory Coast, Jamaica, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. These nations, says William D. Coplin, director of political research services at consultant Frost & Sullivan Inc., will pose a greater political risk for business next year than in 1985. **********Most are considered an increased risk because of poor economic conditions and unstable governments. ''The crisis in the Philippines could have effects worldwide on international business, especially if the United States gets involved,'' said Mr. Coplin. But Saudi Arabia wound up on the list for another reason: It restricts imports and foreign-operated business. **********Where might political risks lessen next year for business? Brazil, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, among others. ''Worldwide,'' Mr. Coplin summarized, ''conditions in 1986 are no more risky than in 1985.'' **********High-Tech Tidings **********About 2.2 billion Christmas cards will be mailed this year, and most will wind up in the trash after New Year's Day. But cards that feature holograms, laser-cut designs and microchip music - and that can cost up to $8 apiece - will probably be saved. ''People keep them and put them up on their trees,'' said Robert M. Herlin, president of Graphics 3, a paper engineering company in Jupiter, Fla. **********Now, Thoughtware Inc., a Coconut Grove, Fla., software company, has taken high-tech cards a step further with Jingle Disk.

He said one reason the N.A.S.D. could move faster in establishing a link was that its system of competing market makers was more akin to the system that the London exchange was developing. The Big Board is continuing to investigate linkups for trading with the London exchange as well as exploring a cooperative effort with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. **********Mr. DaPuzzo said that the availability of price quotes from London was important prior to the opening of trading in New York when there had been an important development overnight on a major American stock and when United States investors wanted to know what prices were available to them on major British and international stocks. **********The joint announcement this week ''ties in with the whole movement of interest in how pension funds diversify their assets,'' said James Davin, head of international equity trading at the First Boston Corporation and a member of the board of governors of the N.A.S.D. This new linkup, Mr. Davin said, ''can't help but accelerate the growth of pension fund diversification globally.'' **********Although the agreement initially involves just a swap of information, rather than an actual expansion of trading, the N.A.S.D. described it as a first step toward the creation of such a link. **********'An Important Step' **********''This is an initial step but an important step toward a global equity-trading system,'' Gordon S. Macklin, president of the N.A.S.D., said today in London, where he had been holding talks with London exchange officials. The N.A.S.D. board has already approved the arrangement, while the directors of the London exchange, which has agreed in principle, are expected to clear the two-year pilot project soon. **********Once under way, the Nasdaq's 2,500 ''level two'' automated quote display terminals across the country will carry price quotes on stocks in The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100. These are Britain's largest companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell, British Telecom, British Petroleum, B.A.T Industries and Glaxo Holdings. In addition, Nasdaq subscribers will receive the price listings on about 180 non-British stocks in which there is active market-making in London off the exchange floor. **********For its part, the London board will receive price quotes on 200 leading Nasdaq industrial and financial concerns, including Intel, Apple Computer and MCI Communications, along with about 75 non-British international companies whose American depository receipts are currently traded on Nasdaq. **********The announcement follows closely on other moves toward global trading. Just last week, the Institutional Networks Corporation, known as Instinet, put into operation an electronic stock trading system in London through the terminals of subscribers to Reuters, the information service.

A survey of pet stores by Pets Supplies Marketing showed that only about 32 percent sold cats and a mere 28 percent carried dogs. Contrast that to reptiles and amphibians (40 percent), or fish and birds (83 and 71 percent). Industry experts, in fact, say pet stores sell less than 10 percent of the millions of dogs and cats that change hands every year. **********Owners of stores that do carry puppies and kittens understand full well why their colleagues demur. ''It costs us close to $5 a day to keep a puppy in the shop properly,'' said Mr. Pass of Pass Pets. ''Baby animals need care, understanding and socialization'' - and thus, time and money - added Petland's Mr. Kunzelman. **********So where do all the cats and dogs come from? A huge, fragmented group of animal shelters, commercial breeders, hobbyists, and countless de facto ''breeders'' who find the family pet has presented them with a litter. **********Industry insiders say the biggest source of cats and dogs are casual breeders who use newspaper ads to sell an occasional puppy or litter. In Portland, Ore., for instance, there are some 30 pet stores but more than 150 breeders advertising in local papers, says Ron Boyd of Boyd's Pet Shop there. **********This situation can be frustrating to the approximately 150 large-scale commercial breeders who make their living supplying pure-bred dogs to pet stores. ''There are a whale of a lot of dogs sold out of the newspaper,'' said J. R. Maike, a breeder in Alma, Kan. ''That's our competition and we can't even find it.'' **********Mr. Maike's breeding operation, Sandy's Kennels, is one of the country's largest, shipping up to 7,500 puppies a year to pet shops and garnering sales of nearly $1 million. Sandy's raises 52 different breeds in its own kennels, and buys additional dogs from other breeders. **********According to Mr. Maike, small breeders often sell litters of dogs to large breeders like himself, who in turn sell them to pet stores. A small breeder might command $60 apiece from the larger breeder for puppies. The larger breeder then sells the dogs to several different stores for about $130 apiece, including the cost of freight and vaccination. Stores would sell the dogs for $225 to $295, Mr. Maike said, with the price reflecting veterinary bills, food, employee commissions and other expenses. **********''It may sound like it's a big markup,'' Mr. Maike said, ''but there are a lot of expenses along the way. There isn't that much profit anywhere along the chain.'' **********Cat breeders face an even bleaker situation. Cats ''are not a big business,'' said Linda Lewis, editor of Cat Fancy magazine. Although a purebred Persian cat can sell for as much as $300, ''Breeders will all tell you they don't make money breeding cats,'' Mrs. Lewis said. ''It's a hobby. The big money is in products.'' **********A survey of the magazine's readers showed that 75 percent got their cats from friends, relatives, animal shelters, or by picking up strays. ''Cats are about the same size and do about the same thing,'' Mrs. Lewis said. ''There isn't the incentive to buy a pure-bred that there is in the dog business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/02/world/west-german-to-visit-israel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "West German to Visit Israel", "print_headline": "West German to Visit Israel", "body_text": " **********President Richard von Weizs\"acker is scheduled to visit Israel Oct. 8-11, his office announced today.

Va. **********Inside the gates of the huge, rust- **********colored Weirton steel mill here, **********one of the nation's most closely watched industrial experiments is taking place. **********Just one year ago, on Jan. 10, 1984, the mill's 7,700 workers purchased the 80-year-old complex that dominates this company town. And to the surprise of analysts and its employee- owners alike, the mill has been profitable from the first. **********''We're surviving when a lot of steel companies are still shutting plants down,'' said Walter F. Bish, the bearded, 38-year-old president of the local steelworkers union and a member of the Weirton Steel Corporation's board of directors. ''Employee ownership was the best thing that could have happened to us.'' **********While most steel companies lost money in 1984, Weirton Steel racked up $48 million in profits in the first nine months alone. The performance has caused vast relief throughout West Virginia: Weirton is the state's largest taxpayer and its largest single-location employer. In addition, the mill's success has breathed new life into this melting pot community in the upper Ohio River Valley. **********''Weirton is the success story of the steel companies,'' said John Tumazos, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. ''From a production and cost standpoint, Weirton is better than its competitors in tin plate.'' **********Indeed, with only a 5 percent increase in staff from 1983, Weirton shipped almost 20 percent more steel in 1984 than the 2.1 million tons in the year before. Moreover, its total labor costs were far lower. Its workers accepted a 20 percent wage cut as part of the $386 million package in which they bought the plant from the National Steel Corporation - a cut that they would probably have refused to take from any owners but themselves. **********Some workers still grumble about the pay cut, and others complain that workers do not have the degree of say in management that employee-owners should have. But while the grumbles may bode ill for the future of the experiment, for now most Weirton workers and managers say the company's success stems largely from the high morale and increased productivity that are fostered by employee ownership. **********''It's clear that our cost advantage is not the only thing going for us,'' said Robert L. Loughhead, Weirton's square-jawed, straight-talking 55- year-old chairman. He boasts of the sales staff he hired - Weirton did not have one under National - and of better labor-management relations. **********Because employee ownership is widely viewed as a way to stave off plant shutdowns, every problem and success at Weirton is being studied and debated by industrial economists, management experts and labor supporters around the nation. Indeed, union leaders in the beleaguered steel industry say Weirton's experience has prompted many steelworkers to propose employee buyouts to prevent closings at their mills. Paul D. Rusen, director of United Steelworkers of America District 15 in Wheeling, W. Va., said he has four such proposals on his desk from workers at steel mills and foundries. **********''Employee ownership can make the difference between success and failure,'' said Eugene J. Keilin, a vice president of Lazard Fr eres & Company and the chief architect of Weirton's employee ownership plan. **********''Weirton has lower labor costs, an entirely restructured balance sheet, new management and a big capital program,'' he said. Noting that National could not have won large wage cuts and had said it would not invest in modernization, Mr. Keilin added: ''Without employee ownership, Weirton couldn't have been restructured as a going concern.'' **********The colossal experiment at Weirton Steel is also being watched closely by this town's 26,000 residents, most of whom depend, directly or indirectly, on the company for their livelihoods. Weirton's success has rid them of the Steeltown Blues that seemed here to stay just two years ago. **********At that time, employment at the mill had dropped to 7,000, from 11,000 in 1980. And National Steel intimated that it might shut the mill. **********''We're a one-industry town,'' said Eugene Swiger, a burly mill veteran. ''This would be a ghost town if the mill closed.'' Instead, noted Richard M. Thornton, president of the Weirton division of the Wheeling National Bank, ''It was the best Christmas season for this town's business community in five years.'' **********STILL, future Yuletides in Weirton may not be as full of cheer. For one thing, the high worker morale and recent increases in productivity may well dissipate when the ''honeymoon period'' of employee ownership is over. Many workers still complain about the pay cut. And, since the company's board picks the senior executives and many middle-level management workers remain from National's day, many workers grumble that labor-management relations are hardly better than they were under National Steel. **********Even more troublesome, Weirton Steel, which is expected to report net sales of more than $1.1 billion for 1984, reaps half of its revenues from tin plate. Analysts note that demand for that product continues to shrink as more beverage and food producers switch from tin cans to aluminum or other non-steel containers. **********But Mr. Loughhead insists that the problems are surmountable. Although Weirton is hurt by the 1.5 percent a year decline in demand for tin plate, it has helped itself by landing customers in new markets. Moreover, many analysts predict that a few, higher-cost tin plate producers might drop out of the market, enabling Weirton to grab a larger share. **********''Our strategy is to improve our market share in all of our major product lines, and we have been doing that,'' Mr. Loughhead said. He predicts that Weirton will increase its share of the tin plate market from its current 20 percent to 25 percent ''within a few years.'' **********Mr. Loughhead already has some impressive statistics to point to. Weirton Steel has expanded its customer list for all types of steel to 1,000 accounts from 800 a year ago and is selling to many markets, such as the automobile market, that were previously off-limits to Weirton because they were served by other National plants. The company also has budgeted $700 million for modernization over the next decade. **********Mr. Loughhead, who had been president of the Copperweld Steel Company prior to joining Weirton in **********1983, predicts that despite the weak demand and prices plaguing the steel industry, his company will report another profit in the fourth quarter - something few major steel producers are expected to do. **********IN March 1982, National Steel, then **********the country's fifth-largest steel **********company, stunned Weirton's steelworkers by offering to sell them the mill. After a mediocre 1981, National, which is based in Pittsburgh, 30 miles east of Weirton, saw things getting worse and worse for the mill. (In fact, the mill suffered a $28 million operating loss in 1982). What is more, demand for tin plate was steadily deteriorating. National indicated that if the workers balked at buying the mill, it would likely close all but a few finishing mills employing about 1,100 people, and would perhaps shut the entire complex. **********The Independent Steel Union - a docile company union that Weirton founder Ernest T. Weir helped create and coddle by paying wages above those of the United Steelworkers - hired McKinsey & Company to do a feasibility study on whether the mill could survive under employee ownership. McKinsey concluded that the mill could prosper, but only if employment costs were slashed by a whopping 32 percent. **********The employees bargained with National Steel to reduce the proposed cuts, and persuaded the company, now known as National Intergroup, to retain responsibility for certain pension, life and health insurance liabilities. The workers had some bargaining clout because National did not want to close the mill and take what some analysts estimated would be a $400 million write-off. **********After receiving rousing support from the community, clergy and state, the workers voted by a 6 to 1 margin in favor of employee ownership. ''We decided that this was not going to be another Youngstown,'' said Father Charles Schneider of St. Joseph the Worker in Weirton, referring to the Ohio steel capital that was decimated by mill closings. **********The new company was to pay $193.9 million for the mill, including $74.7 million in cash, and assumed $192.3 million in liabilities. And the workers voted to accept the 20 percent wage cut. ''No one likes to take a pay cut, but it's better to have part of the pie, than no pie at all,'' said Billy Davis, a strip-mill worker for 20 years whose wages dove from $24 an hour to about $19 (some $3 less than under the United Steelworkers contract). **********''I don't think the workers would have given wage concessions to National,'' said Mr. Bish, the union president. ''They wouldn't want to take cuts for a company that was pouring money into other businesses, like savings and loans.'' **********According to Peter F. Marcus, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., the wage cut reduced Weirton's costs by 10 percent, a total of $100 million. That comes to about $50 a ton. He said this resulted in a $45-a-ton operating profit for Weirton in the third quarter, while the industry average was between $1 and $6. **********Some steelworkers still complain that the wage cuts were too large and that they never saw the McKinsey study. But Mr. Bish insists that ''We had to make wage costs competitive. We had to make enough money to modernize. We don't want this to be a short-term deal that lasts five years and then closes down.'' **********Under the employee stock ownership plan, commonly known as an ESOP, one-third of the company's profits are to be distributed among the workers once the company's net worth - meaning its accumulated profits - reaches $100 million. Mr. Loughhead predicts that will happen within a year. Moreover, the workers' share of profits rises to 50 percent once the net worth totals $250 million. **********Analysts say the profit-sharing provisions will have to kick in soon if the experiment in employee ownership is to maintain its momentum. ''In the initial stage of an ESOP, the attitudes on productivity work in your favor,'' said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, ''But the ESOP idea can work against you if the payouts don't come reasonably soon.'' **********Peter Pitegoff, staff counsel for the Industrial Cooperatives Association, a non-profit organization in Somerville, Mass., that helps arrange worker buyouts, suggested that productivity problems could result because Weirton's employees do not have much say in management. ''With things going well right now, the workers are probably comfortable without having much input,'' he said. ''But if the company has problems, workers might become upset about not having more say.'' **********As of now, Weirton employees elect only three of the twelve directors. Eight outside directors are chosen by the lenders and Lazard Fr eres. The last seat goes to Mr. Loughhead. The ESOP's architects at Lazard Fr eres said it was important to give outside directors substantial representation on the board to reassure lenders that this ESOP would be run on a business- like basis, but that theory does not sit well with everyone. **********''It doesn't seem fair that our board is heavily weighted in favor of the financial community when we in theory own the company,'' said Steven Baumann, a blast furnace worker at Weirton for 12 years. **********In four years the employees will gain the right to elect all of the board's members. At that time they will also vote on whether to allow workers to sell their shares to the public. Selling shares would in theory enable them to recoup some of the money they lost through the pay cut, but would water down the benefits of total employee ownership. **********In the meantime, Mr. Loughhead is moving to increase employee participation. Management now meets regularly with teams of workers to discuss their attitudes, problems and suggestions. He said blue-collar suggestions resulted in the company's decision to replace its mill-by-mill spare parts inventory with a more efficient companywide one. **********''Employees have a vast storage of knowledge that hasn't been put to use,'' he said. ''It's often not asked for and is often not gotten.'' **********Moreover, workers can often be resistant to change. ''As owners, workers will be more agreeable to changes in work routines. They might not be agreeable when other people are the shareholders,'' said Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. And that, he concluded, ''is an important factor in a company's long- run competitiveness.'' **********A COMINGSURGE IN ESOP'S **********With dozens of steel mills teetering on the brink of closure, more steelworkers are taking heart in the Weirton example. **********Michael Bilcsik, president of Local 1256 of the United Steelworkers, said his union is studying the idea of an ESOP for the Duquesne Works, a mill near Pittsburgh that was recently closed by the United States Steel Corporation. In addition, there is talk of having the employees buy the Republic Steel Corporation's plant in Gadsden, Ala., which was recently spun off as a condition of Republic's merger with the LTV Corporation. **********''ESOP's are going to be the only savior of heavy manufacturing industry in this country,'' said Paul D. Rusen, director of District 15 of the United Steelworkers. ''ESOP's are often the only way to raise investment capital for modernization.'' **********Under an ESOP, a trust is created, and banks make loans to the trust, which buys the company's stock. The company makes payments to the trust to retire debt, and, as the banks are repaid, the trust allocates company stock to employees. **********ESOP's provide extensive tax advantages. For example, companies can take tax deductions for cash dividends paid to an ESOP and banks do not have to pay income taxes on half of the interest they collect on loans to ESOP's. Recently, ESOP's also have helped companies ward off unwelcome takeover attempts, since employee/shareholders are often more concerned with maintaining their job security than they are with turning a quick profit by selling their shares to another company that might not retain their services. **********According to Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a non-profit association based in Arlington, Va., there are between 800 and 1,200 ESOP's nationwide in which employees are majority owners. The nation's largest employee-owned company in terms of assets is the Parsons Corporation, a Los Angeles-based construction company. Other well- known ESOP's include People Express Airlines, which is 33 percent employee-owned, and W.L. Gore & Associates, a Delaware-based company famous for Gore-Tex. **********Still, ESOP's are no panacea. ''Employee ownership is not a magical powder that you can spread on rusty equipment and make it modern,'' said Eugene Keilin, the Lazard Fr eres partner who worked on the Weirton deal. ''If the fundamentals are reasonably sound, you can put together a plan with employee ownership that works. If not, employee ownership is at best a stopgap.'' **********That is all it turned out to be at the Rath Packing Company. When Rath, an old meat packer based in Waterloo, Iowa, was close to insolvency in 1980, its 2,000 workers voted to purchase it and also took a wage cut. But aging equipment and competition from low-wage, non-union packers forced Rath to file for bankruptcy reorganization in 1983. **********''We can't say that ESOP's will cure any problem,'' said J. Michael Keeling, chief counsel for the ESOP Association of America. ''We can't blame ESOP's for Rath's problems, and it would be a little strong for us to say that the ESOP was the reason Weirton is working. It was certainly a factor.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/29/world/wasted-corner-of-africa-nothing-left-but-hope.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1985-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1080, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WASTED CORNER OF AFRICA: NOTHING LEFT BUT HOPE", "print_headline": "WASTED CORNER OF AFRICA: NOTHING LEFT BUT HOPE", "body_text": " **********Most of the original residents of this dusty, worn-down West African town - the ''real people'' - moved on some time ago, the elderly woman said. The residents were fleeing drought, in the hope that anywhere else would be a better place to be. **********They have since been replaced by others for whom this small patch of poverty holds far more promise than the wasted land they left behind. **********''People must leave and, well, only three people among all these people are of Lere,'' said the woman, De De Diallo, gesturing toward the small crowd that gathered outside her one-room mud house when a sputtering Land- Rover, carrying four road-weary travelers, pulled up in front. **********Mule-drawn carts are the common mode of transportation here, and when a motor vehicle comes along, people gather round it to see if it is bearing any of the large sacks of emergency relief grain that help them make it from day to day. **********'You Try Your Best' **********''All the rest of these people you see are refugees who lost everything and are looking for food.'' Mrs. Diallo went on. ''Everywhere, people are moving because of the drought. They have nothing. They are hungry. We are hungry. All we can do is try our best; you try your best.'' **********Dja - the word for drought in Bambara, the language commonly spoken in the markets in Mali - is changing life here and throughout Mali, a West African nation that is among the world's poorest. The country of nearly eight million people has experienced two consecutive years of severe drought, and some areas have been affected for three or more years in a row. **********When there is no rain, there are eventually no crops, no herds, no money and no stability. Populations shift, villages disintegrate and families are separated. Food producers from rural areas move to cities and become consumers. **********Because of the strong Malian practice of extended family, many people are being supported by relatives who are urban wage earners, increasingly depleting their slim resources. **********No Money for Taxes **********Wage earners have also been affected in other ways. Because of the drought, shortfalls in tax collection in rural areas were expected to amount to about 5 percent of projected budget revenues last year. **********As a result, public employees have experienced delays of about two months in receiving their paychecks, and the relatives who thought they had fled the drought have discovered that it is relentless in its pursuit. **********The drought has visited the village of Niaganabougou, about 400 miles southwest of Lere and 40 miles outside the capital of Bamako, and chased away many of its young people. **********M'Toura Keita, a 76-year-old noble elder, who has watched the villagers depart, including some of his 23 children, said they were ''obliged to go'' because there was nothing for them at home. When there was rain, he said, the Niger River would swell and overflow onto the great plains, flooding rice fields and providing a means of making a living. **********But drought, which has sapped the village several times since the early 1970's, is once again laying waste. In good times, the fields produced tons of grain, and people had to travel from other villages to help with the harvest. Now farmers measure production in pounds. **********'Must Go Someplace' **********''Many young people have departed to the Ivory Coast or other places to look for money,'' said Mr. Keita, his head covered by a white scarf and his eyes shielded by glasses as protection against Mali's pervasive red dust. **********''People must go someplace to get money,'' he said. ''If there was more rice, people would sell more, people would have more money and people would have more to eat. It's the product of their work on the farm that allows them to get married, to set up a household and even to pay taxes.'' **********Such is the case in Lere. But even when food and money are scarce in Mali, there is always enough for a guest. One visitor was given the equivalent of 40 cents, collected within a few minutes, as a gift. **********Mrs. Diallo offered her guests a communal bowl of rice and watery sauce in which floated a few pieces of meat, and, unintentionally, some of the sand that blankets this town. **********She suggested that they eat inside her home rather than in the open air because ''hundreds will come begging'' when they see others with food. **********''There is some grass here that is not to be eaten, but now people beat the grass and cook it and eat it,'' she said, seated on a small stool and surrounded by others. **********''You know that the ants take millet or rice one by one and bring it into their hole,'' she said. ''The hunger is so bad that people will go to the ant holes to get the few ounces stored there. It is hard here, and people need help.'' **********A French Concern Is Helping **********Among other international donors who provide aid, Veterinarians Without Frontiers, a French concern, came to Lere to help the town and other drought-stricken areas of Mali. The organization has undertaken a project intended to aid herders, who lost nearly 70 percent of their cattle last year, to stock dried meet, a staple of the nomadic diet. **********The veterinarians have been buying 84 head of cattle each week in Lere, which they say is one of the most important cattle markets in the country.

There was lots of water in the nearby river, so much that fresh fish were plentiful. Cows were healthy and strong, and everyone had milk to drink. The markets overflowed with cooking oil, butter and grain. Now there is little except hope. **********''There will always be hope because there is a God,'' Mrs. Diallo said matter-of-factly.

Their principal support seems to lie in northern Nicaragua, where the level of fighting and the number of exiles fleeing to Honduras appear to indicate that something close to civil war is being waged. **********Outlook of 2 Salvadorans **********Two Salvadoran guerrilla officials who have spent considerable time in Nicaragua said in separate interviews that they believed the anti-Sandinista rebels were a serious problem. One of the Salvadorans has been involved in organizing the left for over 20 years. **********The Salvadorans said they believed the rebels would wage a long war that would not lead to a military victory but would considerably weaken Nicaragua. **********'War Will Go On' **********''I have told the Nicaraguan comrades that they are in a situation like Mozambique with South Africa,'' one of the Salvadoran leftists said. ''The war will go on, and with American economic pressure they can slowly be strangled.'' **********The existence of a degree of popular support for the guerrillas has become clearer in recent months as the rebel forces have swelled, even though American fianancing has been cut off. **********Accounts from Nicaraguan refugees and recent rebel recruits in Honduras gathered in the last month also indicate that the rebels have greater support than is generally realized, principally among the conservative farming communities across northern Nicaragua. **********The clearest indication of the rebels' appeal, according to both guerrilla officials and Western diplomats in the region, is that the Sandinistas have felt compelled in the last two months to relocate more than 30,000 peasants sympathetic to the guerrillas to camps in Goverment-controlled territory. **********''The Sandinistas think Reagan created the rebels,'' said a Nicaraguan exile leader, Arturo Cruz, in an interview in Costa Rica. ''They are wrong. The insurgency will continue because citizens of my country are in an armed fight.'' **********Mr. Cruz, a former Nicaraguan Ambassador to Washington, has lobbied for aid to the rebels and called on the Nicaraguan Government to negotiate an end to the conflict. **********Military Victory Seems Unlikely **********The guerrillas do not appear capable of militarily defeating the Sandinistas and, with their backers concentrated in the rural north, it seems unlikely that they can hope for the sort of broad insurrection that brought the Sandinistas to power in 1979. **********What seems more likely is a prolonged, bitter fight in which each side counts on committed backers and Nicaragua remains polarized. The rebels seem capable of inflicting considerable damage on the Nicaraguan economy and of maintaining political pressure on the Government. **********Rebel officials say they have made an effort in the last year to wage a small-unit guerrilla war, thereby avoiding heavy casualties. They do not, and probably cannot, control fixed positions inside Nicaragua, but say they are holding rear-guard areas in Jinotega and Zelaya Provinces. **********People Fleeing Across Border **********A separate indication of the Nicaraguan Government's problems is the rapidly increasing flow of exiles fleeing across Nicaragua's borders to Honduras and Costa Rica. According to a United Nations official in Costa Rica, more than 1,000 Nicaraguan refugees have entered the country in the last two weeks, half as many as officially entered in all of 1984. **********Many of the refugees are middle- class students who have fled the draft in Nicaragua and have no desire to fight for the rebels. But hundreds of others are peasants, many of whom can be seen training at the main rebel camp on the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. **********The rebel group that appears to be growing stronger is the Nicaraguan Democratic Force. It is principally led by former members of the Nicaraguan National Guard, but its rank and file is a 14,000-man army composed mostly of peasants who express deep grievances against the Sandinista Government. **********Criticisms of Rebel Soldiers **********Rebel soldiers, dozens of whom spoke in interviews with a reporter during a visit to their camp last month, offered a sharply competing and considerably more conservative vision of how Nicaragua should be ruled than the socialist program offered by the Sandinistas. The rebels criticized rationing, membership in the political militia, state control of crops and prices and Government friction with the Roman Catholic Church, all of which they attributed to the Sandinistas. **********A measure of the seriousness with which the Nicaraguan Government takes the rebel threat is its expenditure of more than 40 percent of this year's budget on defense. The war dominates Nicaraguan politics and has badly dented the economy, according to Western diplomats in the region and several press reports from Managua. **********A key issue that has divided rebel groups is the nature of their leadership, particularly the presence of former National Guard officers in the Nicaraguan Democratic Force. Human rights violations have also been a point of contention within the rebel movement. **********Interviews with officials from all major rebel groups indicate that a majority believe that the movement needs new leadership. Mr. Cruz was the person most frequently mentioned as capable of uniting the rebels, but he has so far refused to take a leading role in the armed movement. **********Although the rebels themselves say they have been badly hurt militarily by the cutoff in United States aid, Western diplomats who monitor the guerrillas say they still enjoy some advantages. The rebels are able to operate out of secure sanctuaries in Honduras, and they have a veteran combat force that fights on terrain that it knows well. One diplomat in Honduras said the rebels had not waged as wide a campaign of sabotage as they are capable of."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/03/world/envoy-to-colombia-named.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Envoy to Colombia Named", "print_headline": "Envoy to Colombia Named", "body_text": " **********President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Charles A.

They expect to see it again in the more lenient view of developing world debt that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d is expected to urge Tuesday at the opening of the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Seoul, South Korea. **********'Real Change' **********''I think it all adds up to a real change,'' according to Joly Dixon, an economist and first secretary of the Washington embassy of the European Communities. ''It's very positive for us.'' **********Even the harshest critics in Congress of the Reagan foreign economic policies are encouraged. ''These are good signs,'' said John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and a leading sponsor of protectionist legislation. ''The real question,'' Senator Danforth added, ''is, 'Will they follow through?' '' **********Representative Jack Kemp, Republican from Buffalo and foe of the Government's dollar policies, said, ''It's gradual, but there is something out there.'' **********The shift toward a policy of re-engagement, analysts note, has come with a change in the people who are managing the Administration's economic affairs. **********Active Support **********Treasury Secretary Baker now dominates economic policy making more than most of his predecessors, and he has won the active support of two prominent economists with reputations for orthodox conservatism - Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker. **********''The ideologues have been replaced by pragmatists,'' Rimmer de Vries, senior international economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said. **********The man who was the most vigorous proponent of the earlier view, Donald T. Regan, the former Treasury Secretary and now the President's chief of staff, typifies the change in position. ''Geo-economic politics have changed from a year ago,'' a White House official said. ''And as chief of staff, he's closer to political realities than he was at Treasury.'' **********Economists and Administration officials attribute the policy shift to the Administration's domestic political self-interests. The flourishing American economy of 1983 and 1984 has slowed sharply this year, exacerbating the recession in agriculture, causing job losses in major manufacturing industries and feeding the protectionist drive in Congress to stem the flow of foreign goods. **********No Alternative **********Congressmen say they fear that protectionism will ignite a storm of retaliatory measures abroad and a decline of the world economy, but they also say they see no alternative without major changes in the Administration's economic policies. **********A political hazard of another kind also worries the Administration, and especially Mr. Shultz. The harsh belt-tightening economic policies that private Western banks and the Administration have sought to impose on developing country debtors have put the fragile new democracies of some of those countries, notably Argentina and Brazil, at risk. **********''He and Baker are getting very close on economic issues,'' according to Robert N. Morris, who left Mr. Shultz' staff in August to join the American affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce. ''The role of the State Department is certainly growing.'' **********One mark of a major shift was the announcement at the Plaza Hotel on Sept. 22 by the United States and the other members of the Group of Five industrial nations - Japan, West Germany, Britian and France - that the dollar was overvalued and that they stood ready to force it down. **********In agreeing that the dollar was too high, the Reagan Administration said in effect that the market place had failed the dollar - a reversal of its origial view that the markets were usually right. **********Government Role **********In agreeing to push the dollar down, the Administration said that government had a role to play in managing currencies - a position the other countries had long accepted but that the Administration had previously disparaged. **********In agreeing to join other countries in pushing the dollar down, and in announcing the agreement on a stage with other finance ministers flanking Mr. Baker, the Administration reasserted its position in the Group of Five, an informal committee of finance ministers and government bankers that had atrophied with the Administration's earlier disinterest. **********And in agreeing to reassert its leadership, the Administration has conceded what it once denied - that its budget deficits cause distortions in currency values, interest rates and trade. But in reasserting leadership, it also appealed to other countries to change policies that, it said, contribute to the distortions as well. **********It wants Japan and West Germany to stimulate their economies with tax cuts and other incentives to spending, arguing that their faster growth means they should buy more American goods and help reduce the American trade deficit. **********''This is a big change from what we were getting before,'' Mr. Dixon said. ''We used to go through months and months of agony just to get some words like those we got from the Group of Five, saying that these problems can be dealt with through cooperative economic policies.'' **********'War Chest' **********Another important signal was President Reagan's trade policy speech the following day, Sept. 23. Free and open trade is essential to world prosperity, he said, but ''unfair'' trade, or other countries' protectionism, must be fought with protectionism. **********The President therefore created a $300 million ''war chest'' to provide export aid to American companies that have been hurt by similarly subsidized foreign competitors. Previously, the Administration had tried to reduce such aid to trim the Federal budget. **********The newest signal will come from Seoul. Treasury Secretary Baker is widely expected to propose bank-lending policies that emphasize long-term, fundamental changes in developing world economies - shrinking government enterprise and building up private enterprise. **********Mr. Baker is likely to encourage Western banks to de-emphasize economic austerity programs that the banks impose when debtor countries fall behind in repaying loans and to make longer-term loans that facilitate economic growth. **********Analysts in part attribute the shift in the Administration's position to difficulties that the President's economic policies have encountered. **********Now, the record-high trade deficits in the face of the slower American economy and protectionist legislation threaten to undo the Administration's earlier gains on inflation and growth. **********INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC TALKS: A WHO'S WHO **********In recent weeks, several groups of international financial leaders have met to discuss or take action on freeing world trade, lowering the value of the dollar and easing the international debt crisis. **********The crisis involves developing countries, mostly in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, which are struggling to repay hundreds of billions of dollars of loans, and threatens the stability of the world financial system. **********At the same time, the strong dollar, which makes American goods more expensive abroad and imports cheaper, has hurt American exports. This, in turn, has prompted calls for trade legislation to protect American industry, a move that could compound the debtor nations' problems by making it more difficult for them to export their way to economic growth. The Reagan Administration opposes protectionism, and has begun supporting alternative strategies for dealing with both the trade and debt problems. The following is a brief description of the groups involved. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Function: Established in Geneva in 1947 as a vehicle for promoting world trade. The organization, also known as GATT, has held seven rounds of trade liberalization talks since its founding. Members: 90 industrialized and developing countries, representing about four-fifths of international trade. The Soviet Union is not a member. Issues: At a meeting in Geneva last week, the group unanimously agreed to open a new round of formal talks on freeing trade, setting in motion meetings that will last for several years. The Reagan Administration sought the new round to help defuse pressures in Congress for measures that would restrict imports. Such measures, the Administration argued, could lead to a worldwide recession. The United States and other industrial countries want the new talks to remove barriers to trading in services, including establishing telecommunications, insurance and banking operations in many third world countries. This is opposed by some developing nations, who argue it would prevent them from developing their own technology and service industries. >International Monetary Fund Function: Established by an agreement at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944 to encourage international cooperation on monetary matters, including maintaining stable exchange rates and overseeing the payment of international debts. Makes short-term loans to nations, both rich and poor, with balance-of-payments deficits, in concert with individual governments and private banks. The loan pool comes from contributions from member nations. In return for such help, the fund imposes tight controls on a borrower's economy. Such controls include restrictions on government spending and wage rates, and are designed to keep inflation down. Members: 149 industrial and developing countries. The I.M.F.'s managing director is Jacques de Larosiere. Issues: Latin American debtor nations have recently stepped up resistance to I.M.F. austerity requirements, arguing that policies that stimulate their economies and encourage exports would allow the region to grow out of its crushing debt problems. The group is now holding its joint annual meeting with the World Bank in Seoul, South Korea, where Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d is expected to announce tomorrow that the United States now supports the growth-oriented approach. He is also expected to urge support for a wider role for the World Bank in solving the debt crisis. Secretary Baker met with leading commercial bankers last week, reportedly urging them to provide fresh loans to debtor nations, a move that many banks - whose portfolios are already filled with shaky loans to developing nations - have said they would resist. The World Bank Function: Also established by the Bretton Woods agreement. Formally called the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it makes direct loans for specific projects such as highways and power plants in developing countries. It currently lends about $12 billion a year, and unlike the I.M.F., it does not provide tight controls on a borrower's overall economy. Members: Same as I.M.F. The United States is its largest contributor. Its president is A. W. Clausen, former chairman of the Bank of America. Issues: At the meetings in Seoul this week, the United States is expected to urge a greater role for the bank. This would include higher maximum lending levels to developing and debtor countries, partly through collaboration with the I.M.F. and commercial banks. The new loans would not be limited to specific projects but could be used for more general purposes. In exchange for the support of the commercial banks, the Administration is expected to ask the World Bank to provide loan guarantees to safeguard the private lenders. Developing countries have expressed reservations about increased cooperation between the World Bank and the I.M.F., fearing that would lead to tougher loan conditions. >Group of Five Function: Meets informally to discuss sensitive international monetary problems. Members: Finance ministers of United States, Britain, France, West Germany and Japan, the major non-Communist industrialized countries. Sets agenda for the larger Group of 10. Issues: At a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York on Sept. 22, the ministers agreed to intervene in world currency markets to drive down the value of the dollar against other currencies, making American goods more competitive abroad. The move to lower the dollar was, in part, an effort by the Reagan Administration to defuse pressure in Congress for protectionist trade legislation. The other countries at the meeting also wanted to avoid protectionist legislation, and its ramifications for their trade. The move marked a shift by the Administration, which has generally resisted intervention to change the dollar's value. Group of 10 Function: Established in 1962. Meets formally to discuss monetary issues. Members: Finance ministers and central bank governors of the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. It actually has 11 members, because Switzerland joined several years ago. Issues: The same as for the Group of Five. Group of 24 Function: Represents developing countries in international monetary and trade matters. Members: Representatives of eight developing countries each from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Group of 24 is the steering committee for a much larger group that includes about 125 developing nations. Its chairman is Juan V. Sourrouille, Economy Minister of Argentina. Issues: Group seeks easier credit and fewer restrictions on I.M.F. loans, and is said to want World Bank lending to rise to $20 billion a year by 1990."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/14/business/record-for-consolidated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Record for Consolidated", "print_headline": "Record for Consolidated", "body_text": " **********The Consolidated Natural Gas Company said today that one of its gas wells had set a production record for the Gulf of Mexico.

Abdel Rahman Siwar el-Dahab, also said the Islamic law imposed by former President Gaafar el-Nimeiry in October 1983 would have to be ''amended'' and ''modified'' to eliminate ''incorrect and excessive'' punishments inflicted by Mr. Nimeiry's courts. **********The general made these and other remarks in a 45-minute interview, his first with Western reporters since the army toppled the nearly 16-year-old Nimeiry regime in a bloodless coup. **********He categorically denied that the reason senior officers seized control of the Government last Saturday, overthrowing President Nimeiry, was to pre- empt a coup by junior officers amid widespread popular unrest. **********'Absolutely Not True' **********''This is absolutely not true,'' the general said. ''We had been observing the situation since it started a week earlier, and it became quite clear to us that unless we intervened at the right moment, this would lead to bloodshed and it would destroy the unity of this country.'' **********He also adamantly denied that there was any consultation with the United States before or during the coup. **********''We consulted no one, not even the Vice President in charge during Nimeiry's absence,'' the 51-year-old General Siwar el-Dahab said. ''We jumped in to prevent a bloodshed and preserve the unity of the country for which we have been fighting for 30 years since independence.'' **********Deciding on Cabinet **********General Siwar el-Dahab said he hoped that the composition of a new cabinet to help the 15-man military council govern would be decided ''in the next two or three days.'' **********The army and representatives of unions, political parties and other civilian groups have been locked in negotiations with the military for four days. Among the issues is how many military and civilian members the cabinet will have and the length of its tenure. **********The general said Mr. Nimeiry's fate would be decided by the ''people's wishes.'' **********Asked about reports that the new Transitional Military Council, as the steering committee is known, was preparing to put Mr. Nimeiry on trial for ''crimes against the Sudanese people,'' he replied, ''We have more important issues to deal with during this period.'' Lieut. Gen. Mohammed Tawfiq Khalil, another member of the Military Council who sat alongside General Siwar el-Dahab at the interview, said afterward that the new cabinet would be authorized to decide whether Mr. Nimeiry should be put on trial. **********Nimeiry Is in Egypt **********Mr. Nimeiry is in Alexandria, Egypt, in an Egyptian Government-owned villa. He was having talks with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt after returning from a nine-day trip to the United States when he was overthrown. **********Mr. Nimeiry had appointed General Siwar el-Dahab Minister of Defense and chief of the army on March 18, shortly before he departed for Washington for a medical checkup and consultation with President Reagan and other American officials. **********The Reagan Administration has pledged to continue economic aid to the Sudan. A State Department spokesman said the Administration would soon release about $67 million that had been frozen until President Nimeiry agreed to carry out austerity measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund. **********The general vowed to carry out the tough austerity program recommended by the I.M.F., the United States and other international creditors, to which the Sudan is approximately $9 billion in debt. This program includes an end to subsidies on prices of bread, gasoline, oils and other essential goods, reductions of imports and other unpopular cost-cutting measures. **********Increases Sparked Riots **********It was the price increases in basic commodites that sparked food riots two weeks ago, which spread into the general strike that helped bring down the Nimeiry regime. **********''We must carry on with the program for the moment,'' General Siwar el- Dahab said, ''or we might wind up in a worse situation.'' **********He said he did not believe that soaring prices of basic commodites would provoke renewed rioting or unrest. **********''The problem with the old regime,'' he said, ''was that they didn't explain things to the people. They imposed things right away without giving any reasons.'' **********''If we explain things to people and give them the reasons,'' he continued, ''things might be understood and people might cooperate and not make uprisings.'' **********He said his transitional government was forming a high-level committee to devise other ''responsible solutions to the economic problems we are facing.'' **********Th genersl said he had no political ambitions. Asked whether he would eventually serve as president, he replied, ''Absolutely not.'' **********He spoke in fluent English and appeared relaxed and confident. Though he spoke softly and struck a tone of geniality, a certain firmness underlined his comments. **********For example, he made clear his view that the military would have the major responsibility for governing the Sudan during the transitional period to civilian, democratic rule. He said he hoped that the transition would last no more than a year, but he added that military rule might be longer, ''if the circumstances require it.'' **********The cabinet, which other Sudanese officials have said was likely to be composed mostly of civilians, would be responsible for ''administering'' the country and making ''legislative recommendations'' to the Military Council, which ''would have its own advisers,'' the general said. **********But executive and legislative authority would remain with the military, he stressed. ''We can't pass everything they suggest,'' he said, referring to the cabinet. **********Plans News Screening **********He espoused a firm commitment to eventual democratic rule. He vowed to cancel the decree imposed last week banning marches and free assembly without permits. But he said the Military Council would probably appoint a ''neutral body,'' to be headed either by an apolitical civilian or a military officer, to screen news organizations. **********''It's not censorship,'' he said, ''but supervision to guard against deviation from the goals that we are heading towards.'' **********He said that ending the civil war with rebels in the south was one of the new Government's key priorities, because ''the country's economic and political survival depend on it.'' **********But he acknowledged that Col. John Garang, leader of the 10,000 to 12,000- member rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army, had not responded to the Government's offer to negotiate an end to the conflict. **********In radio broadcasts this week, Colonel Garang has denounced the military leadership for ''snatching victory from the people'' and has insisted that the military transfer rule to civilians by Tuesday or face renewed fighting in the south. **********Wants Peaceful Settlement **********''We will continue asking him to come and talk and solve the problem in a democratic way,'' General Siwar el- Dahab said. ''We've tried force and it hasn't worked. We want this settled peacefully.'' **********The general added that the Military Council would continue trying to improve the Sudan's badly strained relations with neighborhing Libya and Ethiopia, Soviet-backed regimes that have provided aid to Colonel Garang's rebels. **********Improved relations with Tripoli and Addis Ababa would probably mean an end to their support for the rebel group, he continued. **********He said that since the coup, the police had arrested about 40 senior officials of the Nimeiry Government, along with 260 members of the now-dismantled internal security force. He said that the Military Council would investigate charges of corruption and other abuses of power against the detainees, and that if there was sufficient evidence, they would be put on trial. **********''Justice must be exercised,'' he asserted. **********Explains Islamic Law **********The general said the question of whether Islamic law should be repealed would be left to ''the government of the people when it takes over its responsibilities.'' But he added that many of the punishments meted out under President Nimeiry's version of Islamic law, or Sharia, had been ''excessively harsh'' and not in keeping with the spirit of Islam. **********For example, he said, the amputation of the hands of a thief was required by Islamic law and could not be repealed. But, he added, Islamic law provided that no thief should have his hand removed if he stole because he was hungry. ''This must be suspended during shortages of food and food crises,'' the general said. **********He said he did not expect an end to President Nimeiry's ban on alcohol."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/01/world/arms-offer-gap-narrows.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Gelb", "pub_date": "1985-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMS OFFER: GAP NARROWS", "print_headline": "ARMS OFFER: GAP NARROWS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's new arms position narrows the gap with the Soviet Union on limiting offensive nuclear forces.

Now he is willing to go up to 3,000, compared with the Soviet offer of 3,600. **********Directive Issued Wednesday **********The officials said the President ordered these and other changes in a directive issued Wednesday, after a week of pressure from allied leaders and from his advisers. Their message was that unless he issued a counteroffer to the Soviet proposal for 50 percent cuts in nuclear forces, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, would gain the advantage in public relations. **********Once Mr. Reagan decided at the end of last week to make the counteroffer, officials said, there was little disagreement between the State Department and the Pentagon on substance. **********There were differences over timing, specifically whether to make the counteroffer now or wait until a few days before the President meets Mr. Gorbachev in Geneva on Nov. 19. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser, favored prompt action. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger urged delay on the ground that the Soviet Union might be given an opportunity to make yet another offer and thus regain the initiative. **********Additional Features Disclosed **********Some elements of the new arms offer were revealed Wednesday to The Washington Post. Officials today mentioned several additional features. **********The United States now proposes to limit the expansion of long-range bomber fleets to 350 compared with 400 in the past. The United States has 260, and the Soviet Union 170. **********The number of cruise missiles carried by these bombers is to be limited to 1,500, which is close to Pentagon procurement plans. Previously the United States proposed 4,000. Moscow would ban all long-range cruise missiles. **********According to officials, Mr. Reagan's letter to Mr. Gorbachev affirmed his willingness to share space-based defense technology, but added what the officials called ''several new wrinkles,'' which they declined to describe. **********Mr. Reagan also suggested that medium-range nuclear forces in Europe be limited to roughly 140, equal to the number of ground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing 2 ballistic missiles to be deployed by the West by the end of 1985. The plan also calls for a reduction of the Soviet Union's 100 SS-20 missiles in Asia. British and French nuclear forces would still not be counted in the balance. **********Soviet Seeks Warhead Balance **********According to American officials, the Soviet Union has proposed a medium-range balance in warheads. It calls for freezing the Soviet force of three-warhead SS-20 missiles in Europe at 243, asking in return that the West restrict its force to 120 American single-warhead missiles plus a number of French and British missiles to bring both sides to an equal warhead total of 729. **********The officials said the Soviet offer referred only to American cruise missiles, suggesting that Moscow would seek to ban the Pershings. The Russians would freeze the number of SS-20's in Asia to the current level of 144. **********According to Soviet calculations, the present force strength of the United States is 3,360, including medium-range missiles in Europe plus a variety of other nuclear-capable forces stationed in and around Europe. The United States puts its own total at 2,200 because it counts only intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers. **********Soviet Forces Put at 2,500 **********The Soviet Union sets the total of its own forces at 2,500, a figure virtually identical to that calculated by Washington. **********After a 50 percent cut, the United States would be left with 1,680 weapons and the Soviet Union with 1,250. **********In addition, Moscow proposed limiting each side to an equal number of ''nuclear charges,'' which would include ballistic missile warheads, bombs, air-launched cruise missiles and short-range attack missiles carried by bombers. **********Mr. Reagan's new proposal calls for unspecified cuts in intercontinental-range delivery vehicles. His earlier offers limited these missiles to 850, then raised them to 1,250. His letter to Mr. Gorbachev is said to offer to go even higher to insure that the overall number of missiles is not so low that either side could contemplate eliminating all or most of them in a first strike."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/16/business/inventories-down-0.1-sales-up-0.4-in-march.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 292, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inventories Down 0.1%, Sales Up 0.4% in March", "print_headline": "Inventories Down 0.1%, Sales Up 0.4% in March", "body_text": " **********Business inventories fell one-tenth of 1 percent in March, the first decline in two years, as sales rose a modest four-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said today. **********The increase in sales and slight drop in inventories left the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.38 in March, the same as the February level. **********That meant that it would take 1.38 months to work off March inventories at the sales pace for that month. **********Inventories held by retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers declined by $781 million, to a total of $578.2 billion in March, the Commerce Department said.

But inside the walls of the Alice Manufacturing Company's Elljean mill, one of five fabric factories the small family-owned manufacturer operates here in rural Pickens County, the changes are dramatic. **********In rooms where workers once moved through a fog of cotton dust, powerful vacuum hoses now glide along rails suspended from the low ceiling, keeping the air cleared of lint. The old clackety-clack shuttle looms have been replaced by sleek high-speed weaving machines. And throughout the plant, television screens hooked to a central computer flicker a continuous stream of data measuring the performance and efficiency of each piece of equipment on the floor. **********''There have been more changes in the textile industry during the last five years than in the previous 100,'' says Ellison S. McKissick Jr., who not only presides over Alice, a company his father and grandfather founded in 1923, but also is the president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the industry's national trade organization. **********As Mr. McKissick is quick to acknowledge, these are turbulent times for America's oldest manufacturing industry. Buffeted by a 65 percent increase since 1982 in the volume of imports of apparel, fabric and other textile products, manufacturers are scrambling to reposition themselves, investing billions in new equipment and marketing strategies in an effort to regain a competitive edge. **********The industry's problems go back more than a decade. Over that time, its largest segment - the domestic apparel manufacturers, who fashion the mills' output of print-cloth, denim and other fabrics into dresses, jackets and jeans - has increasingly been overtaken by imports, mostly sewn goods made out of fabric woven and finished in the Far East. Industry figures estimate that, as of last year, imports accounted for 43 percent of the clothing sold in this country. **********But more recently, imports have begun to penetrate the market for even basic textile materials, such as raw yarn and unfinished fabric, and household goods like draperies, sheets and towels - items that until 1983 were virtually free of foreign competition. In 1984, $4.87 billion in yarn, fabrics and dry goods were imported, compared with $3.46 billion the year before. The rise - 41 percent - was the biggest ever. Last year, for the first time in history, the volume of these textiles entering the country from overseas mills exceeded the volume of imported finished apparel. **********The flood of new imports, which has surged on the strength of the dollar, has domestic yarn and cloth manufacturers reeling, and has raised questions about their future. Only a decade ago they employed more than one million people in 36 states, with nearly half of those jobs here in the Carolinas. Today, employment is down to 702,000, its lowest level since records were kept in the 1940's, and last year hard-pressed manufacturers were forced to shut down 60 plants. **********In their scramble for safer ground, the textile manufacturers have mounted an insistent campaign to persuade President Reagan and Congress to tighten controls on imports and protect their sales, which totaled $55 billion last year. But at the same time, manufacturers have embarked on a variety of strategies on their own, ranging from pumping billions into long overdue plant modernization programs to new marketing programs to increase revenues from high-margin fashion products that imports cannot yet reach. **********With investor confidence low, and most textile stocks selling at a sharp discount, some public companies have gone the route of leveraged buyouts. At least six since 1982 have turned private, including Cannon Mills and Dan River Inc. Still others have moved to take advantage of low wages overseas by sending their own fabric to the Caribbean to have it sewn into apparel and then reimported, nearly duty free, under Provision 807 of the United States Tariff Schedule. Import shipments of this sort increased by 24 percent last year. **********''To think that the textile industry will ever return to what it was even a few years ago is out of the question,'' said Jay Meltzer, the textile analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''They have lost significant market share to imports, and they are spending a lot of their corporate dollars in an effort to just hang in there.'' N OT since the mill owners first moved their factories to the Southeast from New England more than a century ago has the industry undergone such fundamental change. But what is not yet clear is whether the industry's enormous investment in new capital equipment and product strategies will pay off, given the continuing pressure from imports and a domestic market that is growing at 1.4 percent a year. **********The Commerce Department says that manufacturers last year spent a record $1.9 billion on new equipment, ranging from accordion-armed robots that automatically load and unload pallets of yarn and cotton, to high-speed weaving machines that use jets of water or air, instead of shuttles, to weave cloth. That figure is expected to top $2 billion in 1985, as the industry gambles that higher productivity will cut costs enough to compete with foreign producers. **********''When you transfer a liquid asset like cash into iron and steel, you are taking a real gamble, particularly in an industry where the public market puts you at a discount,'' said Mr. Meltzer. On the other hand, he added, companies that fail to spend to improve their productivity and cost structure are only ''hastening their own demise.'' **********Many manufacturers, including some companies like Alice, agree. Here in Easley, Mr. McKissick this month completed the installation of 280 new Swiss-made weaving machines that he said cost him three times what it did to build and equip a whole new factory in 1955. ''If you don't automate, you don't survive,'' said Mr. McKissick. **********Some of the larger companies, like Burlington Industries, have been investing 85 percent of their cash flow into new machinery, a tactic that forced them to squeeze inventories to help preserve liquidity. Still, despite investing $1.5 billion over the last seven years in state-of-the-art textile machinery, the company's return on average equity has declined, rather than improved. As a result, Wall Street continues to be cool to the industry. The common stock of companies like M. Lowenstein, Springs Industries and Burlington are all trading well below their book value. **********In addition to automating and modernizing their plants, American manufacturers are also putting a much greater emphasis on specialty products and marketing, in order to seek out the high-margin niches that foreign competitors cannot yet reach. For example, a Burlington Industries mill in Erwin, N.C., five years ago turned out just six varieties of denim, most of them the standard, heavyweight stuff from which bluejeans are made. Now the plant uses its looms to produce and finish 21 separate varieties, ranging from high-fashion stretch denim to various shades of a brushed, velour-like fabric, marketed under such catchy trade names as Hug Bunny, Crossplay, Ice Blue Crinkle and Easy Going Stripe. **********Along with its new line of Laura Ashley and Liz Claiborne designer home linens and a line of fine worsteds, the company is hoping to dramatically increase its share of revenues from high-fashion products, which now make up about 10 percent of sales. **********Other companies have been successful by carving out niches where imports are not a factor. Collins & Aikman has generated a premium return that has kept its stock price healthy by turning to automotive carpeting, furniture upholstery and commercial carpeting that so far have proved import-proof. W HILE a weaker dollar and tighter enforcement of trade quotas have helped a bit with imports this year, there has been no sign of a domestic recovery yet. Imports of textiles and apparel through April were off 4.4 percent from last year's record pace, for example, but domestic shipments over the same period still dropped 8.5 percent. That means the industry is continuing to go through a transition, which, Mr. Meltzer said, will see ''the marginal plants, the weaker plants, go by the boards.'' **********That is what happened to the Crompton Company, the nation's oldest weaver, which last fall filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law. Crompton had been hurt not only by imports of lower-priced goods, but also by a waning consumer appetite for corduroy and velveteen, its two chief products. In an effort to stem losses, the company closed mills in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, Georgia and North Carolina. Last fall, at the time it filed for bankruptcy, its work force stood at 110, compared with 4,100 in 1980. **********For the small rural communities of the Southeast, a region that accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's textile employment, the industry's recent troubles have had a devastating impact. Often the mill is the only employer in town, and many of those now displaced are people in their 50's and 60's who have been mill workers all their lives, and lack the skills to transfer to other jobs. **********Some jobs, in the production of basic cloth that is finished into material for shirts and blouses, likely have been lost forever to Asian producers, with their less costly labor. **********But modernization itself has eliminated many jobs. Since 1978, when Burlington began its modernization program, it has cut its work force to 53,000 from 66,000. And J. P. Stevens, which has spent more than $480 million on its capital program since 1980 has, over the same period, cut back to 32,700 employees from 41,400. **********''With the market growing at a rate of 2 percent a year, and imports growing at 30 percent, the difference has got to come out of jobs here at home,'' said C. Hunter Gallman, senior vice president for manufacturing at the M. Lowenstein Corporation, which has spent more than $110 million in the last five years on plant modernization. **********In that time, the company has consolidated operations by closing three plants and selling two others. In turn, the company has reduced its payroll to 9,000 workers from 14,000. ''It comes down to a question of survival,''said Mr. Gallman. ''But I think that over all, we have made some real improvements in productivity.'' **********According to statistics from the Textile Manufacturers Institute, the industry processed more than 8 pounds of fiber an hour, up from 6.6 pounds in 1973 - an annual increase of more than 4 percent. S TILL, the textile industry was, in general, slow to modernize. **********Even now, barely 30 percent of the more than 200,000 looms in use in domestic mills today are of the more modern, shuttle-less variety. **********It is, in fact, a measure of the industry's complacency that most of the high-speed looms going into plants these days are manufactured in either Europe or Japan, where manufacturers are 10 years ahead of domestic machinery companies in the production of the advanced air-jet weaving machines. **********At his white brick and frame headquarters here, set amid a pecan grove beside State Road 8, Mr. McKissick describes the industry as being ''at war'' with foreign producers, and he likens his own office to a bunker. **********At issue are a variety of claims that domestic goods must compete unfairly with imports. Not only are the imports made under working conditions and wage rates that are illegal in this country, but United States manufacturers also argue that foreign governments work on behalf of their textile industries in developing markets, offering subsidies and enforcing trade restraints that block American imports. **********The solution, Mr. McKissick says, is for Congress to approve, and the President to sign, legislation now pending that, among other things, would roll back imports from the 20 top textile importing nations, broaden restraints to cover additional apparel and set up a new import-licensing system to strengthen enforcement. **********So far, unlike most other manufacturers, Mr. McKissick has been able to keep his own work force of 2,000 stable, by going to four shifts a day, seven days a week. He knows most of his employees by first name, and the trophies that mill teams have won in softball and basketball are prominetly displayed in each of his plants. **********But without some sort of tighter controls on imports, he says, it is going to be harder to keep his plants going at the same pace, or to avoid cutting back his work force. ''If Washington will give us some help, this industry can compete with anyone,'' he said. ''On a level field, we'll tear the pants off imports.'' **********SPINNING YARN WITH FEWER WORKERS **********The best example of the textile industry's drive to automate is Burlington Industries' denim plant in Erwin, N.C., a community of 2,000 people north of Fayetteville. In the last three years, the company has spent $10 million to modernize its original red-brick mill there, and $45 million to build a new weaving facility. **********According to industry analysts, the plant reflects the state of the art in textile technology. Not only is it more efficient, it also is much cleaner: Air filtration systems exchange the air inside the mill 26 times an hour, clearing it of most of the cotton dust and fibers that used to hang like a haze across the factory. **********In the spinning room, thick coils of cotton and synthetic fiber, called sliver, are fed into machines where they are shredded and then twisted by high-speed rotors into thin strands of yarn. If a thread breaks, swirling jets of air automatically splice the broken ends together without knots. **********The pallets of yarn are then computer coded, and moved by trucks to the new weaving plant, where their cargo is automatically unloaded by machines. A robot sorts the material, placing it on a conveyer belt, which moves it to small, driverless carts for delivery inside the plant. **********When a weaving machine is running out of yarn, for example, it signals the computer, which in turn dispatches a cart by remote control. **********Flashing bright yellow lights and beeping, the cart glides through the plant, following grooved tracks notched in the floor, to deliver a new supply of yarn to the machine. **********The plant's 350 Swiss-made weaving machines are still noisy, and ear plugs are a necessity inside the mill. But the machines do the work that used to be done by 1,000 of the old shuttle looms, each machine not only capable of turning out fabric in three different widths, but also with three to five times fewer defects. All of the machines are constantly monitored by computers, and television screens suspended from the ceilings give a constant read-out of their efficiency. **********The increasing use of computers and automation has also resulted in fewer workers. The plant has reduced its payroll from 2,000 in 1978 to only 1,400 today. **********''What we have eliminated are most of the old pushing and pulling jobs,'' said Neil W. Yeargin, the manager of the Erwin plant. As a result, Mr. Yeargin said that Burlington's over-all productivity, as measured by increased output per hour, has been gaining at a rate of 5 to 6 percent a year, compared with an industrywide average of 4 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/21/business/your-money-venture-capital-club-benefits.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1985-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Venture Capital Club Benefits", "print_headline": "YOUR MONEY;   Venture Capital Club Benefits", "body_text": " **********GREGORY A. GORDON, a physician in Santa Fe, N.M., bought $10,000 worth of stock in a company called the Newman Communications Corporation in the spring of 1984 for 25 cents a share. Now the shares are selling for more than $4. **********But Dr. Gordon did not become acquainted with the corporation, a producer and distributor of books on tape, in the usual way via a telephone call from his broker. Instead, he listened to a talk by the company's chairman, Harold J. Newman, who spoke at the meeting of the Venture Capital Club of New Mexico, and was impressed enough to write a check. **********''Doctors are notoriously horrible investors, and I decided that was not going to be my plight,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''I joined the club for educational purposes, because you just learn a lot.'' But Dr. Gordon's experience is not necessarily a typical one. **********The New Mexico club is one of the about 50 local venture capital clubs around the country, most of which are linked in a loose federation based in Stamford, Conn., known as the Association of Venture Capital Clubs. The clubs - whose origins date back 12 years to the initial one in Connecticut - are essentially networking devices through which venture capitalists and fledgling venture capitalists get an opportunity to come in contact with entrepreneurs seeking investments, typically in high-risk, start-up situations. **********Venture capital clubs, moreover, are a far cry from the investment clubs prominent in the 1960's and 1970's. At such investment clubs, friends, business associates and others would meet regularly to pool relatively small amounts of money for the purchase of publicly traded securities that they would select, hold and then sell. **********On the other hand, venture capital clubs are organizations in which individuals who generally can afford to invest at least $10,000 in a private placement are introduced to businessmen with an idea and a lack of capital. Although funds are sometimes pooled to back a new venture, club members, sometimes referred to as angels, usually make transactions on their own, after looking into the history and operations of the entrepreneur and his business. And when an individual investment is made, the money is frequently accompanied by a wish, if not a demand, to play an active role with the company. **********''If you buy stock in G.M. and it goes down, you don't feel you've made a terrible personal error,'' said Thomas P. Murphy, founder of the first venture capital club and chairman of the association of clubs. ''With this, you get personally involved.'' **********There are many perils of investing and involvement in new businesses, including the danger of a total financial loss. About half of all new ventures fail within the first two years because of such factors as inadequate capital or management inexperience. Investments are usually illiquid at the outset, while the receipt of dividends and capital gains is likely to be far into the future, if ever. **********Nevertheless, venture capital clubs can temper these risks in many ways. Clubs are, in effect, a screening technique for removing marginal companies that members, who come from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, decide to eliminate from consideration. In addition, some of the most promising opportunities are presented to one or more clubs, since the entrepreneurs behind them recognize the potential purchasing power of the membership. **********Although each club develops its own operating pattern, certain procedures are common to all. Membership is normally open to anyone interested or experienced in business formation, with annual dues ranging from $75 to $400, depending on the particular club. At many clubs, the deal-making may include investments of time, as well as money, with specialists such as lawyers or accountants offering their services in return for stock in a venture. **********Monthly meetings, frequently held in conjunction with breakfast or lunch, typically have three basic parts. There is a guest speaker, whose address is geared to what the clubs call ''the entrepreneurial process.'' There is the admittedly misnamed five-minute forum, where originators of enterprises in attendance at the session have from 30 seconds to three minutes to give a thumbnail sketch of their proposals. And finally, there are the informal one-on-one get-togethers, where specific mutual interests between possible investors and entrepreneurs are discussed. **********The language of venture capital is also often explained at club meetings. Thus members talk about the obvious start-up companies; those in the mezzanine stage, beyond a start-up but before reaching the secondary stage, and secondary-stage concerns, which have received most of their financing and currently desire to expand. **********Experienced venture club members warn that a brief presentation about a company at a meeting may not provide adequate information for a substantial investment.

The company said it had invested $30 million to upgrade plants last year, and will spend another $20 million this year, but that the Seremban plant could not expand because of insufficient space and the lack of certain testing equipment.

Yet the rebellion has been mainly a rural phenomenon, adhering to the Maoist edict of capturing the countryside and isolating the cities. **********But in recent weeks, gun battles between Communist guerrillas and Government forces have been fought in Manila itself, underscoring the rapid expansion of the insurgent campaign. **********''Even Metropolitan Manila is now threatened,'' said Salvador H. Laurel, president of the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, the largest grouping of opposition parties. **********Nationwide Upsurge in Fighting **********The gun battles between the military and members of the Armed City Partisans, an urban wing of the Communist New People's Army, come at a time when Philippine military officials have said that clashes with the insurgents are increasing nationwide. **********The intensity of armed encounters has grown alarmingly in some parts of the country. Last week, for example, a gun battle between Government troops and 200 Communist rebels in northern Mindanao ended after eight days. The fighting forced 1,500 families to flee to avoid being caught in the crossfire. **********In the first five months of this year, there were an average of more than 10 violent incidents a day involving the military and insurgents, according to Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff. General Ramos said recently that the average daily death toll was between 10 and 11 people - three Government soldiers, three civilians and four to five rebels. Those figures, he added, represent an increase of about 15 percent over the same period in 1984. **********The rebels, according to General Ramos, are probably financing firearms procurement from abroad through various international contacts. But he added that the Philippine military has not found evidence of support from any foreign government. **********In an interview last month, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile noted the rebels' recent ability to mount sizable assaults in areas outside their traditional strongholds of southern Mindanao, northern Luzon and Samar. But Mr. Enrile stressed that the Government was fighting to resist the incursions in such areas as Negros, Bicol and Panay. **********''These clashes will continue to increase in tempo until one side gives,'' he said. ''And we have to escalate the level of violence until we can dominate them.'' **********The Communist Party, which is outlawed in the Philippines, has also stepped up efforts recently to broaden its influence through nonviolent means. The party's political arm, the National Democratic Front, has become increasingly active. **********The National Democratic Front is regarded as the moving force behind a new political party called Bayan, established earlier this year. ''The National Democratic Front controls Bayan,'' said Ramon Mitra, an opposition member of the National Assembly. **********The clashes in Manila have been limited but dramatic confrontations. More than 100 soldiers and policemen laid siege for five hours recently to a Communist sanctuary in suburban Manila with high-powered rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The battle was believed to be the first in Manila involving the military and Communist guerrillas. **********When the fusillade finally stopped, a bystander and one man identified by the authorities as a guerrilla had been killed and at least four soldiers were wounded. The other insurgents escaped, apparently slipping out of the two-story building before the troops arrived in force. According to the military, documents found in the apartment detailed plans to kill local policemen and steal arms. **********In another development, the military identified a man wounded and captured in a gun battle in a Manila slum district as a Communist Party leader from Mindanao. General Ramos said the wounded man, Alexander Birondo y Kintanar, was transferred to Manila last December to help organize the Armed City Partisans. **********The urban presence of the New People's Army is not yet militarily significant, but it does mark another step in the growth of the insurgency. In testimony before Congress last March, Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, warned that if the rebel strength kept expanding at the recent pace, the guerrillas could fight the Philippine military to a standoff in five years. Spokesmen for the Communists have predicted they will reach a level of ''strategic stalemate'' with the military in two or three years. **********Western analysts place the strength of the New People's Army at 12,000 to 15,000 armed fighters. The insurgents have roughly doubled their activity in the last year, the United States Defense Department estimates. The guerrillas are armed mostly with light weapons, many of which they seize, steal or buy from the military. **********In the face of the heightened aggressiveness of the insurgency, President Ferdinand E. Marcos has become increasingly strident in his denunciations of the rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/27/world/a-reagan-ambassador-raises-vienna-s-eyebrows.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 998, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A REAGAN AMBASSADOR RAISES VIENNA'S EYEBROWS", "print_headline": "A REAGAN AMBASSADOR RAISES VIENNA'S EYEBROWS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration's high-profile public diplomacy collided in Vienna this month with the stuffier conventions of the Old World. **********Two years ago, Helene A. von Damm - an ambitious emigrant from the war-ravaged Austrian countryside who had risen to a position of considerable power in the Reagan White House - caused a stir when she returned to her native land as United States Ambassador. **********But when the 46-year-old Ambassador recently divorced her third husband to marry Peter G\"urtler, 39, the owner of the luxury-class Sacher Hotel, she came close to creating a scandal. **********Vienna cultivates hand-kissing, but behavior that draws attention is definitely out. **********A bit of an international backwater, Vienna appears to draw a rather old- fashioned brand of European diplomat to its missions, which are palatial and not exactly overworked. **********Such exponents of the striped-pants school seem to feel their collective dignity ruffled by Mrs. von Damm's unconventional comportment. **********'I Believe in Selling America' **********''I believe in the kind of public diplomacy that the Reagan Administration espouses,'' said Mrs. von Damm, who keeps in shape by jogging in Vienna's parks and who has clambered to the top of the country's highest peak, the Grossglockner. ''I believe in selling America, and how do you sell America if you don't have a high profile?'' **********Mrs. von Damm - who retains the resonant, titled surname of her second husband, a German-born banker - appears unruffled by the fuss over her remarriage. For some flashier publications, the event was a pretext to switch the tone of the von Damm saga from ''The Sound of Music'' to an Alpine ''Dallas.'' **********Conversing in her office, Mrs. von Damm defended her handling of what she called ''a private affair,'' noting that before her former husband (Byron J. Leeds, 52, a computer industry consultant from Flanders, N.J.) slipped quietly out of Vienna last November, not a word had appeared in the press about their divorce. **********Mr. G\"urtler, who had divorced his wife, and the Ambassador were married at a private ceremony two weeks ago in Kitzb\"uhel, a chic Austrian resort town.  They re-enacted the ring exchange for television cameras. **********''So I think I handled it as discreetly as anyone could,'' said the Ambassador, who has a habit of rolling German and English words into one sentence. ''I don't know why should an ambassador, for instance, be treated differently than someone who works in the Administration.'' **********The Ambassador's birth in the Lower Austrian village of Ulmerfeld in 1938 may, for some Viennese, be beside the point. For Mrs. von Damm (born Winter) is a quintessentially American phenomenon, a resilient risk-taker who got herself out of her Soviet-occupied village, married an American soldier in West Germany, moved to Detroit and got divorced. **********A job as a secretary in Chicago with the political-action committee of the American Medical Association led to a fateful encounter in 1965 with an actor- turned-politician named Ronald Reagan. She followed him to California, joining his gubernatorial campaign and becoming his personal secretary. **********She accompanied Mr. Reagan's ascent to the White House, raising $3.5 million for his 1980 campaign in the northeastern states. By 1982, she had reached the influential position of Assistant to the President for Presidential Personnel, a job that meant giving many weighty jobs to others. **********''Being the special assistant and being in the Oval Office has a lot of - how shall I say? - trimmings,'' said Mrs. von Damm, musing on her decision to accept the posting to Vienna. ''It was a protected, sheltered spot, where obviously I could have made round-the- world trips with the President. **********''And on the other hand,'' she said, ''there was the lure of the challenge to be really out on your own and take the inevitable consequences and risks.'' **********Her high-profile diplomacy has brought a string of American luminaries to Vienna, among them Henry A. Kissinger, Frank Sinatra and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick. She has thrown parties and raised money for Austrian charities and a museum. **********Urged Austrian to Visit U.S. **********Under her prodding, the country's President, Rudolf Kirchschl\"ager, made the first official visit to the United States by an Austrian head of state. And the Vienna Chamber of Commerce won promotional mileage when the Ambassador's boss, President Reagan, appeared on the White House lawn to accept a Lippizaner horse named Amadeus. **********Among diplomats from other countries, there is a consensus that American-Austrian relations have improved since Mrs. von Damm arrived. **********But some are inclined to attribute this development to the departure in 1983 of Bruno Kreisky, a sometimes curmudgeon of a Chancellor, and the accession of the more tractable Fred Sinowatz. Last September, Chancellor Sinowatz replaced his left-wing Foreign Minister, Erwin Lanc, with a pro- American politician, Leopold Gratz. **********In an interview, Mr. Sinowatz said he and the Ambassador were good friends. **********''This is something very special,'' he said. ''A young Austrian girl emigrates, goes to America, triumphs and comes back as Ambassador. It's really a fairy tale.'' **********There are other, unkinder appraisals of the American Ambassador to be heard in this gossipy city. But Mrs. von Damm seems content to ignore them. **********''Any time people lead their lives the way they see it, and they go a little bit out of the norm, obviously you also have to expect that not everybody bef\"urwortet that, nicht?'' she asked, borrowing the German word for ''approve.'' **********''But I'm a little used to that,'' she said, ''because I don't think my life has been that cut and dry.'' **********After her assignment in Vienna, she says, she may help out with her husband's business overseas, setting up a second residence in New York. Or maybe not. **********''I don't belong to the people who makes long-term plans as far as my life is concerned,'' she said, grinning, ''because I always like to take advantage of serendipity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/07/business/market-place-high-place-of-patience.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1985-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  HIGH PLACE OF PATIENCE", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE;   HIGH PLACE OF PATIENCE", "body_text": " **********LAST June, when most investors were worrying **********over the stock market, Charles Allmon made **********his move.

He also publishes two well-known investment advisory reports - Growth Stock Outlook and Junior Growth Stocks. **********In June Mr. Allmon snapped up a host of stocks, including Wallace Computer Services, Longs Drug Stores, Fort Howard Paper, J.M. Smucker, Revco D.S. and Matrix Corporation. He also added to holdings that ranged from Noxell Corporation and Lin Broadcasting to Lamaur Inc. and Laidlaw Industries. **********Generally these issues have performed well since that time. Revco, which operates a chain of self-service discount drugstores, was an exception. ''There was internal squabbling among some large stockholders in the company,'' Mr. Allman said. ''We sold most of our position in the stock and got out about even.'' **********Portfolios under his management contain about 240 issues, many of them stocks trading in the over- the-counter market. The 63-year-old Mr. Allmon, a former illustrations editor at National Geographic, started his advisory service in 1965. **********''Over the years we have found that the big gainers are in the over-the-counter market,'' he said. ''We generally don't own any stocks that you find in the Dow Jones industrial average. But if new accounts come in with some holdings of, say, I.B.M. we will abide by the client's wishes and retain the stock.'' **********For every money manager, learning is a constant process in the equity market. ''Patience sometimes is worth more than money,'' Mr. Allmon said. ''Some of my biggest mistakes were made in selling stocks too soon, a decision often made because I don't like high price/earnings multiples.'' **********Liz Claiborne, a designer of women's apparel, is one stock that the Chevy Chase portfolio manager acknowledges selling too soon. **********So what has he been buying in recent weeks? **********''We've expanded our position in American Income Life Insurance,'' Mr. Allmon said. ''Within the last two weeks we've been buyers of such varied stocks as Weldotron Corporation, Worthington Industries, American Stores, American President Companies, C. R. Gibson, Lawson Products, Fortune Financial Group, RPM Inc., Greenman Brothers, the George Banta Company, Software Publishing and Circuit City Stores, along with Bindley Western Industries, an ethical drug wholesaler.'' **********Managed accounts under his direction also have invested in a number of regional bank stocks, some of which he believes might become takeover candidates if nationwide banking arrives. **********Bank stocks in the various portfolios include State Street Boston Corporation, Bank of New England, First Tennessee National, Citizens and Southern Georgia Corporation, First Virginia Banks and Hibernia Corporation. **********Obviously, with such a diversified list of holdings, there have been some disappointing investments along the way. Mr. Allmon named two issues that were purchased above current market prices - M. Kamenstein Inc., manufacturers of wood household products, and California Amplifier, producers of microwave amplifiers. **********One of Mr. Allmon's longtime favorites that recently came under some pressure in the market is Conwood Corporation, a maker of smokeless tobacco products. ''From time to time there are reports of health dangers in snuff and chewing tobacco, but I am confident that in the long run Conwood will prove a sound investment,'' he said. ''The company's earnings have grown steadily, and its financial position is very impressive.'' **********The portfolios in recent years have benefited from takeovers and management buyouts. In early February, for example, an investor group made an offer intended to take Multimedia Inc. private. The newspaper and broadcasting company is held in managed accounts. In January, Duckwall-Alco Stores, another holding, was the recipient of a leveraged buyout offer by management. Duckwall operates discount department and variety stores. **********Mr. Allmon said the total return - market appreciation plus dividends - has averaged about 19 percent annually over the last 10 years in accounts under management. This compares with a gain of just under 15 percent annually for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during the same period. **********Although the Allmon portfolios tend to be dominated by small, growth-oriented companies, about 20 percent of the assets under management is kept in a selection of large, readily marketable stocks. These include Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers, Longs Drug Stores, Capital Cities Communications and R.J. Reynolds Industries. The object here, Mr. Allmon explained, is to provide ''instant liquidity'' if the need arises."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/business/spending-tops-gain-in-incomes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 553, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPENDING TOPS GAIN IN INCOMES", "print_headline": "SPENDING TOPS GAIN IN INCOMES", "body_text": " **********An auto-buying spree pushed consumer spending up a giant 1.2 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported today, but the growth of incomes of Americans remained sluggish. **********Personal consumption spending rose four times as fast as the gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in personal income.

Two-Thirds of the G.N.P.  Mr. Wyss said a slowdown would be caused in large part by lower consumer spending. ''Since consumer spending is two-thirds of the gross national product, when consumers slow down, the G.N.P. slows down,'' he added. **********The big increase in spending in September matched August's 1.2 percent increase. Both were attributed to heavy sales of autos as buyers responded to attractive cut-rate financing packages being offered at the end of the model year. **********However, analysts noted that, for the latest selling period, the first 10 days of October, car sales declined. **********Robert Ortner, chief economist at the Commerce Department, said that it was quite possible that retail sales would decline in one or two coming months as the 5 percent advance in consumer spending in the first nine months of this year moderated. **********Below First Three Quarters **********''This report suggests a much less robust consumer sector than we had in the first three quarters,'' he said. ''Consumers will not be pulling up the economy almost single-handedly anymore.'' But Mr. Ortner predicted further moderate growth at a rate of around 3 percent. He said this growth would come from inventory restocking by businesses, increased business investment spending and an improvement in the country's trade performance as the dollar falls. **********In addition to a low savings rate, other statistics show that consumer debt has hit an all-time high of 19 percent of disposable income, topping the old mark of 17.8 percent in 1978. **********Disposable, or after-tax, income rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in September, the same increase as in August."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/30/business/business-people-chairman-resigns-at-gulf-resources.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chairman Resigns At Gulf Resources", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Chairman Resigns At Gulf Resources", "body_text": " **********Alan E.

''Developing educational material is the biggest challenge we have had at W.H.O.,'' Dr. Assaad said, ''because many of the practices have deep religious and traditional significance.'' Also polygamy without wedding rings is a widespread practice in Africa, where men consider it a status symbol to be able to afford several wives or mistresses. Health officials are hoping that the ubiquitous transistor radio will become apowerful education weapon. *********** They will begin training Africans to do laboratory tests so that AIDS-contaminated-blood can be detected and eliminated from the system before transfusions are given to patients. Such efforts, however, would take years before they can result in a safe blood supply. *********** They will work to create a hospital surveillance system to determine the extent of AIDS in central Africa. Most African countries lack effective health-care reporting systems and the attempt to set up one for AIDS would be designed to detect trends rather than precise case counts. The AIDS system would be predicated on one used in some central African countries to indicate the prevalence of viruses that cause infections characterized by severe bleeding. **********Dr. Assaad said he was optimistic that African countries represented at the meeting would begin to formally report on AIDS by the end of this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/business/l-savings-rate-160503.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAVINGS RATE", "print_headline": "SAVINGS RATE", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In wringing their hands over the decline of Yankee thrift (Americans seem to save less and less) observers are missing the point that Americans have simply changed the way in which they save (''How Economic Policy Has Gone Awry,'' Forum, Nov. 3). The new way does not show up in the Commerce Department's statistics on savings. **********The main purposes of saving are to provide for retirement and the threat of catastrophic illness, and Americans are now making these provisions through contracts with their Government (Social Security and Medicare) and their employers (pension plans and group health insurance). **********So Yankee thrift is still intact. But what about savings as fuel for economic growth? **********The new way to save is much the same major provider of investment capital as the old way. More than a trillion dollars have accumulated in private pension plans, which have become the largest participant in our nation's stock and bond markets. (Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Social Security, where the trust fund is minimal - and not invested in the private economy - as receipts flow back out as benefits.) So our worries about the decline of Yankee thrift are not founded.

''The bottom line'' of the Reagan proposal, a senior Administration official said today ''is new elections in Nicaragua,'' an idea the Sandinista Government has said was not open for negotiation. **********The Nicaraguan Ambassador here, Carlos Tunnerman Bernheim, said today, ''I don't see any reason we should take recognition away from legitimate elections, just because the Administration didn't like the results.'' **********In addition, Mr. Reagan tied postponement of renewed military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels to an agreement that the Sandinistas would sit at the bargaining table with anti-Sandinista rebel leaders. **********Asked last month if Managua would agree to that, Nicaragua's Vice President, Sergio Ramirez Mercado, said, ''Never, never, never.'' Mr. Tunnerman reiterated that sentiment today. **********Just a Tactic, Some Say **********Those are some of the factors behind the assertion by some members of Congress today that Mr. Reagan's peace initiative was really just a tactic to win Congressional approval of renewed aid to the rebels. **********A senior Administration official involved with Central American affairs said he believed the plan woild be ''utterly impossible for the Sandinistas to accept'' unless ''their situation has become so desperate that they are ready to throw in the towel.'' **********Mr. Reagan pointed out that internal conditions in Nicaragua were not good. The Nicaraguans have severe food and gasoline shortages and other problems. **********In addition, the President said he believed the Sandinistas might agree to his terms because ''there are some other things involved here this time.'' He said the other nations of the region would follow Washington's lead, and he did not think the Sandinistas ''want to be alone completely in the Americas.'' **********Already, however, Nicaragua is at odds with most other nations in Central America. Today, the United States delivered letters to each head of state in the region, explaining Mr. Reagan's initiative and asking for support, an official said. At a news conference today, one head of state, President Belisario Betancur of Colombia, said he was ''pleased to hear President Reagan's proposal,'' adding, ''My reaction is very positive.'' **********U.S. Held Talks in 1984 **********For more than two years, the United States and several Latin American nations have tried without success to forge a peace settlement with Nicaragua. The Contadora talks have been under way since 1983, and through much of 1984 the United States and Nicaragua held direct talks. **********Then last month, a coalition of military and political leaders of the Nicaraguan opposition proposed a new peace initiative in Costa Rica. That is the plan Mr. Reagan adopted as his own today. The opposition leaders called on the Sandinistas to negotiate with them. **********But among the group are some people who are the ''sworn enemies of the Sandinistas,'' a senior State Department official said. Another official said the Sandinistas realized that simply sitting at the negotiating table with rebel leaders, including some who were associated with the old Nicaraguan National Guard under the ousted dictatorship, could ''seriously undercut their support at home.'' **********''The families of all these young boys who were sent off to die in the war with the contras will say, 'What's going on here?' '' he added, using the term often applied to the rebels. **********Many Nicaraguans Fled **********Nicaragua would also ''have many, many more people sneaking off to Honduras and Costa Rica to avoid the draft,'' the official added. In the last year, since the Sandinistas imposed Nicaragua's first compulsory draft, many young Nicaraguans have fled the country. Some of them have joined the rebels. **********While opposing negotiations with the rebels, the Sandinistas have said all along that they supported direct talks with the United States. **********''We are not willing to talk with the mercenaries of the C.I.A.,'' Mr. Tunnerman said of the rebels today. **********The plan announced today did not give the Sandinistas a clear means to comply with Mr. Reagan's initiative without backing away from those and other pledges they have made to their own people repeatedly. **********Sandinista Sees Ultimatum **********As a result, Mr. Tunnerman said: ''For us, this is not a peace proposal. It is more of an ultimatum in support of the contras. And we cannot accept negotiations or dialogue under threat.'' **********The Contadora peace talks - conducted by Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Mexico - have been stalled since last fall but are to resume next week, and Mr. Tunnerman reiterated Nicaragua's support for the talks. **********A senior official said the Administration believed it was likely that the Sandinistas might now quickly agree to a Contadora settlement as a means of sidetracking Mr. Reagan's proposal. That ''would be fine,'' another official said, ''if it was an agreement we could live with,'' adding, ''We fully support Contadora.'' **********Nicaragua agreed to a proposed Contadora treaty last fall, but then the Reagan Administration announced that it opposed the plan because, officials said, it did not include adequate verification mechanisms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/31/business/technology-recycling-used-software.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1985-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  'Recycling' Used Software", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY;   'Recycling' Used Software", "body_text": " **********EVEN in the midst of a remarkably stubborn computer slump, there seems to be an insatiable demand for used hardware - everything from reconditioned personal computers to Cray supercomputers reportedly used by researchers who dropped by the lab only on Sunday afternoons. **********Now the nation's leading aerospace companies hope to do the same with software - slightly used software that can be ''recycled'' - as they write programs for new airplanes, weapons and communications system. The aim is to drastically cut the time it takes to develop new equipment for the Pentagon, which recently concluded that 80 percent of the labor content in ''mission critical'' systems lies in the design of increasingly unwieldy programs. **********Proponents of the technology, chiefly the new Software Productivity Consortium in Reston, Va., boast that it could save more than half the time now required to design and write some of the largest programs used by the Defense Department and its contractors. But other computer experts are wary and say that a host of obstacles - most technical, some legal - will have to be surmounted before program ''modules'' can be snapped into place like headlights. **********''It's something we have been talking about for 10 years,'' said Peter Freeman, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, where academia's largest reusable software project is under way. ''The problem is that the Japanese listened to us too, and five years ago, while we were still talking, they starting doing something about it.'' **********In the mid-1960's, when airplanes and communications systems were far simpler, so little depended on computers that the average military system required less than five months of software development time. Today, hardly a landing gear is locked in place or a navigation system turned on without the oversight of one or more computer systems, usually communicating constantly with other computers in the air and on the ground. By most estimates, it now takes eight years to develop the software for a complex military system. **********The frustrating part for programmers is that much of their time is spent reinventing the wheel, writing computer code very similar to programs written many times before. **********''Probably 70 percent of the software developed by the major aerospace manufacturers has been written sometime, somewhere before,'' said V. Edward Jones, president of the consortium, which was formed by 12 aerospace companies that include TRW, Grumman, Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed and Northrop. ''But there has never been a library where those programs can be cut up into pieces, indexed by function and then stored.'' **********Building that library has become the first task of the consortium, which is starting with a $20 million annual budget and about 200 employees. Once the system is operating, Mr. Jones hopes, a Boeing programmer, for example, would be able to isolate the program fragment he needs, place it into a larger program under development and rest assured that it has already been debugged, or rid of errors. **********But programs, unfortunately, are rarely written in neat modules that can be snapped on and off like hubcaps. Instead, they are ridden with interdependencies - logical loops that rely on information gained elsewhere in the execution of the program. **********''It's an interconnection problem,'' said Professor Freeman. ''And there is no easy way out. Sometimes you need an 'interconnection language,' some way to connect all of the modules and make sure they work together.'' **********The troubles do not end there. Only recently has the Pentagon settled on a single computer language, called ADA, for all of its systems. But the consortium's library, which is really just a large computer data base, will be filled with programs written in a dozen computer languages. ''In most cases, we won't have the tools for translation,'' said Mr. Jones. ''In those cases, it would probably be faster just to write the program again, in the language you need.'' **********Moreover, not all the programs in the library will be available for loan. While participants in the consortium say they expect no antitrust objections from the Justice Department over joint research, sharing proprietary computer programs among the companies may be tempting fate. As a result, TRW will be able to catalogue all of its own programming work, but it will not have access, for instance, to Boeing's. **********In time, however, access to the programming code itself may be less important than access to the concepts underlying it. At the University of California, Professor Freeman and others are looking for ways to reuse generalized designs and program specifications, so that they can be translated into virtually any language. ''It's like reusing house plans,'' he explains, ''only you decide to move the kitchen to the other side and change the placement of the doors.'' **********More than just efficiency and cost savings are at stake in the recycling effort. Computer experts often bemoan the fact that the pace of software development has not kept up with advances in hardware, particularly microelectronics. One reason is that chip designers rarely spend time worrying about the design of individual circuits. Rather, they borrow an arithmetic unit from one chip, the memory section of another and the telecommunications section of another to build a whole system on a single chip. **********''There's no equivalent of that in software,'' noted Professor Freeman. ''We're still bogged down in the detail.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/01/business/careers-improving-employee-training.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 815, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Improving Employee Training", "print_headline": "CAREERS;   Improving Employee Training", "body_text": " **********SEYMOUR LUSTERMAN, author of a new study for the Conference Board, ''Trends in Corporate Education and Training,'' has found what he considers to be important increases and changes in corporate training policies. **********''I had done a study for the Conference Board about education in industry back in 1977, and I systematically have attempted to take a look at the changes,'' Mr. Lusterman explained in an interview last week. ''We got a grant from the Government's Student Marketing Loan Association, better known as Sallie Mae, to help.'' **********Besides wanting to know more about the scope of education in the private sector, Sallie Mae's administrators wanted to find out if there was a trend among companies to assume student loan obligations. Mr. Lusterman said firmly, ''No, they are not doing that.'' **********Mr. Lusterman thinks that at least five factors have led to a growing corporate emphasis on training employees in the face of large layoffs of blue-collar and middle-management workers. **********First, he puts technological change as a major reason for increased training, so that corporations can keep up. Next, he notes that the companies interviewed stressed that competition had been intensifying. **********''The quality of personnel is so important these days, because of the idea that well-trained employees can help a company in a competitive industry, and also can help cut costs by making people more effective,'' he said. **********Mergers and deregulation are two other factors that have had an increasing impact on management thinking in recent years. **********''Many companies are becoming different kinds of companies,'' Mr. Lusterman said, explaining that not only are some producing different kinds of products from what they offered eight years ago, but they also find they ''need changing skills and new ways of thinking.'' ''Their goal is to become more marketing-oriented.'' he said, noting the financial services industry and the airlines as two examples. **********Mr. Lusterman takes special interest in marketing because before his 16 years with the Conference Board, which is a business-sponsored research organization, he was a vice president of an advertising agency and a marketing vice president for Pepsico Inc. **********Marketing has become especially important to banks like the Bank of America, one of the respondents to the survey. Yesterday, Michael L. Thomas, a vice president and the bank's director of corporate human resources development, reported ''a 500 percent increase in sales training from 1983 to 1984'' in the bank's global consumer marketing division, an indication of banking's changed role. ''Now we are a high-stress industry in contrast to just managing the store before,'' he said. **********In the past the bank concentrated more on training in specific areas such as credit and financial analysis, but now middle and senior officers are getting more training on global issues, such as international trade and finance, business ethics, and cultural differences. **********A fifth factor, according to Mr. Lusterman, is ''the new generation of highly trained managers,'' many with master of business administration and other advanced degrees, who have been taking over top offices. **********Some years ago most training was done at lower levels, but now it has become more pervasive among middle and even senior management. He describes ''a great increase in the upward movement of training.'' **********As the need for training becomes more specialized there has been a trend to use more outsiders. And one problem, not easily solved, is how to pick good ones. **********Experience, reputation and word-of-mouth among training directors are some methods used to pick these trainers. ''But the problem remains,'' Mr. Lusterman said. ''One training director I interviewed even asked if we couldn't do something about developing a consumer guide for picking trainers.'' **********Every large company has its own approach to training, some of them unique. Here are examples: *********** Albert M. Gesler of Allied-Signal Inc. spoke yesterday of the new program of the National Technological University, a consortium of leading engineering schools, which offers master's degrees in engineering and other courses for engineers by satellite. ''At Allied we have put up a dish antenna and can now pick up these course offerings,'' he said. ''It's so new we cannot judge it yet.'' *********** The International Business Machines Corporation long has stressed specific training for employees at the time of a promotion, an approach being more widely adopted now. *********** Hewlett-Packard's corporate training department has 80 people, including a group that handles the corporate closed-television training network, especially for ''new products for sales, service and other support personnel.'' *********** Consolidated Edison has been offering managers 36-month interest-free loans of $500 to $8,000 to buy computer equipment to increase technological proficiency. **********GTE, the diversified telecommunications company, thought so highly of training that in 1979 it created a vice presidency for education and training that now has a staff of 58 people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/world/around-the-world-5000-flee-gas-cloud-from-brazilian-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  5,000 Flee Gas Cloud From Brazilian Plant", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   5,000 Flee Gas Cloud From Brazilian Plant", "body_text": " **********A cloud of toxic ammonia gas escaped from a fertilizer plant in a southeastern Brazilian town, causing the evacuation of 5,000 people and injuring at least 30, environmental officials said today. **********Most of the 30 people who were hospitalized in nearby towns ''had vision and breathing problems, but none was in serious condition,'' said an official of the Sao Paulo state environmental agency in Cubatao, 260 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro. **********Officials said 5,000 people began to flee from the shantytown of Vila Parisi, on the outskirts of Cubatao, after being awakened by strong fumes around midnight Friday.

You can argue that was one of the most important geopolitical events in history - the world's most populous nation and the world's most powerful nation, groping toward each other.'' **********Never, the Lords said, did they indulge in fantasies that they would someday be posted to the country of her birth and his most dramatic diplomacy. ''It's not even something we dared to think about,'' he said. ''We often feel we're living a dream, against all odds, against all planning.'' **********The Language of Literature **********Mrs. Lord, also a Fletcher graduate, casts the development in the language of literature, which she turned to after jobs that included typing envelopes for an insurance company, running programs for the East-West Cultural Center at the University of Hawaii and dancing with a Washington repertory company. **********''As a novelist, I could never plot a book the way this has turned out,'' Mrs. Lord said. ''Some editor would say I'd loaded the dice. To come here as an 8-year-old, to happen to marry an American and, of all Americans, to have it be this one. **********''It's not a straight and narrow life. Winston and I don't sit around and say, 'Two years from now we want to do this.' Things happen to us and we react to the opportunity. In a way, I guess, that's very fatalistic.'' **********It is a fatalism grounded in the culture of her country, which over the years Mr. Lord, an heir to the Pillsbury fortune, has acquired by contagion. ''The ups and downs, the yins and yangs, I'm learning that as I get older,'' he said. **********'Would Have Been Unthinkable' **********Mr. and Mrs. Lord say the assignment to China comes at an especially invigorating time, when Mao's brand of Communism is being upended by Deng Xiaoping. ''Fascinating,'' Mr. Lord said, declining to discuss matters of substantive policy before taking up his new post. ''So much of what's happening in China today would have been unthinkable a few years back.'' **********''In many ways,'' Mrs. Lord said, ''Deng Xiaoping's policies are more earth-shaking than Mao's. I've asked many Chinese friends if they thought today would ever arrive and they said they didn't. **********''China is full of contradictions because of its age, its culture and the things it's trying to do. I think the Chinese culture is so old that China will always be China. It's so rooted in its past that it's not really comparable to anyplace else.'' **********Mr. Lord also declined to discuss the potential difficulties of dealing with the Taiwan lobby, but his views are suggested in an essay he wrote for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in April 1984, at the time of President Reagan's visit to China. **********'Ambiguity and Friction' **********''The President, after early missteps, has resumed the course of his three predecessors,'' Mr. Lord wrote. ''He can reaffirm our undertakings with China without abandoning friends on Taiwan. He can state that we will accept any peaceful solution that is mutually agreeable to the parties. Nevertheless, Taiwan will inevitably remain a source of ambiguity and friction in our dealings.'' **********Mr. Lord represents something of a hybrid between the career Foreign Service officer - like Arthur W. Hummel Jr., his predecessor in Peking -and the political appointees prevalent in Mr. Reagan's first Administration. **********At the American Foreign Service Association, the union that represents State Department employees, Mr. Lord is regarded as a political appointee of the highest order, the equal in qualifications to Mike Mansfield or David Bruce. **********''In my experience,'' Mr. Lord said, ''the most dedicated career officers welcome a political appointee as long as he's qualified. You need new blood, people with different perspectives and skill, or the service becomes ingrown. But not so many that there's no opportunity to rise to the top.'' **********A Touch of Irony **********There would be a touch of irony for Mr. Lord in serving under George P. Shultz, a Secretary of State more inclined than Mr. Kissinger to manage diplomacy through ambassadorial channels. **********Mr. Lord disputed the widely held notion that Mr. Kissinger was almost contemptuous of his ambassadors by citing his dependence on Ellsworth Bunker in Saigon. **********Still, Mr. Lord acknowledged, ''I'm not going to contend Henry used every ambassador to the fullest. But if what you're saying is true, the moral of the story is to be in the right place at the right time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/05/business/insider-reports.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insider Reports", "print_headline": "Insider Reports", "body_text": " **********The New York Stock Exchange issued yesterday its latest report of change in the shareholdings of officers, directors and large stockholders in companies whose shares are listed on the exchange. **********The reports of changes follow: NEW YORK EXCHANGE THE AMERICAN SHIP BUILDING COMPANY-George M.

Moreover, they say, the military is prepared to retaliate swiftly if there are Palestinian or Shiite Moslem guerrilla attacks over the border. **********Today, some Israeli soldiers were lounging atop their armored personnel carrier near the gate, in a startlingly beautiful spot with pink hollyhocks and white Queen Anne's lace blooming on the hills. **********Soldiers Expect to Remain **********The soldiers, asked about the future, shrugged and said they expected to be at this post even after the official withdrawal, which is expected sometime before June 6, the anniversary of the 1982 invasion. **********This post, one of five crossing points where cars and trucks are to be inspected before being allowed to come south from the rest of Lebanon, is at the tip of a kind of salient, about three miles south of the embattled Christian mountain village of Jezzin. **********Jezzin has been held by an Israeli-backed militia, the South Lebanon Army, since fierce fighting broke out this spring between Moslems and Palestinians in Sidon and Christians in the villages in the nearby hills. The Israelis say they hope the South Lebanon Army, which is led by a retired Lebanese Army general, Antoine Lahd, will defend the security zone. **********The Israelis also hope, military experts in Jerusalem say, that the Shiite Moslems - the guerrillas who continuously harried the Israeli forces in the south - will now serve their interests by preventing any return of Palestinian forces in the area. The Shiites have said they will not allow the Palestinian guerrillas in because the Palestinians would bring Israeli retribution against the Shiites.

Such ports, free of Government taxes, are common in Lebanon. **********As the Israeli Army pulled most of its remaining forces out of eastern and central Lebanon today, there were several scuffles over the positions between South Lebanon Army militiamen and United Nations peacekeeping troops left over from a 1979 invasion. **********At Majidiye, near the border, a training camp for the South Lebanon Army has been set up. **********At a nearby range, Israeli officers put new South Lebanon Army tank crews through their paces. **********One tank swung its turret smartly to the right, smashing its cannon into the concrete tower from which the Israeli officers were watching the exercise.

Walker Jr., Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Operations, would not identify any of the 140 banks or give details of those investigations. But he said that between 40 and 50 banks had voluntarily submitted reports to the Treasury since last January on unreported cash transactions. ''And there is some overlap between the two,'' he added. **********Mr. Walker did announce fines totaling about $1.2 million against the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the Chemical Bank and the Irving Trust Company, as a result of thousands of unreported cash transactions of more than $10,000 each between 1980 and 1984. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1980 requires that any cash transaction of more than $10,000 at a bank or other financial institution be reported to the Government. **********Under the law, the Treasury could have fined each bank $1,000 for each transaction, but Mr. Walker said that, since the banks cooperated with the Government's investigation, the fines had been reduced to ''less than 25 percent of the amount that could have been imposed.'' **********Reacting to the Treasury announcement, Representative Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat from Rhode Island and chairman of the House Banking Committee, said: ''In future cases, I sincerely hope the Treasury is not as eager and as generous in settling for what amounts to 25 cents on the dollar in the imposition of its civil money penalties. At these bargain-basement rates, it is no wonder that the banks have come forward gleefully and joyfully.'' **********The banks said today that they paid the fines in order to avoid costly litigation. ''The Treasury observed that there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the transactions,'' said Donald Phelps, a spokesman for the Irving Trust Company, ''and we decided to pay the fine to avoid protracted legal proceedings.'' **********Chase Manhattan, the nation's third-largest bank holding company, will pay the largest fine, $360,000, based on 1,442 unreported cash transactions totaling $853 million. The fine against Manufacturers Hanover, No. 4 in the industry, was $320,000 for 1,393 transactions totaling $140 million. Irving Trust, the 23d-largest bank, will pay $295,000 for 1,242 transactions totaling $310 million, and Chemical, No. 6, agreed to a $210,000 fine for 857 transactions totaling $26 million. **********New York banking sources had indicated that a fifth bank would be named by the Treasury today and that the bank was resisting investigative efforts by the Government. Mr. Walker said, however, that he would not comment on the report. **********The action today comes several months after the First National Bank of Boston pleaded guilty to criminal charges of failing to report some $1.22 billion in large cash transactions. The bank paid a record $500,000 in fines, and the publicity surrounding the case touched off several Congressional inquiries. Mr. Walker said that the Treasury was not currently investigating the Bank of Boston, but that a grand jury investigation was in progress. **********Efforts to enforce Bank Secrecy Act provisions have increased in recent months. The Treasury considers cash reports as a major weapon in its fight against organized crime and drug rings, which at some point deposit the proceeds of their illicit activities into the nation's banking system in the form of large quantities of small-denomination bills. The practice is called money-laundering. **********The Treasury said that it did not have any indications that the unreported transactions at the four big banks involved money-laundering, ''but we can never discount that,'' Mr. Walker said. He also said that the four banks were not the subjects of the I.R.S. investigations. To date, he added, the I.R.S. had requested permission from the Treasury to investigate the 140 banks on possible criminal violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. **********Mr. Walker said the fines were record penalties for a civil violation and that they were ''indicative of the extreme seriousness with which we view reporting failures.'' **********According to spokesmen for the banks, all of the transactions involved either foreign currency or United States currency sent to the banks from abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/03/business/investing-rising-pessimism-over-japanese-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1985-11-03", "snippet": "THE recent moves by Japan's central bank to strengthen the yen are not likely to encourage foreign investment in the Japanese stock market.

In fact, analysts say, many Japanese stocks are already grossly overpriced, and due for a fall. **********But the central bank's action to weaken the dollar has introduced a new element of uncertainty into the Japanese investment environment. Not that there is any expectation that the Japanese economy faces any major shocks. **********''We think the outlook is very good, but we are not buying,'' said John Templeton, who runs the Templeton group of mutual funds, some of which have large positions in overseas stock markets. **********But like other professionals, Mr. Templeton believes that there are better bargains elsewhere, mainly in Europe. Such managers shudder at paying stock prices 25 to 50 times earnings - P/E ratios that many stocks now command in Japan. **********John B. English, managing director of Simms Capital Management, a New York-based firm that invests worldwide, said, ''We're loath to make substantial new investments'' in Japan. He added: ''There is enough risk at these levels to give pause about putting new money in.'' **********Analysts say that the Japanese Government's moves to strengthen the yen should have three major effects: They should stimulate the Japanese economy, increase the buying power of the average Japanese citizen and ultimately dampen the stock prices of companies dependent on exports. **********Those export-oriented companies that could be hurt include many of the large electronic giants, such as Sony, Hitachi and Sharp. Their products will be more expensive on the world market - and in a fiercely competitive environment they will be unable to raise prices. **********''Their profit margins are likely to be squeezed,'' said Benson H. Fung, executive vice president of G. T. Capital Management in San Francisco, which invests clients' funds overseas. Major Japanese auto makers may also be hurt. Some analysts believe that those Japanese companies that cater to the domestic market - particularly in the service sector - will suffer less than the exporters. As a result, Simms Capital's portfolio managers hold two real estate companies, Mitsubishi Realty and Sumitomo Realty, and two restaurant companies, Royal and Skylark. **********Other professionals expect that the recent increase in Japanese interest rates will lure capital out of the stock market and into short-term debt securities. The major players likely to move, they say, are the ''tokkin,'' a relatively new breed of Japanese investor, comparable to hedge fund managers in the United States. These tokkin managers, who are often affiliated with local brokerage firms, invest multibillion-dollar accounts for corporations, and guarantee their clients a fixed rate of return. They invest quite speculatively, move in a pack-like fashion and often are responsible for the wide daily swings in stock prices. ''It's a domestic game with local rules, and it's very difficult to play,'' said Simms Capital's Mr. English. **********With the increase in short-term rates and the drop in bond prices, some analysts worry that the tokkin may dump stocks in favor of higher yielding debt securities. **********Even without the new variable introduced by recent currency moves, the Japanese stock market has been no place for amateurs. It has lagged behind most other stock markets outside the United States: For the two years ended Sept. 30, the Tokyo Stock Exchange index had advanced in value only 48 percent, although there have been some bright spots. **********''There is a tremendous two-tier market,'' said Michael Banton, a director of Baring International Investment Management in London. **********For example, the shares of financial companies, which are primarily banks, climbed 161 percent; in the same period, technology stocks declined by 8 percent. The stocks of domestic-oriented companies, which include utilities, foods and housing, climbed 70 percent over that two-year period; cyclical, manufacturing companies are up 26 percent. **********Over the short term, some analysts are not looking for strong stock movements in any direction. **********Jim Sagawa, an analyst with New York's Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that he considers the market overvalued, but expects it to be ''directionless'' in the coming months. And despite the move to a stronger yen, Mr. Sagawa is recommending Sony. He thinks it will suffer less than other exporters because it is well known, has a strong market niche and solid management. **********By and large, American analysts and portfolio managers agree that Japanese bank shares have seen their peak in prices, now that financial deregulations similar to that occurring in the United States will provide a more competitive banking environment. ''A lot of the banks won't be making money,'' predicted Simms Capital's Mr. English. **********''We think they're grossly overvalued and will be in a bear market for a long, long time,'' said Baring's Mr. Banton. In fact, the stocks have pulled back almost 10 percent since they reached their highs last spring. **********Despite the general pessimism, there is one large investment firm, Baring, that is quite bullish on some Japanese stocks. The London-based firm, which manages $5 billion for clients around the world, has been buying technology stocks such as Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. ''We think technology stocks have another 10 percent to go,'' said Mr. Banton. The firm is avoiding the domestic-oriented stocks because its analysts believe that higher interest rates could hurt such sectors as utilities and construction companies. **********Not Bad, for a First Account **********Many portfolio managers often toil years before they win a prestigious account. But Lee C. Garcia will not have to sweat. When he and two colleagues from the International Business Machines Corporation, Bruce D. Bottomley and Daniel L. Leary, hook up with Daniel F. Sullivan, founder of Boston's Rollert & Sullivan Inc., to start a new investment firm in January, their first account will be I.B.M. **********''Having I.B.M. as the first client has to be the best possible beginning for us,'' said Mr. Garcia. **********For the past six years, Mr. Garcia worked for I.B.M., investing as much as $1.5 billion of the pension fund's equity assets. But his dream has been to set up a small, independent firm to manage large institutional accounts. I.B.M. agreed to become the first client of his new firm, Sasco Capital Inc. in Fairfield, Conn., and has hired the firm to manage a ''significant amount'' of its pension assets. **********I.B.M. is changing the way it runs its $15 billion pension fund. (About half of the fund is invested in American stocks; the rest in bonds, international equities, venture capital and real estate.) While size may help I.B.M. sell computers, big is not necessarily better in investing, particularly in stocks. In fact, many investors and consultants contend that managers with large sums of money are unable to ''beat the market.'' A large portfolio is harder to invest, it disrupts prices and it makes it difficult to move swiftly in and out of securities. **********So I.B.M. recently decided to increase significantly the portion of the plan managed in index funds - passively managed accounts designed simply to match the performance of the broad market. The exact ratio is a closely guarded I.B.M. secret. I.B.M. will continue to manage the index funds internally. Outside firms, such as Sasco, will invest the remaining funds, as they have in the past. **********''For the past six years Mr. Garcia and his associates have contributed significantly to the growth of the I.B.M. pension fund,'' said Jon W. Rotenstreich, I.B.M.'s vice president and treasurer.

In the recent agreement with Jordan, the P.L.O. accepted ''all'' Security Council resolutions, but some of its leaders subsequently condemned Resolution 242, which calls on Israel to give back land occupied in the 1967 war in return for secure and recognized borders. **********Outlining what he had said to Mr. Reagan in private, Mr. Mubarak said in his farewell remarks on the White House lawn: ''I believe that no nation is more qualified than America to support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.''

''Destiny has chosen you to lead this great nation at a time when a golden opportunity for peace is emerging.'' **********He said last month's agreement between King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, calling for peace in the Middle East, but advocating procedures not acceptable to Israel or the United States, ''is a major development that should not discounted or discarded.'' **********But Mr. Reagan in his remarks was much more cautious. He applauded Mr. Mubarak for suggestions that had ''helped renew interest in the peace process,'' but repeated the Administration's view that only through ''direct negotiations'' between Israel and its Arab neighbors can peace be achieved. **********Tonight, in a toast at a dinner he gave for Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Reagan said it was necessary ''to clear the way so that negotiations can begin'' in the Middle East.

The Challenger, a British vessel that designed to recover objects from the seabed, is steaming toward the crash site. **********Ocean Is 6,000 Feet Deep **********On Monday, the Challenger met a helicopter carrying technicians and equipment that should improve the ship's ability to probe the 6,000-foot-deep ocean area presumed to be the resting place of the bulk of the jumbo jet. **********The recording devices, generally called the black boxes despite their bright red color, are thought to be trapped in wreckage because they are designed to float when loose. **********The devices may indicate whether the plane was blasted out of the sky by a bomb, as suspected, while it was cruising at 31,000 feet. The devices may even help locate the source of a blast, which would in turn help determine how a bomb might have been planted. For now, officials said, little is certain. Capt. Jimmy Martin, the chief spokesman for Air-India, said: **********''It would appear, according to one of our senior investigators, that the plane did break up before it hit the water, but the cause of the breaking up is totally unknown.'' #50 Autopsies Are Performed About 50 autopsies on recovered victims were conducted by pathologists at Cork Regional Hospital today, but officials said the examinations did not appear to have yielded any dramatic new evidence. **********There was also doubt that the few fragments of the Boeing 747 recovered so far would yield any hints. Perhaps one percent of the plane has been recovered, according to Irish aviation officials and Harold R. Piper, Boeing's representative in the four-member American delegation. **********Mr. Piper declined to speculate on the cause of the plunge. When asked about possible structural defects because of aging, he said the plane had logged 23,000 hours of flying time, about half the service of the most heavily traveled 747's. **********No Structural Pieces Picked Up **********The parts that have been recovered are mainly objects like plastic baggage bins and cushions. The main structural pieces of the plane are not designed to float. **********Experts are hopeful that the recording devices can be found. They are designed to emit electronic signals for up to a month from depths up to 20,000 feet. **********The problem is that water conditions, such as temperature variations, may distort the signals or limit their range, according to experts. **********If the devices are located, an expensive salvage operation may be needed to recover them. Submarines have plucked items off the seabed at greater depths than 6,000 feet, but aviation officials said that picking up a chunk of the 747 or separating the devices from it presented a tougher challenge. **********No Precedent at Such Depths **********''Nothing has ever been salvaged from that depth before, as far as we know,'' said Gerrard McCabe, one of the Irish officials working with Air-India. **********John Young, the National Transportation Safety Board investigator who heads the American group, said: **********''Personally, I think the odds against getting it are high. There are an awful lot of people who would like to see whether it can be done. It is certain that nothing will happen any time soon and that it would take a great effort.'' **********Private estimates of the cost of recovery run into the millions of dollars. Captain Martin, the Air-India spokesman, denied reports that India had already chartered a British ship with deepsea recovery capabilities. **********One way or another, British technology is expected to figure in the effort. Britain has experience in recovering helicopters and vessels lost in servicing the North Sea oilfields. **********Deepsea Disasters Are Unusual **********Airline accident experts say that they have little experience in offshore catastrophes and are seeking advice from marine technology specialists. **********One issue settled today was where to conduct the initial investigation of wreckage from the craft. All items are being taken to Haulbowline Naval Base, just east of here. **********Air-India and the investigators also said they were discouraging relatives of victims from coming here until the autopsies and the scientific identification process had been completed. **********The autopsies are now expected to be finished by Thursday. However, the effort through Interpol and Kenyons, a London-based accident information firm, to assemble vital statistics and dental records is likely to last until at least next Tuesday. **********Mostly Females Recovered So Far **********Captain Martin, the Air-India spokesman said, ''80 percent of the bodies should be identified by medical authorities if we have dental charts.'' **********However, he said that there might not be any dental charts for some of the victims who had been residents of India. So far only one of the recovered victims is not Indian by ethnic origin. **********Supt. Frank Hanlon, the Irish police spokesman handling questions about the activities at the hospital, said 100 of the 131 bodies were female.

But many experts believe that, although the chains may not be so appealing to investors today as they were a few years ago, several bright spots still exist. **********''I like the regional chains, which can more precisely focus on their operations, such as Sizzler steak houses,'' says Roger Lipton, managing director of Lipton Research, a division of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. ''Operationally, Sizzler does twice as well in terms of return on sales, return on equity and consistent growth than such national steak house chains as Ponderosa.'' **********Sizzler Restaurants International, which is 70 percent owned by Collins Foods International, has shown steady earnings growth in the last five years. For the fiscal year ended April 30, it earned 97 cents a share (adjusted for a recent a 3-for-2 stock split), up from 78 cents a share a year earlier. The stock closed yesterday at $23.50, down 50 cents, in over-the-counter trading. **********Mr. Lipton said he also liked the stocks of companies that were renovating restaurants. ''When you spruce up stores, you can usually look for a 15 to 20 percent gain in sales,'' he said. In this category, he said, are Sizzler, Pancho's Mexican Buffet, International Kings Table, Sea Galley Stores, Restaurant Associates, Jerrico's and Morrison. **********Expressing a less optimistic view are Jay Fairfield and Richard Pyle, analysts at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. They say the restaurant chain business is close to its saturation point. **********''The growth in the number of restaurant units has to slow until the number of away-from-home eaters catches up,'' they said. In their opinion, the best investments among the convenience food stocks tend to be the big chains - Burger King, McDonald's and Wendy's -which are still showing growth. **********The expansion of these companies has been at the expense of smaller chains, which have either lost market share or growth momentum. ''Big chains have massive marketing power, which gives a very big edge,'' Mr. Lipton said.  Among smaller chains, Mr. Pyle is recommending Vicorp, a Denver-based company that operates coffee shops throughout the West and Middle West. He said the company could earn as much as $1.50 a share in the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, up from $1.32 a share in the fiscal year 1984. Mr. Pyle believes Vicorp has the potential to turn around its recently acquired Sambo's Restaurants, and, if so, he sees fiscal year 1986 earnings rising strongly to $1.90 to $2.50 a share. **********According to Edward Tavlen, food and lodging analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben in Cleveland, the fast-food industry has turned into a highly segmented investment area with only a few consistent performers. ''Many of the former hot stocks, such Chi-Chi's and Diversifoods, have cooled off,'' he said. Mr. Tavlen is not recommending any fast-food stocks at the moment. **********Frank Williams, a special situation analyst at Cantor, Fitzgerald in Boston, said, ''The present picture is gloomy, with a few bright spots like Cracker Barrel, Dunkin' Donuts, Vicorp and Ryan's Family Steak House.'' **********John P. Uphoff, restaurant analyst at Raymond, James & Associates of St. Petersburg, Fla., and himself a former restaurateur, likes the prospects for Ryan's Family Steak House over the long term. **********''Ryan's management has demonstrated over a period of time that it can control costs and profits during a very aggressive period in which sales and earnings have been increasing by over 50 percent a year,'' Mr. Uphoff said. He said he also viewed Shoney's Inc. and Chili's Inc. as buy opportunities. **********An overview of restaurant stocks is presented by the SBHU Restaurant Stock Universe and Index. Published by Smith Barney, it shows that in the first five months of 1985 its 40 restaurant stock index modestly outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500. **********The best price gains in the first five months of 1985 were made by the family/coffee shop segment, which showed an average gain of 33.7 percent at the end of May, buoyed by very sharp advances by Frisch's Restaurants and Dunkin' Donuts. The second-largest gain of the 10 groups in the index was made by family/steak house restaurants, led by Ryan's Family Steak House and Sizzler. The poorest performing group was the upscale burger segment, which as of June 14, 1985, had risen a scant 1.8 percent from its closing price on Dec. 31."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/world/pretoria-hangs-a-black-activist.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1985-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 701, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRETORIA HANGS A BLACK ACTIVIST", "print_headline": "PRETORIA HANGS A BLACK ACTIVIST", "body_text": " **********Despite international appeals for clemency, a black supporter of the outlawed African National Congress was hanged today in Pretoria for his role in the 1982 murder of a security policeman. **********The execution of the black activist, Benjamin Moloise, 30 years old, set off rioting by hundreds of blacks in downtown Johannesburg. Two white policemen were stabbed, a black man was shot by security forces and at least eight white pedestrians were beaten on the city streets. **********President P. W. Botha had received appeals from around the world to commute the execution, including appeals from the United States, the Commonwealth, the European Economic Community and the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution last year calling on the South African authorities not to execute Mr. Moloise. [In Washington, a State Department spokesman said, ''We have made plain our opinion that clemency in this case was justified.'' At the United Nations, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar deplored the hanging, and the Organization of African Unity denounced what it called the South African Government's ''act of barbarism.'']  Mr. Moloise's lawyers had asked that the case be reopened because of new evidence that they said would have led to commutation of the sentence. Mr. Moloise was sentenced to death in September 1983 for the murder of the security policeman 10 months earlier. **********Mr. Moloise was put to death at about 7 A.M. inside the domed execution hall of Pretoria Central Prison, a dreary brown structure framed by brilliant jacaranda trees. His parents, Mamike and Robert Moloise, and other relatives arrived at the prison an hour earlier but were barred from entering for about 90 minutes until a warden came out and informed them that Mr. Moloise was dead. **********''I once felt sympathy with these people,'' said Mrs. Moloise, a frail, elderly woman who visited her son Thursday for the last time. On Thursday night, soldiers surrounded and fired tear-gas into her home in the sprawling black township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg, as several hundred people gathered at a vigil for her son. **********''From 6 o'clock I have been waiting,'' she said. ''Even this time, the last time to maybe see my son, they tell me to go away. I can't go away. This is my son. If they arrest me, fine. It is my son they killed.'' **********Mrs. Moloise produced her pass book - which must be carried by blacks for identification and permission to be in so-called white areas - to show guards that she was the condemned man's mother. **********Mrs. Mandela Joins Group **********The police used dogs to prevent reporters and photographers, who were later joined by Winnie Mandela, wife of the jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, from approaching the prison gates. **********Mr. Moloise was to be hanged last August, but his lawyers won a stay of execution on the ground of new evidence. The African National Congress has twice denied Mr. Moloise's responsibility for the murder. His lawyers have said he did not kill the policeman but was involved in activities leading up to the shooting. **********Mr. Moloise, who wrote poetry and was the father of two children, was hanged along with another convicted murderer. **********Burial in Prison Cemetery **********Under South African law, the body of an executed prisoner is the property of the state, and Mr. Moloise is to be buried in a prison cemetery. Mrs. Moloise said prison officials had told her to return to Pretoria next week to receive ''a grave number.'' **********Mrs. Moloise cried as Mrs. Mandela hugged her after she left the chapel. Relatives, including elderly aunts who were draped in old blankets, gathered in a parking lot across from the prison and, with clenched fists raised, sang ''God Save Africa.'' **********''This Government is cruel,'' Mrs. Moloise said. ''It is really, really cruel.'' **********An emotional memorial service for Mr. Moloise in downtown Johannesburg later in the day ended in violence, as some of the 500 people at the service took to the streets chanting freedom songs and carrying signs that read, ''The struggle will go on, Ben.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/30/business/briefs-b.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS b", "print_headline": "BRIEFS b", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues *********** DBA Systems has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of $30 million of convertible subordinated debentures due 2010 through underwriters led by E.

By day's end, the Dow average had registered its best gain since it climbed 24.75 points on June 21. **********The surge yesterday, which followed sharp declines in the last two weeks, was led by pharmaceutical concerns, computer makers and other multinational enterprises that had seen their overseas sales hurt by the strong dollar.

In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.74, to 286.09. **********Skepticism Among Analysts **********But some analysts questioned whether the euphoria would last. They noted that the market was primed for a rebound, given the declines over the last two weeks, including last Friday's drop of nearly 9 points, which brought the Dow below the 1,300 level. That decline was attributed mainly to temporary selling pressures related to the expiration of futures and options contracts. **********Signs of caution were noted in yesterday's trading by these analysts.

It calls for closer coordination of the members' foreign policies and formally commits Common Market members to Europe's monetary unification, while also extending the community's competence into other new fields, including technology and enviromental protection. **********The agreement, however, fell well short of the grandiose ''relaunching of Europe'' that European leaders called for at their meeting in Milan in June. Then, at the urging of President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, they voted to set up an intergovernmental conference to prepare proposals for drafting the Treaty of Rome again along more federal lines, with member governments surrendering more individual authority to community decisions and to the European Parliament. **********Eliminating Trade Barriers **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher described the meeting's outcome as ''modest,'' saying its main achievement had been to make it possible for the Common Market to free up its international market by 1992, as planned. **********President Mitterrand described the outcome as ''a compromise for progress.'' **********The plan represented a substantial retreat from the positions many governments took in Milan.

It also recently purchased a bank in Delaware and is negotiating to buy another in South Dakota. **********And it has installed 306 Sears Financial Network centers - combinations of insurance, securities and real estate brokerages - in its stores. The centers consist of three Sears subsidiaries - an Allstate insurance broker, a Dean Witter securities borker, and a Coldwell Banker real estate broker. **********On the retail side, Sears opened a small-scale test store in February in Alma, a central Michigan town of 10,000, and plans to open dozens of such stores throughout small-town America, a new market for the company. **********Meanwhile the Chicago-based retailer's 11 new Sears Paint and Hardware Stores in Chicago and New York have done so well that the company plans to open 40 more, all in big cities, next year. **********And while all this is going on, Sears is sprucing up many of its 800 existing stores into what it calls Stores of the Future, which it hopes will kindle more consumer interest. **********'Sears Is Moving' **********''The exciting thing is that Sears is moving,'' said Edward R. Telling, the 66-year-old chairman of the retailer that was once known best for hardware and home appliances. ''I know the market is there for what we're doing.'' **********Nevertheless, not all of the new ventures are thriving. Dean Witter, which Sears purchased for $607 million in 1981, lost $33 million last year. But company officials say much of the loss resulted from the brokerage's rapid expansion. It added 1,000 brokers. **********Despite some setbacks in the company's far-reaching expansion, many analysts are enthusiastic about all the changes. **********''I think it's all going to pay off in a few years,'' said John S. Landschulz, an analyst with Mesirow & Company in Chicago. '' Their historic business - retailing - has reached maturity, so they're seeking to invest in dynamic areas to increase their return on investment. Their move into financial services isn't without some risk but it isn't without some experience either.'' **********The basic strategy seems a simple one: to pump more dollars into Sears's vast empire. The more business its stores handle, and the more credit billings its computers process, the more profit the company stands to make. Last year the company earned $1.46 billion on $38.83 billion in revenues. **********Financial Subsidiaries **********The in-store financial centers are one example of how Sears is trying to milk more business from its existing stores, said Stuart M. Robbins, an analyst with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, ''When you're a mature company servicing 80 percent of the population, it's unlikely that you'll attract many new customers,'' Mr. Robbins said, ''so you try to get more of the business from the customers you have.'' **********Along these lines, Sears, which is already strong in durables, is trying to get its customers to spend more on its higher-margin nondurable goods. Thus, the 110 Stores of the Future - the renovated, reconfigured stores - are increasing the ratio of nondurables such as clothing to durables such as refrigerators. **********In addition, Sears, both in its stores and its catalogues, is stressing more fashionable, brand-name clothes instead of the less stylish Sears private labels. Sears also plans to begin selling brand-name electronics, such as Sony and RCA televisions and video cassette recorders, in test markets in San Francisco and Atlanta next month, in addition to its private labels. **********''Brand names are definitely in; that's what the consumer wants,'' said Mr. Landschulz of Mesirow & Company. **********Convience Stores **********As for the paint and hardware stores, Sears officials say that the plan was to make them convenience stores for paint or caulk. **********William I. Bass, chairman of the Sears merchandising group, said the company would open 50 downsized stores in small communities next year and was considering expanding ultimately to 350 towns. ''They're entirely different from anything we've done before,'' Mr. Bass said, noting that for the first time Sears would have stores in small towns that would stock paint, hardware, electronics and appliances. ''In the markets we enter, we'll be dominant in the lines we carry.'' **********Analysts and Sears officials agree that the company's biggest move this year is the introduction of Discover, an orange and black credit card with a sunrise emblazoned on it that will be issued by Sears's own Greenwood Trust Company. Sears already has extensive experience in the credit card field, with 28 million active Sears card holders. **********Expanded Services **********But while the company hopes to build the distribution of the Discover card on its list of existing card holders, the new card will differ markedly from the current one. A customer will be able to use it in restaurants, hotels and stores other than Sears, and will also be able to cash checks, withdraw cash from automated teller machines, and earn interest on money deposited in the card account. **********Edward A. Brennan, Sears's president and chief operating officer who will become chairman when Mr. Telling retires by the end of the year, said surveys showed that 38 percent of Sears's card holders and 29 percent of non-holders would welcome the Discover card. **********And Edward Weller, an analyst with E.F. Hutton & Company, estimated that Sears would spend $70 million next year in distributing the card. ''If you're paying $20 a year for your card,'' he said, ''Sears will make sure theirs is cheaper than that.'' **********Many analysts question, however, whether competing retailers will accept the Discover card. ''If it's clear that Sears is associated with the card, it's doubtful that many competing department stores will participate,'' said Walter F. Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Sears officials responded that the travel and entertainment industry accounts sought by the company have so far responded enthusiastically. As for retailers, Mr. Telling said, ''If we have millions of cards out, our competitors will be eager to take them because it will help their sales.'' **********Sears officials talk frequently about the ''synergies'' that their financial network makes possible. For example, Sears hopes that customers who buy a house through Coldwell Banker will obtain property insurance from Allstate, get a mortgage through an arm of the financial network, and use the discount book obtained from Coldwell Banker to buy a Sears washer and dryer. Sears hopes to see this pattern often repeated because Coldwell Banker expects to capture 8 percent of the residential resale market this year and 12 percent in 1988, up from just 1 percent in 1981. **********Nonetheless, some analysts say the financial network still has some problems. ''While on paper a lot of synergy exists, there is still a lot to be proven,'' said David C. Taylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. **********One case in point is Dean Witter. Although its in-store offices attracted 155,000 new accounts last year, Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services, said the offices had skimmed the cream of Sears's customers and would find it harder to land new accounts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/19/world/yugoslav-food-prices-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslav Food Prices Up", "print_headline": "Yugoslav Food Prices Up", "body_text": " **********Yugoslavia said today that the price of bread would rise 35 percent Friday and that the prices of some other vital foods and energy would also rise considerably.

Jesse Jackson, a ''reverse Robin Hood process, taking from the poor and giving to the rich.'' But newly released figures from the Internal Revenue Service on 1983 tax returns show that the tax cut had just the opposite effect. After the cut, the rich paid more and carried a larger share of the total, while the poor paid less. Lower taxes encouraged the rich to earn more taxable income and shelter less - that is, to spend more time with engineers, clients and market researchers and less time with tax attorneys and accountants. **********This picture emerges when we look at the changes in tax payments for those earning more than $75,000 in 1981 - the top 1.36 percent of taxpayers. Assuming normal personal deductions, these taxpayers faced marginal tax rates above 50 percent, before the 1981 legislation. Not only did they get an across-the-board tax cut, as did all taxpayers, but they also benefited dramatically from the reduction in the top bracket to 50 percent from 70 percent. **********With such a big cut, many people would expect this group to pay much less tax. In fact, the top 1.36 percent paid 10.9 percent more in taxes in 1983 than in 1981. Moreover, they paid a greater share of total taxes than at any time in the past 15 years - 23.3 percent of the total tax in 1983, compared with 20.4 percent in 1981. In contrast, the bottom half of income recipients paid 7.1 percent in 1983, down from 7.5 percent in 1981. **********Why did the rich end up paying more despite the lowered tax rates? The major reason is that taxes change incentives. Consider the change in incentives for someone in the top bracket. At the 70 percent marginal tax rate, an added dollar gains only 30 cents for the earner. But after the tax cut, the earner keeps 50 cents of each additional dollar - a whopping 67 percent increase in the incentive to earn. Hiding income in tax shelters yields less, while finding ways to cut business costs and increase sales yields a higher return. **********With this greater incentive, executives spend less on plush offices and Hawaii conferences - both tax-deductible business expenses - and more on the business of satisfying customers. Surgeons, lawyers and other professionals spend more time in the office and less on the golf course. In each case, the driving force is a greater incentive to earn, since each additional dollar is worth 50 cents, rather than 30 cents. As a result, their taxable incomes rise. **********When the I.R.S. data for 1982 showed that the rich were paying a greater share of taxes, many critics resisted the incentives explanation. Some argued that the tax burden shifted to the rich because the 1982 recession cut income growth among lower- and middle-income groupings. However, since we now see that the same pattern was present during the economic boom of 1983, the ''recession-caused-it'' explanation has lost its credibility. **********CRITICS also argued that the rapid growth of the upper-income tax base was a ''bubble'' effect, reflecting temporary capital gains from the boom in the stock market. The problem with the ''bubble'' theory is that capital gains are too small - only about 10 percent of gross income for the top 1.36 percent of taxpayers - to bring about major changes in the distribution of income. **********Instead, employment and business income - by far the largest components - drove the growth of taxable income in the top brackets. The wages and salaries of the top 1.36 percent of earners were 20.7 percent higher in 1983 than in 1981. **********Income changes in the categories of businesses and partnerships are particularly important, since they often provide tax shelter opportunities. The taxable income of the top 1.36 percent of taxpayers from business and professional practices, partnerships and small-business corporations rose from $13.7 billion in 1981 to $20.6 billion in 1983, an astounding gain of 50 percent in two years. **********It is true that lower tax rates reduced the value of tax shelter investments and increased the value of assets that yielded taxable income, such as stocks and bonds. This pushed up stock and bond prices, reflecting the movement of resources away from tax-favored investments towards those generating high real returns. Was this bad? **********The ''bubble'' theory is also inconsistent with the time dimension of decision-making. Few taxpayers sell their old tax-shelter investments as soon as rates go down. But they make fewer new shelter investments. It takes time to move resources into more productive, unsheltered investments. Thus, the expansion of taxable income from the 1981 tax cut will continue for some years. **********A larger economic pie can mean a larger slice for everyone. The 1981 tax cuts increased the incentive of those in high tax brackets to earn income. These taxpayers applied less of their scarce time, energy and money to low-return tax shelters and more to projects yielding higher returns. They increased productivity and expanded G.N.P.

The AMR Corporation, American's parent, dropped $1.875, to $35.25, in active trading, and other carriers also plunged. (Page D3.) **********American's move was matched by such major carriers as Trans World Airlines, Delta, United, Northwest and to a degree by Pan American World Airways. **********Andrew B. Kim, airline analyst for F. Eberstadt, called American's move an ''excellent concept which will simplify the fare structure'' and forecast that ''this will not set off an industrywide fare war in the business travel market.'' **********And Russel Marchetta, a spokesman for People Express, said: ''It's a heavily restricted fare and it will add some low-priced seats. But we don't see it as a major concern because it is so restrictive.'' **********Still, analysts cautioned that, if a major carrier such as Continental cut its prices, it could set off a fare war. They also noted that the first quarter was a slow period for travel, tempting carriers to try to stimulate traffic. **********Changes Take Effect Feb. 18 **********The major change in American's fare structure is the elimination of the Super Saver fares, which offered discounts of up to 50 percent. They are being replaced by Ultimate Super Savers, with discounts of up to 70 percent from regular coach fares. The changes take effect Feb. 18 and the airline has hired more reservation clerks. **********Thus, the new low discount fare from Chicago to New York will be $69 for one way, or 74 percent below full coach fare of $268. Discount fares from New York to Los Angeles will go to $129, or 73 percent below the full coach fare of $479. **********While the cuts will be deeper, the restrictions will be tighter. Under the present Super Saver fare, one had to purchase a ticket 14 days in advance. Under the Ultimate Super Saver, the ticket must be bought 30 days in advance. And in an unusual move, only 75 percent of the value of the ticket will be refunded if it is not used. In the past, most airlines have given full refunds. **********The miminum stay requirement for the new fare is less restrictive, however. It merely calls for a stay over a Saturday night rather than a minimum of seven days under the present Super Saver. **********Limits Are Cited **********Mr. Gunn emphasized repeatedly that American had built in what he called ''fences'' to put limits on the new fares. **********Business travelers who travel at short notice will generally not be able to take advantage of the new low fares and will travel mostly on full fares. Mr. Gunn also said that only 25 to 30 percent of the seats in American's system would be available at the lower fares on the average. **********Not every flight will offer discount seats, but discounts will be available to all the 92 domestic cities that American serves. **********For example, Mr. Gunn said, on a flight from New York's La Guardia Airport to Chicago at 5 P.M. Friday, when there is a heavy demand for seats, the airline will not offer any seats at the discount. On the 2 P.M. flight, where the demand is less, seats will be made available. **********Also, in the busier summer season, the fares will go up from $10 to $20. **********Mr. Gunn said the airline hoped that the lower fares would fill some of the 35 percent to 40 percent of the seats now empty on many American flights. He said that the airline was encouraged when it found in a survey that 17 percent of its passengers made reservations at least 30 days in advance, indicating that there was a market that could be expanded. **********Martin R. Shugrue, vice chairman of Pan Am, said in a statement that unrealistic purchase requirements and onerous cancellation penalties meant that the American fares ''will appeal only to a narrow segment of the marketplace.'' **********Pan Am yesterday extended its $119 one-way fare between New York and San Francisco and Los Angeles, which was due to expire Jan. 31, to March 15. The fare is available only from Monday through Thursday but does undercut American's $129 one- way fare. There are no other restrictions on the Pan Am fare. **********Mr. Gunn said that American, which is based in Dallas and has its hub at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, would keep fares even lower to match some fares of such carriers in Texas as Southwest Airlines. He also said that he did not know how American would respond if other carriers severely undercut its lowest fares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/08/business/about-real-estate-new-houses-mean-a-new-kind-of-mail-delivery-too.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Oser", "pub_date": "1985-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 841, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  NEW HOUSES MEAN A NEW KIND OF MAIL DELIVERY, TOO", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE;   NEW HOUSES MEAN A NEW KIND OF MAIL DELIVERY, TOO", "body_text": " **********It came as an unwelcome surprise to Suzanne Murphy to learn that she will no longer get mail delivered to her door after she moves around the corner in about two weeks to a newly built house in the Windsor Terrace section of Brooklyn. **********''I thought it would be like the row house where we live now,'' said Mrs. Murphy, a mental-health administrator. There the mail comes to her door, but the Postal Service has long since abandoned that practice in what it calls New Delivery Areas. **********In these areas mail is delivered to an individual mailbox at curbside or to a gang box, so called because it is a cluster of 8, 12 or 16 boxes. To get mail from a gang box, a resident may have to walk as far as 100 feet. **********The new Windsor Terrace houses are expected to have centralized delivery at gang boxes. Such boxes have been appearing with regularity in New York City - and, in fact, all over the country - since 1978. To hear home builders tell it, people are adjusting. Developers seem to prefer the centralized boxes, which can be partly enclosed or otherwise given esthetic enhancement, rather than curbside delivery to individual boxes. **********At a new development in Kansas City, Mo., the Coves North, buyers of $110,000 to $210,000 houses will get mail from gang boxes mounted on stainless steel pedestals, according to Jim Young, president of the Jim Young Companies, the developer. **********''With gang boxes there's no excuse for no delivery,'' Mr. Young said. One trouble with the curbside boxes installed in a previous Jim Young subdivision, he said, was that if a car happened to be parked in front of the box, the mailman sometimes did not make a delivery. **********Since house frontages average 90 feet at the Coves North, some people must walk 300 feet for their mail, Mr. Young said. **********Similarly, in Pembroke Pines, Fla., a development company called Pasadena Homes found that individual curbside boxes lacked esthetic uniformity and tended to get damaged after a while. In its latest project, called Pasadena Pool Homes, the developer has provided pedestals for gang boxes at three sites for a total of 110 lots. ''We've had no complaints,'' said John Arbib, vice president in the company's home-building division. **********Clustered boxes also win the vote of Morton Meltzer, a Staten Island builder. He speaks with dismay of the mailbox situation at a condominium development called the Continental, built five years ago at Avon in the South Shore community of Huguenot. There the individual owners supplied their own curbside boxes with no architectural compatibility. Some of the boxes were not securely installed or have been knocked loose. **********''Maybe we missed the boat,'' said Mr. Meltzer, who uses the standard Postal Service gang boxes for his new development, Darcy Condominiums. **********The Postal Service's current authority on clustered boxes is Michael Shine, national program manager in Washington for centralized mail delivery. The formal name for gang boxes, he said, is ''pedestal-mounted locking mail receptacles.'' They make mail delivery much cheaper. Delivery to the door costs the Postal Service an average of $105 a year, Mr. Shine said, while curbside delivery costs $83 and centralized delivery costs $53. **********Although the option of mail delivery to the door of new houses ended in 1978, he said, it may still be used in hardship cases or for houses built on vacant lots between older homes. **********Last year the Postal Service changed its policy on responsibility for boxes. The Postal Service is no longer responsible for installation and maintenance of boxes in mobile-home parks, apartment houses and colleges, but it remains responsible at residential developments, business locations and military installations. **********An apartment house is defined as any structure containing three or more residential units with a common entrance and a common street address. ''It has nothing to do with high-rise or low-rise,'' Mr. Shine said. **********Centralized boxes will always be within a ''reasonable'' distance of the housing units, Mr. Shine said. Precisely where they go is left up to the local postmaster, who decides on a case-by-case basis. **********Buyers of the 17 new Windsor Terrace houses, built under the New York Partnership's auspices, might take some comfort from the observation of Lueweeda Thurston, an owner in the recently completed 48-unit Fulton Park development in Bedford-Stuyvesant. **********''It's not a long walk,'' said Mrs. Thurston, whose husband, Charles, is the block association president, ''and it's safer for the people.'' There has been no trouble with break-in attempts at the well-exposed boxes in Fulton Park, she said, although such attempts have occurred elsewhere at individual mailboxes on houses. **********People who are unhappy with the new system may be reminded that things used to be much worse. ''Until 1863,'' said Louis Eberhardt, a Postal Service spokesman, ''everyone picked up the mail at the post office.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/02/business/british-oil-drilling-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Oil Drilling Up", "print_headline": "British Oil Drilling Up", "body_text": " **********A record 106 oil and gas wells were drilled around Britain in 1984 and 23 of them struck fuel, the British Energy Minister, Alick Buchanan- Smith, said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/world/for-salvador-rebels-a-world-apart.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1985-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 996, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR SALVADOR REBELS, A WORLD APART", "print_headline": "FOR SALVADOR REBELS, A WORLD APART", "body_text": " **********The four top commanders of the most powerful Salvadoran guerrilla faction sat for an evening recently in this small mountain village and talked of their war against the Salvadoran Government and the United States. **********The overwhelming sense left after a day with the commanders and their supporters was of a separate world, existing only 60 miles from the capital of San Salvador, but distanced from it by a perhaps unbridgable difference in political goals, a decade of social struggle and six years of war that has progressively depopulated the area and left a legacy of hatred. **********A small group of rebel supporters brought into the village from outlying areas to talk to reporters chanted: ''Death to Duarte! Death to the Yankee aggressor!'' **********At times, their voices cracked with emotion as they spoke of a future settling of accounts with the Government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. They accuse the Government and the Reagan Administration of permitting the army to burn their fields, destroy their homes and bomb their villages. **********''We are living under escalated United States aggression,'' said Leonel Gonzalez, head of the Popular Liberation Forces rebel faction that commands this area. ''This people lives submitted to injustice.'' **********A Former Teacher **********The retinue of a guerrilla patrol cluttered the dirt-laned village square as the sun fell - radio operators calling to outlying guard posts in code; 10-year-old messenger boys dwarfed by their automatic rifles, and civilian militiamen and women who cook, wash and scan the hills for the Salvadoran Army, which they call ''the enemy.'' **********And in the clefts of nearby ridges, heavily armed rebel combat units, dressed in fatigues, stood ready to fight. **********Mr. Gonzalez, who is 42 years old and a former schoolteacher, was accompanied by three other top officials of the Popular Liberation Forces - Jesus Rojas, Ricardo Gutierez and Dimas Rodriguez. The four rarely give interviews, but they asked to meet reporters to discuss a rebel peace plan that demands a direct share of power in the Government. The Government has previously refused to consider the proposal. **********The rebel commanders defended the kidnapping of President Duarte's eldest daughter and of local mayors two months ago, describing the actions as part of a general strategy against the Government and ''North American intervention'' in El Salvador. Mr. Duarte's daughter, Ines Guadalupe Duarte, and the mayors were released in a prisoner exchange last month. **********The rebels pledged to fight on indefinitely and discussed their preparation of a rebel government in the areas they control. The guerrilla administration, known as ''popular power,'' is staffed by locally elected peasants. It appears to constitute the only known government for the generation of young children now coming of age in the isolated mountain valleys in this region of northern El Salvador. **********'Smartest and Best Organized' **********The rebel army the four men lead draws unusual respect and a degree of concern from the Salvadoran military and the United States Embassy here. The Popular Liberation Forces is considered the most politically agile and militarily enduring of the five factions that make up the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. **********The Popular Liberation Forces, which follows a generally Marxist ideology keyed to the perceived needs of the Salvadoran peasantry and urban working class, has withstood repeated army attacks and spent a decade building a base in the peasant villages of the northern provinces of Chalatenango and Cabanas. **********''The Popular Liberation Forces are the only guerrilla group to fear in the long run,'' a Foreign Military official said in a recent interview. ''They are the smartest and the best organized.'' **********Mr. Gonzalez said a rebel team, which he refused to describe in greater detail, had kidnapped Mr. Duarte's daughter after the top commanders of the rebel front agreed in June to step up kidnappings and attacks in the capital. He confirmed that Miss Duarte had written a diary during her captivity, and he indicated that the rebels might make the diary public. **********Miss Duarte had become more sympathetic to the rebels after seeing how they live, he contended. **********''The vision she had in her mind of the guerrillas as inhumane, illiterate, a vision of terrorist people, this vision was broken,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. Miss Duarte has not granted interviews since her release. **********President Duarte has said that the rebels tried to separate his daughter from him and that he was accompanying her to therapy sessions to overcome the effects of her kidnapping. **********'Remove a False Power' **********Mr. Gonzalez and the other commanders said the meeting in June of the rebel movement's general command had led to closer coordination between the five rebel factions. He said his group, which previously did not kidnap mayors, had begun to do so to support a rebel policy that claims the mayors are the front line of a Government counterinsurgency campaign. **********Mr. Gonzalez said his forces had kidnapped nine mayors, all of whom have now been released, from surrounding municipalities to ''remove a false power'' from the area that had allowed the Salvadoran Government to say that it exercised control. **********''The real military and political power here is in the hands of the F.M.L.N.,'' Mr. Gonzalez said, referring to the rebels. ''When the army comes here, it comes with a battalion.'' **********The rebels kidnapped a Salvadoran Army colonel, Omar Napoleon Avalos, on Oct. 26 and are now questioning him about corruption in the army, Central Intelligence Agency operations and the air force, Mr. Gonzalez said. Colonel Avalos was head of civil aviation and a former top military adviser to the presidency. **********Asked if he was willing to keep the war going after six years in which the rebels have been bloodied and have failed to defeat the Government, Mr. Gonzalez replied: ''I am.

As for the outlook for a turnaround, ''it's like waiting for Godot,'' said John J. Lazlo Jr., semiconductor industry analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. ''I don't look for any material improvement over the short term.'' **********Charles E. Sporck, National Semiconductor's president and chief executive, appeared to agree in his statement yesterday: ''We have recently experienced a marginal improvement in semiconductor order rates,'' he said. ''But until we have a significant and sustained improvements in those rates, our financial performance will continue to suffer.'' **********National's loss, which had been expected, compares with a profit of $35.9 million, or 40 cents a share, in the first fiscal quarter of last year. Revenues in the 1985 quarter, which ended Sept. 22, plunged 20 percent, to $423.4 million, from $529 million. **********Christmas Shutdown **********National, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also said it would close its operations for seven days during Christmas to save money. The company this year has already laid off 1,300 in the United States and others overseas. It has also instituted hiring freezes, other temporary plant shutdowns and capital spending cuts. **********Analysts expect virtually all other semiconductor companies to report operating losses for the third calendar quarter and some to report losses for the fourth quarter as well. **********National's loss is as large as it is because of its heavy reliance on commodity products that have been affected most by price wars, and because of the company's heavy expenditures to modernize its facilities. Moreover, third-quarter operating losses for companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices might be partly or completely offset by interest income or tax credits, while semiconductor losses for Texas Instruments and Motorola might be counterbalanced by earnings from other operations. **********Still, these companies are all acting to reduce the losses. Intel recently instituted pay cuts of 4 to 8 percent for its entire United States work force for the remainder of this year and said it would shut its operations for six days during the Christmas season. **********''Business has not improved significantly,'' said Glynnis Kaye, a spokesman for Intel, which is also based in Santa Clara. She said the company is not making any predictions about when an upturn will occur. **********Motorola Cutbacks **********Motorola, which had so far avoided massive layoffs, announced on Monday a series of staff reductions designed to cut its semiconductor work force by 1,500 to 1,700. It also said that salaries would be reduced 5 to 10 percent through the end of March for its United States employees in that segment. **********Despite the glum news, however, some analysts and executives say that the industry has begun a modest improvement that should pick up steam in 1986. **********Part of the slump, industry analysts say, has been caused by the fact that computer companies over-ordered chips in 1984 and then lived off their inventories in 1985. Now, they say, there is evidence inventories are being used up, so that chip purchases are expected to rise to the level at which the chips are being used. **********''We expect to see a lot of our clients placing orders in the fourth quarter,'' said Robert B. Rabin, a director of Pittiglio Rabin Todd & McGrath, a Palo Alto consulting firm to technology companies. **********Still, other causes for the slump will persist. The actual rate of chip usage continues to be depressed because the computer industry, as a major user of chips, is still not growing rapidly. Furthermore, the American semiconductor companies will still face severe Japanese competition, despite their recent filing of several complaints against trade practices of the Japanese chip manufacturers. **********Sales Increase Seen **********The Semiconductor Industry Association predicted last week that worldwide semiconductor sales would increase by 18 percent next year, compared with a 17 percent decline projected for 1985. **********But many in the industry privately say that such a forecast is unrealistic. Indeed, when the prediction was presented at a gala Silicon Valley dinner last Thursday, several people in the audience guffawed in disbelief. The year before, the association had predicted a 22 percent increase in sales, only to see sales plummet this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/25/business/report-on-foreign-exchange.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Report on Foreign Exchange", "print_headline": "Report on Foreign Exchange", "body_text": " **********An estimated $150 billion a day is traded in foreign exchange markets around the world, twice the amount of five years ago, the Group of 30 said in a report issued yesterday. **********The report, prepared by the New York-based economic and monetary policy organization, cites worldwide investment activity and trading in new financial instruments as the primary forces behind the increase. **********''There are some concerns, particularly relating to contemporary credit management, but they do not appear to have constrained seriously the respondents' international trade and investment activities,'' said Thomas S.

T. Rama Rao was seated on the roof of a sturdy Chevrolet stationwagon at the head of a 22-vehicle motorcade sweeping through the towns and villages of his native state. **********Mr. Rama Rao, the former film actor who is now the Chief Minister, or political leader, of Andhra Pradesh, is playing one of the most crucial roles of his career as he seeks a new mandate March 5 in balloting for the state legislature of Andhra Pradesh. **********Mr. Rama Rao, a burly man who has portrayed various Hindu gods in many of his 320 films, is leading a drive to defeat Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's forces for the third time in three years. In the general election last December, his was the only state to resist the Gandhi electoral wave, and in the new state elections he hopes to win a bigger national role for himself than the one he has played so far. **********Voting in Some Other States **********Balloting is also scheduled March 2 and 5 for 11 other local legislatures, but national attention has focused on the election in Andhra Pradesh. The governing Congress Party of Mr. Gandhi is widely expected to win easily in all the other states, with the possible exception of Karnataka, which borders on Andhra Pradesh and where the opposition Janata Party is waging a strong fight. **********In Andhra Pradesh, even Mr. Rama Rao's critics acknowledge that he is well ahead of his opponents. A daylong drive under a blistering sun through the rich rice- and sugar-cane-growing belt of the West Godavari district recently helped explain why. **********Entire villages emptied onto the road to greet Mr. Rama Rao in scores of unscheduled meetings. The villagers shouted slogans of support. Women threw rose petals at him, and some even washed the roads in his honor. **********Crowds listened intently, almost rapturously, as the powerfully built figure with close-cropped hair and aquiline nose, wearing a brick-colored shirt and trousers, sprang to his feet to speak in his familiar, deep, resounding voice. He cited his achievements, outlined his plans and urged the villagers to support him. **********'We Are With Him' **********''We are not bothered about his party,'' said Valuri Ramakrishnan, a farmer from the village of Korimulli near here. ''We are only concerned about Rama Rao, and we are with him wherever he is.'' **********Mr. Ramakrishnan's companion, V. Pondurang, added: ''We are supporting him because of his good deeds. He also has promised lower electricity taxes for our farms.'' **********The two were waiting with about 3,000 others near a small lake, fringed by palm trees, as the Chief Minister briefly rested before starting another round of campaigning. **********At his public meetings, Mr. Rama Rao talks frequently about the ''good deeds'' cited by his supporters: rice costs the equivalent of 9 cents a pound, free lunches for schoolchildren, mass housing projects, subsidies for village women to acquire saris, and pensions for the old and widows. **********Enthusiasm From Women **********Amid cheers and applause, especially from women, Mr. Rama Rao declared near here that he planned to amend property laws to enable women to inherit land. He spoke in Telegu, the official language of Andhra Pradesh, a state of 53 million people. **********When the rally ended, hundreds of youthful supporters joined the motorcade for several miles, on cycles and even on foot. **********The Telegu Desam, Mr. Rama Rao's party, and the Janata Party in Karnataka both came to power in the January 1983 legislative elections, in which, for the first time since independence, the Gandhi party was defeated in the two states. Both states dissolved their assemblies midway through their terms because of political instability, however, and the 10 other legislatures up for election next week were to have completed their five-year terms in June. **********Challenge From Defectors **********In Andhra Pradesh, the Congress Party backed defectors from Mr. Rama Rao's party last summer in an effort to topple him, but a surge of public support led to his reinstatement within a month. In the new campaign, Mr. Rama Rao is seeking to emphasize his hold on the state in spite of the efforts of the defectors. **********''Andhra Pradesh has been a stage that has introduced me to the political scene of the country,'' Mr. Rama Rao said in an interview as he rested in his van here. ''I have no ambitions, I want to serve. I am not attracted by all these positions and high powers, of prime ministership or anything.'' **********He said he expected to win more than the 202 seats that his party, when it was unified, controlled in the 294-member house in 1983. ''One can feel the pulse of the people,'' he said. **********Mr. Rama Rao, who won the leadership of Andhra Pradesh only seven months after he entered politics, also spoke of a national opposition party that he said he planned to organize in May. **********He said the opposition party would seek to create a balance between New Delhi and the states, which he says are too dependent on the central Government. ''I want to do the best for my country,'' he said. **********Party's Shape Is Unclear **********Mr. Rama Rao said he wanted to call the new organization the Bharat Desam, or National Party. But supporters like Ramoji Rao, editor of Eenadu, the state's largest newspaper, as well as critics, say the Chief Minister is still unclear about what shape it will take. **********''There is confusion in his thinking,'' said the editor, who is not related to Mr. Rama Rao. **********Today, the streets and walls of villages and towns were gaily decorated with posters and flags of Mr. Rama Rao's organization, alongside those of a rival faction and the Congress Party. Markets were dominated by huge wooden cutouts of Mr. Rama Rao, clad in the saffron robes he often wears. **********''He is far ahead of us in the campaign,'' said Madan Mohan, the leader of the Congress Party in the dissolved legislature. Mr. Mohan and other opponents of Mr. Rama Rao maintained that the Chief Minister's policies had not helped the state's economic development. **********But, Mr. Mohan said, the Congress Party's ''best bet is for No. 2.'' **********The rival group in Mr. Rama Rao's organization is led by Nandela Bhaskara Rao, who is not related to the Chief Minister. It is not expected to win many seats. **********Mr. Rama Rao frequently invokes the name of God in his conversations. ''God and my destiny lead me on,'' he said.

While he has shifted India's orientation more toward the West, he has maintained close ties with the  Soviet Union. A breakthrough came this year when the United States allowed India for the first time to obtain high technology equipment for possible military use. **********India's often uneasy relations with its neighbors have improved, although tensions with Pakistan remain. But in Sri Lanka, where leaders once accused Mrs. Gandhi of fomenting civil war, India has become a trusted mediator to end the fighting. **********Perhaps most striking, Mr. Gandhi, 41 years old, has shown a new style of cooperation with the people his mother had opposed or tried to oust from power.  The new attitude has led to peace accords in the troubled states of Punjab and Assam, and an atmosphere of political harmony generally. **********''Think of the change we have seen,'' said Karan Singh, a former Cabinet minister and ally of Mrs. Gandhi. ''A year ago Punjab was in flames, and there was a general feeling we were caught in a net of conflicts. Rajiv has restored hope and faith in the political process.'' **********But Mr. Gandhi and his team of young managers have many critics. Even many supporters agree they have made minimal progress in reducing Government corruption and ineffiency, alleviating poverty and malnutrition, improving the schools and curbing population growth. **********The critics also say Mr. Gandhi has centralized too much power in his office  and displayed a casual attitude toward preserving civil liberties. **********For example, he has allowed some political opponents to be deported or arrested, and thousands of Sikhs have been seized as suspected troublemakers and held in preventive detention. **********Opposition leaders charge that Mr. Gandhi's program of tax breaks and fewer Government regulations benefits the upper-class society in which he moves. They  say he has yet to show he can manage the vast Government machinery or use his high position to educate the people. **********''The country has almost forgotten Indira Gandhi, and there's a kind of relief that her style of politics is no more,'' said Romesh Thapar, a political  scientist and severe critic of the late Prime Minister. **********But Mr. Thapar asserted that Mrs. Gandhi, in her first years in office after  1966, ''was exactly like this - open, receptive, a breath of fresh air.'' He added that ''many of us worry that this chap is subject to pressure, that he can go either way.'' **********A Remarkable Rise **********Speculation about Mr. Gandhi continues to be rife. The country still seems to be in the phase of getting acquainted with him. **********He dominates the scene and throughout India his picture is featured on posters, in newspapers and in glossy personality magazines. But he and his family keep largely to themselves, and people make do with gossip and speculation. **********Have you heard, someone may ask, that ''Rajiv'' - it is always Rajiv -showed  up at a birthday party and sat casually on the floor with his old friends? Or that his wife, Sonia, went to a well-known store and bought four saris? **********Mr. Gandhi's rise is a remarkable chapter in modern Indian history because of the low expectations that many people had for him. **********Although he grew up in an intensely political environment, Mr. Gandhi was never known for his political acumen or inclinations. Jawaharlal Nehru, Mr. Gandhi's grandfather and India's first Prime Minister, had relied on his daughter, Indira, for political advice. **********When Mrs. Gandhi looked to the next generation for similar help, it was not to Rajiv, but to her younger son, Sanjay, who was regarded as the heir to the family's political instincts. **********Brother's Shadow **********All but proclaimed an amateur, Rajiv Gandhi stayed on the sidelines and became a commercial airline pilot. It was only after Sanjay died while stunt-flying a small airplane in 1980 that Mrs. Gandhi recruited her other son into politics. **********In his brief apprenticeship under his mother, Mr. Gandhi did little to develop an independent identity. After the assassination, when the ruling Congress Party chose him Prime Minister, he struck many as weak and uncertain. **********In the subsequent parliamentary election campaign, Mr. Gandhi infuriated his  opponents by questioning their commitment to Indian national unity. In December, the Congress Party won 80 percent of the seats in Parliament, an unparalleled sweep. **********Perhaps because the Congress Party won only 49 percent of the actual vote, Mr. Gandhi took a more conciliatory approach almost immediately after the election. Then he signaled his willingness to break from the past by ousting most of his mother's key advisers from his inner circle. **********In an interview recently, Mr. Gandhi offered his first public criticism of the national emergency his mother imposed from 1975 to 1977, during which civil liberties were suspended and many politicians were jailed. **********Mr. Gandhi said that ''a lot of things'' had gone wrong because his mother ''lost control'' during that period and allowed excesses to occur. **********'One Way to Go' **********Associates say that in becoming Prime Minister, Mr. Gandhi was jolted into a  more conciliatory attitude because of his mother's assassination, which many Indians believe was carried out as a retaliation by Sikhs angered at her crackdown on Sikh extremists in Punjab. **********''I think after his mother was killed, he felt his back was against the wall,'' said Amitabh Bachchan, a film star, Member of Parliament and longtime friend of Mr. Gandhi. ''When your back is against the wall, there's only one way to go and that's forward.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Gandhi said he shifted course for two reasons. First, he said, political opponents ''survived on a confrontation'' with his mother. But second, he said ''the real aim is, we've got to run the country.'' **********Today Mr. Gandhi's conciliatory manner has won praise from several of the politicians who battled with his mother, including one she tried to oust and one she succeeded in ousting from office. **********People close to the Gandhi family feel that the Prime Minister's style is rooted in personality. Whereas Mrs. Gandhi was mercurial and loved the sport of  outmaneuvering her enemies, Mr. Gandhi is seen as more simple and straightforward. **********''Mrs. Gandhi could be reticent, and then act with a force several times more than what was needed,'' said H. Y. Sharada Prasad, press adviser to both mother  and son. ''You know, they always said Nehru was too trusting. They never said that about his daughter. People say Rajiv is more like Nehru.'' **********Popular TV Image **********Yet the Prime Minister has a sophisticated touch with journalists, particularly television journalists. **********When he travels to primitive tribal areas, his staff makes sure the television cameras record scenes of the Prime Minister's impatience with the bureaucracy, which they know contribute to his popular image. **********On a recent trip to a seacoast village, for example, Mr. Gandhi could be seen growing irritated that some newly built housing for fishermen lay empty and unused. **********The Prime Minister's defenders say he is essentially a problem-solver lacking a coherent philosophy or world view. **********''But the things that need to be done in India are obvious - they don't require a world view,'' said Arun Shourie, a journalist and author who was one of Mrs. Gandhi's harshest critics. **********''We have to straighten out our police and intelligence forces, supply safe drinking water and clear up the bottlenecks in industry,'' he said. ''Now we have a ruler who says, 'I'm not the brightest or best, but let me just try to do these things.' '' **********Virtues and Pitfalls **********The Prime Minister's economic program is widely seen as an example of the virtues and pitfalls of his pragmatism. Many people say Mr. Gandhi is not so much committed to free-market theories as he is eager to try something that might work. **********Business executives, meanwhile, say that if the economy does not expand briskly, they could easily imagine Mr. Gandhi backtracking on his economic changes. **********The philosophy behind his economic program is that there is a huge pent-up demand for consumer and industrial products, but that production is being strangled by high taxes, regulations and licensing requirements. **********In the interview, Mr. Gandhi said that he wanted to change the system ''overnight.'' But he added that ''if we do it overnight, the present industry will be in very deep trouble.'' **********He said he was concerned that big, new and efficient factories could be built, wiping out the old ones and throwing people out of work. ''We've got to give a sort of intermediary period where our current industry can adapt and become more competitive,'' he said. **********At Mr. Gandhi's office, there are computers that can spew out figures at a moment's notice. In conversation, he can offer to ''pull out some graphs'' from  the computer to demonstrate his contention that prices have been stable since he took office. **********Businesslike Style **********It is a businesslike style that has dazzled financial interests, leading to the biggest stock market boom in India's history. But it gives some pause to his critics, who fear that he overemphasizes the production of luxuries for the well-to-do. **********''His priorities are a manager's priorities,'' said Rajni Kothari, president  of the People's Union for Civil Liberties. ''I consider this technocratic thing  naive and dangerous. His policies are hurting the poor.'' **********Mr. Gandhi's defenders assert that in the long run, his policies will achieve high growth in the industrial sector, generating tax revenues that can be used for health, education and welfare of the disadvantaged. **********Numerous other problems face the Prime Minister. **********Farm production has increased and famine has nearly disappeared, but widespread malnutrition remains. Vast numbers of Indians are too poor to get enough food to eat, while surplus grain lies rotting in fields and storage bins. **********In education, Mr. Gandhi and his aides acknowledge that India's schools are not training people in the skills the society needs. In population control, he says that current programs are not working. **********Hitting Corruption **********Many experts say the biggest problem India faces is revitalizing Government institutions. The Prime Minister acknowledges that accountability in the sprawling Government bureacracy has rotted away. **********Corruption and incompetence run through the police and security forces, and experts say that bribes have become a way of life for people dealing with the Government. **********In these and other areas, Mr. Gandhi has taken small steps, but his advisers  say that major proposals are being drafted. **********In foreign policy, Mr. Gandhi has shifted course, but with fewer tangible results. **********India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since independence in 1947,  have stepped up their talks, and new cultural and communications accords were signed. But there seems to have been little easing of tensions. **********The chief irritant continues to be the two rivals' mutual suspicions on the nuclear issues. Mr. Gandhi rejects Pakistan's denials that it is making a nuclear bomb, and his advisers say that he is coming under increasing pressure to begin producing nuclear weapons for India. **********In South Asia, the chief concern of American policy-makers is the possibility of a nuclear arms race, and they are watching Mr. Gandhi's actions in this area  extremely carefully. **********Meanwhile, India has startled many experts by playing a constructive role in  mediating the dispute between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil insurgents who are seeking an independent state in the north and east. **********One of the biggest foreign policy changes brought by Mr. Gandhi has come in relations with the United States. American and Indian officials say that he has  built on a trend started by Mrs. Gandhi, but that the tone of the relationship has a qualitative difference. **********Officials said, for example, that the visit to New Delhi last spring by Fred  C. Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, marked a turning point. **********The visit led to an accord permitting India to receive sophisticated technology, much of it with military application, that the Americans had been reluctant to give out for fear it would end up with the Soviet Union. **********American officials are known to be eager to sell or supply weapons to India to wean it away from its longstanding military reliance on Moscow. But Indian officials say no such transactions are in the offing. **********Ties to Soviet **********India's policy toward the Soviet Union has undergone no substantial change. But some analysts say they have detected that Mr. Gandhi may have become more willing to criticize the Soviet Union for its move into nearby Afghanistan. ''The phraseology, the wording, the emphasis has changed,'' said Kuldip Nayar, a leading columnist. **********In this area, as in so many others, the changes may be of style as much as of substance. But changes of style may lead to tangible results, political experts  note. **********Generally, because of the circumstances in which he came to office a year ago, Mr. Gandhi has had to serve as an apostle of both continuity and change. His mother used to say that she presided over ''a Government that works.'' Mr. Gandhi likes to say that his is a Government that ''works faster.'' **********But in the interview, the Prime Minister emphasized that the changes he seeks could take a decade or so. ''We can try to do things faster,'' he said. ''But we don't want to snap the system.'' **********Mr. Gandhi has another four years before he must call another election, but he sounded in the interview like someone prepared to try to see the changes through for as long as they take."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/13/world/china-president-plans-to-visit-us-in-july.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China President Plans To Visit U.S. in July", "print_headline": "China President Plans To Visit U.S. in July", "body_text": " **********China and the White House announced today that President Li Xiannian would visit the United States in July.

While the Dow Jones industrial average has set new highs, it has done so in fits and starts, and investors have not shown much enthusiasm or conviction. ''I don't see any decisive movements in either direction,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. **********For one thing, the small investor is still staging a strike against stocks. In fact, on May 31, trades of 100 shares or under accounted for less than 1 percent of the volume of the New York Stock Exchange, according to Salomon Brothers. That was the lowest level in history, said Mr. Birinyi. **********But why the lack of ardor? After all, sliding interest rates, which have lighted a fire under bonds, might be expected to also ignite the stock market. **********But some analysts say that all of the factors that have combined to erode interest rates have held back stock investors. Lower rates, they argue, are a result of the weakness in the economy that has encouraged the Federal Reserve to loosen credit. A weak economy - and the prospect of sluggish corporate profits - frighten equity investors. **********Moreover, the Reagan tax proposals - which may, if approved, change the way various investments are treated by the I.R.S. - have injected more uncertainty into an already confusing financial environment. And recent tremors in the banking system have unnerved some investors, as well. **********In fact, investors seem to be so wary, analysts say, that they are overlooking the positives: low inflation and low oil prices. **********Some market watchers expect this mood to continue for the next few months. Since the Dow has closed above the 1,300 level, ''it's entitled to a rest,'' said Peter H. Vermilye, chairman of Boston's Endowment Management and Research, which invests almost $1.5 billion for institutional clients. And Salomon's Mr. Birinyi thinks the market is in the process of establishing a new trading range, with a low point of 1,260 to 1,280 and a high of 1,325 on the Dow. Greg A. Smith, executive vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities, thinks the market will remain ''pretty flat'' this summer. **********Still, some analysts think that the stock market could break out on the upside later this summer or fall. If interest rates continue to decline and corporations begin issuing more positive second-quarter earnings reports, investors will drive the market higher, they say. ''I think once you see business activity pick up, the market could show another burst,'' said Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. For his part, Prudential-Bache's Mr. Smith believes that individual investors will shift their assets into stocks when rates on government bonds dip below 10 percent and money market rates drop below 7 percent. **********In the meantime, said Salomon's Mr. Birinyi, there appears to be no change in the market leadership. Those stock groups that have performed well this year will continue to do so - and the laggards continue to get hit. ''Technology continues to look like death warmed over and the oil stocks are looking for room in the caboose,'' he said. **********Technology stocks, with their typically high price/earnings ratios, usually get pounded when the prospects for earnings turn sour. And weakening oil prices make the oil issues look like bad bets. **********Endowment Management's Mr. Vermilye added that his firm has not made any changes in its portfolios. ''We're staying with what's working,'' he said. The firm continues to own those stocks that have fared well in recent months: banks and other interest-sensitive issues; airlines, which will benefit from a drop in oil and fuel prices, and the takeover-hot broadcasters. **********Prudential's Mr. Smith believes that market leadership may change once some smaller growth companies start reporting positive earnings for the second quarter. Investors will then shift their attention to these issues, he said, and start buying. Among the stocks he thinks should benefit are specialty retailers, which are generating high sales volume with discounting, and selected health care companies that have carved out a niche for themselves. Two he mentioned are Western Health Plans and Family Dollar Stores. **********Donaldson's Mr. Miller said his firm continues to recommend companies that enjoy good unit growth. Included are health care, media and specialty chemicals. Stocks he likes are Morton-Thiokol, Great Lakes Chemical, Capital Cities and CBS. **********Because bond prices have climbed for more than a year, many of these strategists predict that stocks will outperform bonds for the remainder of 1985. Prudential-Bache's Mr. Smith said he thinks the stock market will enjoy a ''significant'' rally in the fall, or possibly as early as August. About Those Bonds . . . Anyone owning bonds knows that May was a glorious month. They provided their owners with their highest returns since November 1981. For the month, bond investors enjoyed a total return of 6.17 percent, according to the Ryan Financial Strategy Group, a New York-based firm whose Ryan Index tracks both corporate and government issues. The biggest winners of all were those investors bold enough to own 30-year zero coupon issues. According to Ryan's figures, these securities - which pay no current interest but sell at a deep discount and react strongly to any interest rate move - advanced a staggering 23.8 percent in price in May. **********Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, research director at Ryan, called the performance ''spectacular,'' adding that it was the best one-month showing for any fixed-income security in memory. ''There's no record of such a thing,'' she said. For the first five months of this year, 25-year ''zeros'' have been the best gainers, advancing in price by 19.46 percent. **********A Matter of Principles **********The General Board of Pensions of the United Methodist Church in Evanston, Ill., uses its stock and voting rights to pressure management at companies doing business in South Africa to adopt the Sullivan principles, a code formulated by Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, a Philadelphia churchman and a director of General Motors. Companies adopting the principles are required, among other things, to promote desegregation of locker rooms and canteens in their South African operations, improve training facilities for blacks and provide assistance to communities in which black workers live. **********This year the Methodist group, with $1.8 billion in retirement assets, has filed shareholder resolutions with five companies that have South African operations: Fruehauf, Chesebrough-Pond's, Kimberly-Clark, Pan American and International Flavors and Fragrances. Recently Pan Am agreed to sign the principles, said Gerald Hornung, general secretary of the Methodist group. Last year, the group filed resolutions with six companies, and three of them, Baxter-Travenol, Foster Wheeler and Pepsico agreed to sign. **********Many people argue that only complete divestment is an effective anti-apartheid strategy. But the Methodist group's board members feel that their fund is too large to ignore companies that do business with South Africa. Total divestment of those companies, the board argues, would ultimately hurt the fund's performance and require members to contribute more. Total divestment ''cannot be done,'' Mr. Hornung said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/24/business/patents-patent-office-asking-congress-to-raise-fees.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1985-08-24", "snippet": "The Patent and Trademark Office announced this week that it has proposed raising its fees, effective Oct. 5.", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\n\nPatent Office Asking Congress to Raise Fees", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\n\nPatent Office Asking Congress to Raise Fees", "body_text": " **********The Patent and Trademark Office announced this week that it has proposed raising its fees, effective Oct. 5. **********Congress will make the final decision.

According to Mr. O'Kelley's letter, Mr. Edelman wrote a detailed letter to him on Friday, adding details to the proposal. Among them was a request that Mr. Edelman receive exclusive access to Datapoint's records and other information for 60 days and that he be paid $15 million or an option to acquire 18.5 percent of all the issued and outstanding common stock if Datapoint received a more favorable bid or if any person acquired 20 percent of the outstanding common stock of Datapoint. **********Those conditions were rejected by Mr. O'Kelley. **********Duty to Shareholders Cited **********Referring to the request for exclusive information, Mr. O'Kelley wrote, ''We cannot do this for any prospective bidder because it would violate our obligation to our shareholders to whom we are responsible for providing the best possible financial alternative.'' Mr. O'Kelley added, ''Among other things, this would clearly dilute the values to be received by our shareholders.'' **********Soon after Mr. Edelman's investment in Datapoint became known last month, the computer company's financial adviser, the investment banking house of Kidder, Peabody & Company, was hired to study his offer as well as the possibility of selling the company to someone else.

Frank A. Lorenzo, the president of the Texas Air Corporation and the chairman and chief executive of Continental Airlines, is likely to emerge as one of the pivotal figures in the era of deregulation, just as Juan Trippe, the founder of Pan American World Airways, is regarded as the pioneer in establishing international aviation. **********With an agreement by Trans World Airlines Inc. to be acquired by Texas Air for $793.5 million, Mr. Lorenzo would have three carriers, T.W.A., Continental and New York Air, whose market share together is second only to United Airlines, a subsidiary of UAL Inc. **********Although the agreement with T.W.A. calls for it to remain independent, most analysts expect it to be eventually integrated with the others. Such a combination would not only create a formidable domestic carrier, but would also form an impressive international line. T.W.A.'s presence would make the new carrier the largest trans-Altantic airline; Continental has already provided it with an extensive route network in the South Pacific. Mr. Lorenzo's new company would also be unique, with routes stretching from Continental's service to Tokyo to T.W.A.'s service to Bombay, all fed by a strong domestic network. **********An Acquisitive Strategy **********Unlike Mr. Trippe, who pressed for the development of new long-range planes, and who had daring pilots demonstrate that the vast distances of the Pacific could be crossed by air, Mr. Lorenzo has built his empire through acquisitions of established but troubled carriers: Texas International Airlines in 1972 and Continental Airlines in 1981 T.W.A. would be the latest and largest of such acquisitions. He also founded a small, low-cost carrier New York Air. However, that carrier has met with less success, in 1984, New York Air lost about $6 million. **********In each case, Mr. Lorenzo's strategy has been to hold down the cost of operations primarily through lean labor costs. This allowed his airlines to charge lower fares, which has helped lure business from rivals. **********Continental Airlines has attracted the most attention Mr. Lorenzo acquired it in a hostile takeover battle that left many workers, labor leaders and executives bitterly opposed to what they described as his ruthless methods. The company, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in September 1983, has since become profitable, although it is still under protection of the bankruptcy court. Last year, it made a $50 million profit, and some 10,000 of its employees earned $8.3 million under the company's profit-sharing plan. **********Mr. Lorenzo has a reputation of being a tough boss. HE has not hesitated to replace - at any of his airlines - top executives whoa re unable to turn around losing operations. His main quality, fellow executives say, is determination. As one once put it, pointing to a wall, he himself might run at the wall two or three times, and give up ''Frank,'' he said, ''will hit it 300 times, and get through.'' **********Francisco Anthony Lorenzo - who has since changed his name to Frank -was born in Rego Park, Queens, on May 19, 1940, to Spanish immigrants who ran a Manhattan beauty parlor. **********The slim, brown-haired executive worked his way through Columbia University by driving a Coco-Cola truck in the summers and working as a salesman part time at Macy's. He now lives in Houston with his wife, Sharon, and three daughters and a son. And whether he is at home or or away Mr. Lorenzo typically squeezes in a period of jogging, sometimes taking along breathless colleagues. **********His first contact with aviation came after 1963, when he graduated from Harvard Business School and went to work for Eastern Airlines in New York as a financial analyst. It was then that he became friends with Robert J. Carney, now chairman of the executive committee at Texas Air, who, at that time, worked across the street for the investment firm of S.G. Warburg & Company. **********Both men shared a fascination with America's successful entrepreneurs, such as Adnrew Carnegie, and were avid readers of biogrpahies. They also believed that the airline industry was going through many changes in the 1960's, and that those changes provided many opporunities for investing. **********In 1966, each put up $1,000 to form Lorenzo, Carney & Company to look for such opportunities. This initial investment, Mr. Carney recalled, enabled them to set up a holding company, Jet Capital, which then raised more than $1 million of additional funds through a public stock offering. In 1972, Jet Capital took over a floundering Texas International, and that really started Mr. Lorenzo on his way. **********Deregulation of America's airline industry did not take effect until 1978. But, by then, Mr. Lorenzo had already learned much about competing against a less-regulated carrier. Although Texas International, which fiew in the Southwest, was forced to conform to the various strictures governing competition among interstate carriers. Southwest Airlines, a competitor of Texas Internatioal, then flew only within Texas, and therefore could act much as a deregulated carrier, cutting fares at will and changing routes when it wanted. **********Texas International eventually thrived, as Mr. Lorenzo ran a low-budget operation - he reduced labor costs significantly - and introduced his own low ''peanut'' fares to compete with Southwest. **********A Rival's Suicide **********When mr. Lorenzo later sought to apply the same low-budget strategy at Continental, which had lost more than $500 million between 1979 and September 1983, he was regarded with suspicion. It did not help that Continental's chairman and chief executive, Alvin L. Feldman, who deeply opposed the takeover, committed suicide in August 1981, during the battle. **********''We were seen as the enemy,'' Mr. Lorenzo said in a past interview. ''We represented change that had to take place. Up to deregulation, the airline industry had been a pleasant business. It was clubby.'' **********When Continental's unions refused to give the concessions he believed were needed to turn it around, he filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Sept. 23, 1983. For three days, the airline lay idle while Mr. Lorenzo and his staff put in a draconian plan. Of 12,000 employees, 4,200 were offered jobs at about half pay. Existing uion contracts were repudiated by the company - a step that was later upheld by the bankruptcy court. **********From 108 aircraft serving 78 cities, the airline cut its service to 40 planes serving 25 cities. His executives recall that there was tremendous uncertainty such as whether people would fly a bankrupt airline, even at rock-bottom prices of $49 one way. **********A Large Gamble **********Mr. Lorenzo, whose company still had $50 million in cash to operate, remained calm, even though he knew he had taken a large gamble. He continued to practice for the New York Marathon, running around company headquarters in Houston and the Central Park reservoir when he was in New York. **********Step by step, he and a revamped executive staff have rebuilt Continental to serve 73 cities with a fleet of 111 planes. Fares have gone up, but are still well below the unrestricted fares of major carriers. To fly from Dallas to New York costs $150 on Continental during peak periods and $125 off peak. The unrestricted coach fare on major carriers is $344 one way. **********Mr. Lorenzo and his team have been able to bring the cost per seat mile, a measure of an airline's efficiency from 8 cents a mile to the current 5.9 cents a mile, which is close to that of low-cost carriers such as People Express. **********Mr. Lorenzo is expected to bring his cost-cutting skills to T.W.A. and particularly its domestic division, which lost $536.1 million from 1981 to 1984 - at a time its international division made a profit of $461.9 million. Mr. Lorenzo's competitors are well aware of his capabilities.  Richard Ferris, the chairman, president and chief executive of UAL, noted at a recent analysts' meeting, when asked about the effect of People Express entering the chicago market, that he was more worried about Continental. **********How the Airlines Rank **********Market share based on available seat miles, as of March 1985 United 15% New Ferris Air Corp 13%* American 13% Eastern 11% Delta 10.5% TWA 8 3/4% Northwest 7% Continental 4.5% People Express 4% *********** Includes Trans World Airlines, Continental Airlines and New York Air 1969 - Mr. Lorenzo and Robert J.

Others say the problems have arisen largely because of what they see as favoritism by the Reagan Administration toward Turkey, Greece's archenemy. **********Those who fault Mr. Papandreou say he is trying to manipulate Greek-Americans by using the Turkish issue; those who fault President Reagan say he is trying to do the same thing by raising the specter of Communism. **********The anti-Papandreou side has formed separate groups and sent delegations to Greece to complain. The other side includes the leaders of long established groups who say they want to assist Greece internationally, not to interfere in its internal politics. **********Served in Navy as U.S. Citizen **********Mr. Papandreou moved to the United States in 1940, became a citizen and served as a commissioned officer in the Navy from 1944 to 1946. With a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, he taught at universities until he returned to Greece in 1959 and resumed Greek citizenship two years later. **********In 1981, he became the Greek Prime Minister after his Socialist Party won national elections in a campaign in which he denounced American influence in Greece and criticized Greek membership in the Common Market and in the Atlantic alliance. **********Once in office, he was apparently restrained by President Constantine Caramanlis, a conservative whose New Democracy Party is the second largest in Parliament. **********Last month, Mr. Caramanlis was unseated when Mr. Papandreou nominated his own candidate for President, Christos Sartzetakis. To elect Mr. Sartzetakis, the Socialists needed Communist support, raising speculation about a further shift to the left. **********Tsongas Met With Papandreou **********Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat of Greek ancestry, said in a recent interview that he told Mr. Papandreou in a meeting last month some of his positions were undermining the support Greece had in Congress. **********Mr. Tsongas recalled, in particular, Mr. Papandreou's statement that a South Korean airliner shot down in Soviet airspace in 1983 had been on a spying mission. That statement ''put in conflict'' the loyalty of Greek-Americans, Mr. Tsongas said. **********''In that case, Greek-Americans will opt for the United States,'' he added. ''My concern is that the Reagan Administration tilts toward Turkey. No question of that. It considers Turkey's strategic value to exceed that of Greece, and it does not perceive the Turkish threat to Greece to be real. Given that, it has always fallen to Congress to add some balance.'' **********If Congress becomes less supportive of Greece, Mr. Tsongas said, the United States may ultimately side further with the Turks on such issues as their occupation of northern Cyprus. **********'A Very Hot Issue' **********George Douris, head of the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee, which assists immigrants in New York, said Mr. Papandreou had become ''a very hot issue.'' **********''We are embarrassed,'' he said. ''We always felt Greece would remain in the West and be an ally of America, as it has been ever since the Truman Doctrine saved Greece in the 1940's.'' **********A new group called the American Friends of Greece, led by Dr. Byron Andreou, a Detroit physician, has expressed concern that Mr. Papandreou's ''Marxist associates and the Communist Party will move forward to impose their rule behind a facade of parliamentary democracy.'' **********George Christopher, a former Republican Mayor of San Francisco, took a different view. **********''We are concerned about the harsh words coming across the seas,'' he said. ''But we have to look at which came first, the chicken or the egg. The fact is that all this dissension started when the United States under Kissinger - we hold him responsible - allowed the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey.'' **********Mr. Christopher, who is of Greek ancestry, said Mr. Papandreou had been able to capitalize on disappointment among Greeks with American policies. He said this feeling began when they learned that the United States had advance knowledge in 1974 of Turkish plans to land in northern Cyprus in support of the Turkish-Cypriot minority. **********U.S. Policy on Rightists Recalled **********Greek disillusionment deepened, Mr. Christopher said, from a feeling that the United States had been tolerant of the rightist military dictatorship in Greece from 1967 to 1974. **********Andrew E.

If other judges made similar decisions, they could effectively freeze Mr. Alfonsin's ability to use what is his strongest constitutional mechanism for combating an internal threat. **********Attempts to Reassure Populace **********When the state of siege was invoked on Friday, the President and other officials went to great lengths to reassure Argentines that the measure was being used primarily to keep the 12 suspects, including those ordered released today, under arrest. The action had been taken, they said, because a civilian judge had ruled that an earlier decree, which ordered the arrests on Tuesday, was unconstitutional in the absence of a state of siege. **********The Government says it believes the six military officers and six civilians are responsible, in part, for a series of recent bombings directed at military installations and for threats against grade schools. **********Constitutional lawyers were divided on the correctness of Judge Velasco's decision. One said a new law on habeus corpus permitted the decision. The law gives judges a power called ''control of reason,'' allowing them to review a presidential arrest order and determine whether it is arbitrary. **********Judge Velasco's ruling focused on a lack of evidence against those he ordered released, and political analysts have said this could develop into the Government's most serious problem. Under the arrest order, the President envisioned an investigation by a civilian judge who would have 60 days to press charges against the suspects. One official said the Government needed the additional time to come up with stronger evidence against some suspects. **********Despite the order to release the suspects, the investigating judge, Ameilia Berraz de Vidal, is continuing with her work. If, after 60 days, the Government's evidence proves too weak to press charges, lawyers and political analysts said, Mr. Alfonsin's decision to order the arrests will appear foolish, and he could become suspectible to charges of using his position arbitrarily. **********'A Bad Reminder' **********''The problem,'' a lawyer said, ''is that they might not have evidence and that is a bad reminder of the previous Governments.'' **********The Government has declined to characterize its evidence and has spoken only in vague terms about ''groups'' responsible for conspiring to destabilize the country.

Customs Service agents, operating under cover, had been monitoring his activities since October 1983, when he first placed the order for the devices. **********When they made the arrest, the Federal officials involved later recalled, they were convinced that they were dealing with a foreign agent. **********At that time Customs agents seized a series of letters directly linking Mr. Vaid to S. A. Butt, who was identified as a director of procurement for the Government-run Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. Butt is widely known to American and European arms-control officials as the key operative in Pakistan's successful attempts in Europe in the 1970's to obtain the technology and resources for the enrichment of uranium and the reprocessing of plutonium. **********There is no indication, however, that the Customs agents who did the investigation and the Federal prosecutors who tried Mr. Vaid ever identified Mr. Butt or understood that Mr. Vaid's letters provided evidence that he was operating at the direct behest of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. **********Envoy Denies Any Connection **********Ejaz Azim, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States, denied that Mr. Vaid had any official connection to the Pakistani Government. **********''The Government of Pakistan has absolutely nothing to do with this individual,'' Mr. Azim said. ''He's a private trader, and that is all we know about him. He acts and operates entirely in his individual capacity as a private businessman of Pakistan.'' **********The Ambassador, in an interview, also repeated his Government's position that it ''is not engaged in the production of the nuclear weapon,'' adding, ''The dimensions of our nuclear program are entirely peaceful.'' **********The account of Mr. Vaid's activities in the United States was gathered from court documents and interviews with his lawyers, Federal prosecutors and officials in the State Department, Customs Service and Justice Department. **********If the Federal prosecutors had made the link between Mr. Vaid and the Pakistani Government, Mr. Vaid could have been prosecuted under the Atomic Energy Act or the Export Administration Act if the prosecutors had chosen to do so. Both acts call for a maximum 20-year prison term if the restricted goods to be exported could be used to the national security advantage of a foreign country. **********Instead, over the next four months, the Federal prosecutors in Houston agreed with Mr. Vaid's attorneys to a series of procedural steps that had the effect - whether intended or not - of reducing publicity about the case and of limiting the jail sentence faced by Mr. Vaid. The actions included these: **********- A gag order was approved by the Federal judge in the case barring all of the participants from any public comment. No Houston news organization protested the order. **********- The original indictment of Mr. Vaid was rewritten, at the request of his attorney, to exclude any mention of the possible nuclear use of a krytron. **********- Mr. Vaid finally was permitted to plea-bargain to a reduced charge, cutting his potential sentence from 12 years to two and also avoiding a public trial. **********Mr. Vaid was found guilty of one count of violating American export law, given the mildest sentence possible and deported within three weeks. **********At his sentencing on Oct. 22, 1984, in United States District Court in Houston, the Federal prosecutor agreed with Judge James DeAnda that Mr. Vaid was not a foreign agent but - as the judge declared in court, according to the transcript of the proceedings - merely a businessman ''trying to expedite what he thought was a business deal.'' **********Materials' Significance Overlooked by Officials **********Justice Department and Customs officials in Houston, presented later with evidence of Mr. Vaid's link to Mr. Butt, acknowledged that they had overlooked the significance of the materials in their possession. **********Photocopies of at least three letters were found in Mr. Vaid's briefcase on the day of his arrest. They detailed purchases he had made as a Pakistani freight forwarder doing business in the United States on behalf of Mr. Butt. **********Mr. Vaid's letters made no attempt to shield Mr. Butt's title, and they were addressed to him as a director of procurement for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. **********Mr. Vaid, who was interviewed three times between his sentencing and his deportation, repeatedly asserted that he was an innocent Pakistani exporter doing business in the United States with a branch office in Houston. He said, as he had told Federal officials, that he had purchased the krytrons for university research in Pakistan. **********Perhaps to buttress his assertions of innocence, Mr. Vaid agreed when pressed to waive the attorney-client privilege. As a result, his two immigration attorneys in Houston, Peter Williamson and Spencer Gardner, expressing outrage over the Government's handling of their client's case, took the unusal step of making available to a reporter the documents linking Mr. Vaid to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. **********Mr. Williamson acknowledged that his actions were highly unusual but said in an interview: ''Listen, I want the Government to follow the law. You've seen the case that they got here. You've seen what's going on here.'' **********Referring to Mr. Vaid, he added: ''There's no reason that he shouldn't have done a lot of time in the penitentiary. We fully expected that, and I can still see no reason that it hasn't been done.'' **********State Department officials in Washington, while reluctant to be interviewed on the record, conceded that serious errors had been made at both the departments of State and Justice in connection with the case. But they asserted that the bungling was just that, and nothing more. **********''I know this has all the makings of a grand fix,'' a State Department official said, ''but it's really a petty screw-up.'' **********Complicating the Vaid case is Pakistan's position as a recipient of $3.2 billion in American aid over six years ending in 1987. **********Pakistan has said it has not assembled any nuclear bombs, although it acknowledges it has the means to do so. **********The Reagan Administration has accepted Pakistan's public statements on nuclear capability at face value. Administration officials have said more can be accomplished with quiet diplomacy than with public confrontations over Pakistan's nuclear policies. **********American intelligence officials privately confirm that Pakistan now has enough enriched uranium and reprocessed plutonium to manufacture nuclear weapons. The concern among intelligence officials and members of Congress about the Vaid case is that Pakistan, in trying to obtain trigger mechanisms for nuclear bombs, may have moved to a new level in its nuclear program - stockpiling. **********Concern in Washington On Looking 'Weak Kneed'  The State Department official who was directly involved in the case conceded that the Pakistani leader, General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, would inevitably draw the wrong conclusion from the lax handling of Mr. Vaid. **********''If the Administration had any concern, it was that the case in Texas would come off the way it did, and we'd look weak-kneed,'' he said, alluding to monitoring of Pakistan's nuclear program. **********In retrospect, he said, there were three areas of failure, not including the failure of the investigators to understand the significance of the Vaid papers: ''One part a lack of sophistication in Houston; one part a lack of vigor in the State Department, where the case never got high-level attention, and one part a poor decision by Justice to permit a plea bargain.'' **********A faction in Congress, headed by Senator Alan Cranston of California, the Democratic minority whip, has been increasingly critical of Pakistan's reported efforts to become a nuclear power. **********Devices Manufactured By Only One Company  Krytrons are manufactured by only one company in the world, E G& G Inc., of Wellesley, Mass., a leading military contractor, and cannot be exported without State Department licensing. **********They have many nonmilitary uses, in oil exploration and high-energy lasers, for example, but their most essential function - and the reason their overseas sale is carefully licensed and monitored - is to trigger atomic bombs. The tiny switches are able to deliver a precise amount of electrical current in as little as one-millionth of a second, timing that is essential to nuclear explosions. **********All overseas sales of krytrons are carefully monitored by the Federal Government through its licensing provisions. Each sale is reviewed by the State Department on a case-by- case basis to insure, officials said, that the few krytrons sought for commerical use are not diverted. A proposed sale of 50 krytrons would have been extraordinary, officials said, and provided the Government with immediate justification for an extensive review. **********A krytron is not the only electronic switch that can trigger a nuclear bomb, but it is described by experts as highly sophisticated and reliable. **********He Ordered 50 Krytrons And Company Was Stunned **********The Vaid case, which is the subject of a coming PBS ''Frontline'' documentary, begins on Oct. 18, 1983, in Salem, Mass., site of the Electro-Optics division of E G& G, a Fortune 500 company that has been intimately involved in American nuclear bomb production and planning since the end of World War II. **********Mr. Vaid, dressed in traditional Pakistani garb, showed up in person at Salem and, according to court documents, placed an order for 50 krytrons. **********Company officials were stunned, as Robert B. Stitt, an E G& G division manager recalled in an interview: There had never been an attempted over-the-counter purchase of krytrons in the company's history. **********Mr. Vaid said he had identified himself as being in the import-export business in Pakistan and in Houston. He explained, Mr. Stitt said, that he was buying the krytrons on behalf of a university in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. **********When company officials explained that an export license would be needed for the legal shipment of krytrons, Mr. Vaid asked that E G& G take care of it, Mr. Stitt said. The company informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington about the pending purchase, and it in turn brought in the Customs Bureau, which has jurisdiction in illegal foreign commerce. **********Ten days later, according to court documents, E G& G received a telephone call from Mr. Vaid, who again sought to place the order. He was told the order would not be filled until the licensing requirements had been met. **********Mr. Vaid then turned to a neighborhood electrical supply store in Houston, Electrotex. Its owners, Jerry and Don Simon, said in an interview that Mr. Vaid appeared in their shop on Oct. 31 and placed the order for the krytron tubes, describing them only by their listing, KN-22, in E G& G's commercial catalogue. **********Jerry Simon recalled that E G& G officials wanted to know over the telephone whether the krytrons, which cost a total of $3,950, were intended for export. Mr. Simon said that he had asked Mr. Vaid, who was in the store at the time, and had been told no. E G& G, now actively cooperating with the Customs Bureau, agreed to ship the order. **********Brothers Cooperate With Undercover Agents **********Three months later, undercover Customs agents approached the Simon brothers and asked for their cooperation. **********Over the next few months, the Simons would meet as many as 12 times with the undercover agents as they waited for Mr. Vaid to claim his shipment of krytrons. Under the export laws, only when he tried to forward the krytrons through customs would the Government have the legal right to make an arrest. **********The krytrons were to be delivered, by Mr. Vaid's instructions, to a Houston photocopying shop operated by a distant relative of the Pakistani's who was associated with his export-import company, Jet Cargo Service Corporation. **********The delivery took place on April 16, when an undercover Customs agent, posing as an Electrotex employee, turned over the krytrons to an aide to Mr. Vaid. **********The Houston photocopying shop was placed under 24-hour surveillance, the undercover customs agents said. **********On June 19, Mr. Vaid arrived in Houston on a flight from Pakistan, and two days later he notified the freight- forwarding company that he used, Air Express International at Houston's International Airport, that he would be exporting goods to Pakistan on June 22. **********The shipment's bill of lading said the shipment contained office goods, including what Mr. Vaid described only as ''50 bulbs/switches.'' **********The final step was routine: A driver for Air Express International picked up the package at the photocopy shop, sealed for forwarding through customs, and delivered it to the airport. **********Customs agents seized it there and found the krytrons. Mr. Vaid was arrested and charged, along with two associates in the photocopying shop, with illegal export, conspiracy and false statements. **********The Government prosecutors said they were convinced that they were dealing with a Pakistani agent. **********At a court hearing on June 28 to determine Mr. Vaid's bond, Assistant United States Attorney Samuel G. Longoria, an experienced prosecutor who was assigned the case, told a Federal magistrate that the krytrons had a direct use in nuclear munitions. **********And he added, according to a transcript: ''We strongly suspect that Mr. Vaid is operating at the instance of the Pakistani Government and that the purpose of the export of these krytrons was specifically for the Pakistani Government's use in obtaining a nuclear weapon.'' **********Mr. Longoria added: ''The allegations in this complaint are not simply technical violations of United States export laws. The Department of State has serious concern regarding the nature and direction of Pakistan's nuclear program.'' **********On July 16, 1984, a Federal grand jury in Houston indicted Mr. Vaid and his two associates from the photocopying company - charges against those two men were later dropped - for conspiring to ship the krytrons without a license. The indictment described krytrons as able to be used ''as part of a firing set for a nuclear explosive device.'' **********Dropped References To Bombs and Agent's Role **********Over the next weeks, as Mr. Vaid's criminal attorney, William W. Burge, one of three lawyers the Pakistani had retained in Houston, became increasingly active in the case, the Federal prosecutors dropped their reference both to nuclear bombs and to Mr. Vaid's possible role as an agent of the Pakistani Government. **********Mr. Burge, interviewed about the case after Mr. Vaid's deportation, conceded that he was surprised at how readily the prosecutors agreed to a rewriting of the indictment and to a gag order. He concluded, he said, that the Justice Department ''went along because we are friendly with Pakistan.'' **********He added, ''The case, apparently, was embarrassing to the Government of Pakistan, and they didn't want any more publicity than was necessary.'' **********But Mr. Longoria, interviewed at the United States Attorney's office after Mr. Vaid's sentencing, said the Government had not compromised its position in the case by acceding to the gag order or by dropping any reference to nuclear munitions, since those issues were not involved in the prosecution. He acknowledged that he had described the case in late June at the bond hearing as more important than just a routine export violation, but he added: **********''They're all important cases that we work down here. It's a felony case, but the evidence was not there to support a theory, which I personally espoused early on, that this person was a spy or an agent of the Pakistani Government. That evidence simply was not there.'' **********The prosecutors said they had conducted their negotiations with Mr. Burge, Mr. Vaid's attorney, without being aware of the evidence directly linking Mr. Vaid to the Pakistani Government. **********In fact, the Government obtained the letters linking Mr. Vaid to Pakistani nuclear officials on June 22, the day of his arrest. **********Customs agents had seized files and documents in his possession and, hours later, armed with a search warrant, had taken a large assortment of business records and documents from the photocopying shop in Houston used by Mr. Vaid. Included were letters between Mr. Vaid and Mr. Butt, dating back to December 1983. There also was correspondence between Mr. Vaid and Col. Umar Din Dar, who was identified as the senior executive officer of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. **********The letters did not deal with the krytron sale but showed that Mr. Vaid had been purchasing a number of chemicals, the sale of which is not regulated, for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. **********Agent Sought 'Buzzwords' But Found None   The Customs agent who was responsible for assessing the documents obtained from Mr. Vaid and the photocopy shop said she read them ''looking for buzzwords'' and found nothing. **********The agent, who worked under cover in the investigation and agreed to be interviewed only if not identified, said that the names of Mr. Butt and Colonel Dar and others found in the correspondence between Mr. Vaid and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission had been routinely processed through the Treasury Department's law enforcement computer. **********''They came up negative,'' the agent said. ''There was no record.'' **********In subsequent interviews, Gary Waugh and Rafael Lopez, senior officials of the strategic investigations division of the Customs Bureau in Washington, confirmed that there was no record of Mr. Butt, Mr. Vaid, or Colonel Dar in their computer files. **********Justice Department officials in Washington similarly explained that they had no information linking Mr. Vaid to the Pakistani Government at the time the United States Attorney's office in Houston was authorized to proceed with a plea bargain in the case. **********John L. Martin, chief of the internal security section, said through a Justic Department spokesman: ''There was no evidence to think that this was a big spy case. You're chasing a leprechaun, not a big spy.'' **********A State Department official directly involved in the Vaid case conceded in retrospect that the Department had been too blase about the case. **********''The case was handled by Houston and treated as a nickel-and-dime case all along,'' he said. **********There was State Department concern over the last-minute decision by Mr. Langoria to agree to a plea bargain, thus avoiding a public trial, the official said. But no formal State Department protest was filed. **********That issue arose in mid-September, three months after Mr. Vaid's arrest and on the eve of his trial, when the Government successfully subpoenaed telex records from RCA Global Communications Inc., the company that had transmitted Mr. Vaid's reports to Mr. Butt and Colonel Dar, showing that Mr. Vaid had knowingly violated the export laws and giving direct evidence that Mr. Vaid had purchased the krytrons on behalf of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.     'We Did Not Know Who Those People Were' **********Mr. Longoria, the United States Attorney, and his associates in Houston said they considered the telexes to be the ''smoking gun'' in the case, since it firmly established an intent to break the law by Mr. Vaid, who had pleaded not guilty. **********The telexes, which were addressed to Mr. Butt and Colonel Dar, were even further evidence of a link between Mr. Vaid and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, but no one in Houston, Federal officials later said, understood that the two men were officials of the Pakistani agency. **********''We did not know who those people were,'' Mr. Longoria later told a reporter. **********He added: ''We did not know that Dar or Butt were officials with nuclear bombs in Pakistan. We didn't know who they were.'' **********Asked whether the Government had had all of the evidence it needed to discover Mr. Vaid's official link to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Mr. Longoria said: ''That's right. We had the telexes. If we had known who Butt and Dar were, would have been in a position to prove that. But we didn't know and didn't find out until you came into this room 20 minutes ago.'' **********No Chance to Win, He Sought Plea Bargain **********Mr. Vaid, once confronted by the Federal prosecutors with the telexes, realized that he had no chance to win a jury trial, according to his attorneys. At that point, he sought a last-minute bargain to avoid trial in which he would plead guilty to one count, the lawyers said. He understood, according to his attorneys, that his plea meant that he would be automatically deported from the United States as a convicted felon. **********The plea bargain was agreed upon and was accepted by Judge DeAnda. who was assigned to the case. **********At the sentencing in October, the judge announced, according to the transcript, that he was ''left with the impression that this man was not acting in any capacity as an enemy agent.'' **********He continued: ''He apparently had no malicious intent beyond trying to expedite what he thought was a business deal and trying to accommodate a customer and in so doing made a false report. He did all the things the Government charges, but there's nothing in the evidence aggravating beyond that.'' **********Judge DeAnda then sentenced Mr. Vaid to two years in prison for violating the export law but suspended the jail term to time served in jail while awaiting trial. Mr. Vaid was also placed on unsupervised probation for five years. **********Mr. Longoria argued briefly for a stiffer sentence but ultimately agreed with the judge that ''we never claimed Mr. Vaid was an enemy of the country or Pakistan was an enemy, far from it,'' according to the transcript. **********The case ended. Mr. Vaid was deported on Nov. 10 without incident."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/11/business/advertising-philadelphia-shop-gets-silo-inc-assignment.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Philadelphia Shop Gets Silo Inc.

Anderson, its chairman; Jackson B. Browning, its vice president and director of health, safety and environmental affairs, or any of its scientific experts available to  respond directly to the questions, which resulted from a seven-week investigation by reporters for The New York Times. **********In addition, during the Times investigation, Warren Woomer, the Union Carbide executive who was the last American supervisor at the plant and had been part of a Union Carbide team investigating the accident, declined to respond to more than 12 requests for an interview, one of which included a letter spelling out the aims of the Times investigation. **********Company's Response **********Instead, after conducting what they described as lengthy meetings with a group of Union Carbide's technical personnel, spokesmen for the company's corporate relations department provided answers that contained some previously undisclosed technical and financial information but also reflected the company's own difficulties in determining the causes of the accident. **********As it has said repeatedly since the leak of methyl isocyanate gas occurred in Bhopal on Dec. 3, Union Carbide said its investigation was handicapped because it had had only partial access to documents, and to some of the employees, at the Indian plant. **********Lawsuits have been filed in India against some employees. **********''The judicial and ethical rules and practices inhibit them from answering questions involving the subject matter of that litigation,'' Union Carbide said. **********It added that its main source of information about the circumstances leading  up to the disaster was a team of technical experts that was sent to Bhopal three days later and remained there 24 days. But because the Indian Government was conducting a separate inquiry, the company said, ''restrictions were imposed on  our investigation.'' **********The Union Carbide spokesmen said their ability to respond to questions - several of which stemmed from assertions in India that safety equipment and procedures were severely flawed at the plant - was also limited because the company's investigators had been assigned virtually complete autonomy and privacy until their work is complete. **********''We want them to work like a jury considering evidence in a trial,'' said Walter Goetz, Union Carbide's director of corporate communication. ''We have not tried to question them on their findings.'' **********Another Union Carbide spokesman, Thomas Failla, said the company's ability to respond to questions from The Times was limited by the amount of time that was given. The company was first told that it would be asked a long list of detailed technical questions last Thursday afternoon. The questions were relayed in a telephone conversation early Friday afternoon, and Mr. Failla said the group of  technical experts found it necessary to confer until 11 P.M. Friday and reconvene at 8 A.M. Saturday before their responses were ready shortly before noon. **********Despite those constraints, Union Carbide offered previously undisclosed technical and financial information, some of which had been requested repeatedly by news organizations around the world, including The Times, in the weeks after  the Bhopal tragedy. **********Losses at Indian Plant **********The new information provided by the corporation included the fact that the Bhopal plant had been losing money since 1982. The company spokesmen declined to say how much money it was losing, but they said efforts were under way to make the operation more efficient. **********''Cost reduction is a continual objective of managers throughout the world,'' the company said. Union Carbide India Ltd., ''like other subsidiaries,'' has used ''operations improvement programs,'' it added, ''but the details of those programs at the Bhopal plant are not known to us.'' **********Union Carbide, which had previously declined to name the architect and engineers of the Bhopal plant, said it had given its Indian subsidiary broad design guidelines in the form of a ''process design package.'' It added that Humphreys & Glasgow Consultants Pvt. Ltd., the Indian subsidiary of a British company, Humphreys & Glasgow Ltd., had been retained for detailed design work. The British company was bought in 1983 by the Enserch Corporation of Dallas. **********The capacity of the methyl isocyanate tank that leaked gas on Dec. 3 was 15,000 gallons, Union Carbide said, and it contained 11,000 gallons of the hazardous chemical in a liquid form at the time of the accident. There had been  widespread speculation, unconfirmed by the company, that the capacity of the tank was 12,000 gallons, and that it had been more nearly filled. **********Second Tank Partly Filled **********Union Carbide said its technical team in Bhopal had found that a second methyl isocyanate storage tank at the plant, which was supposed to have been empty, had been partially filled at the time of the accident, contrary to prescribed safety procedures. ''We do not know when and how the MIC got into the spare tank,'' the company said, referring to the methyl isocyanate. It added that the chemical had been safely processed into carbaryl, a far less dangerous  pesticide. **********Union Carbide investigators sent to Bhopal in December collected residues that were found in the storage tank that leaked methyl isocyanate, the company said. Chemists on its team are conducting laboratory tests with the residues to  try to replicate the reaction that caused the accident, the company added, but their work will take several more weeks. **********The company said it did not know whether reduced spending at the Bhopal plant had resulted in the malfunction of key pieces of safety equipment, as charged by some employees in Bhopal. The equipment cited was a refrigeration system, designed to maintain the stability of the volatile chemical in the tank, and a scrubber and flare tower, also designed to reduce the danger of gas leaks. **********''Our information with respect to these pieces of equipment is incomplete,''  the company said. ''Moreover, the significance of these matters in the causative chain that led to the accident cannot now be determined. We will decline to contribute to speculation as to the causal connection between particular items of equipment or procedures.'' **********Staffing Levels **********The company also declined to comment on the contention by Bhopal employees that staffing levels at the methyl isocyanate plant had been reduced from 12 to  6 operators on a shift, that qualifications required for workers at the plant had been lowered, and that morale was low among much of the work force. **********Union Carbide said 11 of the Indian subsidiary's employees had been given extensive training in 1979 at Union Carbide's methyl isocyanate plant in Institute, W. Va. But it said it did not know whether any Bhopal employees had been given similar training since 1979, whether any of those trained in Institute were on duty when the accident occurred Dec. 3, or whether any of them were still employed by the Indian subsidiary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/16/world/3-dead-in-jamaica-as-protests-erupt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 881, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 DEAD IN JAMAICA AS PROTESTS ERUPT", "print_headline": "3 DEAD IN JAMAICA AS PROTESTS ERUPT", "body_text": " **********Protest demonstrations erupted across this Caribbean nation today, hours after the Government sharply increased fuel prices. **********The police said three demonstrators had been killed and at least three people injured in the disturbances, the worst since Prime Minister Edward P. G. Seaga took office more than four years ago with a pledge to restore economic stability to a country torn by violence in the 1970's. **********The demonstrations, which consisted mainly of groups of 40 to 50 people blocking roads with cars and burning tires, forced schools and most offices and businesses in the capital to close. Several international airline flights to Kingston were canceled. **********Little Effect in Resorts **********Government officials said that the disruptions were less extensive in the north coast resort towns of Montego Bay, Ocho Rios and Negril and that the vital tourist business, now in its peak season, was not dramatically affected. **********Mr. Seaga said in an interview that the Jamaican police and soldiers had been instructed to use minimal force ''so as not to be drawn into confrontations and to invite escalation.'' **********At midday, more than half a dozen plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose above the capital and most streets were deserted. **********The police said two deaths and three injuries had occurred in Kingston. The third death, they said, occurred in the farm town of May Pen, about 30 miles west of the capital. **********2 Shot by the Police **********A Government spokesman said that two of the dead, including the victim in May Pen, were demonstrators shot by the police and that the third was killed in an exchange of gunfire with a motorist. The motorist was one of the three injured. The spokesman said there were no reports of police or army casualties, and no word about arrests. **********Diplomats and Government officials asserted that the demonstrations might have been orchestrated by opponents of Mr. Seaga, who in the last two weeks have renewed demands that he call new elections. **********''We have known for some time that the opposition was planning for some demonstrations,'' Mr. Seaga said. ''They were just waiting for the right time.'' **********Michael N. Manley, the former Prime Minister who was defeated by Mr. Seaga in 1980 and remains leader of the People's National Party, described the demonstrations in a radio statement as ''a wave of popular protest.'' **********Mr. Manley's party refused to take part in elections called suddenly by Mr. Seaga in December 1983, asserting that voter registration lists were invalid. Mr. Seaga has said he does not intend to hold elections again until 1989, when he is constitutionally required to do so. **********Austerity Measures **********Through austerity measures, Mr. Seaga, perhaps the Reagan Administration's strongest ally in the Caribbean, has reversed the economic decline that Jamaica experienced in the 1970's under Mr. Manley, who developed close ties with Cuba and frequently criticized the United States. **********But despite significant growth in tourism, agriculture and manufacturing, many of Jamaica's 2.2 million people have yet to feel the benefits. The unemployment rate is more than 25 percent, and inflation in the last year is estimated at more than 30 percent. **********Mr. Seaga said he had increased the price of all petroleum products, including gasoline, in order to offset the nearly 50 percent devaluation of the Jamaican dollar in the last year. The price of gasoline rose by 21 percent, to the equivalent of about $2.16 per gallon. **********The increases were announced Monday night and took effect today. **********Mr. Manley said the increases were ''unwarranted, unjustified and unbearable.'' But he urged that protesters respect the law. **********There were radio reports that perhaps as many as 1,000 people took part in one demonstration in a poor section of the capital this morning. **********Protest at Jamaica House **********In another of the largest demonstrations, about 300 shouting people gathered in front of Jamaica House, where the Prime Minister has his offices. A Government spokesman said the protesters had thrown three burning tires on the vast lawn outside the building, but he said the police had dispersed the crowd without injuries. **********Many Jamaicans active in politics recalled that the Jamaica Labor Party, led by Mr. Seaga, staged similar protests in the late 1970's. **********''We can't make too much noise about this,'' one of the senior officials in Mr. Seaga's party said this morning as he waited beside a policeman with a radio for information on road conditions. ''We did the same thing.'' **********One businessman who closely follows politics here said the demonstrations appeared to be well organized, with small groups of men moving throughout the city and setting up the roadblocks. Diplomats said the protests were likely to be interpreted as a show of strength by Mr. Manley's party. **********In recent polls, Mr. Seaga's party has dropped in popularity. But instead of a marked increase in support for Mr. Manley's party, the polls have shown many Jamaicans to be undecided. **********The businessman said that while the tourist business had not been badly disrupted in the demonstrations today, there were likely to be residual effects. **********''This is obviously going to lead to a lot of people thinking Jamaica is not a safe place to come to,'' he said. ''It will undoubtedly hurt tourism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/12/business/ge-net-increases-5.4-gains-in-output-cited.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1985-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 344, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

L. Bean Inc.'s famous retail store, a landmark in this small Maine town. With visions of down vests, chamois shirts and rubber-bottomed Maine hunting shoes dancing in their heads, most probably do not even notice the sprawling, metal-skinned building that stands unidentified off Route 1, just about a half-mile down the road from Bean's store. **********But in recent years, this nondescript building has attracted a different kind of pilgrim: corporate executives from companies as diverse as I.B.M. and J. C. Penney, Xerox and Eddie Bauer, Digital Equipment and Time Inc. This 315,000-square-foot building is L. L. Bean's distribution center, the backbone of its mighty mail-order business. From this building, Bean annually sends out 5.8 million packages that contain some 11 million items worth some $260 million, or about 86 percent of its total sales. **********What these corporate giants have come to study is not merely Bean's remarkable efficiency, but the way Bean has achieved that efficiency: by relying on people rather than robots. **********''Here is a conventional warehouse that is very efficient and only semi-automated,'' marveled Robert C. Camp, manager of business analysis for the Xerox Corporation, which looked to Bean for ways to improve its own copier-supplies warehouses. **********Limited Use of Technology **********Bean makes no apology for its limited use of modern technology. ''Our technology has never been state-of-the-art or on the cutting edge,'' said John Findlay, Bean's senior vice president for operations. He is a data processing expert and one of the many professional managers recruited during the last decade by Leon A. Gorman, the company's president and grandson of its legendary founder, Leon Leonwood Bean. **********Bean's approach may sound like heresy in a age when scores of American corporations see automation as the way to regain a competitive edge over the Japanese. But many companies are now discovering that automation alone is not a remedy. **********''It's not automation that enables you to survive,'' said Hugh D. Kinney, managing partner of Systecon, an Atlanta-based consulting group that specializes in manufacturing-technology and distribution systems. ''It's the creative use of technology to enable people to be productive.'' **********In fact, some experts maintain that businesses that make good use of workers have a built-in edge. Companies that have developed disciplined people systems ''are very difficult to compete against,'' said John A. White, director of the Material Handling Research Center at Georgia Institute of Technology. **********Meshing Man and Machine **********Under Mr. Gorman, who became president after his grandfather died in 1967 at the age of 94, this Maine mail-order house has meshed man and machine to create just the kind of system that Mr. Kinney and Mr. White describe. **********In the last decade, Bean's sales have grown tenfold. The number of items it stocks - including variations in colors and sizes - increased sixfold, to 51,430. But the number of permanent employees rose less than fivefold, to 1,650, from 344. **********Moreover, Bean still manages to get orders out the door within four and a half days. ''Many catalogue companies take two to three weeks,'' said Robert D. Kestnbaum, a consultant to the direct marketing industry. Just as important as its speed is Bean's accuracy. It sends customers exactly what they ordered 99.89 percent of the time. ''It's hard to be more accurate than that,'' Mr. Kestnbaum said. ''Many companies have a 1 percent to 2 percent inaccuracy rate.'' **********Bean's performance is especially remarkable in light of not only the tedious nature of many jobs at its distribution center, but also the large number of seasonal workers that Bean uses. To handle the Christmas crush, Bean doubles the size of the hourly work force at its distribution center, to 700. Companywide, the number of hourly workers swells from 1,400 to nearly 2,800. **********The Role of Computers **********To be sure, computers - Bean bought its first in 1974 - have played an important role in improving productivity and accuracy. But while other companies' most sophisticated warehouses are empires of mechanized racks and robotic carts ruled by computers, the job of machines at Bean is to lend human beings a helping hand. **********''My preference is to use the computer much more in work planning, control and direction of the manual effort and not to invest much in machinery,'' said Thomas C. Day, vice president for fulfillment operations. **********Computers keep track of the location of merchandise that has arrived from suppliers. That means workers in receiving do not have to put like boxes of merchandise in the same place in the warehouse. They can put them on the nearest available shelf. **********Computers also organize similar orders into batches so workers can ''pick'' the required merchandise from the shelves in the most efficient manner. The computer suggests the shortest route through the warehouse and where on the cart to place each order. The computer also prints out the shipping label and decides the cheapest way to send each order, which is important, because Bean -not its customers - pays for shipping and handling. **********All this may sound fairly sophisticated, but it is not. ''Relative to what we think of as a modern warehouse, they are not modern,'' said Mr. Kinney, the consultant. **********A Seasonal Business **********But Bean's executives believe that an all-out attempt to automate its distribution centers would simply be a waste of money. For one thing, Bean's business is highly seasonal: The number of orders it handles jumps from 7,000 a day during the slow summer months to a peak of 58,000 before Christmas. That means automated equipment would go underutilized much of the year. **********In addition, highly automated storage and retrieval systems may work fine when the products in question are all roughly the same size, shape and weight. But when the products are as different as a flannel shirt and a fishing rod, no machine is a match for a human being, Mr. Day said. **********The work ethic still thrives in Maine, and that certainly has something to do with why the pickers and packers work so hard for the $5 to $6.60 an hour they earn - relatively high wages here. Bean has enhanced that ethic with an atmosphere in which employees - even seasonal workers - feel a deep loyalty to the company and its values. **********Old L. L. might not have approved of Bean's computers at all, but his heart would undoubtedly have soared to hear Vertie Pettengill, a 24-year-old picker, say that ''customers always come first here.'' The company will ''exchange anything for any reason,'' Mrs. Pettengill said. **********Master Communicator **********L. L. Bean Inc. is a master communicator. All employees - even seasonal workers who might work only a total of 80 hours - receive up to one week of training. This indoctrination includes a film on the history of Bean, whose origins date to the early 1900's, when L. L. came up with the idea of a boot that would keep his feet dry on hunting trips. **********Lest the film not make a lasting impression, posters with some of L. L.'s favorite sayings - such as ''a customer is not dependent on us, we are dependent on him'' - are plastered all over the premises. **********Bulletin boards are also an important part of the Bean culture. Customer letters - both complaints and praise - are pinned under a section called ''messages from the boss.'' **********While ''quality circles'' have been nothing more than a fad at many corporations, listening to workers' suggestions is just good business at Bean. **********Posting Vital Statistics **********Bean also believes in letting workers know how they are performing. Vital statistics, such as how often customers are sent what they order, are posted and updated daily. **********Productivity and accuracy records for each picker and packer are also maintained. Bean uses them to decide how much each worker should be paid. **********The wages that Bean pays may not sound like much when compared with the earnings of steel workers or auto workers. But, even though the Portland area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, Bean has had no trouble recruiting seasonal workers like Margaret Colbert, whose husband is stationed at a Naval base at nearby Brunswick. **********One reason is that Bean hires most of its permanent employees from its crew of temporaries. Another is that most of Bean's hourly employees are women who are often not their families' main breadwinners. ''The money comes in handy for Christmas gifts,'' said Mrs. Colbert, who has four children and a grandson. Also attractive is the 33 percent discount on employee purchases. **********Judging from the smiling faces, employees also heartily approve of Bean's old-fashioned custom of giving them a little something extra for Christmas. Workers who have been at Bean for at least three months will find $100 in their stockings. Others find $20. And for those who work 1,000 hours or more a year, there is a profit-sharing payment, which varies from 10 percent to 20 percent of salary, in the spring. **********Bean does have some additional plans for automation, confessed Mr. Day, who wears one of Bean's maroon, duck-print ties and has a watercolor of the famous Maine hunting shoes on his office wall. For instance, the company is installing a computerized scale for automatically checking whether a package contains what it is supposed to. But this system will only complement the human auditors. **********Do not worry about Bean succumbing to high-tech, said Mr. Findlay. ''To a certain extent, some of us hate equipment,'' he said. Why? ''People don't break down.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/19/business/dow-rises-4.93-in-late-rally.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Rises 4.93 in Late Rally", "print_headline": "Dow Rises 4.93 in Late Rally", "body_text": " **********Wall Street had a mixed session yesterday as investors continued to pursue blue-chip issues, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to yet another record, while taking some profits in secondary stocks. **********The Dow, which had set a record only last Thursday, closed 4.93 points higher to another all-time high of 1,440.02.

And what Mr. Bergerac and the board endorsed looks very much like the bust-up of Revlon that he seemed determined to avoid. **********Under the breakup plan approved by Revlon on Thursday, the leveraged buyout firm of Forstmann Little & Company and members of Revlon's management, including Mr. Bergerac, will take the company private by paying shareholders $56 a share, or $1.77 billion. Before that happens, Revlon will sell off its cosmetics business - and with it, the Revlon name - for $900 million, to another investment firm. **********In addition, American Home Products, a big consumer products company, has agreed to pay about $350 million for Reheis specialty chemicals and the Norcliff Thayer unit, which makes Tums antacids among other things. **********Keeping Health Care **********When the dust settles, Forstmann Little and Mr. Bergerac will own and run the great bulk of Revlon's booming health care business. Their portion is an enterprise estimated by at least one analyst to be worth as much as $1.8 billion. **********Their businesses will include contact lenses, blood analyzing equipment, pharmaceuticals and a chain of clinical laboratories. These accounted for the vast majority of Revlon's health care sales of $1.3 billion and operating income of $198.1 million last year. And health care, in turn, generated two-thirds of Revlon's operating profits and more than half its sales last year. **********On the surface, at least, ''it looks to most people as if Bergerac and his group have taken the cream,'' said Allan G. Mottus, a consultant to the health care and beauty industry. **********Indeed, under the Forstmann Little deal, Mr. Bergerac will be cashing in the shares he owns in Revlon and then making an investment in the new health care company that may ultimately end up being worth considerably more than his present Revlon shares. **********In doing so, Mr. Bergerac will become a co-owner of the chunk of Revlon that he had nurtured and that, some former associates say, gave him the most pleasure in running. His most notable achievement in a decade as Revlon's chief executive was bringing the cosmetics maker into the emerging field of health care. **********Mr. Bergerac did not return phone calls yesterday seeking comment on his apparent change of position. **********Bergerac's Change **********To be sure, there are reasons why Mr. Bergerac may have had no choice but to dismember his company, notwithstanding his earlier bitter resistance. **********The relentless pursuit of Revlon by Pantry Pride Inc., culminating in its most recent $53-a-share bid for the company, increased the pressure on Mr. Bergerac to take some action. And after Philip Morris struck a deal to buy General Foods for nearly $5.8 billion and Procter & Gamble agreed to pay $1.55 billion for Richardson-Vicks, it became clear that established consumer products companies, such as Revlon, were worth considerably more than what Wall Street analysts had estimated only a few weeks ago. **********''There is a feeding frenzy for companies with brand names,'' said Daniel J. Meade, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''If Bergerac had held on, he probably would have had a rebellion of the board and shareholders.'' In addition, there were reports that Revlon did seek to find a friendly suitor for the entire company. **********Nonetheless, the question remains: Is Revlon being broken up at what, in Mr. Bergerac's words, could be called a bargain-basement price? After all, the sold-off divisions will reap about $1.25 billion in cash that the Forstmann Little team will inherit, so Forstmann Little's net outlay appears to be only $520 million. **********One answer is that it may not be as great a bargain as it seems. **********For one thing, Mr. Mottus says that, for all its promise, the health care business that the Forstmann Little team is acquiring has its problems, too. He and others note that the pharmaceutical business has yet to come up with a blockbuster drug, and that the diagnostic equipment business faces considerable challenges in the years ahead. **********Moreover, although the net cost of the health care business seems low, Forstmann Little is assuming substantial debt. One reason is that Revlon bought back 10 million shares for $575 million recently to ward off a hostile takeover bid by Pantry Pride Inc., which added greatly to Revlon's debt. Thus, with Revlon's net debt - or its total debt minus cash - the price would be about $1.3 billion. That is 22 to 23 times last year's earnings for these operations, according to Mr. Meade of First Boston. **********That ratio is considered high, and will actually probably be less because some of Revlon's debt will accompany the pieces it is selling off. But even at $1.3 billion, Diana K. Temple, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, thinks that price would be a bargain. ''They can sell the stuff for $1.8 billion,'' she said, predicting that this is what Forstmann and Mr. Bergerac may try to do. **********Stock Price Surge **********Regardless of how well Mr. Bergerac and Forstmann would fare, Wall Street analysts say that Revlon's stockholders are doing fairly well. They note that Revlon's shares were traded as low as $40.375 as recently as Sept. 18 and in the mid-30's just five months ago. **********''The shareholders have no reason to complain,'' said Deepak Raj, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. He and other analysts say that the price that Forstmann is offering is in line with the valuess placed on large consumer product companies in the spate of high-priced acquisition bids. **********As a shareholder himself, Mr. Bergerac has no reason to complain either. The 261,633 shares he owns would fetch $14.7 million under the proposed buyout plan. **********Mr. Bergerac was recruited from the ITT Corporation by Revlon's legendary founder, the late Charles Revson, in 1974. He has been chief executive since 1975. His salary and bonus totaled $1.3 million last year, according to the company's 1985 proxy. He would wind up as chief executive officer of the new company. **********That Mr. Bergerac is electing to remain with the health care operations came as no surprise to anyone who has followed his career at Revlon. The former head of ITT's European operations, Mr. Bergerac was the architect of Revlon's diversification into health care. In the last decade, he has made 11 acquisitions, increasing Revlon's health care revenues tenfold. **********Former Revlon executives and outsiders say that the health care business has always been Mr. Bergerac's first love. **********''He never felt that comfortable with the cosmetics group,'' Mr. Mottus said. ''That wasn't his legacy. His legacy was making the acquisitions that made Revlon a full-blown health care company.'' **********Stanley Kohlenberg, a former Revlon executive, said: ''He came from an enormous company that was highly structured and was a big believer in financial analysis, market planning and five-year plans. It is impossible to make a five-year plan for a lipstick collection.'' **********For their part, Revlon officials hotly deny that they plan a piecemeal liquidation of the health care operations to turn a quick profit. ''Mr. Bergerac fully intends to be an operating chief executive,'' said Roger Shelley, Revlon's vice president for corporate affairs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/23/business/aerojet-contract.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aerojet Contract", "print_headline": "Aerojet Contract", "body_text": " **********The Army said it would cut back research on an airborne optical sensor for the ''star wars'' anti-missile program to avoid a projected $100 million cost overrun by the Boeing Company, the prime contractor.

It would also be useful to learn the real growth of the gross national product, although this would be somewhat less certain to lead to riches. **********But my choice would be none of these. Assuming that I would have only the one year to make my fortune, I would say, ''Genie, what will the interest rate be when the United States Treasury sells 20-year bonds next fall?'' **********The answer could be easily translated into highly leveraged, guaranteed profits, and, almost as a bonus, it would tell a good deal about other things, such as the economy, the budget deficit and Federal Reserve policy. **********The level and direction of interest rates - the rental price of money - are so important, in fact, that no really sensible investment strategy can be framed without taking them into account. Rates are absolutely crucial, for example, in deciding whether venturing into the stock market is worth the risk. **********To be sure, it is probably impossible to forecast interest rates - or any other vital economic data, for that matter - with accuracy or certainty. But rates must at least be pondered, if only to conclude there is a good chance you will do well enough by keeping your money in the bank. **********Although interest rates have dropped sharply from the stratospheric levels of the early 1980's, when the banks' prime lending rate rose to 21 1/2 percent and the Treasury had to offer a 15 3/4 percent return on long-term bonds, they remain very high. Safe, double-digit returns can be found on fixed-income securities that will repay their principal in just a few years. **********When adjusted for the current low level of inflation, roughly 4 percent, yields seem even more appealing. **********''The gap between inflation and yields on long-term bonds is, in fact, considerably wider than it was when the economic recovery began in late 1982,'' the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company observed in a recent analysis. In other words, the real return to investors - the stated interest rate minus the inflation rate - continues to hover near its peaks. Today's inflation rate is not itself an adequate gauge in sizing up bonds that will not mature until the next century, but current yields do provide a substantial cushion in case inflation surges. **********The level of interest rates is determined by several interacting forces, principally the course of the economy, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, international capital flows and what investors think of the chances that the buying power of their capital will be preserved. **********One specialist who is favorably disposed toward the debt market is James L. Cochrane, chief economist for Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. of Houston. If he were to invest $50,000, he would put half the money into stocks and half into medium-term Treasury securities. **********''I would lock it in for three to five years,'' Mr. Cochrane said. ''I don't see anything to drive the inflationary process that would penalize me for this.'' Among other considerations, Treasury securities are totally safe as to repayment, extremely marketable, and the interest is not subject to tax by either state or local governments. The only risk, which rises with the length of time until maturity, is that, if prematurely liquidated, they might have to be sold at a loss. **********Experts also note that Treasury bills, short-term vehicles with maturities of up to a year, usually pay higher returns than the auction yields as typically reported. This is because these securities are sold at a discount and redeemed at their face amount, making them not precisely comparable to other stated returns. **********An alternative to Treasury obligations would be to buy a consumer-type certificate of deposit from a sound bank, an investment Mr. Cochrane recently made for his aged mother. ''A two-year C.D. purchased at today's rates may turn out to be a pretty good deal,'' he suggested. **********Yet few economists think today's high yields must be snapped up before they disappear. One reason is continuing strong demand for credit, much of it from the Treasury, which must borrow to finance budget deficits that seem likely to approach $200 billion for the rest of the decade. Another is the likelihood that the economy will show respectable, though perhaps not rapid, growth next year. **********Francis H. Schott, chief economist for the Equitable Life Assurance Society, like many other economists, considers the paramount factor in setting interest rates to be the nation's business cycle. This occurs ''directly through its influence on credit demands and indirectly through its influence on Federal Reserve policy,'' he said. **********The Fed, a far more seat-of-the-pants institution than its technically elaborate and bureaucratically opaque public statements suggest, is largely unpredictable, even though it has had to disclose its monetary targets semi-annually since 1975. **********If the Fed is worried, say, about poor economic growth, it is free to ignore its targets or change the base from which they are calculated. It has done both in 1985. **********Most analysts, however, believe the Fed will have to continue some degree of accommodation next year because of liquidity problems related to American agriculture and Third World debt. But nobody knows at what point market operators will decide the Fed has supplied too much money, and therefore signficantly increased the prospects for revived inflation, the mortal enemy of fixed-income securities. **********A further complication for those trying to plot a 1986 investment strategy is what will happen to the international value of the dollar. A sharp decline would revive inflation fears, analysts say, probably forcing the Fed to accept - and perhaps encourage - higher interest rates. **********But nobody really knows what result the various economic and financial forces will produce, let alone how policymakers will respond. Although William McChesney Martin, a former chairman of the Fed, once said the board's job is to ''lean against the wind,'' there have been many occasions in which it got the timing wrong and made the windstorm worse. ALTHOUGH some economists predict interest rates will decline a bit next year, the majority see a moderate rise. ''We look for rates on the short end to move up in line with the faster pace of economic activity,'' ventured Joseph G. Carson, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics. The firm projects a 90-day bill rate of about 8 1/4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1986, about 1 1/2 points higher than in the first three months of the year. **********Long-term rates, which reflect expectations of inflation, would rise only half as much, with one-quarter point increments each quarter leaving 30-year Treasurys at about 11 percent in the fourth quarter. ''You're still going to have very good news on inflation,'' Mr. Carson said. ''Agriculture and energy especially will have a depressing influence.'' **********A similar rise is expected by Richard D. Rippe and Arnold X. Moskowitz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. They project an 8.40 percent bill rate and an 11.40 percent long bond rate for the fourth quarter. **********For those who find double-digit note and bond rates attractive and at some point will move to ''lock'' them in, one important consideration is often overlooked by do-it-yourself and even some professional investors. This is the so-called reinvestment rate for those who do not expect to spend their interest and who want to enjoy the ''magic'' of compounding. **********A 10 percent Treasury bond can be counted on, of course, to yield 10 percent every year until it is paid off. But there is no guarantee that such a high rate will still be available when it comes time to reinvest the interest payments. **********''Many portfolio managers, when yields become very high, seek to freeze these high yields over a long period of future time,'' the late Sidney Homer, dean of Wall Street's bond analysts, wrote in 1980. ''It cannot be done.'' **********Now, however, it can, thanks to zero coupon issues, available as corporate and municipal securities as well as Treasurys. Zeros, as their name suggests, pay no current interest. Instead, the interest is provided in the low price of the bonds, which may be offered investors at perhaps 20 to 30 cents for each $1 of principal amount. But income tax is due annually on the imputed rise in the bond's value. **********Overarching all investment decisions, however, should be a recognition that the American political economy seems to have become biased toward inflation over the past 20 years or so. Thus, it is probably a good idea to keep bond maturities fairly short. Today's yield curve suggests that 10 years is about the limit for maximum return with minimum risk."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/14/business/advertising-a-promotion-at-edelman.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A Promotion At Edelman", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   A Promotion At Edelman", "body_text": " **********Richard Edelman has been named president of Daniel J.

Once viewed as one of the most promising ways to store and retrieve computer information - preserving it even when the plug was pulled and the display screen went dark - magnetic bubbles turned out to be too slow and too expensive to be competitive, company after company concluded. **********In 1981, after investing millions of dollars, Texas Instruments, the National Semiconductor Corporation and Rockwell International all closed their bubble operations and turned back to more traditional means of storing information: memory chips and magnetic disks. **********Now, however, there are indications that magnetic bubbles may make a comeback. At Carnegie- Mellon University, where a new Magnetics Technology Center has already become a hotbed of new research in data storage techniques, researchers have for the first time put semiconductor devices on bubble memory material. The development promises to make bubble memories much smaller and much faster, combining the durability of bubbles with the speed of semiconductor chips. **********''It's a very promising step,'' said Lane Mason, a senior industry analysts for Dataquest, which follows the memory market. ''With bubble prices so high, a big enough market just hasn't developed to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling that bubbles are here to stay.'' The worldwide market last year was about $140 million, or ''about equal to about two weeks of 64K RAM production,'' the most common memory chips, Mr. Mason said. **********Bubble memories differ greatly from semiconductors, however. They are best envisioned as tiny, **********permanent magnets on the surface of a chip made of garnet, the same material used in gemstones. The position of the bubbles - each of which represents a single bit of information, is changed by two sets of coils wound around the garnet. **********''All these bubbles are marching around like a band on a football field, and each one has to march out to be read,'' said Mark Kryder, a former researcher at the International Business Machines Corporation's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory who worked with David Greve and Paul Rasky on the Carnegie Mellon effort. The data from each member of the band are then translated through a handful of ''support'' chips surrounding each bubble device, and sent to the computer's processor. **********The benefits are tremendous. In a desktop computer, data might be stored - at least temporarily - in random-access-memory, or RAM, chips, but in the industry such chips are known as ''volatile.'' That means that when the power disappears, so do the data, instantly and irrevocably. More often, data are written onto a magnetic disk, where things are more permanent. But disk drives are heavy and cannot take much bouncing around. **********Because they are solid state devices, bubble memories can take all sorts of abuse. And because the data are stored magnetically, a constant stream of power is not necessary. Thus, they are particularly attractive in portable computers, and companies like the Teleram Communications Corporation have used them in their models for some years. (However, for reasons of economy other portables, like Tandy's popular Model 100 portable, use RAM's supplied with power by battery packs.) **********''Bubbles work for years and years, which makes them particularly attractive to the military, and anyone who needs memory in a miserable environment,'' Professor Kryder said. As a result, bubble memories have been incorporated?in robotics equipment on the factory floor and in weapons systems. In addition, some aircraft manufacturers are using them in flight recorders, the ''black boxes'' recovered after a plane crash. **********The problems have been cost and speed. As the price of semiconductors has plummeted 90 percent in the last five years, bubble memories simply could not keep up: silicon is a lot cheaper than garnet. Moreover, the bubbles themselves take a while to get sorted and ''detected'' by a probe on the surface of the chip that sends the signals to the support chips. The process is too slow and cumbersome for manipulating large amounts of data. **********The effort by researchers, both at Carnegie-Mellon and the Intel Corporation, the sole United States manufacturer with a very active bubble memory program, has been to pack bubbles more densely and eliminate those support chips. **********The technique used at Carnegie-Mellon has involved bombarding the garnet with hydrogen, helium and neon ions, a ''doping'' process similar to that used to put impurities with special characteristics for conducting electricity in semiconductors. ''That forms a pattern in the garnet wafer, not just on the surface,'' Professor Kryder explained, making it possible to fill the device with 16 times more bubbles than on a conventional device. **********The second step involved controlling those bubbles, however, and that was more complicated. By using lasers, the Carnegie-Mellon team was able, for the first time, to put a silicon wafer on the garnet. ''The thing that takes the most space on the bubble chip is the detector,'' Professor Kryder said. The hybrid chip, however, uses far smaller silicon detectors, and those problems are solved. There are four detectors in Professor Kryder's current model, but as many as 100 are possible, he said. And it is not necessary to amplify the data signals, a troublesome and power-hungry feature of current bubble chips. **********No one is certain when, if at all, the Carnegie- Mellon advance will become a commercial product. But little was ventured, and much knowledge was gained, even if it is not marketed, researchers say. The work was done on a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for only $100,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/21/world/greenland-seeks-us-money-for-eskimos-moved-for-base.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenland Seeks U.S. Money For Eskimos Moved for Base", "print_headline": "Greenland Seeks U.S. Money For Eskimos Moved for Base", "body_text": " **********Greenland is seeking as much as $5 million from the United States to compensate villagers who were moved to make way for an airbase extension, a Danish Government official said today. **********About 200 Eskimos were moved to new homes that were paid for by the United States and Danish Governments when the base at Thule in northwest Greenland was extended in 1953, the official said. **********The extension reduced the traditional hunting grounds of the Eskimos, also known as Inuits, and their income was cut by an international campaign against seal hunting.

''For the people who followed only one case, they should be embarrassed.'' **********He said he had helped find two other major war criminals around Sao Paulo: Franz Stangl, the former commandant of the Treblinka death camp who was extradited to West Germany in 1967 and died three years later while serving a life sentence; and Gustav Franz Wagner, former deputy commandant of the Sobibor death camp, who died amid extradition proceedings in 1980. With Dr. Mengele, he said, the three found in Sao Paulo accounted for the deaths of nearly 1.7 million people, or nearly one-third of the victims of the Holocaust. **********Mr. Wiesenthal also said that as far back as 1963 he had learned of contacts between Dr. Mengele in South America and Hans Sedlmeier, a manager of the Mengele family farm machinery factory in Gunzburg, West Germany, and had passed the information and subsequent tips to the Frankfurt prosecutor's office. **********''When the prosecutor is not observing Sedlmeier, it's not my guilt,'' he said. **********Letters Found in House **********West German officials said it was while searching Mr. Sedlmeier's house on May 31 that they found letters of Dr. Mengele and other documents that led them to Sao Paulo. **********Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies in Los Angeles, acknowledged some embarrassment over the outcome of the Mengele case.

''It was the task of the West Germans - it was right under their noses.'' In fact, he said, the Israelis had closely missed capturing Dr. Mengele along with Eichmann in Buenos Aires in 1960. **********Mr. Klarsfeld in Paris said of the West Germans, ''They were never serious.''

Eugenio Vides Casanova, said, referring to Mr. Duarte in an interview this week. **********Many Changes Noted **********In interviews, more than 20 people in and out of Government, some of whom oppose Mr. Duarte and United States policy in El Salvador, noted these changes in the last 18 months: *********** The Salvadoran Army, concerned with its own survival and with winning the war, has severed its political alliance with the traditional oligarchy and the extreme right. The military has reorganized the three police security forces and has largely ended officially sanctioned death squad killings. *********** Human rights violations are at a five-year low. There has been no report of a massacre by Government troops for 10 months. While killings by rightists have declined, assassinations by leftist rebels appear to be on the rise. *********** The army has significantly improved its performance on the battlefield. For the first time in three years leftist guerrillas have been unable to mount a dry season offensive and have been forced to resort instead to small-scale ambushes and a new campaign of kidnapping town officials. *********** Mr. Duarte has won control of the Legislative Assembly, ending a political deadlock with his rightist opponents that would have obstructed important programs such as judicial reform. The Salvadoran leader has also been willing to pursue difficult, but not yet moribund, peace talks with rebel officials. His Christian Democratic Party is seen as having the opportunity to become the first civilian political party to govern El Salvador and deliver some measure of benefit to citizens who chose their representatives in free elections. *********** Internationally, Mr. Duarte has won growing support for El Salvador. He has additionally weakened the standing of the rebel military Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the political Democratic Revolutionary Front. Changes Financed by the U.S. Such shifts have come in a bloody and often uncertain process of change initiated in 1979 by young army officers afraid that El Salvador would soon follow Nicaragua into mass insurrection and a victory by leftist rebels. **********The changes have been financed and encouraged, sometimes falteringly, by the United States. According to State Department figures, the United States has sent over $1.7 billion in economic and military aid to El Salvador since 1980. A senior American official here said he expected the United States would continue to give up to $500 million in annual assistance for at least the next few years. **********The economy and the needs of over a half a million refugees from the war appear to be the toughest problems facing the Government in the immediate future. General Vides Casanova said he considered hunger and unemployment greater enemies in the next five years than the guerrillas. **********The average Salvadoran is estimated to have endured a decline of more than 30 percent in the standard of living in the last five years. Strikes and demands for salary increases are growing even with unemployment of over 40 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/world/regional-trouble-spots.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REGIONAL TROUBLE SPOTS", "print_headline": "REGIONAL TROUBLE SPOTS", "body_text": " **********The summit participants are expected to discuss several regional conflicts, particularly in light of President Reagan's United Nations speech calling on the Russians to help resolve such wars. Many strains in American-Soviet relations have arisen over the years because of problems in other parts of the world, and regional crises have not infrequently set back progress in other areas, such as arms control. Afghanistan rrIn December 1979, more than 100,000 Soviet troops entered Afghanistan, which shares borders with the Soviet Union and Pakistan. The cause, the United States says, was Soviet dissatisfaction with the Afghan leadership and the need to prop up a leader who was closer to Moscow. The Soviet Union says its soldiers were invited to help Afghanistan fight rebels supported by Pakistan and the United States. After the Soviet troops arrived, the civil war continued, pitting the Kabul Government's forces and their Soviet allies against thousands of Islamic rebels. Efforts to find a political settlement, including the withdrawal of Soviet troops, have been conducted under United Nations auspices, but have produced no agreement. Cambodia In December 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia and toppled the Khmer Rouge Government, which had taken over in 1975 and slaughtered, it is estimated, millions of its own people. The Soviet Union supports the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Samrin, which has been battling guerrillas from a Western-backed coalition that includes forces loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former head of state; the Khmer Rouge, which is led by Pol Pot; and the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front. **********American-backed efforts to bring about the withdrawal of the Vietnamese and hold elections in Cambodia have failed. Africa The Marxist Government of Angola has been fighting Western-backed guerrillas for a decade with the help of Cuban troops. The withdrawal of the Cubans has been sought by the United States as a condition for an agreement on the independence of South-West Africa, the territory also known as Namibia, which is administered by South Africa in violation of United Nations resolutions. The Soviet Union has given military backing not only to Angola but also to the Marxist Government of Ethiopia, which is fighting separatist insurgencies, and where Cuban troops are also stationed. The United States has accused the Soviet Union of contributing to instability in both areas. Recently, Washington talked of openly aiding rebels fighting the Luanda Government. Central America The emergence of Nicaragua as an ally of the Soviet Union and Cuba has become a major issue of dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union. Washington, saying the Nicaraguans pose a threat to their neighbors in Central America, has been helping Nicaraguan insurgents who are trying to unseat the Managua Government. In El Salvador, a leftist insurgency is fighting a guerrilla war against the United States-backed Government. Washington has accused the Nicaraguans of helping the Salvadoran rebels and trying to export Marxism throughout the region. Nicaragua and the Soviet Union have accused the United States of interference in Nicaragua's internal affairs. Middle East The United States has ties to Israel and several Arab nations, while the Soviet Union has ties to the Arab world but none to Israel. The Soviet Union has demanded that Israel, in return for peace, give up the land it seized from Arab nations in 1967. The United States says it believes Moscow is not interested in sincerely mediating a solution, but only in gaining favor among Arabs. The Russians say the United States, by trying to keep them out of Middle East diplomacy, has blocked a negotiated solution. Moscow is seeking an international conference on the Middle East as a way to re-enter the diplomatic process. The Russians have hinted at a willingness to re-establish ties with Israel, which were broken in 1967, but the Israelis say they do not expect this soon. >"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/07/business/thayer-repayment-bid-cited.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1985-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1090, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THAYER REPAYMENT BID CITED", "print_headline": "THAYER REPAYMENT BID CITED", "body_text": " **********Paul Thayer, former Deputy Secretary of Defense, and a Dallas stockbroker have offered to pay the Government more than $750,000 to settle civil charges of illegal insider stock trading, according to lawyers involved in the case. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to approve the offer under which Mr. Thayer and his friend Billy Bob Harris, a Dallas stockbroker, would cover some of the illegal stock profits that the agency says Mr. Harris and eight other individuals made as a result of the confidential corporate information that Mr. Thayer illegally provided them in 1982. **********The S.E.C. accused Mr. Thayer of giving Mr. Harris insider information relating to impending takeover offers by companies of which Mr. Thayer was a director. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Thayer and Mr. Harris are to appear for sentencing before a Federal judge here on criminal charges of obstructing justice in connection with the S.E.C.'s investigation of the $1.9 million insider trading case. **********Mr. Thayer, who resigned from the Defense Department in January 1984, and Mr. Harris pleaded guilty in March to the obstruction of justice charge, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. At the time the pleas were entered, the Justice Department said it would recommend some prison time for the two men, but not a ''substantial amount.'' Negotiations for an agreement to settle the S.E.C. civil suit were already underway at that time. **********Memorandums on Sentencing **********Attorneys for both men last week submitted long memorandums to the court urging that their clients not be sent to prison. In Mr. Thayer's case, the memorandum included 68 personal testimonials about Mr. Thayer's good character many from prominent individuals, such as former President Gerald R. Ford, Senator Barry M. Goldwater, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States ambassador to Great Britain and top executives of major corporations.. **********Letters on behalf of Mr. Harris were submitted by the United States Attorney in Dallas and the head of the Dallas office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********Several private attorneys in Washington who specialize in white-collar crime cases noted that it was common for character references to be submitted in such cases, but they added that the number of well known figures who have written to the court on Mr. Thayer's behalf was somewhat unusual. **********The attorneys for Mr. Thayer and Mr. Harris said today that they were hopeful the settlement with the S.E.C. would be regarded favorably by Judge Charles Richey of United States District Court when he makes his decision on sentencing. ''The judge was concerned with restitution, and we see the S.E.C. settlement as a factor in determining whether someone has acknowledged his mistakes and made amends,'' said Judah Best, who is representing Mr. Harris. **********The Justice Department, in a response today to the sentencing memorandums filed by Mr. Thayer and Mr. Harris, reiterated its intention to seek prison time for both men. The Government reply noted that Mr. Thayer and Mr. Harris had asked for leniency because they were first-time offenders who had not committed violent crimes, because they had already suffered enough and because the crimes were aberrations in otherwise good lives. **********''These arguments are typical of those made in cases involving white-collar crime and should be rejected by this court,'' the Government reply said, adding that ''the deterrent value of sentencing white-collar criminals to jail should not be overlooked.'' The Government prosecutors also urged Judge Richey to ignore the community service sentences handed out in two cases cited by the defendants' attorneys as similar to the the current case. Government attorneys said that the insider trading in the case of Mr. Thayer and Mr. Harris was ''egregious'' and that their obstruction of justice was ''rampant.'' **********Instead, the Government cited its own precedent, a case in which a District of Columbia government employee earning $32,000 a year was sentenced to prison for stealing a $700 chandelier. ''To allow these defendants - men clearly more wealthy, privileged and powerful and men clearly involved in more signifcant criminal activity - to escape prison as their counsel now advocate would, in our view, be unjust,'' the Justice Department argued. **********Mr. Thayer's attorney, Robert B. Fiske Jr., declined comment on any details of the proposed settlement with the S.E.C. but said that if it is approved, it would be presented to Judge Richey as part of the plea for leniency in sentencing. **********Community Service Sought **********In arguing that Mr. Thayer be sentenced to a term of community service rather than prison, his attorneys said that the conduct underlying the criminal charges was an aberration. ''The entirety of Mr. Thayer's life of contribution significantly outweighs the offense which he has admitted committing,'' the memorandum said. **********The memorandum contained a biography of Mr. Thayer, describing his youth in Wichita, Kan., his decorated service as a Navy fighter pilot in World War II and his career in business. **********Mr. Thayer became president of the LTV Aerospace Corporation in 1965, and in 1974, he became chairman and chief executive officer of the LTV Corporation. He resigned in 1982 to become Deputy Secretary of Defense. **********Some of the letters accompanying the memorandum do not directly address the matter of sentencing. For example, President Ford, who wrote Judge Richey that he had known Mr. Thayer for 20 years, praised his work at LTV and in the Defense Department, and concluded, ''Throughout our friendship, I have always found Paul Thayer to be honest and forthright. From my personal experience, he was a person of good character.'' **********'Dedicated' and 'Patriotic' **********Senator Goldwater, an Arizona Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, described Mr. Thayer as a ''great personal friend'' and a man of ''great talent and ability in the field of community service.'' Mr. Goldwater told the judge that he knew very little about the case in which Mr. Thayer is involved, but added, ''I don't know of another man living in this country who has been as dedicated, patriotic and such a willing and constant servant to our government and our Constitution.'' **********Jan C. Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, praised Mr. Thayer for ''extraordinary efforts'' as chairman of the fund's corporate advisory board in helping to get the monument built. ''He is a great patriot and a man of integrity,'' Mr. Scruggs wrote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/20/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Murdock, the West Coast financier. **********The deal, which will create a combined company with a market value of about $600 million, is expected to help Castle & Cooke escape from severe debt problems that have threatened to drive it into bankruptcy. **********Under the agreement, Flexi-Van, based in New York, will become a subsidiary of Castle & Cooke, the Hawaii food and real estate company known mainly for its Dole products. Present Castle & Cooke shareholders will end up owning 55 percent of the new company, while Flexi-Van shareholders will own 45 percent on a fully diluted basis. **********New Executive Alignment **********Management control will go to Flexi-Van, however. Mr. Murdock will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined entity. Mr. Murdock, who owns 33 percent of Flexi-Van, will end up owning more than 14 percent of Castle & Cooke. **********Robert D. Cook, now president and chief executive officer of Castle & Cooke, will become president and chief operating officer. The new board will consist of eight directors from the current Flexi-Van board and six from the Castle & Cooke board. **********Although Castle & Cooke has been considered an acquisition target for months, analysts had expected that some food company, such as R.J. Reynolds Industries, would be the most likely suitor. **********''People have been talking about a merger for a long time, but I never thought it would be Flexi-Van,'' said Michael Gibbs-Harris, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********Interested in Real Estate **********He said Mr. Murdock is apparently most interested in Castle & Cooke's real estate in Hawaii, including most of the island of Lanai. **********''It seems like a good deal for Mr. Murdock,'' he said. Based on the present price of Flexi-Van stock, which closed unchanged at $30.75 in today's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Gibbs-Harris estimated that Mr. Murdock would be paying the equivalent of $9 a share for Castle & Cooke, much less than the $15 or so that analysts had thought the assets of the company were worth. **********Mr. Murdock won control of Flexi- Van in 1983 and has consistently shown that once he he gets a major stake in a company he takes action. After his Pacific Holding Corporation bought the Cannon Mills Company in 1982, he laid off managers as well as workers to improve productivity. **********A year earlier, he became the largest shareholder in the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, where he helped persuade Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman, to make his successful bid for the Cities Service Company. Last July, Occidental bought Mr. Murdock's 5 percent interest in the company for a substantial premium over its market value, and he resigned as a director. **********Under today's proposed agreement, each share of Flexi-Van stock will be converted to 2.222 shares of Castle & Cooke common stock plus 1.111 shares of a new series of voting convertible preferred stock. The preferred will have a 90-cent annual dividend and a liquidation preference of $9 and will be convertible to one Castle & Cooke common share. **********The deal has been termed a no-premium merger because shareholders are not receiving a premium over the market price of their shares. The shareholders should benefit, however, if the combined company does better than the two on their own. **********As an inducement to get Flexi-Van to agree to the merger, it is being allowed to purchase up to 4,725,000 Castle & Cooke shares at $11 a share, a little below today's closing price of $11.37 1/2, down 25 cents. **********In addition, Flexi-Van will have the option of buying valuable Hawaiian real estate for up to $300 million under certain conditions. The company did not disclose the conditions, but one source close to the deal said the purchases could be made if the Castle & Cooke shareholders reject the merger or if someone else acquires majority control of Castle & Cooke. **********The merger is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies, the willingness of Castle & Cooke creditors to agree to revised lending arrangements until the merger takes place and some other conditions. **********Castle & Cooke has missed interest payments on public debt due March 1, which could result in its being forced into bankruptcy if it cannot make the payments by March 31. In addition, the company is negotating with private unsecured creditors to restructure more than $250 million in debt. **********In the six months ended Dec. 29, 1984, Castle & Cooke lost $63.9 million on revenues of $784.6 million, in contrast to a profit of $393,000 on revenues of $708.7 million a year earlier. **********William Gibson, an analyst with Davis Skaggs & Company, a unit of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said Castle & Cooke might have had little choice but to merge. Its bankers were pressing it for repayment. **********Even if it restructured its debt, Irwin L. Jacobs, a Minneapolis financier who owns 12 percent, was waiting in the wings, perhaps to make an unfriendly acquisition. A court order barring Mr. Jacobs from acquiring more shares expires March 31. **********''They were painted into a corner,'' Mr. Gibson said. **********A question is what Mr. Jacobs will do. Analysts said he might end up losing money on his purchase of Castle & Cooke shares. Mr. Jacobs could not be reached for comment. **********Castle & Cooke, in addition to its Dole banana and pineapple operations, is a major seller of fresh vegetables in its Bud Antle division. **********The company has been hurt by low prices for these commodities, particularly bananas. Castle & Cooke company has also floundered as it tried to diversify, entering businesses such as propellers where it had no expertise. **********Its cash problems grew worse last year when it paid $71 million to buy back shares purchased by a Houston investor, Charles Hurwitz, after Castle & Cooke's abortive attempt to take over Dr Pepper. **********In January, as part of a divestiture plan to reshape the company, it sold its Bumble Bee Seafoods division to a group of investors. That plan had been initiated by Ian R. Wilson, who was brought in from the Coca-Cola Company in February 1983. His strategy was to capitalize on the Dole name by introducing more processed food products. But these expansion efforts added to the company's financial burdens, and it ran out of money.

His rejection was viewed as stemming from ill feelings brought on by eight years of martial law under General Zia. **********In addition, about 30 members of the existing national legislature, whose members were picked by General Zia, lost in their attempts to win seats in the new assembly. About 40 members won, but the defeat of so many was also interpreted as a loss for the President. **********Strategy Held Vindicated **********Supporters of General Zia said that, far from being disappointed by the losses, they were pleased with the high turnout. Independent analysts said that the President's strategy of holding elections appeared to have been vindicated, and that a measure of representative government might be restored. **********General Zia had many times promised elections and the restoration of civilian rule, but he repeatedly postponed the moves, citing economic difficulties and political instability. **********The President has not specified what powers he is willing to yield to the legislature, so the effect of the election on his authority remains unclear.  The Government said the turnout was 52 percent of the 35 million eligible voters. There were some charges of bogus ballots being cast, but random checks of polling places by journalists and others on Monday suggested that the turnout was higher than many had expected. **********The leaders of opposition parties banned from participating in the election thus apparently failed in their effort to organize a boycott and keep the turnout below 10 percent. **********Coalition of 11 Parties **********The opposition was led by the Movement for Restoration of Democracy, a coalition of 11 parties active before 1977. In that year, General Zia, then the army chief of staff, seized power in a coup, suspended the Constitution and declared martial law. **********Hundreds of opposition leaders were arrested in the week before the election. General Zia has said they will be released after voting for provincial assemblies is conducted on Thursday. **********Although the President has promised to relinquish some of his authority to the newly elected National Assembly, the opposition parties remain unconvinced. They cite, in particular, his ban on party participation, forcing candidates to run as individuals. **********American Officials Pleased **********Despite these problems, American officials were pleased with the election results, and they expressed hope that General Zia would start yielding some of his authority. **********''I think the election was a major step on the road to establishing democratic representative institutions,'' Ambassador Deane R. Hinton said in a telephone interview from Islamabad. **********He added that the loss by many of General Zia's aides demonstrated that it was ''a pretty honest election'' conducted ''without too much Government interference.'' **********Mr. Hinton said the arrest of opposition leaders was ''one of the unfortunate aspects'' of the election, adding, ''It is not a 100 percent success by the standards of American democracy.'' **********General Zia did not face election himself. In a referendum in December, he asked for endorsement of his policies of bringing the nation's laws into conformity with Islam. He construed the approval he got as giving him a five-year term as President. **********His aides have said that the new National Assembly will be able to approve laws and that it cannot be dissolved except in a national emergency. **********Nominal Premier to Be Chosen **********The nominal powers of running the country are expected to be given over to a prime minister to be chosen by General Zia from the assembly, which could then reject the choice. The assembly is expected to be largely supportive, yet it may have General Zia rule in greater political consensus with civilian leaders than before. **********What remains unclear is how much control the army will wield and the political parties will be allowed to organize in the new legislature. In all, 237 assembly members were elected from 1,098 candidates. In the elections for the four provincial assemblies on Thursday, voters are to choose 506 members from among 3,565 candidates. **********Several factors appear to have contributed to the turnout. In rural areas, wealthy landlords spent money to get out the vote for their candidates. The defeat of General Zia's supporters also suggested that some voters went to the polls to protest his policies. **********Some of those defeated were longtime members of the Government, and some of those elected were young and relatively inexperienced newcomers. **********Analysts said the elections could bring a new generation into power, possibly diminishing the traditional political parties of the Movement for Restoration of Democracy. **********''The election proved there is a reservoir of hostility to Zia,'' said a newspaper editor. ''But it is not a victory for the M.R.D. There is a new leadership coming that demands change, and it could make the M.R.D. irrelevant.'' **********Among those defeated were Arbab Niaz Mohammad, Minister of Culture, and Sheik Ishrat Ali, adviser to the President for business coordination and internal trade.  Four members of General Zia's Cabinet were elected, two of them unopposed.

Should such a deviation be found to have occurred then necesssary conclusions will be drawn.'' **********The statement was released after meetings this morning between Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. **********No Details on Investigation **********Officials here declined to say how the investigation was being carried out, who was leading it or when it might be completed. **********Some American Jewish groups represented in Israel said tonight that they were uncomfortable with the time it has taken the Israeli Government to produce a clear response to the case. **********''Israel should deal with this matter directly, without further delay and at the highest level,'' said Harry Wall, the Israel representative of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ''If it is true, it is an act of incomprehensible stupidity,'' he said. **********The foreign arm of Israeli intelligence, the Mossad, is equivalent to the Central Intelligence Agency in the United States. It has several agents based in the Washington embassy, who are primarily responsible for liaison with American intelligence services. **********The chief of the Mossad is not known to the Israeli public. Newspapers are not permitted to print either his name or picture. The current Mossad chief, called simply ''No. 1,'' came into office in September 1982 when his predecessor, Yitzhak Hoffe, stepped down. **********Israeli officals suggested that a key question in any investigation would be the extent, if any, of Mossad's connection with the case: If the intelligence service was involved, was it on the initiative of the Mossad chief or lower-level agents? **********Mossad Chief and Prime Minister **********The chief of the Mossad is part of the Prime Minister's office and reports only to him. **********Isser Harel, who was chief of the Mossad until he resigned in 1963, was asked by the newspaper Haaretz whether it would be possible for espionage activity to have taken place out of the Washington embassy without high-level directives from Jerusalem. **********''Theoretically this is possible, even though as a rule activity such as this is not carried out without directives from above,'' Mr. Harel said. **********Mr. Pollard worked for two years in a special Navy intelligence unit dealing with antiterrorism, according to United States Navy officials. After his arrest he told the authorities that he had been paid about $50,000 for turning over confidential documents, Federal officials said. **********The day after Mr. Pollard's arrest, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested his wife, Anne L.

DeCrane Jr. and a similar statement issued yesterday at the company's headquarters in White Plains sent the stock down $2.125, to $32.125, Texaco was the volume leader on the New York Stock Exchange with 8.6 million shares changing hands. **********However, oil industry analysts, while agreeing that Texaco would not be able to meet a $12 billion bond order, viewed the DeCrane statement as part of its overall strategy of overturning the $10.53 billion jury judgment in favor of the Pennzoil Company. **********''I think it was done to make everyone aware that a bond could have an extreme impact on Texaco, and to emphasize that the judge can change the jury's award,'' said John A, Martin of the Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. **********Mr. Martin, as did several analysts, said he considered the risk of Texaco going into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding ''very remote.'' **********Mr. DeCrane was quoted in yesterday's editions of The Dallas Morning News as saying: ''If a $12 billion bond is required, Texaco doesn't have $12 billion, and in my opinion probably can't get it. Then we'd have to look for some heroic measure, whether it's Chapter 11 or whatever.'' **********Under Texas law, the amount of the bond necessary to appeal damage awards such as the one in the Texaco-Pennzoil case must include at least the amount of the verdict and interest on that amount, according to J. Patrick Hazel, a professor at the University of Texas Law School who is an expert on Texas civil procedure. That would mean an appeal bond of at least $12 billion. Professor Hazel said that the purpose of the bond was to guarantee payment of the judgment should the defendant lose the appeal. **********Mr. DeCrane added that Texaco was not sure ''that that issue has to be addressed; but I'm not hollering wolf; that issue is not settled.'' $8 Billion Company Value The company's value, based on its stock price at yesterday's close, is about $8 billion. The value of Texaco's stock has fallen more than $7 a share since the decision on Nov. 19 in which the jury ruled that Texaco must pay the $10.53 billion in damages to Pennzoil for its role in enticing the Getty Oil Company to back out of a merger with Pennzoil in January 1984. A Dec. 5 court session has been scheduled in Houston for a final judgment. **********Word of Mr. DeCrane's remarks provoked a startled reaction in the financial community. Analysts said they were getting large numbers of calls from worried institutional investors wanting to know which banks had lent money to Texaco. **********In the last two years, the company has borrowed more than $8 billion to finance its $10.1 billion acquisition of Getty and a share repurchase program. Most large banks are believed to be among its creditors. **********In recent years, other domestic industrial giants facing huge lawsuits have filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. **********Manville and Robins Cases **********The Manville Corporation acted in 1982, asserting that it was being financially drained by having to contest more than 16,000 asbestos-related lawsuits. Last August, the A.H. Robins Company, which is facing thousands of suits related to its manufacture of an intrauterine birth control device, filed for bankruptcy protection and sought to separate the health-related lawsuits against it from those involving purely commercial matters. **********However, although the liabilities facing them were huge, both Manville and Robins were said to be financially healthy at the time of the filings. **********In Texaco's case, Larry Binganan, a company spokesman, said that bankruptcy proceedings ''would be a very extreme step that would arise as a possibility only after all legal remedies had been exhausted.'' He indicated that Texaco would try at the Dec. 5 court session to persuade Judge Solomon Casseb to sharply reduce the amount of the bond required, or require no bond at all. Reading from a statement, he said that it ''would be absurd and irresponsible to force Texaco into bankruptcy by requiring an impossible bond.'' **********Judge Casseb is empowered to overturn the jury verdict or reduce the amount it awarded Pennzoil. **********Seen as Part of Strategy **********One analyst, who asked not to be identified, asserted that Mr. DeCrane's remarks raising the prospect of bankruptcy for an industrial giant - Texaco is the nation's third-largest oil company, following Exxon and Mobil - were purposely made as part of Texaco's strategy to overturn the verdict. This analyst said Texaco wanted to put pressure on Judge Casseb to at least sharply reduce the amount of the bond required for an appeal and probably to influence his consideration of the jury's verdict and the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded as well. **********However, Mr. Martin of Provident National discounted the ''pressure argument.'' **********''I think their tactic is to go after the verdict on its merit,'' he said. ''They will argue that it's incorrect based on law and that the damage award is unrealistic.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/11/business/business-people-morgan-stanley-shifting-merger-unit-leadership.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   Morgan Stanley Shifting Merger Unit Leadership", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   Morgan Stanley Shifting Merger Unit Leadership", "body_text": " **********After handling a record $50 billion in mergers and acquisitions last year, Morgan Stanley & Company is shuffling the leadership of the department that pulled in that business. **********Joseph C.

But the $1,000-a-month limit on withdrawals imposed late Tuesday by Gov. Harry R. Hughes caused widespread confusion. **********Throughout the state, savings institutions reported a sharp drop in the number of depositors waiting to withdraw their money. **********Meanwhile, the Governor disclosed today that Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Corporation were negotiating with a team of state officials to acquire some Maryland thrift units. **********There were reports that the discussions were aimed at turning over control of the two thrift units that experienced the brunt of the run - the Old Court Savings and Loan Association and the Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan Association. **********'Interested in Being Helpful' **********Citicorp declined to comment, but a spokesman at Chase Manhattan said his bank was ''interested in being helpful in Maryland,'' perhaps as a way of becoming a full-scale commercial bank in that state. He added, however, that, at present, Chase was not specifically seeking to acquire Old Court. **********Representatives from the two New York City banks are expected to testify Thursday in a public hearing on the savings crisis before a joint committee of the Maryland Legislature. Both banks recently received permission to begin limited-service banking in Maryland, and begin full-service operations by 1986. **********Even as the Maryland thrift units were recovering from the run on their deposits, which over the last two months has exceeded $600 million, they faced a new problem: how to administer Governor Hughes's emergency order limiting monthly withdrawals to $1,000. **********From the moment they opened today, the state's 102 privately insured thrifts were deluged with calls from confused depositors wanting know how the $1,000 limit would work. **********'Dozens of Calls' **********''We've had dozens of calls,'' said Jerry D. Whitlock, the president of John Hanson Savings and Loan Inc., Maryland's third-largest privately insured thrift institution. ''People just don't understand how the limit will affect them personally.'' **********At the Chevy Chase Savings and Loan Association, the state's largest thrift unit with private insurance, a source close to top management said: ''The management is totally confused. They just don't know how to implement the order.'' **********Initially it was unclear if any exemptions to the $1,000 limit would be allowed - for example, to cover monthly mortgage payments or other large expenses. Late this afternoon, however, aides to the Governor issued guidelines explaining in detail how the limit would work: the guidelines said no exemptions would be granted. And Governor Hughes reinforced this at a news conference tonight at the State House: ''Obviously, there will be hardships,'' he said. ''But we are in a difficult time, a crisis time. All I can say is that we have to stick with these guidelines.'' **********He continued: ''We want institutions to apply for Federal deposit insurance. One way to accomplish that is not to make a lot of relaxations.'' **********In Touch With the Fed **********Mr. Hughes said he had been in contact today with the Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, and the Federal Reserve's chairman, Paul A. Volcker. Both assured support, Mr. Hughes said, and Mr. Volcker assigned three top aides to deal with the Maryland crisis. They are William Taylor, the Fed's director of banking supervision and regulation; Michael Bradfield, a top Fed attorney, and Welford Farmer, a senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, which oversees many of Maryland's financial institutions. **********According to banking sources, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, through its Baltimore branch, has extended $370 million in loans to members of the Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation since the beginning of the crisis. **********The $1,000 limit is expected to cause huge bookkeeping problems for thrift units. Some are so small that they record account information on paper, rather than by computer. Keeping track of withdrawals to make sure they do not exceed the $1,000 limit could be particularly tedious for such institutions, banking experts said. **********Other thrift units do have computers. But they will have to quickly rewrite their computer programs to allow for the new rule. Some thrift unit executives said they were setting up $1,000 ''accounts within accounts'' that, once drawn down, would result in a customer being denied future withdrawals. **********''We're working on the software right now,'' said Suzanne Koones, a spokesman for the Friendship Savings and Loan Association, the state's 10th-largest thrift unit. **********A New Insurer **********Under Governor Hughes's action, Maryland's privately insured thrift institutions will remain under the $1,000 limit until they receive Federal insurance. The only exception will be for those too small to qualify for Federal coverage, for which a new state-backed insurance company is expected to be formed. **********In Washington, a spokesman for the Federal insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, said that six applications for Federal coverage were being processed, and that dozens more were expected in coming days. According to one source familiar with the insurance process, Chevy Chase Savings and Loan could receive F.S.L.I.C. coverage as early as Thursday. **********In the meantime, Maryland lawmakers hope to write legislation that would create the insurance company for smaller thrift units, tighten thrift regulation and give Governor Hughes sweeping power to do what is necessary to end the crisis. The lawmakers will convene in an emergency session Friday, and aides worked all day today to draft legislation so it could be passed quickly. **********According to Ejner J. Johnson, Mr. Hughes's chief of staff, three groups were at work. One group, consisting of private attorneys specializing in financial institutions, were preparing a bill that would enable Maryland to float $100 million in general-obligation bonds. The money would finance the new insurance company. A second group, consisting of aides to the Governor and representatives of the Federal Reserve, were writing a bill that would force all thrift units that could qualify to obtain Federal insurance. A third group was writing bills to broaden Mr. Hughes' power over the state's thrift units. **********In an interview in his office this afternoon, the Governor said that obtaining Federal insurance, which would mark the end of Maryland's private insurance system, was critical to ending the crisis. And he confirmed reports that Maryland's financial institutions have had problems ever since the collapse of a big Ohio savings and loan threatened to wipe out that state's private insurance company, leading to a run on deposits there. **********'A Snowballing Effect' **********''It started with Ohio, then you had a financial house in New Jersey go belly up, and then we had negative news on Old Court,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''The combination of all of this has had a snowballing effect.'' **********Mr. Hughes said he had not been in touch with Ohio's Governor, Richard Celeste. But Mr. Hughes said that, like the Ohio Governor, he had to get a cram course in financial institutions. Mr. Hughes, a lawyer, has little background in the area. **********''I've had to learn it all in the last three weeks, and I still don't proclaim to be an expert,'' the Governor said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/21/world/honduran-in-discussions-in-us-is-expected-to-ask-security-pledge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 470, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HONDURAN, IN DISCUSSIONS IN U.S., IS EXPECTED TO ASK SECURITY PLEDGE", "print_headline": "HONDURAN, IN DISCUSSIONS IN U.S., IS EXPECTED TO ASK SECURITY PLEDGE", "body_text": " **********President Robert Suazo Cordova of Honduras arrived here today for two days of discussions with President Reagan that are expected to be dominated by requests for increased United States commitments to Honduran security. **********The meetings between the two leaders come at a time of increased tension and military activity along Honduras's border with Nicaragua, where rebels fighting the Sandinista Government have made their camps.

Those proceeds were considered the nest egg G.E. would use to make acquisitions. **********As that money remained dormant, there has been continuing speculation as to which company might be attractive to G.E. More than once, however, G.E. officials told analysts that it might not make one big acquisition, but several small ones. **********Huddling Over Final Details **********Yesterday, however, it became apparent that General Electric was ready to unload a bombshell. A long-scheduled meeting that the company was to have with analysts last night was canceled without explanation. RCA, likewise, canceled all internal meetings as the companies and their investment bankers huddled over the final details. **********Felix Rohatyn, a partner with Lazard Freres & Company, reportedly handled the negotiations for RCA. while G.E. was represented by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********A source close to the negotiations said the first meetings were initiated by G.E. and took place in early November. But the intense talks that resulted in last night's announcement began just 10 days ago. **********While details of the merger were sketchy, G.E. said it would pay $66.50 a share in cash for RCA's 94.4 million shares. The total price of $6.28 billion matches the transaction for the largest non-oil company acquisition. Earlier this year, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company agreed to buy the Beatrice Companies, a Chicago-based consumer products company, for $6.2 billion. **********In making the acquisition, which will take several months to complete, G.E. might also be interested in consumer products - of the electronic variety. While RCA has had problems with some projects, such as its costly videodisk, it has made strong inroads into the video cassette business. **********G.E., which sells video and audio equipment, may see RCA as a way to expand its presence in that consumer goods market. But it may also be the high-technology defense business that brought the companies together. **********Each is a major military contractor that could benefit from the cost savings that would result from a linkup. It is unknown, however, whether the Government might require divestitures because it fears a dilution of competitiveness. **********G.E. officials last night would not disclose its reasons for wanting to acquire RCA, deferring all questions to a news conference scheduled for this morning. **********Privately, however, some company officials said they felt the combined companies would emerge as a powerhouse in technology and marketing. **********'Excellent Strategic Opportunity' **********In a statement last night, the companies said the merger is ''an excellent strategic opportunity for both companies that will help America's competitiveness in world markets.'' **********The transaction may have been helped along by the fact that executives from both companies know each other well. **********Mr. Welch, who is 50 years old and took over as head of the company in 1981, is expected to remain in charge of the combined company. Also likely to stay on is Robert R. Frederick, president and chief executive of RCA, who was formerly a G.E. executive. **********Less likely to remain for very long is Thornton F. Bradshaw, RCA chairman, who took over in 1981 as head of a then-floundering RCA after being chairman of the Atlantic Richfield Corporation. **********The transaction is subject to the approval of RCA's stockholders and various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, which has authority over broadcasters. **********In Washington, a spokesman for the Justice Department said that either Justice or the Federal Trade Commission would want to examine the proposed merger for any possible antitrust implications. Such reviews are routine. F.C.C. approval of the transaction is not expected to be a major stumbling block since the agency earlier this year approved the Capital Cities-ABC merger without delay. RCA operates five television stations, including the network's flagship station in New York; G.E. has one station. **********The change in ownership of the National Broadcasting Company, which over the last few years has been increasing its share of the viewing audience through the production of such critically acclaimed programs as ''Hill Street Blues,'' is not expected to have much of an effect on the network's contents. The network's news operation, likewise, is not expected to be changed much, and its attempted moves into late-night news broadcasts might even be encouraged by General Electric. **********Last year RCA had sales of $10.11 billion, with net income of $341 million, while sales at G.E., currently the nation's ninth-largest industrial corporation based on revenues, totaled nearly $28 billion, with a profit of $2.28 billion. **********Undervalued Broadcasting Assets **********The transaction announced yesterday underscores how undervalued broadcasting assets have been. At the end of 1984, RCA's book value was only $22.57 a share. **********After trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, RCA's stock had soared to $63.50 a share, a $10.375 gain in one day. The stock began climbing Tuesday when several rumors circulated, including the possibility of a spinoff of NBC or a vast repurchase of stock, but none involving G.E. **********The idea behind both either a spinoff or a buyback, according to Wall Street analysts, was that the company needed to increase the price of its shares in order to protect itself against a takeover. **********RCA has been cash-rich, thanks largely to the sale announced in August of its Hertz Corporation subsidiary to UAL Inc. for $587.5 million. That money, analysts believed, made the company a prime target for another looking to buy assets at a discounted price."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/business/company-briefs-090462.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Champion International Corp., Stamford, Conn., a producer of paper and wood building material, said it had sold its distribution yards and industrial supply division to Michael R.

McFarlane, said today that it was unlikely that President Reagan would agree this week to a joint affirmation with Mikhail S. Gorbachev to extend compliance with the 1979 strategic arms treaty. **********A verbal ratification of the 1979 agreement is something that has been eagerly sought by the Western European allies, who hope for gestures from the American and Soviet leaders at the summit meeting to indicate that the arms-control process is being sustained. **********But the disclosure of a letter by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger urging Mr. Reagan to avoid making pledges to the Soviet leader on two key arms issues appears to have forced the Administration to sharpen some of its public positions more than it might have liked before the talks begin. **********Reagan Visits Chateau **********Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are to meet for more than eight hours on Tuesday and Wednesday in the first United States-Soviet summit meeting since 1979. **********Mr. Reagan, during a brief walk today with his wife, Nancy, at La Maison de Saussure, an 18th-century chateau overlooking Lake Geneva, was asked his top priority as the talks approached. He responded, ''Peace.'' **********This morning, Mr. Reagan conferred with senior aides for about 25 minutes and then visited Fleur d'Eau, a lakeside mansion that will serve as the site of the President's first meeting with Mr. Gorbachev on Tuesday. **********At one point, Mr. Reagan sat down in the chair that he will use on the first day of the summit meeting. Mrs. Reagan sat in Mr. Gorbachev's chair. **********''You're much prettier than I expected,'' the President said. **********Weinberger Not in Geneva **********The text of the Weinberger letter to Mr. Reagan appeared in the Saturday issue of The New York Times. In the letter, Mr. Weinberger, who was pointedly omitted from the American delegation here by the White House, urged Mr. Reagan to ignore the Soviet Union's ''great pressure'' and not make any agreements in Geneva involving two key elements of arms control. **********One of those elements involved the 1979 arms-limitation treaty, signed by President Carter and Leonid I. Brezhnev but never ratified by Congress. A second portion of the letter urged Mr. Reagan to resist giving assurances that would limit research, development and testing of his space-based shield, popularly known as the ''Star Wars'' plan. **********The Russsians have formally proposed extending for a year the commitment not to undercut the 1979 arms treaty, which expires on Dec. 31. In doing so, the Russians have sought to announce what would amount to a joint extension of the agreement. **********'Has Not Made a Decision' **********The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said: ''The President has not made a decision on whether we would extend it or not. At the moment, it is open-ended. Our policy is to continue to abide by it so long as the Soviets continue to follow the same criteria. But we have to make judgments on what the Soviet actions are. That's where we stand.'' **********Mr. McFarlane, at a news conference, said consideration of the 1979 treaty ''ought to benefit from the President's absorbtion of what does happen here,'' as well as what takes place in the Geneva arms-reduction talks. Mr. McFarlane also cited what he said was the Soviet arms buildup. **********''Until all of those things have been pondered by the President,'' Mr. McFarlane said, ''it's unlikely he would make a decision on that issue.'' **********No Exchanges Continuing **********Meanwhile, Arthur A. Hartman, the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, said he was ''90 percent sure there are no substantive exchanges continuing'' before the Reagan-Gorbachev talks. Middle-level Soviet and American diplomats continued meeting on logistics for the two days. **********Mr. McFarlane, asked if differences on major issues like arms control had narrowed in the last few days between the Soviet and American sides, replied tersely, ''No.'' **********The American side has said Mr. Reagan intends to discuss four major subjects during the meetings: arms control, Soviet-American relations, human rights and regional issues. **********''The President feels he is prepared to sit down with the Soviets, to chart a new relationship,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''That relationship has not been good. Its had its ups and downs on a roller-coaster course. The President has chosen a course he believes will put it on an even keel.'' **********U.S. Welcomes Soviet Move **********Mr. Speakes also said the White House welcomed the Soviet decision to issue nine exit visas to spouses of divided families, one-third of the number of long-separated spouses who remain in the Soviet Union. **********''There are nine divided spouses on this list provided by the Soviets,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''As much as we welcome this development, we remain concerned over the fate of those still divided from their spouses. **********''To the extent that this reflects a change in Soviet policy,'' he said, ''we have yet to determine if this is so. We would, of course, welcome any new direction in Soviet policy on spouses that are divided.'' **********Administration officials said it was improbable that a communique would be issued at the end of the summit talks, but added that Mr. Reagan seemed to be leaning toward a proposal in which a series of ''guidelines'' would be issued to negotiators involved in talks on strategic weapons, intermediate-range nuclear forces and military and space issues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/11/business/advertising-alfa-romeo-campaign-phase-2.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 610, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Alfa Romeo Campaign:Phase 2", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING;   Alfa Romeo Campaign:Phase 2", "body_text": " **********FOR over a year, Alfa Romeo North America, the importer of the Italian motor cars, has been pushing the product with some unusually graphic ads that gave much attention to the logotype and to ''Alfissimo!'' - a word created for the occasion. It was supposed to mean great to look at and tremendous to drive. **********A lot of water has gone over the dam since then, and one of the bigger changes is that the company's agency, Marsteller, a Young & Rubicam property, became half of an American-French joint venture, called HCM. All of the people working on the account are different now, including the ad manager at Alfa Romeo's offices in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. **********Only Joseph E. Cooley Jr. remains the same. He is still director of sales and marketing at Alpha Romeo, and at the moment is terribly pleased with how the ''Alfissimo!'' campaign has worked. Sales are up 54 percent in the first five months of this year over the period last year, and there is a four-month wait for all convertible models. In a telephone interview yesterday, he attributed it to ''Alfissimo!'' **********What is about to happen July 1 is what he considers the beginning of Phase 2. **********Frank Fleizach, senior vice president and a creative director at HCM, yesterday showed off the first two ads in the all-print campaign that will be a far cry from ''Alfissimo!'' By comparison, to an outsider at any rate, it looks like just another automotive ad, with a headline type face a bit reminiscent of Volvo's print advertising. Maybe it just seems that way when one knows that Mr. Fleizach came to HCM from Scali, McCabe, Sloves, where he wrote Volvo ads. **********He was to have been joined at the agency by Mr. Cooley, but the client executive found early morning New York-bound traffic too forbidding and therefore settled for a telephone interface. Mr. Cooley said that his ad budget for this year should be $2.94 million, based on an expected sale of 4,500 vehicles, which would be an increase of 800 from 1984. The first five months saw 2,200 sold. **********Mr. Fleizach admits to not getting excited by the ''Alfissimo!'' campaign, but thinks each of his ads will be ''a hard page to ignore.'' **********The first ad in the campaign, which will break in The Wall Street Journal, features four Alfa Romeo racing cars used since 1925 as well as today's GTV-6 sports coupe. The headline reads, ''What you get in every 1985 Alfa Romeo.'' **********The second ad makes the point that the Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce is the last of a breed of ''red hot sports cars'' that were ''sleek, sensual and agile.'' **********The tagline on each ad that appears under the logotype is ''Engineered with a passion,'' which reads smoother than last year's, ''The most passionately engineered cars in the world.'' **********Mr. Fleizach calls the ads ''startling in their simplicity.'' He thinks they will answer the questions in many consumers' minds as to what the Alfa Romeo is and what it does. **********In addition to running in full national runs of The Wall Street Journal, alternating with East and West Coast regionals, the campaign will also appear in Fortune, Money, Smithsonian, Gentlemen's Quarterly, Esquire and automotive buff books, such as Car & Driver and Road & Track. **********For the first time, according to Mr. Cooley, the company used outdoor billboards, moving into 10 markets in mid-May.

Gorbachev conceded today that he had failed to budge President Reagan from his commitment to space-based missile defenses, but the Soviet leader said their meeting had left him optimistic. **********Mr. Gorbachev appeared upbeat and animated as he delivered an hourlong opening statement and then answered questions for 45 minutes at a news conference at the Soviet Mission after appearing with Mr. Reagan in a concluding ceremony. **********It is ''unfortunate,'' Mr. Gorbachev said, that no agreement had been reached on arms control, a development for which he laid the blame on the American side. But he called the meeting ''the beginning of a dialogue aimed at improving the situation and changing it for the better.'' **********Meets Warsaw Pact Leaders **********After the news conference, Mr. Gorbachev flew to Prague to brief the other Warsaw Pact leaders on the summit meeting. He spent the night in the Czechoslovak capital. **********In the news conference, which was shown on Soviet television, Mr. Gorbachev focused on what he said had been the absence of movement on arms control, and specifically on the United States' missile defense program, known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called Star Wars. **********Before the summit meeting, Mr. Gorbachev had insisted that movement on arms control and a halt to the American missile defense program be the foremost goal. **********Today, while maintaining that arms control had been the ''pivotal'' question at every session of the summit meeting, he sought to explain the absence of progress and to report at least qualified success for the summit meeting as the start of a process toward improved relations. **********''We see that the Americans did not like the logic that we presented,'' Mr. Gorbachev said about the space-based defense issue. ''But we did not see any logic in their position.'' **********Although he avoided personal criticism of Mr. Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev struck a didactic and frustrated note on the missile defense issue. **********''We felt that the idea was something that had taken hold of the President as a person,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''But as a politician responsible for such an important country, such a powerful country, and for its security, I could not understand his actions.'' **********Blame Is Put on Americans **********More broadly, Mr. Gorbachev placed the fault for the absence of progress on arms control entirely on the Americans. **********''Of course, it would have been much better if, in Geneva, we could have reached an agreement on the key problem of stopping the arms race,'' he said. ''Unfortunately this did not happen. It turned out the U.S. side was not yet prepared to make major decisions.'' **********In their joint statement, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan ''agreed to accelerate the work'' of the Geneva arms negotiators, who are seeking accords on strategic nuclear weapons, medium-range nuclear weapons and space weapons. The statement did not mention Soviet insistence that progress on nuclear missiles be linked to progress on space weapons, although Mr. Gorbachev reiterated the point at his news conference. **********In the balance of his presentation, Mr. Gorbachev sought to paint a positive and favorable image of the meeting. **********''I would assess the meeting as something that creates possibilities for moving ahead,'' he said. ''This makes it possible for me on leaving Geneva to look to the future with optimism.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev spoke with satisfaction of the decisions to exchange visits with Mr. Reagan, to ''expand the political dialogue'' and to hold more frequent consultations. He said the Soviet Union was looking to doing more business with American companies if relations improved. **********Talks 'Sharp' But 'Productive' **********Describing his exchanges with Mr. Reagan in their many hours of private meetings, Mr. Gorbachev said, ''Those meetings were frank, sharp, sometimes very sharp.'' **********''Still, it seemed to me, they were productive,'' the Soviet leader said. ''We found and believe that we did have something in common, a starting point for improved relations. And that is the understanding that nuclear war is inadmissible, that it should not be reached, that there is no winner in nuclear war.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's assessment seemed to betray a desire to put the best possible face on his most important foray into international affairs since taking office eight months ago. It seemed to reflect, too, a political need to give a sense of positive movement in foreign affairs as the Soviet Union prepares for the Communist Party congress opening in late February. **********From Substance to Process **********Even before Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan met this week, Soviet sources had talked of shifting the focus of the meeting away from concrete agreements to the start of a process of gradually improving relations. **********Mr. Gorbachev did not directly proclaim the meeting a success or failure, nor did he join Mr. Reagan in characterizing it as a ''fireside summit,'' an allusion to the fireplace in a pool house on the grounds of the chateau where the two leaders conferred Tuesday. **********The Soviet leader said the summit meeting had been ''too important an event to assess in simplistic terms.'' **********But even without concrete arms accords, he said, ''I feel bold enough to say that the world has become a safer place.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev offered no personal assessment of Mr. Reagan, except for the comment on the President's attachment to the missile defense program. But Mr. Gorbachev's opening statement often came across as a list of points he had made to Mr. Reagan. **********Several times, Mr. Gorbachev began by saying, ''I said to the President . . .'' or ''I tried to tell the President candidly . . .'' Mr. Gorbachev said the two men had agreed at the outset sessions to avoid the ''banalities'' that had marked the pre-summit maneuvering. **********Mr. Gorbachev became animated when he told how he tried to explain to Mr. Reagan that it was wrong to think that imposing an arms race on the Soviet Union would squeeze it economically. **********'We Are Not Simpletons' **********''I said to the President, bear in mind that we are not simpletons,'' he said. ''If the President was committed to that idea, then my task as Soviet leader was to disabuse him of it.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev was equally heated in arguing against the notion that America's advanced technology would give it an edge in shifting to space weapons. The program the Soviet Union would mount in response, he said, ''will be effective, though less expensive, and quicker to produce.'' **********Some experts expect to counter the United States' space-based defense program against ballistic missiles by deploying more missiles. **********Mr. Gorbachev seemed to disclose a previous unknown Soviet position regarding verification. If the United States were to halt its space-based defense program, he said, the Soviet Union would open its laboratories to inspection, and ''this would include international verification.'' **********The United States has often talked about verification as one of the major obstacles to arms agreements with the Soviet Union. **********The news conference was Mr. Gorbachev's second with the world press, and it lacked some of the novelty and drama of the one he gave in Paris last month. Only 300 reporters of the 3,117 accredited to the summit meeting could squeeze into the conference hall of the Soviet Mission - after being selected by Soviet officials - and in the context of the summit meeting, the questions did not carry the confrontational tone of those in Paris. ----Moscow's Allies Briefed PRAGUE, Nov. 21 (AP) - Mr. Gorbachev flew to Prague today to brief the other leaders of the Warsaw Pact countries on his meeting with President Reagan. The group then endorsed the talks as a cornerstone of improved United States-Soviet relations. **********The Czechoslovak Government press agency, in reporting on the Soviet bloc meeting, said: **********''The great importance of the Geneva meeting rests in the fact that it was the beginning of a dialogue aimed at achieving a turn to the better in Soviet-American relations and in the world in general.'' **********The agency said that the Soviet-bloc leaders ''expressed full support for the constructive stand taken by Mikhail Gorbachev during his talks with President Ronald Reagan.'' **********''It was unanimously noted that the direct and frank dialogue at the meeting had been necessary and that its results were useful,'' the agency added. ''On the whole, the results create more favorable possibilities for improving the international situation and for a return to detente. It is important for these possibilities be turned into practical deeds by the two sides.'' **********Nuclear War 'Inadmissible' **********While generally upbeat, the report noted the lack of agreement on arms issues, saying that the summit meeting ''failed to solve concrete problems of limitation and reduction of weapons.'' **********''Of fundamental importance is the joint statement on the inadmissability of nuclear war and on the two sides refraining from efforts to achieve military superiority,'' the report said. **********The meeting was attended by Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia, Erich Honecker of East Germany, Janos Kadar of Hungary, Gen.

The second round of talks is to open Thursday. **********''In practice the United States has no intention at all to reduce its nuclear arsenals,'' Pravda said. It said the United States' affirmations of its desire for arms reductions were ''total eyewash.'' [In Washington, a State Department spokesman had no comment in response to the Pravda editorial.]  Treaty Violations Denied Pravda denied accusations by Washington that Moscow is violating the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty, and said American space-weapons research was itself a violation of the treaty. ''The actions of the United States Administration are unlawful by their very essence,'' the editorial said. **********Calling the Pravda statements familiar, Western diplomats said the Soviet Union appeared to be laying down a hard line before the second round of talks in Geneva. **********They said the tough words did not rule out the possibility of new and more positive proposals by the Soviet Union at the negotiating table. But the editorial, printed today by the official press agency Tass in advance of publication scheduled for Monday, offered no public compromise on the harsh position Moscow has taken since the talks opened in March. **********The negotiations are broken into three sets of talks covering space weapons, strategic nuclear weapons and medium-range nuclear weapons. The Russians have made it clear that stopping the development of American space weapons is their first priority, while Washington has insisted on its right to carry out research in this area, under a program popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' Gorbachev Accuses U.S.  When the first round of talks ended April 23, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said that the United States, in its approach to space weapons, was breaking the agreement on which the talks were based and that it appeared that ''Washington does not seek agreement with the Soviet Union.'' **********Elaborating on this position, Pravda said, ''The crux of the matter is absolutely clear: an overt sabotage of studying and solving the question of preventing an arms race in space, an attempt to get through and legalize Washington's program of an accelerated militarization of outer space by any method.'' **********The American insistence on space-weapons research, it said, is ''clearly intended not only to make the limitation and reduction of nuclear arms impossible but also to impart a qualitatively new dimension to the entire arms race, to undermine totally the very idea of stability, equality and equal security.'' **********Pravda wrote, ''The United States cannot count on any whatsoever reduction by the Soviet Union of its return-strike nuclear arms while Washington is furthering its program of measures to 'render impotent' the Soviet nuclear arms in the hope of acquiring the ability to carry out aggression with impunity.'' **********European Nations Addressed **********In a remark clearly addressed to the European nations that Washington has asked to join in American space-weapons research, the newspaper said, ''Those who play up to the United States in this assume grave responsibility on themselves.'' **********It said Washington is seeking to scuttle the antiballistic missile treaty as part of its policy to ''destroy the very foundation on which the process of limiting and reducing nuclear arms rests.'' **********Denying American accusations that the Soviet Union has violated that accord, Pravda wrote, ''The Soviet Union has not and is not conducting any research or development work which would not fit within the framework of the ABM treaty.'' **********Summarizing the contents of the Geneva talks so far, Pravda said the United States had not offered any proposals that went beyond its positions in the separate talks on strategic and medium-range missiles that were broken off at the end of 1983. **********It said these proposals leave open the possibility for the United States to develop long-range cruise missiles, which it said would destabilize arms-control efforts. **********Scoffing at U.S. Position **********It dismissed American proposals that do not include British and French nuclear weapons in the balance of arms, saying, ''Obviously, this is not a basis for agreement.'' **********Pravda said the Soviet Union, for its part, offered a complete ban on development of space weapons and an agreement to destroy any such weapons already in existence. **********Moscow has offered radical reductions in strategic arms, accompanied by a proposal for stopping or strictly limiting the development of new weapons, Pravda said, and has proposed a mutual renunciation of cruise missiles in all basing modes. **********Pravda said Soviet negotiators had proposed a halt to deployment of new American medium-range missiles in Europe, accompanied by a halt to what it called Soviet countermeasures. This halt would be followed by a reduction in the weapons, it said. **********Soviet negotiators were also prepared to talk about a complete removal of both strategic and medium-range nuclear weapons from Europe, Pravda said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/02/business/internorth-stake-in-valero-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNORTH STAKE IN VALERO SYSTEM", "print_headline": "INTERNORTH STAKE IN VALERO SYSTEM", "body_text": " **********Internorth Inc., which is based in Omaha, bought half interest in the Valero Energy Corporation's west Texas natural gas pipeline system for 68 million, the two companied said yesterday.

He has rarely made public statements, has submitted to no press conferences, and has generally appeared to stay above the fray. **********President Francois Mitterrand in this sense has exemplified the distant and dignified style expected of a French President, particularly in a crisis. This one, the worst of his presidency, was brought about by the sinking the antinuclear protest ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand in July. **********But despite Mr. Mitterrand's cool and distant personal response to the crisis, there is virtually no question here that his standing and credibility as a leader have been dramatically affected by it, so much so that political figures say off the record that even the President's eventual resignation cannot be ruled out. **********Several Factors, All Bad **********Commentators are talking of several factors in the crisis, all of them bad for Mr. Mitterrand and his Prime Minister, Laurent Fabius. One is the appearance of a Government fumbling embarrassingly for a response as official accounts have crumbled before an onslaught of press revelations. **********On Sunday, Mr. Fabius took an action that was virtually unheard of in modern French history: He admitted, after more than two months of denials, that agents of the French intelligence service, acting under orders, had indeed sunk the Greenpeace vessel and that officials had tried to conceal the truth from Government investigators. **********A conspicuous element of the Greenpeace affair from the beginning is that neither the original operation nor even the Government's inept handling of it has created a strong negative reaction among the public. There have been no demonstrations, no petitions, no sense of outrage. The French overwhelmingly support the nuclear testing program that Greenpeace wanted to protest, and they seem to accept what would be called in the United States a ''dirty trick'' as an unfortunate necessity to protect the national interest. **********That background has formed much of Mr. Mitterrand's response to the affair. When he has spoken, it has been in terms of the French nation, its independence and strength. **********But several problems are shaking Mr. Mitterrand's position. One is that the disclosures, the steady leaking of secrets, have simply been humiliating. The reputation of the army has been affected, and while the French might not care if politicians are tarnished, the army is sacrosanct. **********In addition, the crisis may affect Mr. Mitterrand's medium-term survival in office. The Socialists face legislative elections in March that, if current trends persist, will be won by the rightist opposition, enabling it to form a government under Mr. Mitterrand. **********A victory by the opposition is so widely assumed in this country that even Mr. Mitterrand himself has publicly announced the formula by which he would share power with the right. But with the loss of prestige and authority that many believe Mr. Mitterrand has suffered, it will be far more difficult for him to resist demands that he relinquish his office if the Socialists lose control of Parliament. **********More Immediate Reaction **********Meanwhile, there is the more immediate reaction to the affair, particularly to Mr. Fabius's admission that French agents were ordered to blow up the Greenpeace vessel. **********One newspaper headline this morning, reporting on Mr. Fabius's admission, read, ''Who gave the order?'' And indeed, until satisfactory answers are provided on questions like that, suspicion will remain high among the public that something is being covered up, possibly the identities of officials high in the Government who knew in advance about the operation. **********In this sense, Greenpeace resembles Watergate, to which it is commonly compared here. To be sure, there is no judicial investigation, and no impeachment proceedings can be brought against the French President, who is almost entirely independent of Parliament. But as in Watergate, it is not the original act that poses the problem so much as the deterioriation of the credibility and reputation of Government leaders, who ultimately are responsible for what their subordinates do. **********New hints of a cover-up were widely reported in the French press today. Paul Quiles, the new Defense Minister, who is leading an investigation into the Greenpeace operation, is reported to have discovered that key documents on the affair were destroyed. **********Moreover, while there is no proof, many here, including some members of Mr. Mitterrand's own party, have concluded by inference that the operation must have extended into the highest councils of the Government. **********A parliamentary commission of inquiry into the affair, announced by Mr. Fabius on Sunday, will begin to look into the Greenpeace operation early next month, as soon as Parliament reconvenes. It will certainly look into press reports that Gen. Jean Saulnier, Mr. Mitterrand's personal military adviser at the time, had to have approved the release of funds for the operation. **********General Saulnier has denied the charge, and nobody has proved the press reports correct. But given the current mood, virtually any further disclosures of involvement by senior officials would lead to the conclusion that the Government either does not know what its personnel are doing or cannot control them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/14/business/business-gain-on-taxes-likely-in-reagan-plan.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1985-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS GAIN ON TAXES LIKELY IN REAGAN PLAN", "print_headline": "BUSINESS GAIN ON TAXES LIKELY IN REAGAN PLAN", "body_text": " **********The plan to revise the Federal income tax system that President Reagan intends to submit to Congress next week will probably be somewhat more favorable to business and less favorable to individuals than the proposal the Treasury Department presented last fall, Administration officials said today. **********The Treasury's proposal last November would reduce total taxes paid by individuals by 8.5 percent and raise corporate taxes by more than 35 percent. **********The officials said the President's plan, which is being designed to generate the same amount of revenue as the current tax law, would increase corporate taxes and reduce individuals' taxes, but not by so much as the November proposal. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that Mr. Reagan had told Treasury officials ''what he would go for and what he wouldn't go for.''

Baker 3d, and that a final plan might be adopted then. In any event, they said, all decisions are likely by Wednesday so the plan can be given a final run through the Treasury Department's computers and sent to the printer. **********Administration officials said they were not sure of the exact dimensions of the tax shift from individuals to corporations in the President's plan because final policy decisions had not been made. But they said what shift there was would result largely from an abolition of the investment tax credit, depreciation rules less favorable to business than the current law and a sizable increase in the personal exemption that individual taxpayers would be allowed for themselves and their dependents. **********On the other hand, they said that the depreciation rules would be more generous to business than those put forth by the Treasury in November and that the personal exemption would probably not be so large as the Treasury proposed. The current exemption is $1,040 for each person in a family.

But it oversees only trade in goods. **********Services, now estimated at up to a quarter of world trade, have no corresponding international pact that defines rules and procedures that govern their trade. For half a decade now, the United States has led efforts to fill this vacuum. But, at the November 1982 GATT interministerial meeting and again last month at an ad hoc senior ministers' meeting in Geneva, important developing countries led by Brazil and India adamantly opposed these initiatives. **********Now, with the GATT annual meeting scheduled for Nov. 25, it can only be hoped that a conciliatory atmosphere can be created. For the confrontation is unfortunate, souring relations just at a time when compromise seems possible. **********In recent years, the developing countries have abandoned impassioned rhetoric and confrontational tactics in favor of pragmatism. And the United States, as evidenced in the policy moves of the Treasury Secretary, James A. Baker 3d, at the I.M.F. and World Bank meeting in Seoul, South Korea, last month, has also taken a pragmatic, interventionist turn after years of ideologically inspired rigor mortis. But the atmosphere of confrontation threatens to push America, through ire and impatience, into opting yet again for bilateral and regional moves. **********Developing countries must therefore be brought on board in the negotiations on international transactions in services. How can this be done? **********The key lies in recognizing that our negotiating positions have unwittingly tended to press our advantages in services of interest to ourselves instead of seeking mutuality of interests within the broader service sector. To see how this has occurred, we need only to examine why the United States pressed the issue in the first place. **********One factor, with which few would quibble, is the economic philosophy of free trade, and the obvious logic that it should apply to transactions in services as well as goods. However, the major thrust has been supplied by interest groups lobbying for particular service sectors, first multinational banks and corporations in the new ''telematics'' sector (satellite data transmission), and later, companies providing insurance, accounting and other business services. **********These lobbies have buttressed their claims with arguments about the national interest, claiming that the nation's export advantages have shifted decisively to the service sector and away from manufacturing. They argue that it is unfair to open our markets to foreign goods while foreign markets are closed to our services. This is simply another instance of the increased demands for aggressive reciprocity. **********The legitimacy of these claims, while certainly debatable, is not the issue here. The concern is that, by attending to the squeakiest wheels, the Administration has focused its energies mainly on those service sectors where we have the exporting edge. Conveniently omitted are those areas, such as construction, where our service businesses might face stiff competition from foreign businesses. **********We have therefore encouraged the notion that service trade is for our export benefit, and trade in goods is for that of the developing countries. Thus, our concessions on trade in manufactured goods with developing countries have become a quid pro quo for their concessions on trade in services. MANY developing countries find these aspects of our position unfair. If service negotiations are going to reflect the export interest of the developed countries, what do they get? We have suggested offering ''rollbacks'' on VER's (voluntary export restrictions) and ''standstills'' on new protection on goods of interest to developing countries. **********But the developing countries correctly see all recent and threatened trade barriers on goods as de facto violations of GATT obligations anyway. Rollbacks and standstills are seen, therefore, not as concessions, but as compliance with existing GATT obligations. In short, since services are a new area not contemplated in the original GATT protocol, the developing countries think they are being offered a raw deal: an unrequited concession on services masquerading as a quid pro quo agreement! **********We must recognize the legitimacy of this view and look for service sectors where the developing countries have the export edge. The quid pro quo must be sought within the service sector itself. Among the most obvious services in which many developing countries have recently acquired a trading advantage is construction. **********South Korea, India, the Philippines, Egypt, Pakistan and a growing number of developing countries are already waiting to do in the developed countries what they have been doing in the Middle East: building highways, hospitals, schools and playgrounds, using skilled and unskilled labor from home. **********Conceptually these are indeed services, and international transactions in them cannot legitimately be excluded from a services compact. Willingness to include them, and related transactions, in the negotiations that we seek would help convince the developing countries that the emerging discussion of the rules will be even-handed. **********Since we would face obvious difficulties in moving to a free market in services such as construction, this role reversal would also make us more sensitive to the serious difficulties that the developing countries have in opening their markets, fast and fully, to services in which we have the export advantage. These also require special handling. **********Other service sectors require special handling. Banking raises issues of fiduciary and monetary control. Several countries, therefore, have extensive, often excessive, regulation, extending, as in France and India, to substantial nationalization. In tele-matics, there is widespread fear of losing political control over a highly strategic sector of technology that promises increasingly to define economic and social evolution and thus to shape national destiny. These are sectors that independent-minded countries will not leave to the marketplace. The analogy has to be partly with armaments negotiations: We would not expect nation states to let market forces determine the location of defense production. **********We cannot realistically expect that such service sectors can be brought altogether under a GATT-type ''rule of law'' trade regime. ''Who gets what,'' not just ''What rules do we play by,'' becomes a critical question. **********A significant reduction of our demands here, as we simultaneously extend the proposed pact to services like construction, is necessary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/world/india-and-pakistan-differ-over-us-mission.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1985-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIA AND PAKISTAN DIFFER OVER U.S. MISSION", "print_headline": "INDIA AND PAKISTAN DIFFER OVER U.S. MISSION", "body_text": " **********A United States mission to India and Pakistan this week was praised in Pakistan but criticized in India for suggesting the two nations undertake ''regional initiatives'' to avert a nuclear arms race on the subcontinent. **********A United States official called the four-day visit a success and said it signaled further involvement by Washington in encouraging discussions between India and Pakistan, particularly on each country's fears of the other's nuclear program. **********The official said the next step in reducing tensions could come at a possible meeting between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India and President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan at the United Nations in October. **********''This process is going to take a long time,'' the United States official said in Islamabad Thursday, the last day of the visit.

Atop the building, a Marine guard in olive fatigues peered over a concrete wall as the chants echoed through the shady parking lot. **********The protests are common here, up to three times a week in recent months, and are a sign of the United States Government's unpopularity with the Nicaraguan Government and the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front. **********The peaceful demonstrations are little more than a nuisance to embassy personnel, who often are dismissed early when a demonstration is expected and are denied entry or exit while it is under way. But the protests also are a symbol of the growing split between the two nations. **********A Widening Rift **********The rift widened on Jan. 18, when the Reagan Administration, citing a lack of progress, announced it had suspended direct negotiations with Nicaragua. The same day, the United States also said it would not take part in further proceedings before the International Court of Justice about the mining of Nicaragua's harbors. **********Meanwhile, the Sandinistas' attempts to convince the Nicaraguan people of the damage caused by American policies seem to be having an effect. **********''They are all spies inside. They are the enemies of Nicaragua,'' said Jose Santos Gonzalez, a worker who walked by the embassy on his way home. **********For Ana Ciesa, the answer was also clear. Her son was kidnapped by the ''contras,'' as the rebels supported by the United States are known here. **********''The people inside are the same as the rebels fighting up in the mountains,'' she said, pointing at the embassy. ''They are in agreement with the rebels.'' **********Accusations in 1983 **********A Sandinista party official who deals with the United States asserted that intelligence gathering went on at the embassy because of the unrestricted freedom embassy officials have. But, he added, ''they'd be crazy'' to run covert operations from the embassy. **********The only major diplomatic incident occurred in June 1983 when the Sandinistas expelled three United States diplomats for purportedly plotting to kill Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto Brockman. The United States denied the charges and retaliated by closing six Nicaraguan consulates in the United States and expelling 21 consular officers. **********The Sandinista official said that most of the embassy personnel here were simply professionals doing their job. He said, however, that Ambassador Harry E. Berghold had isolated himself from the Nicaraguan Government and that there seemed to be more hostility toward Nicaragua on the part of the embassy's middle level officials. **********Less Contact **********''We haven't changed our attitudes. Ambassador Quainton used to see the 'comandantes,' so it is the embassy that has changed,'' the official said, referring to former Ambassador Anthony Quainton, who was ambassador here earlier in the Reagan Administration, and to the nine-member national directorate that leads the Sandinistas. **********The embassy does appear to be having less contact with high-ranking Government officials, including the recently-elected President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra. **********One person familiar with the embassy complained that no Warsaw Pact country restricted access to Government officials as much as Nicaragua does. The same person said that Ambassador Berghold did not have direct contact with the nine commanders of the Sandinista National Directorate, and that no other embassy officer did either. **********A Western diplomat said that there were no other restrictions on the movement of embassy personnel. The diplomat added that the embassy's telephones ''are probably tapped'' and that those who the diplomats have contact with are under surveillance. **********Opposition Said to Be Harassed **********Another person who follows embassy functions said that there was no evidence that people who met with United States Embassy officers were being harassed specifically for their contact with Americans. **********''They're being harassed anyway,'' the person close to the embassy said, pointing out that the embassy has had contact with opposition politicians. **********The embassy does not have any restrictions on what is called ''fraternization'' with the local population, a common regulation in United States embassies in Eastern Europe. But there is a growing sentiment in the embassy that such a policy may be needed if Nicaragua's Government continues to become like those of Eastern Europe. **********''There have been several cases of social penetration,'' one Western diplomat said, referring to attempts to get information from United States Embassy personnel. ''But it's not as bad as it could be.'' **********The Western diplomat added, ''The down side of a 'no-frat' policy is it closes off a lot of contacts, but you come to a point where your intelligence vulnerability is so high, you have no choice.'' **********Anti-U.S. Feeling Reported Low **********Another person close to the embassy insisted that anti-American sentiment among the Nicaraguan people was very low. **********''It relieves some of the psychological pressure'' on the Americans to know that ''the reaction to embassy personnel is very warm,'' said the person familiar with the embassy. ''The devil image just doesn't take hold.'' **********At the end of 1984, the United States Embassy here had a staff of only about 45 officers. Large United States Agency for International Development programs were phased out early in the Reagan Administration, and the embassy staff now is smaller than it was during the rule of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was ousted when the Sandinistas came to power after an insurrection in 1979. **********Embassy personnel receive a 20 percent bonus with their salary as hardship payment, and they are only required to serve two years, instead of the normal three to four years. **********Paid Rest Trips **********Those serving in the post also get one paid rest-and-recreation trip. The Bahamas is the designated location for such trips, but most people take the equivalent air fare and visit the United States. **********The embassy is a rundown, emergency housing unit that was built after the earthquake that struck Managua in 1972, and it was only meant to serve for 10 years. **********One person who knows the state of the building said that it ''passed its projected useful life two years ago and it shows. You could kick your way right through from one side to the other.'' **********There are no speed bumps or barricades in front of the embassy, only the iron gate with the barbs and two or three Sandinista policemen in a kiosk out front. **********''However, we probably are safer here than other places,'' said another Western diplomat.

That is nearly 9 percent ahead of the 1984 pace that led to a record $123.3 billion total for the year. **********The February deficit was $11.4 billion and analysts said the March decline probably was a one-time thing. Many of them are expecting deficits of $12 billion or more a month for the rest of the year. **********Imports rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $29.5 billion in March, while exports rose 3.3 percent, to $18.4 billion. These figures are rounded off. **********Exports of aircraft parts and other manufactured equipment rose enough to offset a 13.6 percent decline in sales of agricultural commodities. **********The rise in imports came from purchases of telecommunications equipment, industrial machinery, shoes, clothing and inorganic chemicals. But the value of petroleum imports and of imported cars both fell by 16.8 percent. **********Influence of Oil **********Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said refineries delayed buying oil in March because they thought, incorrectly, that the price would drop to about $25 a barrel in April. Mr. Evans said that as a result, oil refineries had to buy heavily in April. **********Mr. Evans also noted that imports of Japanese cars fell in March because that was the last month of an expiring quota agreement and many manufacturers were at or near their assigned ceiling. Higher quotas went into effect on April 1, suggesting a big jump when updated auto import figures are available. **********The trade deficit, although not a new development, is drawing increasing attention as the economy appears to be weakening. First-quarter growth, as measured by the gross national product, was at an annual rate of 1.3 percent, the weakest level in more than two years. Economists say the trade deficit is sapping about three percentage points from the economic growth. **********Rob Wescott of Wharton Econometrics, a private forecaster in Philadelphia, said that last year, when the G.N.P. grew 6.8 percent, the trade deficit ''probably was the difference between an overheated economy and one that wasn't overheated.'' **********''Now we may be getting to the point where it is the difference between good, strong growth and lackluster performance,'' Mr. Wescott said. **********He said Wharton economists are now talking about G.N.P. growth for 1985 in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent instead of the 3 percent to 4 percent they were forecasting earlier. Another forecaster, Chase Econometrics, recently revised its 1985 growth estimate to 2.9 percent, from 3.4 percent. **********As usual, the biggest deficit was in trade with Japan, but the $3.2 billion March imbalance was down from a $4.2 billion February deficit.

Yurchenko, the purported Soviet defector who returned to his homeland last week in a blaze of publicity, has again raised the question of whether ''lie detectors'' can verify the truthfulness of a trained intelligence agent. **********Some officials of the Reagan Administration have said that Mr. Yurchenko passed a battery of lie-detector tests when he first defected and additional tests during the course of his three months of interrogation by the Central Intelligence Agency. **********That could mean that Mr. Yurchenko was telling the truth to his American interrogators, that he was a genuine defector who provided valid information to his interrogators and only later changed his mind. **********But several leading experts on polygraphs, or lie-detectors, said in interviews this week that an intelligence agent can easily be trained to fool the polygraph examiners. One leading academic expert also asserted that the examiners for the C.I.A. are considered the least competent in the Federal Government, although another expert described them as ''very good.'' **********Thumbscrews 'Work Better' **********Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told the Women's Democratic National Club here today that lie detectors can be used as one investigative tool but that it is a mistake to rely on them too heavily. ''It sure as heck didn't do much good in the Yurchenko case,'' he said. ''I personally like thumbscrews. They work far, far better.'' **********Defense Department polygraph experts contended in a report issued last year that the polygraph has proved ''extremely useful in intelligence and counterintelligence operations'' and has helped uncover many espionage attempts over the years. **********A C.I.A. spokesman said the agency would not comment on whether polygraphs were used during the interrogation of Mr. Yurchenko and, if so, how they were used. A Pentagon spokesman said that polygraph experts in the Defense Department declined to comment on the value of polygraphs in such cases because they had played no part in the examination of Mr. Yurchenko. **********The dispute over whether lie detectors can be used effectively in intelligence inquiries is part of a much broader debate about the value of lie detectors in interrogating a wide range of subjects, including suspects in criminal investigations, witnesses in legal proceedings and applicants for sensitive jobs. There is little consensus among the handful of experts in the field. Some say that lie detectors do little better than a coin flip at determining who is lying; others claim accuracy rates as high as 99 percent. 'Horror Stories' Ignored?  David T. Lykken, professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, a strong critic of the tests, called such anecdotal evidence ''essentially meaningless'' because it emphasizes the success stories and ignores any ''horror stories'' where the polygraph may have failed. He said the polygraph may actually induce a ''false sense of confidence'' that allows some trained agents who pass it to operate undisturbed. **********But experts on both sides of the debate agree that polygraph examinations of intelligence agents pose particular difficulties because the agents can be trained to fool the testers, and there is often very little independent evidence available to the testers to help verify whether the agent is answering truthfully. **********''I'm a proponent of polygraph techniques,'' said David C. Raskin, professor of psychology at the University ot Utah, who has consulted for Federal agencies on lie-detector usage. ''I think they're effective when used properly, especially in criminal cases. But when you talk of intelligence and national security, you're talking of a sophisticated group that can be given substantial training. A large proportion of people can be trained to beat the test in the laboratory.'' **********The possibility that an agent can learn to ''beat'' the test arises from the nature of the polygraph machine and of the questions administered by the examiners. **********Machine Can't Detect Lies **********The machine does not literally detect lies. Instead, it measures such physiological changes as breathing, blood pressure and skin conduction caused by sweating that occur while an individual is being asked questions. The assumption is that when an individual lies his breathing quickens, his blood pressure rises and his fingers start to sweat. In short, he gives himself away with guilty reactions. **********The examiner compares the individual's responses to the important questions with his response to irrelevant questions, or questions for which the answers are already known. If the physiological response to the important questions is greater, the examiner concludes that the subject was lying. **********Dr. Raskin cited studies he conducted with two researchers indicating that, in laboratory experiments, many people can be trained to beat the tests. Individuals participating in the continuing studies were typically given a half hour of instruction in how to recognize the control questions and were advised to bite their tongues, or press their toes against the floor, or perform complicated mental tasks the minute the control questions were asked. That had the effect of increasing their physiological responses to the control questions, making it unlikely that any lies they told would evoke a greater response than the control questions did. **********''A large proportion of these people, very close to 50 percent, were able to beat the test,'' Dr. Raskin said. He added that Federal polygraph examiners who consistently dismiss the likelihood that countermeasures can defeat the tests are ''operating on faith and folklore'' and exhibiting ''Neanderthal attitudes.'' **********Frustrating the Cheaters **********There is some evidence that additional sensors might frustrate efforts to beat the tests, Dr. Raskin said. He noted that one study, conducted primarily by Charles R. Honts, a graduate student, found that electromyographic recorders attached near the jaw and calf muscles could detect 90 percent of those who bit their tongues or pressed their toes down to frustrate the polygraph. ''So we took one step forward after two big steps backward,'' he said. **********Experts outside the Government doubt that Federal polygraph examiners employ such additional sensors and some say that sensors would have difficulty picking up mental calculations or the contraction of hidden muscles. **********Leonard Saxe, associate professor of psychology at Boston University, who was the principal author of a 1983 technical report on polygraph validity issued by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, said today that he was dubious about the accuracy of polygraphs in general. He said he ''would be amazed if it were a useful technique'' for interrogating a spy like Mr. Yurchenko, who could have been given extensive training in how to take the tests, including the use of biofeedback techniques to reduce the reaction to important questions or increase the reaction to control questions. **********The extent of such training in the Soviet Union is not known, but American intelligence officials say that Americans who have spied for the Soviet Union have been given training in how to defeat the polygraph. **********Gordon Barland, a polygraph consultant from Utah who has done research for both the Defense and Justice departments, said today that a wide range of countermeasures can be used in an effort to reduce reactions to the critical questions, including drugs, self-hypnosis and merely thinking relaxing thoughts, and that physical movements can boost reactions to the control questions. He called it ''very hard to generalize about their effectiveness'' because ''there is not a lot of research in this area.'' But if Mr. Yurchenko were sent here on a premeditated mission, Dr. . Barland said, then the Soviets ''might have given him some tips that might help'' defeat the examiners. **********It has not been revealed who administered the polygraphs to Mr. Yurchenko, but if it was the C.I.A., opinions are mixed on the agency's competence. Dr. Raskin charged that the C.I.A.'s examiners have ''an extremely bad reputation'' among their colleagues in the Government and are probably ''the least well trained'' in the government because they attend their own school and not the Government's leading polygraph school. But Dr. Barland said he believes the C.I.A. examiners are ''very good'' and are ''generally held in high regard'' by other Federal agencies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/16/business/industry-output-during-july-up-a-meager-0.2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 773, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDUSTRY OUTPUT DURING JULY UP A MEAGER 0.2%", "print_headline": "INDUSTRY OUTPUT DURING JULY UP A MEAGER 0.2%", "body_text": " **********Production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a meager two-tenths of 1 percent last month as the economy displayed little evidence of the second-half rebound predicted by the Reagan Administration and most private analysts. **********''The anemic rise in industrial production continues to reflect a yearlong stagnation in industrial activity, with no meaningful signs of pickup,'' said Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. **********Consumer Debt Figures **********Today's report, compiled by the Federal Reserve, follows various other recent lackluster or worrisome figures for automobile sales, retail sales, business inventories and employment. The Federal Reserve also said today that consumer installment debt climbed $6.79 billion in June, well under May's $9.04 billion and the smallest gain this year. **********Although summer is often a time of desultory activity, some analysts fear that these indicators showing feeble sales and swelling inventories may reflect overstretched consumers who have decided to curb their spending. Home sales have not responded as well to lower interest rates as many expected and auto makers have begun to revive cut-rate financing plans. **********Nonetheless, some economists found a measure of consolation in the output report, noting that it showed at least some growth for the seventh straight month. The Federal Reserve also revised its industrial production figures upward for May and June, to two-tenths of 1 percent and three-tenths of 1 percent, respectively. Output for both months had previously shown an advance of one-tenth of 1 percent. **********Economists said they were particularly encouraged by the three-tenths of 1 percent gain for manufacturing, the biggest since March, reflecting increased automobile production. **********Michael P. Daly, an economist for the Cigna Corporation, a leading insurance company based in Hartford, said, ''It appears the productive sector of the economy is coming back into line.'' The manufacturing component of the industrial production index now stands 1.7 percent above its level of July 1984. **********Record Trade Deficits **********The nation's trade deficit, which is expected by many to show another record amount this year that could reach $150 billion, has been a major factor in depressing American industry. Attractively priced imported goods have been substituted for those that would otherwise have been produced in this country. **********The Reagan Administration, which previously reduced its forecast for the 1985 gross national product to an increase of 3.1 percent, from 4 percent, said today's industrial production report was ''good news'' that ''will allow the economy to continue moving forward at a steady pace without the danger of drastically increasing prices.'' **********Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office predicted today that the G.N.P., which measures the total value of all goods and services, would rise by just 2.6 percent this year and that unemployment would remain at current levels. **********Lawrence Chimerine, head of Chase Econometrics, said, ''We are still mired in this almost flat or very slow-growth economy period we have been in since early last summer.'' **********Decline in Dollar **********Some economists said, however, that industry would soon begin to benefit from the 15 percent decline in the dollar that has occurred over the past six months. If American demand stops ''leaking'' overseas, they said, it will flow into the hands of domestic producers instead. **********On the other hand, the Fed's data showed that automobile output, which climbed 1.2 percent in July, accounted for virtually all the gain in the industrial production index for the month. Since recent sales reports have been poor, auto production could be cut back in coming months, dampening overall economic activity. **********A strike by car haulers, which was resolved this week, was said to have only begun to take a toll on sales. **********Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 8.3 million vehicles last month, up from 8 million in June. **********Business Equipment Off **********Production of business equipment, for both construction and factories, was down three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same decline posted by the previously buoyant military and space component. **********The other market groupings all gained, with output of consumer durable goods rising six-tenths of 1 percent. **********Output at the nation's mines edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, less than in May and June, while electric and gas utilities showed a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve reported. **********This was the second straight sizable decline for utilities, apparently reflecting less than normal demands for air-conditioning. **********The overall industrial production index now stands at 124.9, 1.4 percent higher than in July 1984.

The Dow Jones industrials sailed over the 1,500 barrier this week, with frenetic trading given an extra lift by the news that the General Electric Company had agreed to acquire the RCA Corporation for nearly $6.3 billion, which would make it the biggest industrial takeover to date outside the oil industry. **********But, as the overall stock averages boomed, oil stocks sagged over reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might get into a price-cutting war with non-OPEC producers. The OPEC marker price of $28 a barrel was already crumbling. The stock market was exhilarated by expectations of a continuing fall in oil prices, seen as a harbinger of continuing low inflation. **********The market's excitement about oil was intensified by a Texas trial judge's decision upholding a jury's $10.53 billion verdict against Texaco Inc. for luring the Getty Oil Company away from a merger with the Pennzoil Company two years ago. With the meter ticking away, adding interest charges to the all-time record award, Texaco now owes an extra half-billion just since Jan. 5. This raises the total tab to $11.12 billion, enough to threaten the company with bankruptcy. **********The hot activity in mergers and acquisitions, along with corporate buybacks of stock, is helping to push the overall averages up by putting a lot more money into the hands of investors and, simultaneously, by reducing the availability of equities to them. Since the start of the year there has been an estimated reduction of 13 percent, or $150 billion, in available equities. **********The market has also been spurred by the drop in interest rates - and expectations that rates will continue to decline. Low inflation, slow economic growth and a more liberal Federal Reserve monetary policy have combined to push rates down. Three-month Treasury bills, which averaged 9.58 percent last year, have dropped to 7.07 percent. Long-term rates, which were slower to decline, have fallen faster in recent months. The yield on corporate AAA bonds, which averaged 12.71 percent in 1984, have come down to 10.4 percent. **********Expectations that interest rates will not rebound upward rest largely on the belief that the Fed, with the strong support of the Treasury, will be trying to hold the dollar down and indeed to cut its value further against the Japanese yen and the West German mark, to reduce the United States trade deficit, running this year at about $150 billion. **********The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve also want lower rates to avoid aggravating the debt crisis of third world countries and the threat to the United States and other Western banks that have lent them $630 billion, according to the latest World Bank estimate. The plight of American farmers further increases pressure on the Government to hold down interest rates and cut the overvaluation of the dollar. **********The peril to the financial system that would result from a collapse of the enormous burden of foreign and domestic debt has made the risks of allowing the United States economy to slide into recession ''unacceptable,'' in the jargon of Government officials. **********But may the unacceptable have to be accepted in the coming year? Not many economists expect recession now. The consensus of 50 leading economists, just reported by Blue Chip Indicators, is that the American economy will rise 3.1 percent in 1986, up slightly from 2.5 percent this year. However, uncertainty about the outlook is reflected in the widest spread among the forecasters on record, with the highest 10 predicting a 4.3 percent gain next year and the lowest 10 an advance of only 1.7 percent. Six of the 50 economists are forecasting that a recession will start next year. Many businessmen, in private conversations, express concern about a weaker economy in 1986. **********One riddle is what Federal budget policy will do to the business outlook, now that Congress has passed and the President has signed the Gramm-Rudman bill calling for a balanced budget by 1991. The stock market is still taking the cheerful view that Gramm-Rudman, by cutting the deficit, will ease the dilemma of the Federal Reserve and improve the outlook for interest rates. But uncertainty persists over what Gramm-Rudman will actually do to the deficit, given conflicts between President Reagan and Congress on military spending, cuts in social programs and tax increases. And some economists remain concerned that mandated budget cuts will hit a weakened economy and help push it into recession. If the economy is weaker than the Administration has assumed next year, the budget deficit would be bigger and the necessary Gramm-Rudman cuts would be steeper. **********Despite such doubts, the stock market remains feverishly hopeful, convinced that lower interest rates resulting from the new mixture of easier monetary policy and tighter fiscal policy will keep the market rising and the economy expanding. The stock market boom could well go on for a while, but - as another piece of Wall Street wisdom puts it -the tree does not grow to the sky."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/20/world/around-the-world-peace-group-to-confront-france-at-test-site.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Peace Group to Confront France at Test Site", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Peace Group to Confront France at Test Site", "body_text": " **********A spokesman for Greenpeace said today that the environmental group would go ahead with its campaign against French nuclear tests in the Pacific despite orders by President Francois Mitterrand authorizing the use of force against its ''peace flotilla.'' **********''This makes no difference at all,'' David McTaggart, chairman of the group, said of Mr. Mitterrand's directive to the armed forces to keep intruders out of French territorial waters and air space around Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls. **********Defense officials said the directive was a public restatement of a permanent ban on unauthorized vessels penetrating a limit of 12 nautical miles round the atolls. **********Greenpeace said that during its past campaigns in the Pacific the French navy had violated international law by boarding its vessels outside the 12-mile limit but within a 60-mile ''security zone'' outside territorial waters that is considered a warning zone for shipping."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/17/world/president-issues-a-veiled-warning.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1985-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESIDENT ISSUES A VEILED WARNING", "print_headline": "PRESIDENT ISSUES A VEILED WARNING", "body_text": " **********President Reagan today warned Moslem Shiite hijackers ''for their own safety'' to free the American hostages on a Trans World Airlines jet in Beirut as well as the passengers removed Friday night to an undisclosed location. **********Mr. Reagan, who met this afternoon with advisers, also affirmed the United States policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists. **********''This has always been a position of ours,'' said Mr. Reagan, who returned early from a weekend at Camp David, Md., to confer with aides. **********At Least 40 Hostages **********The hijackers have killed one passenger and are holding at least 40 Americans hostage in Lebanon. **********''I think that we're going to continue doing the things that we're doing,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''and just hope that they themselves will see that - for their own safety - that they'd better turn these people loose.'' **********In Jerusalem, a source said Israel would consider a possible request from the United States to meet the hijackers' demand that about 700 Shiites be freed in exchange for the release of the hostages.

Such a step had been suggested by a top Administration advisory group, but the option was dropped before the plan was sent to President Reagan this morning, according to a senior official. **********Word of the ''line of credit,'' a phrase that might imply direct access to Treasury funds, was disclosed by some officials on Tuesday on the eve of a sale of Farm Credit System bonds. In his presentation to the subcommittee, Frank W. Naylor Jr., the Under Secretary of Agriculture, outlined a more restrictive approach. **********Two Conditions **********He said the Administration would ''assess the need for Federal financial assistance'' only if Congress first agrees to approve two other measures. **********One is to authorize an existing entity within the Farm Credit System to use surpluses that have occurred in some parts of the system to absorb operating losses elsewhere. The other is to convert the Farm Credit Administration, now a nominal supervisor, into a genuine financial regulator with expanded enforcement powers. **********''When that gets done, then we'll think about'' such other measures as a credit line, asserted another Administration official. **********The Administration, which has doggedly resisted requests for financial aid to the system, appeared to be ready to give in earlier this week when its Economic Policy Group drew up a statement about the farm system. The Cabinet-level group includes Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Agriculture Secretary John R. Block, who were reported to have supported the line-of-credit proposal. But a White House official said today that that provision was only an option. **********According to the official, the proposal was dropped before the policy statement reached President Reagan, who approved the statement just before Mr. Naylor appeared before the House subcommittee. **********The statement ''was fine-tuned, that's all'' just before it went before Reagan, said an Administration source, denying that either Mr. Reagan or his top advisers had changed their minds about the credit line. **********Various officials said a Government bailout of the Farm Credit System would represent an invitation to other sectors of the economy to seek aid. **********Complaints From Congress **********The decision not to provide the credit line immediately brought complaints from Congress and appeared to adversely affect trading in outstanding Farm Credit securities on Wall Street. **********A $1.25 billion issue of six-month bonds that the system marketed Wednesday at a yield 84/100ths of a percentage point higher than six-month Treasury bills traded today at a spread of about 95/100ths of a point, Wall Street specialists said.

Washington's decision to delay transfer of the economic support funds was made nearly two months ago, the officials said. The Sudan uses this kind of aid for such purposes as commodity imports and payments on international debts. **********The decision to freeze the aid was not lightly arrived at by Washington, the officials said. According to one aide at the State Department, some policy makers had argued that the Sudan was so important to American interests in Africa that the aid should continue no matter what international financial condition Khartoum found itself in. **********Much of the Sudan's importance to the West lies in its strategic position, touching Libya, Egypt, the Red Sea and Ethiopia in the north and east, and Zaire and Kenya in the south. The country is also considered vital because it shares the United States view of the Middle East and Africa and favors cooperation with American military forces in the region. **********The official said consideration had been given to what might happen to President Nimeiry, if, without economic aid from this country, the Sudan could not import oil or pay its military officers. **********''The conclusion is obvious: If Nimeiry doesn't solve his problems, Nimeiry will not be around,'' the official said. **********'Couldn't Bail Them Out' **********''But the numbers just don't add up,'' he added. ''We could spend every penny that is available to us and we still couldn't bail them out.'' **********Officials here said that if the Sudan could not reschedule its international debt through the I.M.F., the debt to the United States would reach a level that would automatically put in force a legal requirement for a total cutoff in aid. **********The spokesman for the I.M.F. said that the Sudan ''has to come up with some sort of plan to get overdue payments'' to its creditors, including international lending institutions, governments and commercial lenders, ''taken care of.'' **********''When that is possible,'' he said, ''we can begin to talk about a new financial and economic program involving possible new credits from the I.M.F.'' **********Political Problems Noted **********In the meantime, however, the country has ''enormous problems'' to overcome, including the economic and political impact of President Nimeiry's program for the ''Islamization'' of the country, the spokesman said. **********Although Washington's economic support funds have been frozen, President Reagan's budget requested $115 million in such funds as part of a total aid package of $254 million for Sudan in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. **********A recent report by the State Department to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that while the Sudan had considerable potential for development, ''overambitious Government development plans throughout much of the 1970's, combined with poor financial management, created staggering international debt obligations.'' **********''The country's financial situation will remain problematic for years to come,'' it said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/25/business/1985-tax-overhaul-unlikely-says-dole.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1985-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 805, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "1985 TAX OVERHAUL UNLIKELY, SAYS DOLE", "print_headline": "1985 TAX OVERHAUL UNLIKELY, SAYS DOLE", "body_text": " **********The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, said today that he does not expect Congress to approve a major overhaul of the tax system this year. **********''I think it's a great idea, a good concept,'' the Kansas Republican said. ''But let's be realistic. I don't think so. It seems to many of us in Congress - while we may like the idea, the concept, of tax simplification - that we better move first on deficit reduction.'' **********In his remarks today, Senator Dole emphasized economic and political reasons to shrink the Federal budget deficit, especially for Republican Senators who face re-election next year. ''We are serious about it, we believe it is good policy and we believe it's good politics,'' he said. ''The 22 Republicans up in 1986 believe we ought to do it, get it behind us and move on to something else.'' **********Remarks by Dole and Baker **********His comments came the day after Treasury Secretary-designate James A.

''I feel strongly the number one priority, which is way ahead of the number two priority, is these budget deficits,'' Mr. Chafee said in an interview. ''Maybe if we have some energy left over we would deal with tax simplification.'' **********Goldwater Offers Comment **********Meanwhile, Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, said the country would have to consider an increase in tax rates as part of a program to reduce the deficit and avoid ''national bankruptcy.'' **********Republican leaders from the House and the Senate met later at lunch to discuss several issues, including a deficit-reduction package in the Senate that would cut Federal spending by at least $50 billion in 1986. **********Afterward, Senator Dole and Representative Robert H. Michel, the Illinois Republican who is the House minority leader, said that they would cooperate but that the Senate would take the lead in formulating a deficit- reduction plan. **********The Senate effort has run into difficulty because of Republican objections to a freeze in the military budget. House Republican leaders also oppose a freeze in the cost-of-living increase for Social Security. **********Issue of Military Spending **********Underscoring the tension, Senator Dole today emphasized the importance of including military savings in any deficit-reduction package. ''A number of solid conservative Republican Senators tell me straight out unless defense is on the table, forget it,'' he told business leaders at the Chamber of Commerce breakfast. **********In a statement released from New York, where he went to attend a fund- raising event, Senator Bob Packwood, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said ''I don't know yet'' about the chances for a tax overhaul. ''Spending cuts will come first,'' the Oregon Republican added. ''After that it depends how much Jim Baker is willing to lobby for tax reform.'' **********At the White House, however, there appears to be an effort to grasp tax overhaul as a major issue that, in the long run, would be politically appealing and would help define the Republican Party as the party of the middle class. **********House Conservatives' View **********Later, several conservative Republicans in the House, including Jack Kemp of upstate New York and Newt Gingrich of Georgia, urged President Reagan ''to reject the counsel that deficit reduction should be the top priority of the new Congress.'' **********In a letter to the President, these Republicans said they would not ''support any further social spending cuts'' until the White House presents a tax-overhaul plan to Congress. **********One White House official said today that the President ''is absolutely hopeful it could come up this session.'' **********Administration officials also said the President plans to meet next week with Republicans from the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee ''to indicate that tax reform is a top priority.'' **********Speech by Arizona Senator **********Senator Goldwater's remarks were made in a statement prepared for delivery in the Senate.

Aging industrial slums and dilapidated residential neighborhoods had a choke-hold on inner cities, discouraging development. And much of corporate America, complaining about crime and the poorly educated urban labor force, fled to the lush greenery and superior schools of the suburbs. **********Manhattan's downtown financial district was as battered by these forces as most others. But now, major corporations like Merrill Lynch, American Express and Dow Jones, will soon begin moving into Battery Park City, the bold renewal project that is adding a new dimension to Wall Street. The phoenix-like rising of their collective new home is demonstrating that predictions of lower Manhattan's demise were unduly hasty - like forecasts for other downtowns across the nation. **********From Boston's ''combat zone'' to San **********Diego's Horton Center, through Chicago's Loop and Baltimore's Charles Center area, the bulldozing and rebuilding of old downtown areas are proceeding at a torrid pace. **********Office Network, a Houston-based real estate consulting firm, reports record downtown office construction: More than 177 million square feet of space, or the equivalent of nearly 20 World Trade Centers, are rising in the country's 24 largest markets. To be sure, some developers worry about the overbuilding that has already inflated vacancy rates in Denver, Miami, Phoenix and elsewhere. But promoters say that the new downtown projects, if built on strong financial underpinning and accompanied by an upgrading of services, may well prove to be the salvation of the nation's old cities. **********Battery Park City, in the shadow of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, is perhaps the country's most ambitious multi-use urban project. Conceived in the late 1960's by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and a pet project of his three successors, it is a complex of residential and commercial buildings built on 92 acres of landfill skirting the Hudson River. When it is completed in the next decade, its price tag is likely to be between $3 billion and $4 billion. **********Its commercial space, the World Financial Center, will house 30,000 office workers, with the first tenants scheduled to move in next month. Fueled by sharp growth in the financial services industry, which has created thousands of new jobs on Wall Street and stimulated demand for larger quarters, the World Financial Center's four glass and granite-sheathed skyscrapers are already 90 percent spoken for. **********On the residential side, Battery Park City's 14,000 apartments and condominums will become home to 30,000 residents. The 1,700 apartments already constructed are all rented, with many tenants drawn by the lure of working and living downtown. **********But trying to fill the World Financial Center has taxed the marketing and financial savvy of its sponsor, Olympia & York, the world's largest privately held real estate developer. **********In a tricky environment of climbing commercial vacancies and uncertain interest rates, the Toronto-based company now has a huge inventory of unrented space in older, downtown buildings in New York City. The company was forced to buy those buildings to entice tenants to new quarters in the World Fionancial Center. **********''When we first started the World Financial Center, we didn't expect to end up buying four million square feet to rent eight million square feet,'' says Michael Dennis, executive vice president of Olympia & York. **********More new skyscrapers are rising on the East River and renovated ones are opening in the heart of Wall Street. Their landlords are aggressively seeking tenants. The specter of Houston's overbuilt downtown eerily haunts Olympia & York, along with other local builders. **********Some owners of older downtown Manhattan structures are fearful of the Renaissance Center syndrome, a Detroit phenomenon that saw a huge new waterfront development suck much of the life out of the downtown area. And some urban experts fear that the resources being channeled into Battery Park City will be underutilized until the city's more basic problem's, like social turbulence and poor services, are successfully addressed. In the meantime, they warn, the country's glittering downtown structures may be merely frothy icing on the great urban mudpie. **********''When we talk to the urban geographers, they paint some pictures of New York that will keep you up at night,'' says Charles Manzella, Merrill Lynch's vice president for facilities management. He cited poor schools, bad roads and creaky mass transit as lingering problems. **********Despite the problems, the World Financial Center is turning out to be the quintessential case study in the way that central business districts are recycling themselves. AT the close of each workday, as multitudes of hard-hatted construction workers trudge homeward through the muddy landfill on the western edge of Lower Manhattan, a convoy of moving vans appears. The trucks crawl up to the loading docks of a tower nearing completion on the river's shore, then methodically disgorge their cargo of shiny new office furniture and blank-faced computer terminals. **********The tower - the tallest in a complex of four ornately topped, luxuriously appointed skyscrapers in the World Financial Center - will become the headquarters of American Express. The tenant liked the building so much that it persuaded Olympia & York to sell it all 51 floors. Occupancy begins late next month for the first of 7,000 employees. **********When all the workers are assembled in the 2.3 million square feet under the pyramidal roof, American Express says it will have completed the largest corporate move in history. But moving day will have an additional distinction for the company. It comes less than 10 years after its highly publicized 1976 move into its narrow, 40-story Broad Street offices. The move from Broad Street and five other downtown locations brings all of its Manhattan offices, except its operations center on lower Broadway, under one roof. **********Since 1976 American Express's employment in Manhattan has skyrocketed. When it moved to its present site only 3,000 people were employed at headquarters. The company's aggressive expansion into the brokerage and investment banking businesses - through its absorption of Shearson and Lehman Brothers -has created much of the need. But like many other labor-intensive financial services companies, American Express is experiencing explosive internal growth. **********The company's net income from credit cards recently has been growing at the rate of 21 percent annually. And the number of people who hold its credit cards has soared to 20 million from 12 million only 5 years ago. **********Besides consolidating employees, the move will aid the ''cross-pollination of American Express and Shearson cultures,'' says Richard MacCauley, American Express's vice president for real estate. **********At Merrill Lynch, the scenario is familiar. Merrill's downtown Manhattan offices are now scattered among 11 sites. Next year, when most of these sites are closed and Merrill completes the transfer of its 12,000 Manhattan employees (double the number involved in the last move a dozen years ago) to its 3.9 million square feet of office space, it will topple American Express's tender young record for large-scale corporate moves. The big brokerage and investment house will occupy 4.2 million square feet in Manhattan, which includes its mail center in lower Manhattan, up from 2.4 million five years ago. And it continues to expand in New Jersey. **********Much of the expansion results from financial deregulation and the proliferation of new financial services, like money market mutual funds and cash management accounts. Merrill, for example, now offers 120 products, up from about 6 only a decade ago. **********In the final weeks before Moving Day, the offices are abuzz with activity - and the companies are trying to prepare their workers for the big change. While electricians hook up computer terminals and decorators direct the picture hangers, American Express management is passing out glossy 24-page orientation booklets to employees. A special internal publication keeps employees up to date on the building's progress. ''Slowly this building is coming to life,'' a recent issue promised, ''And when it's ready it's going to be a knockout.'' IT is a knockout, indeed. The American Express building and the other towers in the World Financial Center appear destined for critical acclaim, with their colorful fabric-covered walls, their 27 varieties of marble, the winding grand staircases, the lobbies as huge as the Metropolitan Opera and a glass-enclosed palm tree-lined public space as large as the main room at Grand Central Station. **********But the monetary success of Battery Park City and its $1.5 billion World Financial Center is not nearly as definite. **********New York State's Battery Park City Authority seems to be in fine shape now, after a decade of what it calls ''frustration, financial brinkmanship and uncertainty.'' Meyer S. Frucher, the authority's president, predicts that by the time the project's bonds are retired in 2014, Battery Park City will earn a profit for the state of $3 billion from leases on the land and payments-in-lieu-of-taxes. New York City, which opposed the project as a ''golden ghetto'' during the Lindsay administration, also stands to gain handsomely. It has the option to take title to the land for $1 after the bonds are retired. **********But the financial outcome for Olympia & York remains uncertain. The owners of more than 21 million square feet of office and retail space in this city, Olympia & York will rival Rockefeller Center for the title of New York's largest commercial landlord when the financial center is completed. The company, which operates in 11 other North American cities as well as in Belgium, Britain and France, plunged courageously into the New York market in 1977 during the depths of the city's fiscal despair and, coincidentally, the bottom of the real estate cycle. **********It first bought the real estate portfolio of the Uris family, a big New York developer, consisting of eight buildings, including the American Brands building on Park Avenue and the J. C. Penney building on 53d Street. After other purchases, it expanded into renovation, transforming the building adjacent to Grand Central Station, which housed the old Penn Central train switching operation, into the trendy Park Avenue Atrium, where Olympia & York has its United States headquarters. **********But Battery Park City, from the start, has been a major financial challenge. Built on speculation, without a single tenant signed up in advance, most of the World Financial Center has been financed by banks, including Manufacturers Hanover, Bankers Trust, the Bank of Montreal and the Sumitomo Bank. But the last two towers, the ones Merrill Lynch will occupy, were financed with $500 million borrowed in the volatile commercial paper market. **********Real estate experts say Olympia & York's short-term financing could place the company in a predicament similar to the one that faced the real estate investment trusts in the 1970's when those trusts were devastated by steeply rising interest rates. Developers usually finance construction projects with bank loans and get long-term financing from insurance companies or pension funds when the project is built. **********''If the market changes on you,'' says Beatrice Gotthelf, president of the Catco Group, a New York real estate development company, ''you could end up finding it very difficult to attract long-term financing.'' The cancellation of an important lease in a softening market could have the same result. But Miss Gotthelf does not expect such a turn of events to catch Olympia unprepared. ''They very much know what they're doing,'' she adds. **********Yet Olympia & York is now sitting on dozens of floors of unleased office space in three older buildings in the financial district that it bought from Merrill Lynch, the City Investing Company and American Express to entice them into leases in the World Financial Center. **********Those holdings could pose a real problem now. According to Office Network, a real estate consulting firm, the office vacancy rate in lower Manhattan reached 8.3 percent in July. While that is better than the national downtown rate of 13 percent, it is up from 8 percent at the beginning of the year and significantly higher than the 6.6 percent rate in midtown Manhattan in July. And downtown's vacancy rate is expected to increase because developers have continued to throw up commercial structures and renovate others in Lower Manhattan at a torrid pace. Many are trying to take advantage of benefits in the 1981 tax law before Congress enacts threatened revisions. **********Olympia has not had an easy time renting space in the older buildings that it had to buy. It has commitments for only about 45 percent of that space, although it says it is courting some fast-growing insurance companies. **********But it will take some concessions, like extended periods of free rent, to lease these floors, if standard rental procedures are any indication. Mr. Dennis says, hesitantly, that he expects to see substantial progress in leasing the old properties by the end of the year and that the entire financial center will prove to be profitable. **********''The same thing probably happened when the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were developed,'' he argues, stressing that developers usually have to nurse large projects for five or six years. ''You have to take the long view.'' Though the World Financial Center is slightly more than 90 percent leased, traditionally a critical point in office building profitability, Olympia paid dearly to reach that point, offering bargains to entice tenants, Merrill Lynch says the concessions in its lease - a document that covers 25 years and fills five bound volumes, each about four inches thick - will save the brokerage firm 25 percent of what it would have spent if it had stayed in its former offices and leased additional space. **********Merrill was a particularly elusive prospect until it signed on a year ago, buying 49 percent of the two towers it will occupy. The big brokerage company let Olympia know it was also negotiating with the World Trade Center for space and that New York State, the trade center's owner, was being very accommodating. **********But the trade center deal fell apart when Governor Cuomo threatened to veto it as too cozy. Merrill signed with Olympia & York and Dean Witter eventually took the World Trade Center space. When state agencies move to make room for Dean Witter, the World Trade Center will be completely occupied by private tenants, a further indication of downtown's comeback. When it was completed in the early 1970's, state agencies occupied it. Those agencies are scattered now around the city. **********American Express says it got a good deal, too. It paid Olympia & York $370 million for the new structure and sold its Broad Street building to the developer for $160 million, earning an $87 million pretax profit. Olympia wanted to rent to the company, but American Express disagreed. **********''They got a triple-A tenant to come in and take a large amount of space. It put them in a very good position to lease the rest of the space,'' says American Express's Mr. MacCauley. **********That was, of course, not always the case. Olympia had some tense moments when City Investing, the first large tenant to sign up, announced earlier this year that it would liquidate itself. Consequently, Olympia found itself without a tenant for the several floors in the same building that Dow Jones will occupy. And Olympia, too, was left owning City's 43-story headquarters building on Maiden Lane, where much rentable space still remains. **********Olympia & York, after lengthy bargaining to rent City Investing's space in the World Financial Center, announced last week that Oppenheimer & Company would take much of it. But tens of thousands of square feet remain uncommitted, Olympia & York has said. Rents will range from about $38 to $40 a square foot, on average, a bit more than rents in luxury office buildings downtown, but less than average luxury rates in midtown. WHEN American Express finishes its move by the end of the year, it will be just about a year behind schedule. In the interim the architects are harried. Contractors are under pressure. And the center's would-be occupants are cramped in their old quarters. **********''Everything that's happening in the financial services world translates into an increased demand for space,'' says Olympia's Mr. Dennis. **********Mr. Dennis has done detailed studies on the growing office needs of the Wall Street area. He estimates that demand for space in downtown New York grew by two million square feet a year between 1960 and 1980. That constituted the basis for Olympia & York's interest. ''We thought two million square feet a year could be absorbed through the 80's,'' he said. ''And we had to get our share of it.'' But money troubles stalked the project from the beginning - from the time the first excavation tailings from the World Trade Center's construction were dumped into the landfill site along the Hudson that is now Battery Park. City and state financial crises scuttled a public financing that would have been the first step toward transforming the landfill into a big real estate project. **********Olympia & York's financial plan for the financial center eventually included extensive use of commercial paper and guaranteeing the state agency's debt repayment. Residential builders, like the Lefrak Organization and the Zeckendorf Company, began erecting apartments. **********Olympia & York sponsored a design contest for the financial center and hired Cesar Pelli, the former dean of Yale's architecture school. Ground was broken in December 1981. **********Mr. Pelli enjoyed designing a building that had not signed up a single tenant. There were few detailed specifications to incorporate and almost no personal whims to satisfy. ''It made the process extremely efficient,'' he says. **********But his project manager has seen things differently. ''It started faster but it ended slower,'' says Thomas J. Morton. Specifications of the major tenants had to be accommodated after all. THERE, in the westernmost canyon of the financial district, a squat gray office sits incongruously among the skyscrapers, looking like it would be more at home in a fledgling suburban development. **********But the little West Street sales office, where salesmen are pushing waterfront condominiums at prices ranging from $155,000 to $900,000, is as important to the success of Battery Park City as the hulking structures, at least symbolically. The 14,000 apartments and condominum units represent the unique feature that distinguishes this project from downtown redevelopement projects in many other cities. **********The plans would infuse 30,000 residents into the area in an effort to avoid the kind of desolation that creeps over Detroit's Renaissance Center after sundown. ''What gives a development life is people living there,'' says Mr. Pelli, the architect. ''Renaissance Center was designed as a bit of a fortress with high walls. This is open.'' The developers have put great effort into weaving the new city into downtown's existing fabric. The World Financial Center was relocated northward opposite the World Trade Center, under the revised master plan to reduce the isolation of the complex. Wide-carpeted foot bridges span busy West Street. **********And the surrounding environment is becoming much more of a 24-hour area. The Vista Hotel is busy around the clock. Throngs are building at the South Street Seaport and the pricey Windows on the World restaurant atop One World Trade. Office workers stroll the quarter-mile riverfront esplanade at lunch time. Manhattan Community College, recently relocated from midtown to West Street, is a destination for 12,000 students. **********But some pioneering residents of the Battery Park's 1,700-unit Gateway Plaza, a rental project built by the Lefrak Organization, say life downtown still leaves something to be desired. ''There isn't much of a community feeling here,'' says Natalie Bullock, a former resident of the Upper West Side whose husband is an executive in the financial district. ''And there are times when all the construction gets on your nerves.'' **********But, at the World Financial Center, such concerns have been pushed to the back burner for now. The developers of the city within a city are caught in the euphoria of commercial tenants preparing to move in."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/30/business/business-digest-monday-september-30-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 339, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1985", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1985", "body_text": " **********Companies **********Richardson-Vicks was barred from issuing new preferred stock designed to ward off a takeover attempt by Unilever, at least until the case can go to trial.

XU SHIYOU OF CHINA DIES; LONG A KEY MILITARY LEADER", "body_text": " **********Gen. Xu Shiyou, a veteran of the Long March who held top Chinese military posts for a quarter of a century, died Tuesday in the eastern city of Nanjing, the New China News Agency announced. He was 80 years old. **********General Xu played a key role at several critical junctures under the Communists. Perhaps the most important came in 1976, when as commander of the Canton military region in the south he gave sanctuary to Deng Xiaoping after Mr. Deng had been purged by Mao Zedong for the second time. **********The general was credited with having a major hand in Mr. Deng's return to political influence in Peking the next year, after Mao's death, and in his subsequent rise to control of the Communist Party. But in 1980, as Mr. Deng turned to changes in the military, the general was one of a number of powerful regional military commanders who lost their posts. **********Two years later, he lost his seat in the ruling Politburo and was appointed deputy chairman of the central advisory commission, a body of elders created by Mr. Deng to make room for the promotion of younger men to top party posts. In effect, the general was retired, and he returned to Nanjing, where he had been regional commander from 1954 to 1973. **********Weathered Cultural Revolution **********In the Nanjing post he had became one of a group of ''Communist warlords'' who combined political and military power to become overseers of large regions of the country. The post was especially crucial during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, when cities that fell under General Xu's authority, including Shanghai, were the scenes of turmoil. **********Although he came under pressure at the outset of the upheaval, the general saved his position by offering a public ''self-criticism,'' and when the army was ordered to crack down on the Red Guards, he emerged with his authority enhanced. In 1969 he was appointed to the Politburo, and the next year became party chief of Jiangsu Province, one of the most populous and economically important in China. **********An official announcement today described the general as ''a loyal Communist fighter, proletarian revolutionary and outstanding military commander.'' It said his 60 years in the military had been marked by ''great contributions'' to the Communist victory in 1949 and to the subsequent modernization of the armed forces, as well as to the ''security and prosperity'' of the country. **********The son of a peasant in Henan Province, the future general began his military career in the forces of Wu Peifu, a northern warlord. He switched to the Communists in the mid-1920's, took part in the Long March of 1934-35, and survived a political upheaval that followed the purge in 1937 of his commander, Zhang Guotao. **********In the closing stages of the civil war he played a major role in the Communist capture of the eastern province of Shandong. After China entered the Korean War in 1950, he commanded the Third Corps in action against American troops. In 1955 he was promoted to the rank of colonel-general."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/01/business/note-and-bond-financings-in-lull.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 530, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Note and Bond Financings in Lull", "print_headline": "Note and Bond Financings in Lull", "body_text": " **********Participants in the Treasury market can look forward to a lull in note and bond financings, as no new auctions are expected before the week of May 6, except for the regular monthly sale of two-year notes on April 24. **********In the bill market, Treasury officials announced that today's regular auction would be reduced to $13.1 billion, from the $14 billion it has been offering in recent weeks.

''Sometimes it's warmer, and that's summer.'' **********This afternoon, a stiff wind off the Rhine snapped the flags of the seven nations represented at the economic conference that will open in Bonn Thursday; a featureless, leaden sky lowered over the moored Rhine cruise boats, where some of the 3,500 journalists who have descended on the city are packed in cramped elegance. **********The first of May is a holiday, so Bernd Kraus, who runs a restaurant above the Bonn Rowing Association, should have expected a brisk trade today. ''But for me it's bad,'' Mr. Kraus said, surveying the families and the bicyclists moving sedately along the Rhine promenade, ''because my customers are afraid they will be cut off by all the police.'' **********An 'Expectant' Atmosphere **********The Bonn Rowing Association, founded in 1882, abuts the low-slung, modernistic chancery complex, where the leaders of the major non-Communist nations will confer, so Mr. Kraus knows a lot about the green-uniformed police officers with walkie-talkies milling by the river. **********The restaurateur, who counts Chancellor Helmut Kohl among his regular customers, pronounced the atmosphere on the eve of the meeting as ''expectant.'' **********Bonn officials are being coy about the number of police officers deployed in the city, but it seems to be about 15,000 - or one representative of law and order for every 20 inhabitants. Joachim Zimmermann, the police director, admits it is ''one of the biggest security operations ever seen in Bonn.'' **********Aside from putting a lot of police officers on the ground, Mr. Zimmermann has banned private planes from flying over the capital and has checked all manhole covers to make sure they remain bolted. **********In an attempt at humor, a West German official involved in security procedures said the police's delicate role fell somewhere between ''that of James Bond and Brigitte Bardot.'' 13-Pound Bomb Is Found Today at noon, some James Bond types found and defused a 13-pound bomb planted in a blue briefcase on the terrace of the German Aerospace and Arms Industry Association on Konstantinstrasse, a central artery in the residential neighborhood of Bad Godesberg. **********The police emptied neighboring houses - the adjacent Bolivian Embassy was closed for May Day - before a fire department bomb squad defused the bomb. **********The police said the bomb, which was discovered by a secretary, was possibly the work of the so-called Red Army Faction, which on Feb. 1 murdered a Munich arms executive in what it has depicted as a ''Western European guerrilla campaign'' against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its weapons suppliers. **********Three bombs went off in Dusseldorf and Cologne on Monday, and a shadowy group that styles itself the Revolutionary Cells took responsibility. The group said it was protesting against the economic meeting. **********The advent this morning of the traveling White House and its attendant, jet-lagged press corps coincided with what seemed to be a determined Administration attempt to focus on a new issue and move attention away from President Reagan's much-criticized plan to visit a German military cemetery at Bitburg on Sunday. **********Questions About Nicaragua **********The American press headquarters is in a restaurant called the Tulpenfeld, a name derived from tulips sprouting in a prim quadrangle where resident journalists and Parliament deputies have their offices. In a crowded Tulpenfeld backroom, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, mangled the pronunciation of the German leaders who are the President's hosts and then moved on to announce a trade embargo against Nicaragua. **********The questioning turned to Nicaragua, with one Washington-based television correspondent, forgetting that she had just crossed the Atlantic ocean, asking whether the Administration intended to close Nicaragua's trade mission ''here.'' She meant in Washington. ''You want to get a couple of questions on camera?'' said Mr. Speakes, apparently content to talk at length about the Nicaragua issue. He spoke of an ''urgent threat'' emerging in Nicaragua, one that made it imperative to announce the trade ban in Bonn, not sooner, not later. **********When another television reporter asked about Mr. Reagan's Bitburg program, Mr. Speakes answered testily, ''We have non-Bitburg questions, believe it or not.'' **********Bitburg Visit as Satire **********A satire this morning on West German television called ''May Revue'' would not let go of the Bitburg imbroglio. The program host, Hans-Jurgen Rosenbauer, conducted mock telephone interviews with a super-earnest-sounding Mr. Reagan and a bumbling, vowel-gulping Mr. Kohl, who were played by two quite effective mimics. **********In English, the fictive Mr. Reagan said he would visit both the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the Bitburg cemetery. ''You see, I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings,'' said the Presidential voice, ''so in a helicopter I will not land but hover over both locations and then, since total reconciliation between our peoples is the purpose of my visit here, I will fly on to Berlin, West Berlin, and fly over Spandau prison and greet Rudolf Hess.'' **********Mr. Hess, once deputy leader of the Nazi party, just turned 91; he is the only inmate left in Spandau. **********The program led to angry calls from viewers. Jurgen Sudhoff, a Government spokesman, denounced the show as ''an unparalleled smear.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/30/business/ohio-depositors-looking-to-citicorp.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1985-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1069, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OHIO DEPOSITORS LOOKING TO CITICORP", "print_headline": "OHIO DEPOSITORS LOOKING TO CITICORP", "body_text": " **********New York's giant Citicorp has come to represent the hope of thousands of Ohio depositors in the bankrupt Home State Savings Bank. They have been encouraged to believe that Citicorp, with its $150 billion in assets and its determination to be in every financial market throughout the country, will enable them to get their money back - $668 million - by buying the failed Cincinnati-based savings and loan association. Home State ran into trouble because of its dealings with the failed E.S.M. Government Securities Inc. **********Such hopes have been fanned by Ohio officials who are under heavy political pressure to get the depositors repaid. But so far Citicorp has refused even to confirm it has been talking with officials in Ohio. **********While there is no doubt that Citicorp has been negotiating, many analysts doubt that its takeover of Home State - even if it were to occur - would enable Home State's depositors to get back all their money. At best, the analysts say, a takeover by Citicorp could ease the losses, or reduce the amount the state would have to ante up to make all the depositors whole. **********Huge Losses Seen **********According to bankers who have seen Home State's balance sheet, the thrift institution's losses are so huge that a buyer would have to invest more than $150 million to cover the gap. And that is a lot of money even for Citicorp. **********Home State's problem is not merely its estimated $150 million loss from its dealings with E.S.M., but also overvalued mortgages and bad loans. **********Home State has ''had many problems over the years with impaired assets and therefore we are very reluctant to go after'' the institution, ''even to stop Citicorp,'' said an official of the Ameritrust Corporation of Cleveland, a large and heavily capitalized bank holding company that is eager to increase its assets. The official asked not to be named. **********What Citicorp or any other purchaser would be buying would be a direct toehold in the Ohio banking market. But even for the most expansion- minded banks - including Citicorp - the rust belt state of Ohio is not a high- priority market. **********Lower Interest Rates **********Ohio has its attractions. Its conservative population accepts lower interest rates than, say, New Yorkers or Californians, and Ohio is home to many corporations, large, medium- sized and small. **********But there are also drawbacks. Ohio has several well-managed and highly profitable banks that have a strong hold on the banking market. And the conservatism of the state's businesses and consumers makes it difficult for a newcomer to attract clients away from their traditional bankers. **********Citicorp knows such difficulties from experience. Over the last two years or so it has acquired failing savings and loan associations in California, Illinois and Florida. And it has found it much harder to reattract lost deposits in Illinois - a market very similar to Ohio's - than in the two Sun Belt states. **********Citicorp already has substantial operations in Ohio, with 360 employees in the state. Its subsidiary, Person-to-Person, employs about 60 people in Ohio and lends to consumers through branches in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus. Citicorp Acceptance, with 80 to 90 employees in Columbus, finances dealers in cars, mobile homes and manufactured homes. There are other operations as well. **********These activities could be bolstered by the ability to accept federally insured deposits and to offer checking accounts, the two functions that only a genuine bank can do. It is for that reason that Citicorp is thought to be bargaining for the ability to convert Home State into a full-fledged commercial bank and to be allowed to open a commercial banking unit in Cleveland. **********Bill in Legislature **********Currently, Federal law prohibits a bank in one state from establishing a commercial bank in another state unless specifically allowed to do so by the host state. To make that possible, a bill is pending in the Ohio Legislature. **********But the question is cost to Citicorp and what Ohio would get from any deal. If an acquisition by Citicorp does not sufficiently help Home State's depositors, the state might balk at passing the required legislation. Ohio's bankers are vehemently opposed to such legislation. **********According to its 10Q report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the third quarter of 1984, Home State has deposits of $668 million, including $618 million in savings deposits; total loans of $681 million, including mortgages of $279 million, and 33 branches. For the first nine months of 1984, not long before its collapse, it reported profits of $3.2 million. **********Home State's total assets amounted to $1.4 billion, but about half of that represented dealings with E.S.M. As a result of the unwinding of those activities - which did not reflect any real business in Ohio - Home State's current total assets are much smaller. **********The question for Citicorp is how much can it earn on whatever it will have to invest. Other prospective buyers have been discouraged by what they saw. **********Analysts estimate that a buyer of Home State would have to invest $150 million or so if all depositors were to be fully repaid. This total would include: **********- A net loss of $60 million from Home State's dealings with the bankrupt E.S.M. of Florida - a $150 million loss minus $90 million from the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund. **********- A possible $50 million write-down on Home State's mortgage portfolio, reflecting a lower market value than what is carried on the books. **********- Perhaps another $50 million loss as the result of bad loans in Home State's $400 million non-mortgage portfolio. **********- An injection of at least $21 million of capital to give Home State a net worth of 3 percent, assuming $700 million of assets. **********These costs would come to $184 million. If Citicorp could raise Home State's rate of profitability to the average for the large banks in Ohio - $1 for each $100 of total assets - net income from Home State would be about $7 million.

As a result, the Volume Investors Corporation, a member firm of the New York Commodities Exchange responsible for handling their trades, found itself in receivership yesterday. **********The exchange announced that it had suspended, for five days, the member privileges of Gerald Westheimer, his wife, Valerie, and James Paruch. The traders were suspended, pending a hearing of the exchange's supervisory committee. **********They were said to have held substantial positions in the gold options market, and were badly hurt Tuesday, when gold surged by almost $36, in one of the largest one-day jumps on record. Just how badly they were hurt is not clear, but the receiver for Volume Investors has sued them to recover at least $14 million. **********Losing Bets **********The exchange did not detail the specifics of how the three traders were hurt, but, in effect, they bet that the price of gold would fall - and they began to lose those bets in the frantic trading Tuesday. **********The exchange said they took ''imprudent'' positions in the gold options, specifically by writing (selling) such options. They did not own the gold on which they wrote the options, and when the price of gold soared, they were unable to supply enough cash to support their positions. **********The Comex is an auction market, in which traders stand in the pit and exchange bids, executing orders either for their own account or for brokerage firm customers. The Comex includes some 200 to 250 people eligible to trade gold, and 150 who can trade gold options. **********The fact that traders might have been buying to try to cover their short positions could have been one factor pushing up the price of gold on Tuesday, some traders said. **********Others disagreed. ''That's like saying the tail wags the dog,'' a Comex source said, adding that he believed gold had been pushed up primarily on concern over United States financial institutions, and because the dollar was taking a pounding. **********Other Traders Affected **********Professionals bore the losses and the public apparently was not hurt, those familiar with the trading said. Nine other traders covered by the financial quarantees of Volume Investors were temporarily sidelined. **********Volume Investors was suspended by the Comex. The firm's receiver was appointed by a New York Federal court, at the request of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Government agency that supervises commodities markets. The agency said that Volume Investors could not comply with minumum financial requirements. **********In a suit filed in Federal court in New York, Frank Wohl, the newly appointed receiver, demanded that the three traders repay ''at least $14 million,'' which he said they owed Volume Investors. The suit seeks to freeze the assets of the traders. **********A Margin Call **********According to court papers, the three traders were unable to meet Volume Investors demands for more margin, or cash, to support their postions. Volume Investors was then unable to meet a margin call by the Comex Clearing Association, the exchange's clearing house. **********Volume Investors, depleted by the failure of the traders to meet the margin requirements, was $20 million short as of Tuesday night, the Government said. But the loss may have narrowed as gold prices retreated from Tuesday's highs. And yesterday, they fell further; on the Comex, gold for current delivery was quoted at $317.10, off $6.70. **********Mr. Westheimer, reached at home, said he did not want to speak, and hung up. He was described by associates as a longtime member of the Comex and mainly a copper trader who switched into options a year ago. **********Options are contracts to buy or sell a given amount of a commodity within a given time at a certain price. Sources suggested that traders such as Mr. Westheimer, lulled by a market long trading in a narrow range, had been writing options without sufficiently hedging their position to protect against an unlikely explosion on the buy side. **********Dominant Local Trader **********The principals in Volume Investors are Charles Federbush and Owen Morrissey, both known as major traders. Mr. Morrissey is said to be the dominant local trader - or one who trades for his own acount - in the Comex gold ring. A woman who answered at Volume Investors said neither had any comment. **********A situation in which a Comex member firm is unable to meet its financial requirements is not unheard of, a spokesman said. But he added that this case was different in that it affected several local traders. **********The nine traders that lost their Volume Investors financial guarantees of about $250,000 each were out of action until they could make arrangements through other member firms. **********The C.F.T.C said in Washington that the receiver for Volume Investors would see to it that no futures or options trades were executed by the firm, except to liquidate or transfer open positions. The Comex Clearing Association was liquidating the firm's positions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/world/rebel-chief-says-angola-is-pressing-largest-attack-in-10-yuear-war.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1985-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REBEL CHIEF SAYS ANGOLA IS PRESSING LARGEST ATTACK IN 10-YUEAR WAR", "print_headline": "REBEL CHIEF SAYS ANGOLA IS PRESSING LARGEST ATTACK IN 10-YUEAR WAR", "body_text": " **********Jonas Savimbi, leader of a rebel army in southeastern Angola, says his forces are under attack in the biggest Government troop offensive against them in a decade of civil war. **********He said a two-pronged offensive by the Soviet-armed Government forces had forced his South African-backed guerrillas to abandon a town in an area of Angola he says he controls. He said battles still raged in another area. **********He hinted that the Government offensive might force him to abandon Jamba, the bush settlement that he calls Angola's provisional capital. **********At a news conference in Jamba shortly after midnight Friday, Mr. Savimbi also said Soviet officers were directing the attack against him, but denied that South African troops were fighting on his side. **********On Friday, South Africa acknowledged for the first time that it was supporting Mr. Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, which is fighting to force Angola's Marxist Government to talk with him about forming a coalition. **********Offensive a Serious Threat **********The tone of his comments, said reporters who attended the news conference, indicated that Mr. Savimbi, long used to battlefield successes, saw the offensive as a serious threat. They added that he seemed to be making an implicit plea for help from possible allies or sympathizers, such as conservatives in the United States. **********''The people of Unita are more than determined to defend Jamba,'' he said, using the acronym for his group. But, he went on, ''If we have to leave Jamba, we shall build another Jamba.'' **********It was the first time Mr. Savimbi had even obliquely referred to the possibility of abandoning Jamba, a settlement of straw-roof huts and military emplacements in Angola's remote, southeastern corner, near the borders with Zambia and South-West Africa. **********Reports 150 Rebels Killed **********Mr. Savimbi said that 150 of his men had been killed in the fighting that began 55 days ago and that 1,078 Angolan and 41 Cuban soldiers had died. **********He said 20,000 Government soldiers were involved in the offensive against his 12,000 guerrillas. **********Western military analysts say that there are 25,000 to 30,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan Government and that there are thousands of Soviet and Eastern bloc military advisers. **********Mr. Savimbi's movement, rooted in the southern Ovimbundu tribe, Angola's largest, lost a three-way power struggle when Angola gained independence from Portugal in November 1975. **********'End of the Earth' **********The winner was the Cuban-backed Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. Mr. Savimbi retreated to the sparsely populated Cuando-Cubango province, which the Portuguese used to call the ''end of the earth.'' **********He has since fought back steadily, pushing north, although his forces have been unable to take and hold major cities. The rebels have harassed the authorities with lightning strikes at diamond-mining centers, taking many foreign technicians hostage and later releasing them. **********The Government offensive, judging from reports here and in Luanda, the Angolan capital, seems designed to break Mr. Savimbi's hold on what he calls the ''liberated area'' covering a third of Angola's territory but containing only about a seventh of its population. **********''This big offensive is planned and directed by Russians, commanding sections and companies,'' he asserted. ''The Soviets are directing artillery, driving tanks and armored cars and flying helicopters,'' he said. **********Assertions Not Verified **********There was no immediate way to verify his charges. **********Mr. Savimbi said his forces had evacuated Cazombo, in a part of Angola on the Zambian border, before Government forces took it. ''We left them an empty town and took the population with us,'' he said. **********He said heavy fighting continued at Mavinga, a small town that controls access on winding bush roads to Jamba. Mavinga is about 140 miles north of Jamba. Because of poor roads, it takes at least 14 hours to cover the distance in a fast, four-wheel-drive vehicle, but much longer for an advancing military convoy. **********Mr. Savimbi said the offensive started 55 days ago. **********The Angolans have accused South Africa of flying air strikes against their forces closing on Mavinga, and of sending an armored column to help beleaguered rebel forces. The Angolans say two South Africans have been killed in the fighting. **********South Africa Troop Role Denied **********''No South African soldier is involved in Mavinga,'' Mr. Savimbi said. ''I do not think we will call for South African troops.'' **********He did acknowledge that wounded rebels were being treated by South African medics. **********South African forces fought alongside Mr. Savimbi's men in the 1975-76 civil war and have since conducted several invasions into Angola, the last full-scale one in December 1983. **********South Africa said earlier this week that it had sent 500 of its soldiers into another area of southern Angola, far to the west of Jamba, to pursue insurgents from the South-West Africa People's Organization, a rebel group fighting to end South Africa's domination of South-West Africa, also known as Nambia. **********The authorities here have since said those troops are being withdrawn to their bases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/10/world/west-bank-university-faults-israeli-army-action-on-protest.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1985-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 323, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEST BANK UNIVERSITY FAULTS ISRAELI ARMY ACTION ON PROTEST", "print_headline": "WEST BANK UNIVERSITY FAULTS ISRAELI ARMY ACTION ON PROTEST", "body_text": " **********A university in the West Bank today issued the results of an investigation into the behavior of Israeli Army soldiers in putting down a demonstration last year in which a student was shot and killed by Israeli troops. **********At a news conference in East Jerusalem, officials of the school, Bir Zeit University, presented their findings, which they said were compiled from the sworn affidavits of witnesses.

Biggs said in January. ''For many years, European investors have been international in their perspective. Now American institutions are expanding their horizons.'' He is chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management Inc., the company's investment management subsidiary, which supervises assets of more than $5 billion. **********Two days ago Morgan Stanley extended its already considerable global reach by announcing the purchase, effective next Jan. 1, of rights to the publications and stock market indexes of Capital International Perspective, with headquarters in Geneva. The present owner is the Capital Group, a Los Angeles-based investment company that manages assets of some $20 billion. **********Virtually unknown to the general public, the basic monthly publication - which fittingly displays a globe on its cover - serves investors and traders in foreign securities. On a unified accounting basis, it compares price performance, yield, reported profits and other statistics for 1,600 stocks covering 19 foreign countries and 38 industry groups. ''Five years from now,'' Mr. Biggs has predicted, ''the standard of comparison for American insitutional investors may well be the Capital International Index, not the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.'' **********The acquisition is a logical move for Morgan Stanley, which is broadening its equity research effort abroad to complement its international sales, financing and trading capabilities. As one example of its global reach, the firm trades securities 24 hours a day in New York, London and Toyko. **********The international arena already accounts for about 20 percent of Morgan Stanley's total business mix, according to Richard B. Fisher, president of the firm. ''We expect that percentage to double over the next three to five years,'' he said. **********While giant investment concerns are staking out their claims abroad, individual investors have become increasingly aware of foreign equities. Volvo and Jaguar, Americans have learned, are stocks as well as automobiles. **********Most average investors lack the expertise to venture directly into foreign stocks. Instead, their typical investment route consists of mutual funds specializing in this area. Such publicly owned funds include Scudder International, Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund, T. Rowe Price International, Fidelity Overseas, Alliance International and Templeton Foreign. **********But buying a foreign stock or investing in a mutual fund with a portfolio of overseas securities does not guarantee profits. Changes in currency values, as well as economic and political conditions, influence equity values abroad. Then, too, foreign companies are subject to the same swings in fortune that can affect corporations in the United States. **********''Mutual funds that invested overseas generally performed well during the late 1970's, mainly as a reflection of the depressed value of the dollar and the high rate of inflation in the United States,'' Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said yesterday. ''But with the advent of the 1980's basic changes took place as the dollar rose and the inflation rate subsided.'' **********As a result, domestic stocks tended to outperform foreign stocks. For the five-year period ended June 30, 1985, international mutual funds monitored by the Lipper organization produced, on average, a total return of 62.92 percent. This return consists of market gains plus dividends and interest reinvested. But Standard & Poor's index of 500 United States stocks produced a total return of 115.04 percent during the same period. **********So far this year, thanks partly to a declining dollar, international mutual funds have performed nearly as well as the 500-stock index. **********One criticism of foreign stocks has been that many companies overseas are less than forthcoming in disclosing their results, when compared with American corporations. Research on foreign stocks, too, has lagged behind comparable efforts in this country. But because of deregulation and other trends, money managers said, the situation abroad is improving. **********There is a special art, too, when it comes to ferreting out opportunities abroad.

A high-tax state such as New York would become less attractive to buy a home in than a state such as Connecticut, which has no income tax, or one with lower income taxes, such as New Jersey. **********''Any person who has an income of $50,000 has got to seriously consider the alternative of moving to New Jersey or Connecticut,'' said Marc Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, which represents more than 500 buildings in the city. **********Impact on Buyers **********If cooperatives, condominiums and houses become less desirable, prices might drop and one group might benefit: prospective buyers. Mr. Luxemburg conceded this possibility, but asked rhetorically: ''Who will want to buy co-ops?'' **********''It's like saying the near bankruptcy of New York City was a good thing,'' he continued. ''That was the last time co-op prices went down, because people were afraid of what was going to happen. But no one suggested that was good in the greater scheme of things.'' **********Sy Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group, saw a beneficial side to what he otherwise felt was a worrisome tax-revision plan. **********''One fond hope is that it will result in the invigoration of rental housing construction and it will slow down tendencies like conversion from rental to co-op or condo,'' he said. A principal impetus for such conversions, he said, had been the ability to deduct property taxes on Federal returns. **********Maintenance Charges **********Robert K. Lifton, chairman of the Council of Owner Occupied Housing, a New York City-based group whose members are involved in conversions of rental housing to cooperatives and condominiums, concurred with that analysis. **********Like all residential buildings, cooperative and condominium buildings in New York City pay a real estate tax of about 9.1 percent of their assessed valuation. Owners of individual apartments in such buildings pay their share of that tax through their monthly maintenance charges, but they can deduct the real estate tax portion of the maintenance on their Federal tax return. Under the Reagan plan, such a deduction would not be allowed. **********To illustrate the impact of the change, Mr. Luxemburg gave the example of a co-op owner paying $1,000 a month in maintenance charges. Of the $12,000 paid a year, he said, $2,000 to $3,000 would typically be deductible as interest on the building's mortgage and another $2,000 to $3,000 as real estate taxes. **********The interest on the building's mortgage would still be deductible under the Reagan plan. The $2,000 to $3,000 in real estate taxes that could no longer be written off, however, represents a substantial sum in the often hairline calculations that prompt a person to decide to buy a cooperative, he said. **********Choosing Among Communities **********Mr. Schulman said that when similar calculations are made by owners or prospective owners of houses in Westchester County, many may decide to choose low-tax communities. For example, a home in White Plains may become more desirable than a comparably priced one in Scarsdale because of the difference in property taxes. **********''You used to think that the tax burden was really half of what it was because of the tax deductibility,'' he said. ''Now the tax burden will be the total tax burden and would tend to scale down Scarsdale as compared to White Plains.'' **********Jerome Belson, president of the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, a leading builders' group, predicted that the President's tax plan would depress the housing market in New York and induce a freeze in the construction of commercial as well as residential buildings. **********The most important factor, he said, would be the inability to deduct local income taxes. New York companies, for example, might come under pressure from highly taxed employees to raise salaries or relocate to a lower-tax state. In such an environment, he said, builders might hesitate before starting projects. **********''You're going to see a hiatus,'' he said. ''Nobody's going to rush to build. If people are escaping New York, there's going to be a vacuum and nobody wants to build in a vacuum.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/business/alexander-s-move-outside-the-family.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1985-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALEXANDER'S MOVE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY", "print_headline": "ALEXANDER'S MOVE OUTSIDE THE FAMILY", "body_text": " **********Alexander's Inc., the New York retailer that was founded by George Farkas and run by his family for 66 years, has reached outside the family for the first time and has turned over daily control of the company to Roger A. Barrer and Louis Powell, who are expected to be formally named co-presidents shortly. **********Although both are longtime veterans of Alexander's, their appointment will open a new chapter in a company long dominated by a merchant entrepreneur and his four sons. The dynasty, now represented only by two of Mr. Farkas's sons, steered the stores in a direction that set them apart. **********Alexander's became a seller of copies of the newest international fashions at bargain-basement prices. In addition, it accumulated valuable real estate, and led its competition into suburbia. **********Even when the family sold control of Alexander's to outside investors, including Robert Bass, the Fort Worth financier, and Interstate Properties Inc., the New Jersey real estate developers, last November, Robin L. and Bruce R. Farkas, two of the founder's sons, remained at the helm. **********A Classic Tale **********Indeed, the current transition is in many ways a classic tale of how a well-known enterprise grew and prospered under the close control of one family, which then developed strains as the second generation grudgingly entered the business while the third remained outside. **********''I wonder how many family companies which go public and remain under family control can continue to do so,'' Robin Farkas said. ''The third generation is the big hurdle. Will the grandchildren want to stay in? Bruce, Sandy and I always understood that handwriting on the wall.'' Sandy is Alexander Farkas, the oldest son of the founder, who resigned as the company's longtime president in July 1984 to devote himself to other interests. **********In a candid interview recently, both Robin and Bruce Farkas recounted details of their relationship with their strong-willed father, George, who died in 1980, and talked about why they had decided to sell their interests. **********'We Were Coerced' **********According to the two brothers, most of the second generation joined the business unwillingly. ''We were coerced into the business,'' Bruce Farkas said. ''George not only planned for it but expected our compliance. All of us wanted to do something different. Robin wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. Sandy wanted to be a college history professor. I wanted to be an architect. Only Jonathan, the youngest, did what Dad wanted.'' **********All the brothers, however, finally joined and stayed with the company, although two did leave for a time. But not before some arguments. **********Robin, now 51 years old, left in 1959 to visit the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and determine what it would take to become an aeronautical engineer. Instead of following that plan, however, he took a master's degree in business administration at the Harvard Business School and went to work at Arthur D. Little Inc., the Boston-based research company. ''But,'' he said, ''George seduced me back.'' **********Bruce, now 45, wanted to study architecture. ''If that's what you want, all right,'' George said, ''But you'll have to pay for it yourself.'' **********By the time Alexander's became a public company in 1968, all the brothers were in and George was semi-retired. George and his wife, Ruth, who had been United States Ambassador to Luxembourg, sold their shares shortly after the company went public. But Robin and Bruce maintained substantial ownership. **********Alexander and Jonathan sold their interest, but Jonathan remained with the company until 1980. He since has become a theatrical producer. **********Success in Real Estate **********About the time the company went public, Alexander's was having some problems and, his sons recall, George felt he was being ignored. He had become a very active real estate investor. Sources close to the family say his holdings and profits from real estate in Europe, Asia and Australia far exceeded what he had gained in his career at Alexander's. Nonetheless, Robin Farkas said: ''He tried to call the shots from backstage. He would say, 'Nobody asks me for help.' '' **********Even as retailing in the metropolitan area grew more competitive in the 1970's, with Macy's, Lord & Taylor and Bloomingdale's becoming more fashion-oriented and increasing their clientele, Alexander's continued to make a profit. **********In 1981, however, with the acquisition of a Texas retailer, Margo's La Mode, Alexander's posted its first loss in 56 years because of the cost of the acquisition and that company's declining sales. **********But while Alexander's quickly returned to the black as a retailer, another portion of its business held greater promise. As Robin Farkas put it, ''The real estate we owned became more valuable than our retail operations, principally because real estate values grew so dramatically in the last few years.'' **********Outside Investors **********That fact was not lost on outside investors. First Interstate Properties began accumulating stock, and then the Bass group. Both investor groups increased their holdings, giving the non-family related directors a majority on the board of directors. Plans are now progressing to convert a number of the Alexander's store sites, such as the giant 59th Street store and others, to multipurpose uses. **********''One of the reasons we went along with the sale of our stock was to give the company some stability,'' Robin Farkas said. ''With the investors' stock purchases and Sandy's resignation, we were in limbo for months. The Basses and the Interstate people have a lot of expertise in real estate and we believed that they could help us realize the higher value of the real estate at the same time that we could improve our retail business.'' **********The company's new choices as president, Mr. Barrer, 59, and Mr. Powell, 62, together represent 75 years' service at Alexander's, but are likely to pursue some new strategies, nonetheless. They have been functioning as co-president ex-officio for seven months, and have developed plans that they can now carry out themselves. ''We feel that we haven't really captured our rightful market share because we haven't made enough of a proper effort to do it,'' Mr. Barrer said, ''and we've taken some steps along those lines.'' **********But Alexander's still has some way to go. Last year, while sales rose a slim 1.2 percent, to $517.6 million, from $511.3 million, its net income dropped 13.5 percent, to $4 million, from $4.6 million. **********The merchandising staff has already been reshuffled to provide more concentrated coverage of the apparel market. A target profile of Alexander's potential customers, generally those with annual family incomes ranging from $20,000 to $40,000, has been drawn to provide direction for the company. **********Mr. Powell, who has been executive vice president for merchandising, said the company was also seeking a senior marketing executive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/22/world/israelis-offer-little-insight-into-the-21-slain-terrorists.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1985-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 936, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELIS OFFER LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THE 21 SLAIN 'TERRORISTS'", "print_headline": "ISRAELIS OFFER LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THE 21 SLAIN 'TERRORISTS'", "body_text": " **********An Israeli Army spokesman said tonight that he could not provide any definitive information on the identities of 21 ''terrorists'' reported slain today in an armored sweep in southern Lebanon. **********According to the original announcement, soldiers killed the 21 during raids on two southern Lebanese Shiite Moslem villages. **********The spokesman said that beginning in the early morning hours the Israeli Army conducted ''searches for and arrests of terrorists in the villages of Humin al Tahta and Jaba. In the course of the operation, 21 terrorists were killed, most of them armed.'' **********Seven ''terrorists'' were also wounded, the spokesman added, and dozens were arrested. Several houses in which arms were found were also demolished, he said. **********But it was not clear from the original spokesman's statement who the 21 ''terrorists'' were or how so many men, including some who the Israeli spokesman indicated were unarmed, were killed during the searches and arrests. The Israeli operation did not appear to have met much resistance. Only one Israeli soldier was slightly wounded, the spokesman said. **********Information Is Incomplete **********The Israeli Army refers to all individuals who forcibly oppose their occupation in Lebanon - be they Lebanese or Palestinians - as ''terrorists'' and almost never identifies them by name, nationality or religion. **********When asked to clarify the Army spokesman's original statement and to identify the ''terrorists'' and the circumstances in which they had been killed, an Israeli Army spokesman in Tel Aviv said information from the field was still incomplete. **********He said that what was known by his office was that an Israeli armored convoy heading for the village of Humin al Tahta was fired on and returned the fire ''and the results you see.'' He said that some of the ''terrorists'' were also apparently killed while trying to flee the scene in an automobile, but details of the incident were not yet available. As for the identity of the ''terrorists,'' the spokesman said it was safe to assume that they were Lebanese Shiites. But, again, there was no absolute confirmation by late today. **********Foray Outside Israeli Lines **********Humin al Tahta is north of Nabatiye, in the area of southern Lebanon that the Israeli Army has already evacuated and that now is in the control of the Lebanese Army and various Shiite militias. **********The foray into Humin al Tahta marked the deepest penetration yet by Israeli troops into Lebanese territory from which they had withdrawn. **********In his brief communique, the Israeli spokesman said that during the searches of the two villages a large amount of arms were seized, including rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortars, crates full of demolition blocks, submachine guns, rifles, mines, detonators, thousands of rounds of ammunition and grenades. An unspecified number of people were also arrested. **********The raid was the largest single attack by Israeli troops against Lebanese opposed to their presence since the Israeli Army raid on the Shiite-dominated village of Zrarieh March 11, in which 35 Lebanese were killed. According to Israeli military sources the 35 men were part of a Shiite force that had been massing in Zrarieh in preparation for carrying out attacks on Israeli troops. **********Bombs Dismantled **********The Israeli Army was also active elsewhere today in southern Lebanon, where several roadside bombs were discovered and dismantled by Israeli units near Tyre. The United Nations spokesman in southern Lebanon, Timor Goksel, said Israeli forces searched the village of Sreifa, near Tyre, rounding up and interrogating about 150 men, four of whom were arrested and taken away. **********In another development, the Israeli Army spokesman announced that an Israeli soldier who was wounded in a clash with Lebanese guerrillas March 8 died of his wounds today, bringing to 642 the number of Israelis killed in Lebanon since Israeli troops invaded on June 6, 1982.  Today's Israeli actions in southern Lebanon, part of the Government's so-called ''iron fist'' policy to deal with Lebanese guerrilla groups, comes in the wake of army efforts to speed up the second phase of the Israeli withdrawal.  Prime Minister Shimon Peres said two days ago in a radio interview that he believed the Israeli Army will have evacuated ''almost all of Lebanon within 8 to 10 weeks.'' Government sources say Mr. Peres would like to see the Israeli Army completely out of Lebanon by late May.  Because of relatively warm weather in Lebanon in recent weeks, and the spiraling cycle of violence between the Israeli Army and the local population, the Israeli Army is speeding up the second stage of its pullback, according to military sources.  Israeli Defense Ministry officials also now say that the second stage of the withdrawal may be larger than originally planned. In particular, the large Shiite-populated towns of Tyre and Nabatiye and the cluster of anti-Israeli Shiite villages east of Tyre will probably be relinquished in the second stage in 8 to 10 weeks, instead of in the final stage as originally planned.  The third and final stage of the withdrawal is also expected to take place sooner than September, the deadline earlier suggested by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In fact, momentum appears to building in the Government to have the third stage follow almost immediately on the end of the second.  After the second stage is completed in the next two months, the Israeli Army will still be in control of a narrow strip running along the border, the exact width of which remains to be determined. Before withdrawing to the international border, the Israeli Army plans to set up local militias in villages in this area, which in the past had been relatively friendly to Israel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/30/business/at-t-plans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

After this sifting process, the firm evaluates a stock by digging into the quality of management and financial condition and the economic environment of its industry, among other factors. ''In particular, I seek out companies with a low expectation level,'' Mr. MacIver said. ''I want stocks where the overwhelming consensus is negative.'' **********Issues recommended by MacIver & Company are regarded as longer-term plays. After all, disenchantment with a downtrodden stock does not fade quickly in the investment community. **********One of his current favorites is the Interfirst Corporation, which closed yesterday at 10 3/4, down 1/8, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of this bank holding company, the largest in Texas, sold as high as 30 1/8 in November 1982. That was before the company's need to make a large provision to cover energy-related loan losses caused it to report a substantial loss for 1983 and, later, to cut the cash dividend in half. **********''I can see this stock selling at 30 some time over the next two to four years,'' Mr. MacIver said. ''At present prices, I believe the downside risk is limited. Interfirst is perceived as an energy lender, but in reality it is mainly a real estate lender.'' He said Interfirst's real estate loans ''are conservative, in my estimation,'' and he added: **********''Moreover, R. H. Stewart, whose management team built Interfirst during the 1960's and 1970's, has returned from his semiretirement in 1980 to again assume the senior executive role. Also, Bass Brothers Enterprises has accumulated a 4 1/2 percent position in Interfirst's common stock and convertibles in the last 12 months.'' **********The Apache Corporation, another MacIver recommendation, is an oil-and-gas exploration and production company operating as general partner in investment partnerships it organizes. The shares, which traded at a high of 28 1/4 in 1981, closed yesterday at 11, unchanged, on the Big Board. **********''This stock essentially is down because oil-and-gas issues are out of favor,'' Mr. MacIver said. ''But I've never researched a company that is so well regarded by such a diverse group - including competitors, former executives and pension funds that give money to Apache to invest in oil-and-gas deals. Another crucial point is that Apache has uncommon ability to produce real cash earnings.'' **********The analyst said he could see the stock reaching 20 over a period of time. **********He also views Dome Petroleum Ltd. as attractive on a long-term basis. This Canadian company, which produces oil and gas and also markets natural gas liquids, saw its stock soar in the late 1970's and sell as high as 21 1/4 in 1981 before a huge debt burden and softening petroleum prices brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. In yesterday's trading on the American Stock Exchange, Dome was unchanged at 2 1/16. **********''A significant improvement in the operating environment of oil and gas companies in Canada has occurred within the last six months,'' Mr. MacIver said. ''Gross revenue taxes have been lowered, and Dome - the largest landholder in Canada - also is reducing its debt. **********''Another factor that should not be minimized is the insider buying in Dome, particularly by H. P. Milavsky, a director of Dome and chief executive of Trizec, a Calgary-based real estate company. He is cautious and financially astute.'' Mr. MacIver envisages a target price of 6 or 7 for the stock some time in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/05/world/the-un-today-july-5-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

In 1976, the last year when the rise in consumer prices was close to the 4 percent rate of 1982, 1983 and 1984, Treasury bond yields were below 8 percent most of the year. **********Fears of inflation have helped keep bond yields well above the levels that prevailed in 1976 (as well as 1977-79, when inflation was higher than now, and rising). But lately investors have been sanguine enough that the yield on the 11 1/4 percent Treasury issue, due in 2015, has fallen from 11.42 percent a month ago. **********Investors' Outlook **********Of course, bond yields do not fluctuate merely on changes in investors' outlook for inflation over the next 10 to 30 years. The catalyst for the recent drop in yields has been a general weakening in the economy, combined with moves by the Federal Reserve Board to encourage lower short-term interest rates. **********To some analysts, the improvement in bond prices and the decline in long-term interest rates is a long-overdue recognition that inflation is low and will remain low. Capacity utilization is less than six months ago, and at 80.6 percent is well below the 85 percent level that some economists associate with rising pressure on prices. At the same time, the dollar is still strong enough to hold down demand for American-made goods and keep imports attractively priced. **********Lack of Foresight **********Others, however, say the bond market is showing a lack of foresight and overlooking the development of forces which will bring higher inflation. ''The Fed should be more cognizant of the future effects of money supply growth,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at the Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia. He said that Fed officials may make a greater effort to control money supply growth when economic activity rebounds later this year. But, for now, Mr. Levy said, monetary policy seems intent ''not on reducing inflation further, but only to keep it from rising.'' **********''There is a whiff of inflation in the air already,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group, Chicago. Mr. Kudlow estimated that prices would be rising at a rate of more than 6 percent by the fourth quarter. He said the upward pressure would come from a rebound in energy prices, a rising world economy, a weaker dollar and the effect of the stimulative monetary policy the Fed began in the second half of last year. **********Fed's Efforts **********Fred D. Kalkstein, chief economist at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia securities firm, concluded recently that the record-shattering monetary stimulation in the first two years of this expansion -which exceeded the two business cycles of the 1970's - represented the Fed's efforts to keep the economy growing. ''The monetary stimulation has not resulted in an inflation acceleration - yet,'' Mr. Kalkstein said, but he repeated his previous forecasts of rapid inflation before the business cycle is complete. **********Despite such warnings, the bond market has rallied in recent weeks. Market participants agree that too much money supply growth will bring more inflation. But when that will happen, no one seems sure. **********Perhaps one reason for investors' lower-inflation expectations is confidence in Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the central bank. ''Volcker has a tremendous reputation, and so long as he is there, he's the Rock of Gibraltar against inflation,'' said Robert Ulin, chief economist at the Bank of New York. ''He can ease credit and people don't worry about inflation, but if Preston Martin did exactly the same thing, it would be viewed in a different light.'' **********Mr. Martin, vice chairman of the Fed, has said the Fed has leeway to stimulate the economy with a more generous monetary policy because inflation is low. Although he is perceived by private economists as generally favoring low-interest rates, Mr. Martin has said in recent speeches that too much stimulation by the Fed would be counterproductive because it would bring unacceptable inflation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/27/business/aviation-agency-in-deal-with-ibm.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1985-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 237, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AVIATION AGENCY IN DEAL WITH I.B.M.", "print_headline": "AVIATION AGENCY IN DEAL WITH I.B.M.", "body_text": " **********The International Business Machines Corporation has won a contract to provide a new generation of computers to the Federal Aviation Administration for use in the nation's 20 air-route traffic control centers.

Page D1. **********WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 - Senate Republican leaders said today that they would propose a one-year elimination of the cost-of-living increase for Social Security pensioners as part of a package aimed at reducing Government spending by at least $50 billion in 1986. **********The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, stressed that the Republicans would support the elimination, beginning next January, only as part of a larger package that included cuts in other domestic programs and in the military budget. **********Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Budget Committee bluntly told Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger that he should expect President Reagan's military budget request to be reduced. **********And former Defense Department officials who served in Democratic Administrations said the military budget was not only ''bloated'' but also ''unbalanced'' toward nuclear weapons and the Navy. (Page A20.) **********Dole Stresses Deficit Cuts **********In his State of the Union Message Wednesday, Mr. Reagan gave a strong push to redesigning the tax system, but almost ignored efforts to reduce the Federal deficit. James A. Baker 3d, the new Secretary of the Treasury, said the Administration would not finish drafting a tax-simplification bill until well into the spring. **********Mr. Dole said today that he was ''disappointed'' by Mr. Reagan's lack of emphasis on deficit reduction. **********''I also think, very candidly, when you've got something you are not particularly proud of, you don't raise that as the centerpiece of your speech,'' Senator Dole told a breakfast meeting of the American Bankers Association. **********Stockman Criticizes Colleges **********Also today, David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who criticized the military retirement system on Tuesday, said colleges had a selfish financial interest in preserving the Federal student loan program. **********In defending proposed cuts in the program before the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stockman said, ''Now you are going to get a lot of pressure from the collges on it,'' and added: ''They're not worried about the student, they're not worried about equity in America; they're worried about financing their budgets.'' **********The Senate leaders' proposed one- year elimination of the cost-of-living increase in Social Security was the first public sign in weeks of headway in the Republican effort to write a budget package. **********The effort slowed in January because of the difficulty of mustering support for cuts in domestic spending without significant cuts in the increase in the military budget, which the President has opposed. Mr. Dole has since shifted much of the task to the Senate Budget Committee, which is not expected to produce its package until next month.  On the other hand, there were signals of slippage today on some of Mr. Reagan's proposed spending reductions. Senator Dole said he did not think the Small Business Administration would be eliminated, only cut. And Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said he would oppose the end of revenue sharing to the states in 1986 but would support its elimination in 1987. **********Together, the elimination of these two programs accounts for $4.9 billion of the President's proposed $47.5 billion in spending reductions for the fiscal year 1986 **********Answering questions after his breakfast speech, Mr. Dole said, ''We have agreed to put the COLA change in our package,'' adding that he thought the elderly would support the change if it was part of an overall package. **********Campaigned on Benefits **********''We believe we can make that Social Security adjustment without doing violence to anyone,'' the majority leader said. **********Mr. Reagan, who during his re-election campaign strongly opposed any reduction in Social Security benefits, said last month that he would consider adjustments in Social Security cost-of-living increases if the Administration was faced with an overwhelming Congressional mandate. **********According to Administration estimates, a one-year elimination of the Social Security inflation increase would reduce projected spending by about $6 billion in 1986 and by $22 billion over three years, making it a major part of any package. Officials have said there would be a saving in each future year, even if such annual adjustments are resumed after a skip, because the one omission means all future benefits are lower than they would be without the skip. **********At a luncheon speech, Senator Domenici also said the omission of a Social Security cost-of-living adjustment would be part of the package, provided it included reductions in the military budget and in other domestic programs. ''I am going to support it,'' he said, if it is in a ''$50 billion to $54 billion deficit reduction package'' and ''there is a reasonable chance we can pass it.'' **********In making this case, Mr. Domenici made an argument that could be picked up by Republicans and Democrats who want to reduce the increase in military spending. **********In an earlier Budget Committee hearing, Senator Domenici told Mr. Weinberger, ''There is a growing expectation that Congress will make significant reductions from the request you have submitted.'' **********But in his speech to the National Press Club, the Senator was more forceful. ''The truth of the matter is that we cannot continue the kind of buildup, we cannot continue the kind of expenditures that are being asked for, unless there is no real risk to America's future from large deficits.'' **********Weinberger's Warning Challenged **********At the budget hearing, after the Defense Secretary read to the committee part of a list of what programs and weapons would be cut under a freeze of the military budget in 1986, Mr. Domenici remarked, ''May I be honest and say I have a great deal of difficulty in believing that will be the result.'' **********Responding to the Senator's questions, Mr. Weinberger said Congress had cut a total of $60 billion in appropriations from the President's military budgets since 1981 but the Defense Department had still received 95.5 percent of what it asked for. He also said Mr. Reagan was asking for a $29 billion increase in appropriations in 1986. **********''So you were able to get 96 percent of the weapons systems and everything you requested with a $60 billion budget authority cut over the five years,'' Mr. Domenici said. ''And you are telling us that if we reduce $29 billion and freeze it, we would have to get rid of a list of weapons systems that you can't even read today because it is so long.'' **********Mr. Weinberger said a freeze of the 1986 military budget would require a three-year delay in the B1-B and Stealth bomber, a 38 percent cut in tactical aircraft, a 50 percent cut in Army and Air Force helicopters, termination of heavy lift helicopters and the C-17 transport airplane, a three- year delay in the re-engining of the C-5A cargo plane, near elimination of the multiple rocket launching system and the reduction of two Trident submarines. **********When he finished reading the list, the Secretary added, ''And I could go on for about four pages here.'' **********'Budget Housecleaning' Needed **********In his appearance before the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stockman said the budget was normally a matter of ''housekeeping,'' trimming a little in some areas and adding a little in others. ''But this year,'' he added, ''we must do budget housecleaning.'' **********Pressed by Democrats on the committee to defend the deep cuts proposed in many domestic programs, Mr. Stockman said it was essential for the Government to tighten its belt and eliminate programs that were not absolutely essential to the nation's welfare. **********For example, he told Representative William H. Natcher, Democrat of Kentucky, that while he would be happy if it was possible to increase the number of research grants offered by the National Institutes of Health, ''we simply don't have room in the budget.'' **********In response to complaints from Representative Neal Smith, an Iowa Democrat, that the Administration's agriculture proposals would prove disastrous to farmers, Mr. Stockman said, ''The question is whether the Federal taxpayer has some responsibility to insure people in one sector of the economy against loss.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/world/around-the-world-guerrillas-black-out-lima-for-45-minutes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Guerrillas Black Out Lima for 45 Minutes", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Guerrillas Black Out Lima for 45 Minutes", "body_text": " **********Guerrillas blacked out Lima Friday night and attacked two offices of President Alan Garcia Perez's party and a police station, the authorities said. **********The 45-minute blackout affected more than a third of Peru's 19 million inhabitants.

He said a decree issued Tuesday by the Government in Managua not only blunted political dissent, but also affected ''the area of personal freedoms, personal privacy.'' **********Nicaraguans Differ on Effect **********In Nicaragua, opposition activists were divided today on the effect of the Government's decree. Some said they feared the restrictions would mean the end of political debate in Nicaragua. But others said the new measures might not have such a drastic effect, depending in part on how they were enforced. [Page A10.]  Bernard Kalb, the State Department spokesman, said, ''The Sandinista Government has taken a further step toward imposing a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua.'' **********The comments by White House and State Department officials were some of the strongest by the Administration about Nicaragua in months and reflected the general feeling among officials here that the leftist Government was turning increasingly totalitarian. **********Disaffection Is Seen **********Officials said the Nicaraguan regime appeared to be reacting to the disillusionment and anger among sizable sectors of the population, including the middle class and the church. Officials said the church had been singled out for harassment. **********A Nicaraguan decree, signed by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and announced Tuesday, suspended civil rights on the ground that ''the brutal aggression by North America and its internal allies has created an extraordinary situation.'' **********State Department officials said that in referring to ''internal allies,'' the Nicaraguan Government was apparently citing not only the United States-supported rebels, but also the church, labor unions and others opposing the regime. **********Among the rights suspended were free expression, public assembly, strikes and the privacy of postal communication. The decree also strengthened news censorship, with the press required to submit material before publication or broadcast. Most of these rights had been suspended in March 1982, when the Government imposed a state of emergency. They were restored shortly before national elections were held last November. Administration officials said the newest moves tightened the lid on civil liberties still more. **********Mr. Kalb, the State Department spokesman, said the Nicaraguan action ''goes beyond the previous state of emergency, since it totally suspends and not merely limits basic freedoms.'' **********''This action is the result of the growing disillusionment with the Sandinista regime by large sectors of the population and reflects the Sandinistas' fear of their own people,'' Mr. Kalb said. ''This, not any action by the United States, is the cause of the suspension of civil liberties in Nicaragua.'' **********Privacy Restrictions Seen **********At the White House, Mr. Speakes said, ''Obviously we feel very strong about it.'' **********He said the Nicaraguan decree was ''a part of their repression of civil liberties, which not only affect the right of political dissent, the right of labor unions, the right of newspapers, the right of churches, but now has come into the area of personal freedoms, personal privacy.'' **********''This is a clear example of the Sandinistas tightening their control over their country by violating basic freedoms and refusing to tolerate dissent,'' Mr. Speakes said. The sweeping decree suspended for a year the rights to public assembly, to strikes, to freedom of expression, to movement around the country, to organize into labor groups, to speedy trial and to appeal of convictions, as well as the right to protection from unreasonable searches and unwarranted detention, according to the State Department. **********Harassment of Clergy Charged **********Department officials said the Nicaraguan Government had been harassing and intimidating the clergy. For example, on Oct. 12 Nicaraguan security forces seized nearly all copies of Iglesia, a new church newspaper, as well as its press and printing equipment, officials said. **********Three days later the Sandinistas occupied the offices of the church's Social Welfare Agency, refusing to let the clergy enter, officials said. **********Last month the Government drafted 11 seminarians into the military despite assurances that the clergy was exempt from serving in the armed forces. State Department officials said the 11, who had been visited recently by several priests at a military training center, were being ''mistreated'' because they refused to wear military uniforms or accept training. **********''The Sandinistas, obviously, fear the strong support for the Nicaraguan church by the great majority of the Nicaraguan people,'' Mr. Kalb said.

Vietnamese troops overran the camp on Christmas Day, and guerrillas of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front have been trying to take it back ever since. **********More than 60,000 people opposed to the Government in Phnom Penh lived at Rithisen. The area is now a battlefield, with ''almost all'' of its buildings destroyed, the camp's chief civilian administrator, Tu Tun, said in a interview this morning at an evacuation site called Nern Din Daeng. **********At other Cambodian insurgent camps scattered along the Thai border, there was a atmosphere of tension as the guerrillas - and Thai troops nearby - braced for a major New Year's offensive by the Vietnamese. **********Thai Soldiers Building Bunkers **********The Thai soldiers, who are not involved in the fighting but who are vulnerable to stray shells, were building more sandbagged bunkers along their border fortifications. **********Meanwhile, at hastily contructed civilian refugee centers in Thailand, to which tens of thousands of Cambodians have fled, there was exhaustion, misery and hunger. **********But there were also small efforts by people who have already spent years in flight and deprivation to start another new life in another new place. At the Nern Din Daeng evacuation camp - also known as Red Hill - two boys were getting haircuts at a barbershop built of bamboo poles and plastic sheeting. Along a footpath, women were selling bits of fried food. **********On Sunday, the Rithisen came under heavy artillery attack, with shells landing every few minutes. Wounded soldiers were brought out in a nonstop guerrilla ambulance operation to be treated a makeshift, roadside emergency center run by medical officers of the International Committtee of the Red Cross. **********This morning the roadside center had expanded from the shade of one tree to three - one tree trunk was marked ''OPD'' to mark the ''outpatient department.'' **********Under the second tree, two young Cambodians, attached to intravenous bottles suspended from package-wrapping twine, rested on straw mats. A man with a badly damaged foot recuperated under the third tree. The sun was hot, the earth parched and dry, and the undergrowth is lacerating at this time of year. **********No Certainty on Casualty Total **********Casualties from the fighting are not known with any certainty on either side. Thai officers told reporters that three Cambodian rebels died today; estimates ofthe deaths Sunday ranged from under 10 to 30. **********Mr. Tu Tun, the former camp president, who is living with the refugee civilians on the open field of grass, bamboo and scrub trees a few miles north of Nong Samet at Nern Din Daeng, said in an interview Sunday that he believed ''about 50'' people had died since the fighting began. Hundreds have been wounded. **********Today, Chea Sokha, 27 years old, who fled Phnom Penh only four months ago to join the guerrillas at Rithisen, said he believed that at least a hundred civilians had died when the attack began on Christmas Day. He said the dead were near the camp's military training center and the market, two targets hit first by the Vietnamese. **********Tonight, there were reports from guerrillas that the Vietnamese still held the training center. Mr. Tu Tun said his military commanders had told him that the guerrillas had retaken two-thirds of the camp. **********Fears of New Attack **********There were fears that the Vietnamese would exact a higher toll before giving up the camp, possibly to mount a similar attack on the Khmer People's National Liberation Front headquarters at Ampil. All civilians have already been evacuated from that site. **********Vietnam and Cambodia have given no reports of casualties or details of the offensive. **********At the Nong Chan camp, south of Nong Samet, which the Vietnamese attacked in late November, guerrilla forces and civilians have have begun to return, aid officials say. **********A European volunteer, however, said that while the Nong Chan camp had not been destroyed, as was earlier reported, the retreating Vietnamese had left small mines in the ceilings and on doors of houses, so that returning residents, eager to go home, were being killed and wounded. **********The camps now under attack by the Vietnamese and their Cambodian allies are border settlements controlled by one or another of three anti- Phnom Penh guerrilla groups - the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the Communist Khmer Rouge, and the followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. **********Coalition Is Not United **********The three groups are part of an often- uneasy coalition that does not fight in close alliance. On the contrary, there have been attacks by soldiers of one group on another. The division is greatest between the two non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge, whom many Cambodians on both sides of the Vietnamese question oppose. **********About 250,000 Cambodians live in the border camps, which are out of the reach of most Western aid officials because the people in them, technically Cambodians living in Cambodia, are not considered refugees. The United Nations Border Relief Operation, however, has provided the camps' civilians with food, education and other social services. **********Two months ago, Mr. Tu Tun took a reporter to lunch at Rithisen's Women's Center, where the walls were decorated with nutritional charts and food had been prepared by women learning the rudiments of a healthy, hygenic kitchen. **********The people in the border settlements are not like the refugees living in established centers in Thailand, awaiting resettlement abroad. **********Thailand allows the residents of the border camps to move back and forth into its territory only temporarily. **********Many Have Fled Before **********Some of the people camped at the Nern Din Daeng have fled Rithisen with every Vietnamese dry-season offensive since the early 1980's. **********In his small shelter of plastic and matting today, Keo Vong Rath, a gentle, 41-year-old man who has made this exodus three times, was trying to feed his three small sons. Their mother had died of cancer a week before the Vietnamese hit Rithisen. **********He said when the shells began to fall at 5 A.M. on Christmas Day, he put his three boys - ages 1, 3 and 10 - on his bicycle and fled. Holding the children, he said, he could take little else. **********Asked why the Vietnamese, who open a dry-season offensive against the rebels every winter, were hitting the Khmer Liberation Front hardest and leaving the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam's older enemy, more or less alone, Mr. Tu Tun said, ''They want to teach a good lesson to anyone who would support us, here or anywhere in the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/business/l-the-market-197444.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKET", "print_headline": "THE MARKET", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********The problem of institutionalization of the system is present in all aspects of our economic system. **********You can close the $100 window at the track and leave the $2 window open and the track will do business.

Nor would the officials provide financial details about Shugart until the company's year-end earnings are announced Jan. 30. **********In a statement, Xerox said that it had decided the Shugart unit, which it bought for $41 million in stock in late 1977, was ''not strategically important to the corporation's long-range plans.'' The company said that rather than ''invest in a long and costly recovery program'' it had decided ''to make an orderly exit from the business.'' **********The Shugart unit, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is a maker of 3 1/2-inch, 5 1/4-inch and 8-inch disk drives used to store data in personal and office microcomputers. Yesterday, Xerox said that the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the Japanese manufacturing giant, had signed a letter of intent to purchase the 5 1/4-inch flexible drive business, but that no buyers had yet been found for the other operations. **********Some of the 1,650 people who work for Shugart in California - down from 3,900 in mid-1983 - will be transferred to other Xerox operations, a company spokesman said. But an unspecified number of employees will be ''terminated with severance pay tied to their length of service,'' the spokesman said. He also said it was possible that the buyers of the operations might retain some of the employees. **********Xerox has recently suffered reversals in a variety of ventures. Crum & Foster, the property and casualty insurance group, was bought by Xerox for $1.6 billion in 1983 with hopes that it could offset the results of the company's ill-fated efforts in designing office systems and word processors. But in the second quarter of 1984 the insurance operations lost $15 million. While those operations recovered somewhat in the third quarter, the entire company's profits continued to slide, to $81 million, compared with $112 million in the quarter a year ago. **********Moreover, another California computer peripherals subsidiary owned by Xerox, Diablo Systems Inc., has suffered heavy losses and layoffs. Diablo makes printers for personal computers. **********Until two years ago, Shugart appeared to be one of Xerox's bright spots. Shugart was once widely regarded as one of the ''Big Three'' among small disk drive makers in the United States, after the Seagate Technology Corporation and the Tandon Corporation. **********In the early 1980's, when Xerox was headed into the word processor and office systems businesses, it was itself one of Shugart's biggest customers. But Xerox's office systems division quickly ran into trouble, finding itself unable to compete with the International Business Machines Corporation, Wang Laboratories and others. **********Competitors' Strategies **********Seagate, which was founded by Shugart's namesake, Alan Shugart, five years after he left Shugart Associates in 1974, seized the market for hard disk drives - the so-called Winchester drives used in sophisticated personal computers. **********Shugart was also consistently undercut in price by Tandon, the industry leader in floppy disks, which produces many of its drives overseas. **********''The foreign competition has also hurt,'' noted Nancy L. Bendig, who follows computer peripherals for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin.

Chase, a West Bloomfield, Mich., attorney representing the investors, Merrill Lynch sold the Tigers with ''undisclosed excessive markups'' and did not disclose that the Tigers could be retired by the Treasury in 2006 rather than the final maturity of 2011. In addition, the suit charges the securities firm with failing to register the securities with the S.E.C. or provide investors with a prospectus. **********Mr. Chase said he did not know how much of the price that Merrill Lynch charged was a markup and how much might have been charged in error. ''We'll find out when we begin collecting facts about Merrill's practices,'' he said. ''I don't know if this situation is unique to my clients or is broad- based, but that, too, will come to light.'' **********Merrill Spokesman Disagrees **********William Clark, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, said the firm ''totally disagrees with the complaint, to the extent that it alleges an excessive markup of price by Merrill Lynch.'' The company also disagreed with the allegation that its securities needed to be registered. **********According to Mr. Chase, none of the securities firms, including Merrill, that sell zero coupon securities that are backed by Treasury issues have obtained a ''no action letter'' from the commission, which, in effect, gives a securities firm a green light to sell securities. Investment bankers said they did not obtain such letters from the commission because the securities were nothing more than repackaged Treasury obligations, which, in turn, are exempt from registration. **********''Of course, we had informal indications from the S.E.C. before we proceeded with public offerings of zeros,'' said one investment banker, who asked not to be identified. **********The Michigan investors, who are trustees of the Detroit-based University Emergency Services Profit Sharing trust, made two purchases of Tigers in May 1983 through the Bloomfield office of Merrill Lynch. Each purchase was identified on the confirmation ticket as having a maturity of 2011, a price of 7.001 and an amount of $340,000. Those particular Tigers were created from 14 percent bonds that have a maturity in 2011 but that may be retired by the Treasury in 2006. **********Difference in Payments **********If the Treasury does call the 14 percent bonds, holders of zero coupon issues created from those bonds would receive their money in 2006, not 2011. If the Treasury does not call the bonds, investors in the zeros would recieve no interest until 2006, when they would begin receiving semiannual interest payments of $70 per $1,000 face amount of bonds, until the bonds matured. **********After the investors' account was changed to E.F. Hutton, exhibits attached to Mr. Chase's suit showed that the Michigan investors' holdings were identified by Hutton as $400,000 principal amount and $680,000 face amount. The $280,000 difference represents five years of interest payments the investors will receive if the Treasury does not retire the bonds before maturity. **********A memorandum from a Hutton official to Mr. Chase explained that in the case of zero coupon issues that may pay interest before maturity, industry practice is to charge a price based on the principal amount, not the principal amount plus the amount of interest that might be paid. ''It does appear that the client paid a price'' that was ''determined by a 2011 maturity value, rather than a 2006 callable date,'' the Hutton memo said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/30/business/finance-new-issues-georgia-bonds-for-2-projects.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;Georgia Bonds For 2 Projects", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;Georgia Bonds For 2 Projects", "body_text": " **********The Georgia Development Authority is offering $200 million of pollution control revenue bonds for the Oglethorpe Power Corporation's share of the Hatch  and Vogtle nuclear power plants. **********Underwriters led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company tentatively priced the issue to yield from 8 percent for bonds due in 1992 to 8.70 percent in 1995, 9 1/2 percent in 2001, 9 3/4 percent in 2005 and 9 7/8 percent in 2010.

It is more the fault, they say, of Americans who persist in spending their money rather than saving it. **********Japan's ''high savings rate and low investment are primarily responsible'' for the Japanese trade surplus, said Richard N. Cooper, professor of international economics at Harvard University. **********The Japanese currently save about 17 percent of their disposable incomes, compared to 5 percent in the United States. And Japan has a smaller budget dificit, so the Government does not itself borrow as much money as does the United States Government. So the United States is short of capital to invest, and maintains high interest rates to attract more, while Japan has too much capital, and keeps interest rates low. **********The result is that Japanese capital comes to America, seeking high interest rates. The Japanese sell their yen to buy dollars to invest in American securities. The yen falls and the dollar rises on currency markets. That makes American goods expensive in Japan, and Japanese goods cheap in America. Therefore Americans buy more Japanese goods than the other way around. **********Another way of looking at it is that the United States' net capital inflow - the money that the Japanese and other foreigners invest in the United States minus the money that Americas invest overseas - must equal the trade deficit. Simply put, the Japanese people sell their yen so that they can buy dollars to invest in America. The purchaser of the Japanese currency can invest the yen in Japan, reducing America's net capital inflow. Or they can send the money to a Japanese exporter in return for products to be imported to the United States. **********Thus, the trade deficit, which in its broadest form is called the current account, equals the capital inflow, which is called the capital account. But which sets the value of the other? **********''If I had to choose, I'd say that the capital account is more autonomous than the current account,'' said Jagdish N. Bhagwati, director of the International Economics Research Center at Columbia University. **********That view has gained ground in recent years, as capital flows have come to dwarf flows of traded goods. All the figures are questionable, but it appears that worldwide trade in goods and services totals about $2 trillion a year, compared to $20 trillion or $30 trillion in capital flows each year. And perhaps $50 trillion in currencies is traded each year by banks. It is these flows, the argument goes, and not the more meger flows of goods, that establish exchange rates and the size of the current and capital accounts. So what effect do trade barriers have on the American trade deficit? ''I think trade barriers in the U.S. and Japan have a lot to do with determining the level of exports and the level of imports, and also the composition of exports and imports,'' said Jeffrey A. Frankel, an associate professor of economics at the University of California at Berdeley, ''but I don't think they are the primary determinant of the difference between exports and imports - in other words, our trade deficit and the Japanese trade surplus.'' **********Many economists agree with that, although they disagree with just how much importance to ascribe to trade barriers. It is as if the capital flows and the trade flows are two ends of a see-saw. The eventual resting position of the see-saw depends to some extent on the weight at each end. However, more and more economists believe that the weight of the capital flows is more important in determining the see-saw's equilibrium than trade flows and related factors like protectionism. How much more important is widely debated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/20/business/state-restraints-lifted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "State Restraints Lifted", "print_headline": "State Restraints Lifted", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge today vacated two state court orders that attempted to block Mr. Icahn's efforts to take control of Phillips.

Richard F. Whittington, manager, marketing of Interactive Systems, said national distribution should be achieved by the spring of 1986. **********The two client types had an early morning visit yesterday at the agency with Karl A. Maier, Marschalk vice president, management supervisor. **********They explained that they came to the Videowriter via focus group interviews that showed, first, that most owners of home computers used them largely as word processors and that, secondly, those likely candidates for home computers, although they felt they would like one, did not really know what to do with them. **********At the agency, they showed the two 30-second spots created there, and the full-page four-color magazine ads based on them. The print started running earlier this month in the same nine markets, in the three news weeklies and Sports Illustrated, through the good offices of Media Networks Inc. There will be a single announcement ad in newspapers in December and it will list local dealers. After that, all newspaper advertising will be part of a co-op program, in which the manufacturer and retailer contrubute to the cost. **********One spot shows a student-like person writing with a pencil, then breaking and discarding same to turn to a Videowriter to find complete happiness. The other commercial shows a very futuristic garbage truck that was rented from a West Coast private carter, which is seen dumping old manual typewriters in a nice end-of-the-worldish setting. **********Asked what his ad budget was, Mr. Ayer proved himself in love with the languge by responding, ''We prefer to keep that marketing variable private.'' When asked who the competition is, he and his associates pointed to the Apple and I.B.M. computers and said nothing about Smith-Corona until prodded. **********And that subsidiary of the SCM Corporation came out with its Personal Word Processor, or PWP, which was introduced this fall and, according to Robert G.

That covers the computer attachment that can be hooked up to any of six or seven models of the new Smith-Corona electronic typewriters. Both pieces of equipment can be yours for under $1,000, according to Mr. Mayer, which is not what the gang from Philips is saying. **********Mr. Whittingham of Philips said that, including word processor computers, the total typewriter market was 2.3 million units, or $1.2 billion annually. **********Mr. Mayer of R.S.& H., said that Smith-Corona would be spending a very limited amount on its new product until it could catch up with demand. **********He also estimates that total advertising spending for typewriters comes to some $70 million, 65 to 70 percent of which is for office machines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/24/business/what-s-new-in-employment-testing-a-fresh-interest-in-personality-tests.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A FRESH INTEREST IN PERSONALITY TESTS", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN EMPLOYMENT TESTING;   A FRESH INTEREST IN PERSONALITY TESTS", "body_text": " **********Last summer, H. Paker Sharpe, Inc. administered the Berkman Method-a widely used personaity questionaire to Larry Lagerhausen to see if it should hire him as an insurance salesman.  At his former job Mr.  Lagerhausen had sold only $260,000 worth of insurance in six months.  But the Berkman test indicated ht he would thrive if closley supervised and recognized for his achievements. **********''So Mr. Sharpe put me in a plush office and treated me like a million-dollar producer,'' recalls Mr. Lagerhausen.  In his first six months with Sharpe, Mr. Lgerhausen sold $2.2 milllion worth of insurance. **********Like Sharpe, many companies are finding that judicious use of written tests can be valuable, not only for employee selection but also as a tool or getting the most out of employees.  This discovery is one of several trends fueling the current boom in psychological testing --a field consisting of personality, aptitude, and interest tests. **********Mark Kleinschmidt, marketing manager at National Computer Systems, a leading test distributer, estimates that the companies commmercial testing business has grown more than 30 percent in each of the last two years.  He says that United States companies are spending about 50 million annualy on such testing, and that the amount is growing each year. **********This rapid growth, evident at both entry level and upper management ends of the employment spectrum, comes after a decade of flat sales for the testing business.  The slump stemmed from the many equal employment regulations enacted through the 1970's.  These require companies that use testing to conduct expensive validity studies proving a strict correlation between the qualities measured by testing instruments to those demanded by the job at hand.  Many companies stopped using tests as a result. **********But many others started seeking bias-free tests.  For exmaple, in 1978, members of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of power companies, began a project to design and validate industry wide assessment tools for positions in several job categories.  By analyzing job requirements, developing and administering experimental tests, and correlating the results with performance appraisals by supervisors, the institute created tests measuring, for example, decision-making capability and electrical knowledge for systems operators, mechanical comprehension for maintenance workers, and language skills for clerical employees. **********By last fall, may utility companies across the country had adopted all of the tests.  ''If every company in our industry did a separate validity study, it would have cost at lest 10 times as much,'' said Daved Klienke, manager of psychological services at Edison.  Mr.  Kleinke estimates that by improving employee selection procedures, the tests should save utility companies at lest $20 million this year in operating costs. **********Computerization has also spurred the use of testing.  Scoring services used to require as much as two weeks to give test results; now, scores are frequently available within 24 hours, a boon to employers juggling several applicants. **********This winter, National Computer started marketing its Microtest Asessment System, a package including an I.B.M. PC, the company's own scanner for scoring, and test software.  The $7,000 system is among the first designed exclusivey for adinistering and scoring tests on site. **********''If a company loses one good applicant because of delays associated with mailing the results, this system will more than pay for itself,'' said Mr. Kleinschmidt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/21/world/defense-minister-resigns-in-france-over-boat-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1985-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFENSE MINISTER RESIGNS IN FRANCE OVER BOAT ATTACK", "print_headline": "DEFENSE MINISTER RESIGNS IN FRANCE OVER BOAT ATTACK", "body_text": " **********The French Defense Minister resigned today and the head of France's intelligence agency was dismissed as the Government moved to end the political crisis surrounding the sabotage of an antinuclear protest ship in New Zealand. **********The actions represented a tacit admission by the Government that its agents were responsible for sinking the ship, which belonged to the environmentalist group Greenpeace, and that the facts of French complicity had been withheld from Government investigators. **********They Deny Responsibility **********Press reports have linked the two officials to complicity in the bombing of the vessel, the Rainbow Warrior.

Almost 40 percent of its business comes from the automotive industry. **********As part of the deal, Claude R. Whitney, the 61-year-old chairman and chief executive of Allen-Bradley, and J. Tracy O'Rourke, 49, its president, would continue in those posts. **********The money from the sale would go into trusts for the five children and other heirs of the late Lynde and Harry Bradley, the brothers who founded the company in 1903. One of the children, Jane Bradley Uihlein Pettit of Milwaukee, owns an estimated 30 percent of the company, the largest individual stake. **********Other Suitors **********Rockwell won out over a small group of other suitors, including Siemens A.G., the West German electronics giant, which is understood to have been the next-highest bidder with an offer of $1.55 billion. **********Allen-Bradley's top executives also bid for the company in a management buyout together with the Wall Street house of Forstmann, Little & Company and the Emerson Electric Company of St. Louis. Brian Little, partner in Forstmann, Little, said the group bid about $1.4 billion. **********In a news conference at the ''21'' Club, Robert Anderson, chairman of Rockwell, said the company would borrow $650 million to help finance the deal. He said the company had $1.3 billion in cash plus $2.1 billion in credits from a syndicate of banks headed by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. **********Morgan Guaranty and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company would have headed another syndicate of banks ready to finance the management buyout. **********Siemens, which has some $6 billion in surplus cash, would have financed the purchase out of those funds. Sources close to Siemens said it ''would not rule out'' another big purchase in this country in the electrical business ''if the occasion arises.'' **********One Chance to Bid **********The bidding process, used regularly by Morgan, Stanley & Company, adviser to Allen-Bradley, calls for qualified bidders - companies with the money and no antitrust problems - to see the books, look at the company's operations and talk to top executives. At bidding time - in this instance, last Tuesday - each suitor puts its bid in a sealed envelope and then waits to hear if it has won. There is only one opportunity to bid. **********Joseph F. Fogg 3d, a managing director of Morgan, Stanley and a champion of the process, remarked, ''This deal proves that this kind of one-shot bidding, which no one else does, is the fairest way to sell attractive companies.'' **********He explained that the $1.65 billion price was 18 1/2 times Allen-Bradley's earnings and almost twice its annual sales. **********As a private company, Allen-Bradley does not have to release figures. It nevertheless listed sales last year of $942 million and profits of $90 million. Other sources said that profits the year before amounted to only $20 million, partly because of the concentration of sales in the then-lagging auto industry. **********Allen-Bradley, Mr. Anderson said, would be a ''substantial new core business for Rockwell,'' joining Rockwell's telecommunications, avionics and semiconductor businesses when the deal is completed around late February. **********He noted that both the General Electric Company and the International Business Machines Corporation had forecast that plant automation, now an estimated $4 billion- a-year industry, would grow to $20 billion by 1990. **********Following discussions with Rockwell's management about the deal, he said, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it would maintain Rockwell's ratings of AA for senior debt and preferred stock, AA- for subordinated debt and A-1x for commercial paper. **********Another Acquisition **********In what seemed to be a strong signal that Rockwell had enough financial muscle to make another big acquisition, although not in cash, he noted, ''Ratings on the company have reflected all along the substantial financial capacity available to major acquisitions without impairing credit quality.'' **********Asked earlier whether Rockwell might be interested in buying the Hughes Aircraft Company, now on the block, he seemed somewhat surprised but replied, ''It's a very attractive company and we'd be interested in taking a look.'' **********In a statement made jointly, Mr. Whitney, chairman of Allen-Bradley, and Mr. O'Rourke, its president, said that while they had hoped to succeed with their own bid, they felt the Rockwell deal would ''support and enhance'' the company's success. **********In addition to Morgan, Stanley, other Wall Street bankers working on the deal included E.F. Hutton for Rockwell and both Merrill Lynch and Arnold & S.

Account Interest Rates", "print_headline": "Your Money ;   I.R.A. Account Interest Rates", "body_text": " **********Sponsors of Individual Retirement Accounts - such as banks, savings and loan associations, brokerage firms and mutual fund organizations - are required to give new purchasers of I.R.A.'s a disclosure statement. Among the facts that must be included in this statement is a table showing the buyer how $1,000 a year deposited in an account will multiply up to age 70 at the rate of interest being offered, depending on his or her age. **********Yet despite the Internal Revenue Service rule calling for a disclosure of a rate no greater than the buyer can obtain, some of these institutions are apparently showing a higher rate in their I.R.A. statements than the public is generally able to get. And this means that the total received at the end of 30 or 40 years could be substantially lower than the account holder expects. **********For example, Joe A. Mintz, the Dallas-based publisher of the Nroca News Letter, believes that banks in different parts of the country are deceiving the public because their interest rates on certain certificates of deposit are less than indicated on their disclosure statements. A small difference in the yield translates to a large difference in dollars after many years. **********''There is only a tiny difference between a yield of 10.52 percent and a yield of 10.79 percent,'' he said. ''But after 40 years of depositing $2,000 annually, the higher yield can represent a difference of about $90,000.'' **********Therefore, it is advisable to double-check the rate on the account against the calculations in the disclosure statement. And it always pays to compare rates - as well as other aspects of the I.R.A. - at various institutions before making the decision about where to invest retirement dollars. **********Unionizing for Benefits **********A little-known labor union offers an opportunity for managers and professionals, as well as other employees, of a wide range of companies to become members and thereby receive the benefits negotiated with an employer. Among these benefits may be such much-desired health, welfare, pension or profit-sharing plans paid for by the employer or by combined employer-union funds. **********The key proviso for establishing this type of collective bargaining agreement, however, is contained in Section 7701(a)(46) of the Internal Revenue Code, developed in the 1984 tax law. This section states that the employee representative may ''not include any organization more than half of the members of which are employees who are owners, officers or executives of the employer.'' Thus, at least 50 percent of the union members at a company cannot be in one of those supervisory categories. **********The union accepting management personnel is the Professional Executives Guild, Local 525 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union in Bethesda, Md. Chartered in 1983, the guild has structured retirement, welfare and profit-sharing trusts tailored specifically for the needs of executives. **********''Employees have a right to organize, regardless of their level with a company,'' said Lawrence Bell, the guild's lawyer. ''The advantage is that the benefits can be negotiated and the management- level people can receive them.'' **********Membership in the local, moreover, could allow business people and decision makers at a company to save or invest up to specified limits on a pretax basis if the benefit package at their employer allows for these arrangements. Even after-tax contributions could result in a higher yield than might be available otherwise because of the investment power and potential of the group. **********Deductions in Volunteering **********Volunteering time or personal resources to a charity could have its rewards in the form of tax benefits. Although a charitable deduction is not allowed for the value of volunteer services or for compensation lost while performing these services, unreimbursed expenses can be deducted. **********Among the more common unreimbursed expenses are those for operating a personal automobile. These expenses can be either the amounts directly attributable to the charitable service or a flat mileage allowance - 9 cents a mile for the 1984 tax year and 12 cents a mile thereafter. Also deductible are entertainment costs, maintenance and repair of special uniforms and long-distance telephone charges related to the charity. **********When your motivation for rendering charitable service encompasses the anticipation of a direct benefit, though, charitable deductions are disallowed, since the service provided is presumed to be a direct payment for the benefit received. On the other hand, an indirect benefit received as a member of the community retains the premise of detached and disinterested generosity and the corresponding tax deduction. **********''Upon an audit, if a charitable deduction is taken, a question asked by the agent might very well be to identify the validity of the deduction,'' said Barry Salzberg, director of personal tax services of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells, the certified public accounting firm. ''The motivation should be purely charitable.'' **********Another point to consider is keeping a contemporaneous log of spending in connection with charitable activities. Without such records, it is easy to forget many of the incidental expenses that can be deducted and that may add up to a significant total at the end of the year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/25/business/pullman-peabody.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pullman-Peabody", "print_headline": "Pullman-Peabody", "body_text": " **********The Pullman Company said its merger with the Peabody International Corporation to form the Pullman-Peabody Comapny had been approved by shareholders of both companies and becomes effective tonight.

No such attempts have been reported. **********A police spokesman, meanwhile, said three more blacks died here overnight after a police patrol opened fire on people setting fire to a liquor store. One person died immediately, the spokesman said; a second died later of wounds, and a third body was discovered at 5:30 A.M. today. **********Toll Rises to 29 **********The latest fatalities brought to 29 the number of people who have died since the police opened fire on a crowd of blacks in Langa Township near here on Thursday. That shooting killed 19 people and was the worst single incidence of township violence since 69 blacks were killed by the police in the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. Kwanobuhle and Langa Townships provide labor for the automotive center of Uitenhage, which is sandwiched between the two black residential areas, north of Port Elizabeth on South Africa's Indian Ocean coastline. **********The Langa shootings came on the 25th anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre. In the past year, about 250 people have died in township violence prompted by deepening black disaffection with their living standards and absence of political rights in a nation where they are the overwhelming majority. **********Police patrols withdrew from Kwanobuhle today to allow residents to bury three people killed before the police shooting Thursday in Langa, but air force helicopters continued to fly surveillance flights. **********The police say they opened fire in self-defense at Langa after a crowd attacked them with sticks, stones and gasoline bombs. But within hours of the incident black witnesses told white liberal activists that the police had shot them without warning or provocation. **********Official Account Challenged **********Six members of the white opposition Progressive Federal Party have since offered a version of events, based on their own inquiries, that directly contradicts the official account. The authorities have ordered a judicial inquiry, and many opposition groups have called for the resignation of Louis LeGrange, Minister of Law and Order. **********South African commentators said he was the most obvious scapegoat since he is officially in charge of the police and has displayed a harsh approach to political dissent at a time when the Government of President P. W. Botha says it is enacting racial reforms. **********The killings on Thursday prompted great anger among blacks in this town that clings to a hillside. A valley filled with industrial sites separates it from hilltop areas restricted to white residents under the system of racial separation called apartheid. **********On Saturday the township's last remaining community councilor, or Government representative, T. B. Kinikini, was among those killed by the crowds who turned their wrath at the white authorities against those blacks they saw as the surrogates of white power. **********Fierce and Bloody Reprisals **********In fierce and summary reprisals, crowds hacked and burned the councilor, two relatives and other friends. In Kwanobuhle today, the streets were blackened by gasoline bombs.  And properties, stores, homes and trucks owned by whites or anyone perceived to be an ally of the whites smoldered under a gray sky. **********The police declared the township a ''riot area,'' under which officials then barred reporters from entering. A reporter who slipped past a roadblock was briefly detained by the police on his way out. **********While in the restricted area, the reporter said he was told by young black men carrying iron bars and spades that a liquor store was burned because its owner was white, and that the councilor was killed because he represented the same authorities they considered responsible for the Langa shootings. **********Plumes of black smoke spiraled from the township, rising from blazing homes and trucks. A funeral march wound its way through streets lined with small homes of brick and pockmarked with the dark scars of firebombs. **********Mood of Revenge Prevails **********The reporter indicated that the young men were jubilant about the killings and the arson, and said they gave the impression that, by the logic of South Africa's disenfranchised black majority, they had won a victory by killing black puppets and destroying township property. **********But that mood was not shared by all blacks, especially those now outside the township. **********Moses Ndhlovu, a court interpreter, said that because he worked for the Justice Department he had come to be regarded by young blacks as an informer. **********Thus, he said, his home was burned Saturday soon after he evacuated his family. **********''They say there should be no informers in the township,'' Mr. Ndhlovu said outside the Uitenhage police station, where he had filed a formal complaint about the burning of his home. **********Fifth Attempt to Burn House **********''I am not an informer, but four times before they have tried to burn my house down,'' he said, referring to what he called the ''youth'' in the township. ''I had a revolver and sent them away. This time, after the killings in Langa, I knew it was time to get out.'' By the time he returned from taking his family to safety Saturday, he said, his home had been burned and the militants told him not to come back. **********Army trucks with troops in riot gear stood guard at intersections on roads leading from Kwanobuhle to nearby areas around Uitenhage, suburbs populated by whites who did not fit the stereotype of a suburban class. **********Whites there have no private tennis courts and swimming pools, only small homes where the drying laundry provides the pennants for armies of white children who, by tradition and like their unseen black counterparts over the hill, do not wear shoes. **********'I am Not Afraid' **********''Let me tell you, I am not afraid,'' said an older white man whose small home with bars across the windows and a kerchief-sized lawn overlooked Langa Township. He was talking to a reporter who had not raised the issue of fear but who nonetheless became the recipient of opinions that seemed to hinge on the specter of slave rebellion. **********Then the man's son, added, that ''they did the right thing,'' referring to the killings by the police. ''If the blacks had got into the white area it would have been much worse,'' he went on. ''Sure, some whites would have died, but a lot more blacks would have died with them.'' **********Neither of the two men, both of Afrikaner stock, would give their names, but their views seemed to mirror oft- spoken beliefs. **********'Leave Us Alone' **********''Leave us alone to sort out our own problems,'' the father said. **********Then the son spoke again, spanning three centuries of Afikaner history in the intonation of his words: ''You don't seem to understand, you Americans. You can't expect these people to be like whites and sit on chairs and things like that.'' **********Then, vouchsafing a little family history, he said that he was born in this same house, an unpretentious tin- roofed house built in 1895. His father, he said, had stood guard over his mother's labor because the black people, those down below in the township, were restive in those days, too. **********''I'm still here,'' he said with some pride, adding that what happens in the township ''does not really involve me; only there is a lot more of them now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/15/business/utilities-get-seabrook-delay.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utilities Get Seabrook Delay", "print_headline": "Utilities Get Seabrook Delay", "body_text": " **********The Maine Public Utilities Commission yesterday agreed to extend for five weeks the deadline it had given the three utilities in that state to get out of the Seabrook nuclear power project. **********The commission voted on Dec. 13 to require the three utilities, which together own 9.7 percent of the New Hampshire reactor, to present plans by Jan. 11 to sell their shares or otherwise ''disengage'' from it. **********But the companies and partners in the project in other New England states argued that the Maine utilities would be subject to suits for violating the partnership agreement. **********Charles A.

''We are going to work hard.'' **********Reagan Requests Aid **********The Reagan Administration, concerned about the Guatemalan military's ability to deal with the country's own guerrilla war, has made several requests to Congress to resume military and police aid in anticipation of the installation of an elected government. Such aid was ended early in the Carter Administration for human rights reasons, although $300,000 was made available this year for military training. **********Mr. Cerezo, whose inauguration for a five-year term is scheduled for Jan. 14, indicated that he wanted first to gather in the reins of power himself so that any requests for military aid, as well as the expected request for an increase in economic aid, could be made by him. **********''The real challenge is not to have the best army in Central America but to have the best democracy,'' he said. ''If, in the future, they need military assistance, they have to tell me and we are going to decide if I request it.'' **********Mr. Cerezo said that the only understanding he had with the Guatemalan military was that ''they are going to give us the office'' and that it would take great skill and effort on his part to exercise political power. But he said a number of factors made him hopeful that the armed forces would cooperate in building democracy. **********One such factor was the nearly 69 percent of the vote he won in the runoff election, which he said was the largest vote share in Guatemalan history. Another factor, he said, was a realization by the Guatemalan armed forces that it was better to accept a political democracy than to face the prospect of their being destroyed if the guerrilla forces should be victorious. **********Rebel Issue an Internal Matter **********Responding to a question about the possible support of Cuba or Nicaragua for the guerrilla groups in Guatemala, Mr. Cerezo said he could not rule that out but felt the guerrilla issue was primarily an internal matter. **********''It is not just a question of where the support comes from,'' he said. ''It is a question of beginning to deal with problems inside the country.'' **********In addition to Vice President Bush, Mr. Cerezo met with Acting Secretary of State John C. Whitehead, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott Abrams, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and aid officials. **********For the 1986 fiscal year, the Reagan Administration has requested from Congress $77 million in economic and food aid for Guatemala and about $10.3 million in military aid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/16/business/business-health-hmo-growth-displays-vigor.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1985-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS HEALTH;H.M.O.

GROWTH DISPLAYS VIGOR", "body_text": " **********NOT many years ago, organizers of the prepaid medical plans known as health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, often were sent packing when they sought cooperation from hospitals. Now the wheel has turned. Prepaid plans are thriving while hospitals, squeezed by Government and employer health-cost controls, welcome H.M.O. business. Hospital chains are even organizing their own H.M.O.'s  as a way to attract patients and stave off empty-bed syndrome. **********National H.M.O. enrollment passed 15.2 million subscribers (individuals and families) in December and is headed for 18 million this year, a 20 percent growth rate, according to researchers at Interstudy in Excelsior, Minn. William  Blair & Company, the Chicago investment house, predicts enrollment will double by 1990, to 30 million. **********Tomorrow the letters HMO will appear on New York Stock Exchange computer screens, designating the HealthAmerica Corporation, the first independent H.M.O. to be listed by the Big Board. With 625,000 members in 18 states, HealthAmerica  is the largest independent investor-owned H.M.O. chain. **********H.M.O. members and their employers pay a flat monthly per capita fee instead  of being billed for each treatment. A typical H.M.O. provides full coverage of most hospital and doctor bills, plus extras such as free physicial examinations. H.M.O. revenues totaled about $7.5 billion in 1984. **********Prepaid plans have raised $1 billion in investment capital since 1980, said Peter A. Wadsworth, vice president of Kidder, Peabody & Company's health finance group. Most of it was in stock sold by for-profit chains. ''New equity offerings are coming at the rate of one a month,'' he said. **********In this year's biggest stock offering, Fremont General, a Los Angeles holding company, sold off 55 percent of Maxicare Health Plans Inc. for $226 million. An  earlier offering last year yielded $90 million. Fremont General acquired Maxicare for approximately $15 million only three years ago. Maxicare has since  grown to 530,000 members. **********As for HealthAmerica, it was started in 1980 by Philip N. Bredesen, a former  H.M.O. executive with Cigna, the Connecticut-based insurance concern. HealthAmerica began making profits in its third year - $1.9 million in 1982, $4.8 million in 1983 and $12.6 million last year, Mr. Bredesen said. Enrollment  rose 40 percent last year by recruiting and 10 percent more by acquiring other H.M.O.'s. **********The giants of the industry are run on a nonprofit basis. Kaiser Health Plans, with 4.5 million members, is discussing a merger with the Health Insurance Plan  of Greater New York, which has 900,000 members. Blue Cross and Blue Shield have  2 million members in 70 independent H.M.O.'s. **********One big potential growth area is the 30 million Americans, most of them elderly, who are eligible for Medicare under new Federal regulations. HealthAmerica plans to keep a lid of 8 percent on Medicare membership, in anticipation of Government pressures similar to those squeezing hospitals. **********HealthAmerica also plans to add low-income Medicaid recipients in Cleveland and Philadelphia with start-up government and foundation money. **********Much of the recent growth has come in Southeastern states, where in the past  conservative physicians had been hostile to H.M.O.'s. In South Carolina, the hospital association and medical society are putting together a statewide H.M.O. **********HealthAmerica is active in New Orleans and Birmingham, Ala. In Birmingham it  is not seeking Federal qualification for its plan. ''We can satisfy employers without that Good Housekeeping seal of approval,'' Mr. Bredesen said. ''They don't care if we're federally qualified or not. We provide the same kind of benefits in most cases.'' He added, ''We are looking at lower-level kinds of benefits to meet the needs of employers who don't need high- benefit plans. Birmingham may set a trend, as employers become more and more sophisticated.'' **********HealthAmerica prefers medium-size markets, but even in those the competition  can be brisk. In Louisville, Ky., it faces the Humana Corporation, the big hospital chain, which is offering a plan in 32 cities that competes with H.M.O.'s. **********The Hospital Corporation of America also has applied to several state authorities to start H.M.O.'s. And Voluntary Hospitals of America and the Aetna  Life Insurance Company have said they will form a joint venture to market H.M.O.'s. **********''Competition in Louisville has impinged our growth rate by about 5 percent,  not a big factor,'' Mr. Bredesen said. ''The market is still so big. In most of  these cities, H.M.O.'s still have only 4, 5 and 6 percent of the market.'' **********With the high rate of growth, however, competition is coming fast, according  to Leonard D. Schaeffer, president of the nonprofit Group Health Inc. at Minneapolis-St. Paul. ''It brings increased advertising budgets, reduced margins and lower costs to members.'' Group Health and five H.M.O. rivals have signed up 775,00 members, 40 percent of the market. ''Look at the Twin Cities,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''We're the future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/business/sec-to-let-funds-set-fees-themselves.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1985-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 371, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Newspaper reporters could be banned from covering unrest unless they agreed to a police escort. **********Correspondents' Group Protests **********The Foreign Correspondents' Association immediately condemned the regulations ''as the beginning of the slippery slide toward a totally controlled press'' in South Africa and called on its members' governments to lodge strong protests. **********Under the restrictions, unrest covers a wide range of situations, including stone-throwing, school boycotts, work stoppages, police action to counter such protests or anything that could directly or indirectly threaten public order. A journalist could be ordered out of an area if the police determined that his mere presence could turn the situation into one of violence. **********The officials, who said the new measures would not easily be relaxed as long as emergency regulations remained in effect, said the restrictions should not be viewed as a move against a free press but instead as a move to reduce the violence that has convulsed South Africa for more than a year, claiming about 800 lives. **********Little Effect on Domestic TV **********The regulations are not expected to greatly affect South Africa's Government-controlled television, which does not generally show incidents of unrest but instead uses a map to indicate where such incidents have occurred. **********The new action comes amid increasing charges by Government officials and some local newspapers that the foreign press was inciting violence for its own aims and presenting an unfair picture of events, thus stirring protests and economic sanctions from abroad. The police have increasingly taken harsh action against journalists -- particularly television crews -- whipping them in the streets as they tried \u00b8 to film unrest and detaining them without charge for either working in areas of unrest or merely being present there. **********Foreign journalists, who have vehemently denied Government charges that they manufactured or twisted the news, have feared further crackdowns in what they and others view as a Government campaign to control the news. **********The Government in September expelled Ray Wilkinson, a correspondent for Newsweek magazine who is based in Nairobi, for what it said was the publication, among other things, of ''half truths'' in articles on South Africa in one issue. The issue was subsequently banned. **********Louis Le Grange, the Minister of Law and Order, said in a statement today that the Government was ''concerned with the presence of television and other camera crews in unrest situations, which proved to be a catalyst to further violence.'' **********''While the Government has no intentions of curtailing the right of the public to be informed of current events,'' Mr. Le Grange said, ''it has decided to curb the presence of television and other audio-visual equipment during unrest situations in emergency areas without the consent of the commissioner of the South African police.'' **********38 Areas Under Emergency **********Mr. Le Grange said only journalists authorized by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Bureau for Information or the police would be allowed to cover unrest in the 38 magisterial districts under the state of emergency decree. Accreditation cards, which must be applied for, must be displayed at all times, and approved journalists ''will be required to report to the officer in charge of the South African Police in the area concerned, who will render the necessary assistance,'' Mr. Le Grange said. **********Until now, accreditation was not a criterion for covering unrest. The Foreign Correspondents' Association said there were 172 accredited correspondents working in the country. The work permits and visas of as many as 30 foreign journalists lapsed weeks or months ago, and the Government advised them to remain in the country until a decision was made on their applications for renewal. Officials said a final decision on each case would be made within the next week. **********Under the state of emergency decree issued more than three months ago - it was prompted by months of deepening unrest in black townships and gave the police and army nearly absolute powers - the authorities could impose total press censorship. **********If such censorship was introduced, reporters could be required to identify their sources of information in areas affected by the decree. Moreover, all reporters, foreign and South African, could be forbidden from writing about the emergency. Local journalists have for years worked under other legal restrictions contained in this nation's vast body of security legislation. **********Funerals, which represent one of the few lawful outlets for black political expression in South Africa and sometimes erupt into violence, are not specifically considered as unrest under the regulations. But the moment any violence begins, television crews are to leave the area, although a television reporter could apparently remain if he used only a notebook to record events. **********If a television crew films the beginning of the unrest and transmits it, it violates the new regulations. Newspaper reporters are to seek out the nearest policeman and ask for his assistance in such cases. It would be left to the discretion of the police to determine when, in fact, violence had actually first occurred. **********It is also now an offense for broadcast journalists and photographers who are barred from situations of unrest to accept film or video tapes from someone else who was in an emergency area, according to officials, or to transmit such materials. Although no tape recorders or sound equipment would be allowed in areas experiencing unrest, officials said, reporters could telephone sources in such areas and get accounts from witnesses. **********The correspondents' association said after an emergency meeting today that it viewed the decision to exclude television news teams, still photographers and radio correspondents with audio equipment from emergency areas ''as a severe form of censorship'' and ''an attempt to prevent news of South Africa's social conflict from reaching the outside world.'' **********Contention Called Absurd **********''We reject the Government's contention that the restrictions are meant solely to help reduce the level of violence,'' the association said in a statement. ''It is absurd to hold a small group of journalists responsible for a profound political conflict that has been going on for more than a year, left 800 people dead and placed a third of the population under emergency rules.'' **********The association said the ban on correspondents entering an area of unrest except under police escort raised alarming implications. **********The action follows a decision by the Government last month to ban all journalists from covering events in the sprawling black township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg, which is affected by the emergency regulations. **********The association referred to a speech by President P. W. Botha to the group this week in which he declared his support for press freedom. The association said the Government had until now prided itself on a degree of press freedom not found in other countries. It said it found it ''difficult to reconcile these new restrictions with the President's assurances.'' **********Some local newspapers, in unsubstantiated reports that failed to name sources, have recently published articles accusing television teams of paying blacks to burn books or repeat incidents of stone-throwing so they could film them. They have also said journalists sometimes knew beforehand that violence would occur. **********'A Growing Errosion' **********The association said its members were threatened by ''a growing erosion of their journalistic freedom and urgently call on their governments to lodge the firmest possible protests with the South African authorities.'' **********Meanwhile, Louis Nel, Deputy Minister of Information, demanded an unconditional and public apology from the Board of the Correspondents' Association for what he said was its failure to offer an agreement not to report on the new regulations until they were formally announced. **********Mr. Nel said in a statement that he met on Friday in two separate meetings with executives of the Association and the South African newspaper editors to tell them of the impending regulations. **********The sessions were held, he said, ''in the spirit of good cooperation and on the basis of the worldwide acknowledged traditions that governments do inform the press from time to time of their intentions.'' **********Calls Remarks 'Off the Record' **********Mr. Nel said the conditions of the discussions were that his remarks would be ''completely off the record and not publishable,'' that Mr. Le Grange would issue a press statement and that all reports must be based on that statement, that nothing be published before that statement was issued and that any ''publishable comments'' from Mr. Nel would only be obtained after release of the law and order ministers comments. **********Mr. Nel said the conditions were ''unconditionally accepted'' by both the local editors and the foreign press representatives. Although the South Africans honored the agreement, Mr. Nel said, executives of the Correspondents' Association failed to do so and ''violation took place on an international basis.'' **********TEXT OF SOUTH AFRICA BAN **********JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 2 (UPI) - Following is the text on the restrictions of news coverage of unrest in South Africa, as published today by the Government: **********JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 2 (UPI) - Following is the text on the restrictions of news coverage of unrest in South Africa, as published today by the Government: **********Prohibition in respect of certain films, representations and sound recordings: **********1.

Hartley, Unocal's chairman, said the company was also considering a direct distribution of partnership units to shareholders as an enhancement of shareholder value. **********The Pickens group responded by saying it would have to know more about the structure of the partnership before commenting on the impact on its plans. **********45% of Proven Reserves **********The proposal, which is expected to be approved by Unocal's board, would place 45 percent of the company's domestic proven oil and gas reserves into the new partnership. The company had said in legal documents on Tuesday that it might take this course to prevent the company's takeover by Mr. Pickens. **********The sale of units in the partnership, which is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, would bring Unocal the cash to buy up some of its shares in order to prevent a collapse in the stock price that could follow a defeat of the Pickens offer. Unocal wants to avoid a stock drop because that could leave the company vulnerable to a later takeover attempt by Mr. Pickens, or others. **********Unocal's plans ''are a step in the right direction,'' commented Lawrence Speidel, senior vice president of Batterymarch Financial Management, which owns 1.5 million Unocal shares. ''It was clear the company had to do something beyond its poison pill offer.'' **********Negative Reactions **********Institutional investors have reacted negatively to Tuesday's Unocal offer to exchange $72 worth of debt for 49.9 percent of Unocal's shares if Mr. Pickens was successful in gaining control of the first 50.1 percent of the company's stock. He is bidding $54 a share. Some of the investors had said they would join in a lawsuit against the company if Mr. Pickens, chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company, was defeated and the stock declined sharply. Before Mr. Pickens began buying Unocal shares, the stock was trading at about $35 a share. **********The Unocal plan to sell or possibly distribute partnership units is a direct challenge to Mr. Pickens, because in other takeover attempts of major oil companies he has argued that similar action to enhance shareholder value should have been taken. **********Spinning off income-producing assets, such as oil reserves, increases value, some analysts say, because such assets are often carried on the company's books at prices below their true worth. Selling them for cash, or allowing the income to flow directly to shareholders, maximizes that value, they add. **********'An Attempt to Confuse' **********David Batchelder, chief financial officer of Mesa, said, ''This is an attempt to confuse the issue by placing a carrot in front of shareholders in hopes that they will forget about the poison pill.'' He said it was irrelevant whether the assets to be placed in the partnership might be valued on the company's books at less than they are worth, saying ''shareholders don't look at book value anyway.'' **********He added, ''We're glad to see Mr. Hartley talking about enhancing shareholder value, but he doesn't presently intend to distribute the units to shareholders, which is the most important thing.'' Historically, Mr. Batchelder said, such limited trusts and partnerships were set up when there were more favorable tax advantages. The 1984 tax act removed most of the incentive for doing so, he said. **********Securities analysts also said it was too early to assess the partnership plan. ''There are jillions of questions to be answered,'' said Bernard J. Picchi of Salomon Brothers Inc. The company's announcement yesterday, he added, did not specify how much of the designated assets would actually be sold and how much would be retained by the company as general partner in the partnership. **********Big Board Listing **********According to the company's plan, 45 percent of Unocal's total domestic proven reserves would form the assets of a Master Limited Partnership, to be named Union Exploration Partners Ltd. Units in the partnership would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. **********In active trading yesterday, Unocal's stock rose 75 cents, to close at $47.50 a share, its high for the day. The company's announcement came shortly before the close of trading on the Big Board. **********The Unocal plan is not conditional on the success or failure of Mr. Pickens's takeover bid, nor does it change Unocal's anti-takeover maneuver, according to a company spokesman, Barry Lane."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/27/world/many-face-death-in-africa-un-says.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1985-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANY FACE DEATH IN AFRICA, U.N.

SAYS", "body_text": " **********United Nations officials say that despite the easing of the agricultural situation in Ethiopia and other drought-afflicted countries, many thousands of Africans may die of starvation or related diseases next year if aid efforts prove inadequate. **********Reports from two United Nations agencies in recent days have also cited grave problems that linger in parts of the continent that were afflicted with drought and hunger in 1984 and earlier this year. **********These problems include enclaves of severe deprivation that persist, notably in the Sudan and Ethiopia; the weakened and disease-prone condition of famine survivors, and the plight of three million displaced people, most of them virtually destitute. **********Maurice F. Strong, executive coordinator of the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa, said that, with 19 million Africans still in danger of death from hunger and related illness, ''real suffering is continuing on a massive scale; if people don't get the assistance they need, this could give rise to deaths in the tens of thousands or, conceivably, in the hundreds of thousands'' next year. **********Death Toll Under 500,000 **********The office's director, Bradford Morse, also cited weather as a variable in the situation. He said he thought the death toll in 1985, after drought depleted earlier harvests, was less than 500,000. **********Mr. Strong, a Canadian who was formerly president of the Canadian International Development Agency, said relief efforts in 1986 ''will be more difficult in many ways than in 1985 - even though the amount involved is less.'' The Office for Emergency Operations in Africa has calculated that $1.03 billion worth of aid from outside Africa is needed for 1986 - down from almost $3 billion in 1985. **********In interviews at United Nations headquarters, Mr. Morse, Mr. Strong and other officials elaborated on predictions that next year's efforts will be administratively more complex than this year's, requiring a higher percentage of cash and other nonfood aid. **********The officials also restated the worry, widespread among relief experts, that future relief efforts will be curbed by dwindling public and governmental sympathy outside Africa. The Office of Emergency Operations has estimated that more than 30 million Africans faced immediate starvation early this year. **********Emergency Remains in 6 Nations **********Mr. Morse reported last week that of the 20 nations ravaged by the recent drought, 6 still have emergency conditions. These are the Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde and Mozambique. Swift additional assistance is required in several other countries, he said. **********The checkerboard pattern of suffering that the experts describe prevails despite their projections that the 20 countries' total food grain production will soar to more than 30 million tons in 1986, up from less than 20 million in 1985. **********Even the bumper harvests have caused problems. A recent study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported that financial aid is now necessary to help channel and absorb an unusual crop surplus in the Sudan and in some other countries. The organization estimated that the Sudan's food grain output reached a record 4.6 million tons this year, up from 1.5 million tons in 1984, but it reported that the country would nonetheless also require emergency aid next year for its ''displaced and drought-affected'' population. **********Mr. Strong said that in the Sudan there are four million people who may die, down from the more than eight million facing starvation in the country earlier this year. **********Ethiopia Crop Estimate **********In Ethiopia, the F.A.O.'s preliminary estimate was that the latest crop would amount to 5.8 million tons, which is 800,000 tons less than the 1981-83 average. **********The organization's report said that in Ethiopia, too, ''displaced and drought-affected'' people would need emergency assistance in 1986. **********In other countries of eastern Africa, it reported, ''the food supply position is back to normal.'' In West Africa it estimated that the total food grain output of seven formerly drought-affected countries had soared to 6.7 million tons - also a record - more than half again as much as in the previous year. **********Nevertheless, in the Sudan and in other hard-hit areas, Mr. Strong said, ''the people involved are in a weakened and vulnerable condition as a result of the cumulative effect of malnutrition and hunger.'' **********In a Dec. 1 status report made public last week, the United Nations Office for Emergency Operations in Africa said, ''even prior to the 1984-85 emergency, the nutritional status of the affected people was poor.'' It added, ''The health situation of many children and elderly people is precarious.'' **********In Somalia as well as the Sudan and Ethiopia, the status report said, the plight of a total of more than one million refugees and former refugees is critical. **********In addition, the status report said, in the countryside in several parts of northwest and north central Africa ''grasshopper and grain-eating bird infestations have occurred'' and urgently need combating with chemicals and pesticides."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/29/business/foreign-prop-for-us-issues.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1985-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOREIGN PROP FOR U.S. ISSUES", "print_headline": "FOREIGN PROP FOR U.S. ISSUES", "body_text": " **********Foreign buying of Treasury securities has helped keep a lid on American interest rates the last few years, as overseas purchases helped finance the Federal budget deficit and reduced the amount of securities to be absorbed by domestic investors. **********But recently, as the value of the dollar has fallen, government securities dealers have begun to worry that foreign investors will become less willing to buy Treasury securities. Those concerns have been an important reason why prices have declined enough so that yields on Treasury notes and bonds have climbed about four-tenths of a percentage point since July 17. **********The 9 7/8 percent notes due in 1990, for example, were yielding about 9.98 percent late Friday, up from 9.53 percent, while the 11 1/4 percent bond due in 2015 was at 10.74 percent, up from 10.31 percent. **********While a lessening of foreign demand is a serious matter, many analysts said it would be premature to conclude that it had dried up for a long spell. They agreed that demand from overseas had been weak recently but added that there had been little outright selling of Treasury issues by overseas investors. **********Weaker Demand Acknowledged **********Masanobu Takeda, vice president at the New York branch of the Sanwa Bank Ltd., acknowledged that demand for Treasury issues from Japanese investors had recently weakened. But he estimated that, over a longer period, ''the share of their investments in United States securities will not be greatly reduced.'' **********Because Japanese institutions have such large amounts of available funds, they will continue to invest in foreign markets where yields are higher than in Japan. Thus, while Japanese investors are becoming more interested in securities denominated in currencies other than dollars, Mr. Takeda said funds would still be available for new investments in dollar-denominated securities. **********''The United States bond market is very fragile before the Treasury refunding, and many Japanese investors are just waiting for lower prices in a week or two weeks,'' he said. **********Guy I. Burgun, president of Swiss Bank Corporation International Securities, New York, said, ''I don't think there has yet been any real fundamental change in the attitude of foreign investors,'' adding that ''if there were a fundamental change, we would have seen much more selling'' of Treasury issues. **********Market Volatility Cited **********''As long as the currency markets are volatile, and the dollar is falling, people say, 'Why buy now?' '' Mr. Burgun said. He also cited the heavy supply of Treasury issues to be sold in early August and the lack of agreement on a budget package to reduce the Federal deficit as reasons why potential foreign buyers had recently been on the sidelines. **********Looking ahead, Mr. Burgun said that the weakness in the dollar need not continue and might be overdone. Comparing the American unemployment rate of 7.2 percent with the unemployment of more than 10 percent in many European countries, he concluded that other countries might take actions to keep their currencies from rising in value too much. ''How will they address the imbalances in their economies, and where will they sell their goods if they allow their currencies to strengthen?'' he asked. **********Besides injecting a new element of uncertainty into the outlook for interest rates, the activities of foreign investors are changing the way government securities are traded. While New York is still the center of the market, handling most of the more than $70 billion of trades arranged daily, markets for Treasury securities are also developing in London and Tokyo. Market participants estimate that average daily trading in Tokyo is $1 billion, and half that amount in London. **********Cantor, Fitzgerald Push **********Tomorrow evening, the Cantor, Fitzgerald Securities Corporation will give the Treasury market another push toward becoming a 24-hour, global market when it starts brokering trades in New York during the hours the Tokyo market is open. Cantor is not the only broker in London or Tokyo, but it is the largest broker to act as middleman for trades between firms that are not primary dealers in government securities. **********''We perceive a real need for servicing the market during Tokyo hours for Tokyo dealers,'' said Harry Needleman, general counsel at Cantor. New York-based securities dealers objected in 1983 when Cantor proposed keeping its New York office open during London trading hours, causing Cantor to revise its operations so that brokering was done in London, while the New York office remained closed. **********Mr. Needleman said that some dealers ''are still not enamored with the idea of longer New York hours, but the majority felt that the time had come for a change and recognized that this is not a 9-to-5 market.'' **********After the startup of its Tokyo operations tomorrow evening, Cantor will be brokering Treasury securities around the clock, except for an interval of no more than two hours between the close of the New York market and the opening of the Tokyo market. In New York time, the firm will broker Treasury securities for the domestic market from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. or 6 P.M., followed by Tokyo trading from 7:30 P.M. to 3 A.M., and London trading from 3 A.M. to 9 A.M."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/02/business/italy-s-retail-prices-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy's Retail Prices Up", "print_headline": "Italy's Retail Prices Up", "body_text": " **********Consumer prices in Italy rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in March from February and were up 8.6 percent from March 1984, the Government reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/business/business-people-angus-chairman-seeks-nutrasweet.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   Angus Chairman Seeks Nutrasweet", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   Angus Chairman Seeks Nutrasweet", "body_text": " **********Roger Secrist, chairman and chief executive officer of the Angus Chemical Company, is bidding for one of the hottest items in the sweetener business.

Its constant and sometimes hyperbolic appearance in advertisements and promotions for new residential developments can confuse even the most hardened housing shopper as to what really is and is not new. **********In Manhattan's Greenwich Village, however, using it is no mistake. Here, in a well-preserved and long-romanticized section of the city, the first new condominium building ever constructed in the so-called heart of the Village, on Avenue of the Americas between Washington Place and Waverly Place, is nearing completion. In this location, one block west of Washington Square Park, any new building would be unique simply by virtue of its creation. **********The real questions, beginning when plans for the site were first presented, concerned how much originality would be allowed. In a community noted for its historic residential architecture, how modern would be too modern? And for the developer, would distinction - and thus easier condominium sales - lie in making the new building look more like its neighbors or less? **********Within those questions lie a maze of subissues and variables, from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which had to approve the design because the building is within the Greenwich Village Historic District, to the uncertain tastes of apartment shoppers, to the site itself, which is right above the Sixth Avenue subway tunnel. **********Indeed, there was nothing with which to compare the new building -the Village's only other new condominium project, a 22-story tower on Charles Street, has just begun construction and is outside the historic district, and a third is still being planned. So the Avenue of the Americas building evolved in a sort of vacuum, with all the questions appearing more difficult because they had never been asked before. For instance, should a new building be required to have ornate cornices and lintels, which were in vogue when most of the buildings in the Village were constructed? **********Now, although the building is still shrouded in scaffolding after more than a year of construction, some of the answers are beginning to emerge. Even uncompleted, the project apparently has already established what has been long believed but, until now, unproved: that once-bohemian Greenwich Village can support some of the most expensive housing anywhere in New York City. **********Apartments at Washington Court, as the project is called, are to sell for about $500 a square foot, or more than $400,000 for the smallest one-bedroom unit, when sales begin near the start of next year. Such prices compare with about $400 a square foot for many of the current projects on the Upper East Side and $350 or less at some new midtown and downtown apartment buildings. **********Moreover, according to James C. Stewart, president of Gilbert Charles Beylen, the sales agent for the Village project, a waiting list of 600 prospective buyers has been compiled over the last year - people who responded to a telephone number posted at the site. There will be only 28 apartments, ranging from 825 square feet to 1,600 square feet. **********There will also be 25,000 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor facing Avenue of the Americas, with projected rents of $125 a square foot. **********As for the architectural issues, they are still being debated. Both the developer, Philips International, a New York-based company primarily involved in commercial property -notably shopping centers - and the local community groups, led by an organization called the Village Coalition, have kept to their guns. **********Meanwhile, the design, having won approval from the Landmarks Commission, proceeds. It calls for a plain red-brick facade devoid of cornices and lintels but with a terra cotta trim. **********Philip Pilevsky, president of Philips, maintains that the project will make a positive contribution to the Village, in terms of both the new housing and the full block-front of commercial retail space that the building will feature on the avenue. Opponents do not deny that the building will have an impact, but they are less certain as to what it will be. **********''I would be delighted to find, when the scaffolding comes down, that it's a more elegant building than it seemed,'' said Martin Hutner, a member of the landmarks committee of Community Board 2 and a trustee of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. ''But now,'' he added, ''we can only hope.'' **********According to the project's architect, James Stewart Polshek, who is also the dean of the graduate school of architecture at Columbia University, the construction of Washington Court has been dictated by more than just esthetics. Because the building sits above a subway tunnel - the site was formerly a parking lot - lighter building materials such as glass were favored over brick to keep the weight down. And the pillars that support the six-story structure were built much closer together than they would otherwise be, so that each one supports a smaller proportion of the weight. **********The spacing of the pillars, although a result of engineering considerations, is also having an esthetic effect, said Mr. Polshek, who lives directly across the street from the new building. **********''The tight spacing of the pillars creates a rhythm,'' he said. ''It makes it look more like a set of row houses than one brick apartment building.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/05/business/data-bank-may-5-1985.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 782, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data Bank;   May 5, 1985", "print_headline": "Data Bank;   May 5, 1985", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/world/european-project-picks-up-support.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1985-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EUROPEAN PROJECT PICKS UP SUPPORT", "print_headline": "EUROPEAN PROJECT PICKS UP SUPPORT", "body_text": " **********A French plan to develop new European technologies, initially announced as a reaction to President Reagan's effort to develop a space-based missile defense system, has begun to take shape in the last few days, with Britain and West Germany indicating that they will take part. **********The project, which was given the name Eureka by its French sponsors, seems to have won support in other European capitals because it has taken on the character of a parallel project rather than an alternative to the American initiative. **********''We don't want Eureka to be seen as a European S.D.I.,'' a French official said, referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative, the $26 billion American research project popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' **********''It is a program to organize certain key technologies for the future, with both civilian and military uses,'' the French official added. **********'A Cluster of Ideas' **********A British official said: ''We expect that Eureka will become a reality. But it will become a reality as its concrete nature evolves. **********''Right now,'' the British official went on, ''it is a cluster of ideas focusing around the concept that industry in Britain, France, Germany and other countries can do better if their cooperation is enhanced.'' **********This week, both Britain and West Germany, after an intense French diplomatic effort, said they favored closer European technical cooperation. The two countries apparently overcame earlier anxieties that France was pressing its European partners to make a choice between Eureka and the ''Star Wars'' research project. **********Three days ago, France and Britain announced they would set up a team of experts to talk about specific projects that might be carried out under the Eureka banner. The West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, apparently referring to the French proposal, said in a speech here this week that Europe needed to ''pool its technological capabilities in order to remain a partner of the United States on equal terms.'' **********No Money Yet Allocated **********For the moment, Eureka nonetheless remains a vague idea, an intention rather than a concrete set of projects. No money has been allocated, no contracts have been signed, and even the administrative structure remains undecided. Officials said one possible structure would be a small secretariat. Other suggestions include the creation of permanent working groups of Government and industry officials from each country or a new agency in the European Economic Community. **********Nonetheless, the move toward acceptance of the project seems a success for the Government of President Francois Mitterrand, which made its proposal out of a concern that the resources to be devoted to the American antiballistic missile research program would cause a European brain drain and increase the American technological advantage over Europe. **********At the meeting of the major industrial nations in Bonn this month, Mr. Mitterrand rejected an American invitation for France to take part in ''Star Wars'' research. He said European participation would be restricted to subcontracting. **********French arms industry specialists have argued that the role envisioned for European industry in ''Star Wars'' research would be limited to specialized items and would not provide a genuine transfer of technology. **********''Subcontracting is not going to teach us anything,'' a French military specialist said. ''It's not going to get us into the areas that we are most interested in.'' **********Strategic Benefits Doubted **********At the same time, France has been the most outspoken European ally in expressing doubts about the strategic benefits of the ''Star Wars'' program. The French argue that building a shield in space against ballistic missiles would weaken deterrence and begin a new cycle in the arms race. **********It was out of all these concerns, French officials say, that the Eureka idea was born. Last month, letters from the French Foreign Ministry were circulated to all members of the Common Market, suggesting the high technology project and offering to send teams of specialists to formulate specific projects. **********In the last two weeks, 10 major projects have been suggested, in two broad areas: communications and information processing, and manufacturing methods, including such matters as robotics and integrated plants. **********Among other areas reportedly under consideration are a large European computer, high-powered lasers and electronic sensors.

The officials said the Administration would like to bring military aid up to about $200 million and add at least $100 million in economic assistance. **********Recent United States intelligence assessments have reported that El Salvador's President, Jose Napoleon Duarte, is confronted by the most serious threat to his Government since he took office last June, the officials said. **********Problems for Duarte **********The problems include tenuous support in the military command for his peace initiative, resentment among civilian leaders over an effort to help his son seek re-election as Mayor of San Salvador and the possibility that right- wing parties could build upon their control over the legislative assembly in March elections. **********Although the Reagan Administration obtained Congressional approval in October for almost all the aid it requested for El Salvador in fiscal year 1985 - the first time Congress did not make significant cuts in proposed aid to El Salvador - officials say they believe additional money is required. **********Decision Is Not Final **********L. Craig Johnstone, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central America, said in an interview that a supplemental aid request, with an emphasis on economic assistance, ''would clearly be desirable.'' **********He added, however, that there had been no final decision, partly because of overall budget constraints. **********Other officials said a request for additional aid would almost surely be submitted to Congress within the next two months, in part to demonstrate strong support for Mr. Duarte. **********Last year, the President's commission on Central America, led by Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, recommended providing El Salvador with a total of $400 million in military aid in 1984 and 1985. **********Mr. Johnstone said any additional military aid would focus on trying to improve the mobility of Salvadoran forces and enhance battlefield communications. Last year, the United States doubled the size of the Salvadoran helicopter fleet. **********Congress Made Cuts at First **********In the fiscal year 1984, Congress initially made deep cuts in the Administration's request for El Salvador, but ended up approving two supplemental appropriations that brought total economic assistance to $329 million and military support to $196 million. The level of military aid was more than double the amount approved in 1983. **********The outlook for Congressional approval of extra aid this year appears uncertain. Representative Michael D.

''Since this is a case where they can't argue that Congress was not generous, I think a request for supplemental aid would be very closely scrutinized.'' **********Doubts Among Officers **********The concern about Mr. Duarte's position stems, in part, from the historically uneasy relationship between civilian and military leaders in El Salvador, Administration officials said. **********Although Mr. Duarte has received support from key military leaders for peace talks with guerrillas that began in October, Administration officials said, intelligence reports indicated that there were increasing doubts about the negotiations in the armed forces, especially among officers close to conservative political parties. **********The negotiations stalled after two meetings between the Governmment and guerrillas. Salvadoran officials said recently that it was unlikely Mr. Duarte would pursue the peace talks until after elections are held in March. **********Duarte's First Veto **********Reagan Administration officials said Mr. Duarte provoked considerable anger among civilian leaders in December when he vetoed clauses in an electoral law approved by the legislative assembly that would have prevented his son, Alejandro, from seeking re- election as Mayor of San Salvador. It was the first time Mr. Duarte had used his veto power. **********The veto also blocked provisions in the law that would have made it easier for conservative parties to form an alliance against the Christian Democratic Party, which Mr. Duarte represents. **********These problems, Administration officials said, could be compounded by the election in March of a strong conservative majority in the legislative assembly. The elections are for the national assembly and municipal offices. **********Conservative parties, led by the National Republican Alliance, better known as Arena, have a working majority in the assembly, but lack absolute control. Recent United States intelligence reports said that a major election victory by conservatives in March was possible and that such a victory could further isolate Mr. Duarte politically, according to Administration officials. **********Success by conservatives in the elections, the officials said, might embolden conservative military commanders to oppose Mr. Duarte. **********'Always Cause for Anxiety' **********But Mr. Johnstone said Mr. Duarte's position did not appear to be seriously threatened at the moment. ''There's always cause for anxiety in El Salvador,'' Mr. Johnstone said. **********He added that Mr. Duarte's position today seemed to be ''much more secure'' than most people would have anticipated nine months ago. **********In general, Mr. Johnstone said, the Administration is encouraged by long- term developments in El Salvador. ''We're quite satisfied with the course of events,'' Mr. Johnstone said. **********Citing what he said was the strengthening of democratic rule, a reduction in death-squad killings and improved performance by the Salvadoran military, he said the situation in El Salvador had reached a level of stability and progress that the Administration originally projected for 1988. **********Many Administration officials, however, are concerned that El Salvador remains a potential tinderbox, and they say they see no end in sight for the need for United States aid. **********Nicaragua-Salvador Connection **********Mr. Johnstone said the United States would have to maintain the current level of aid to El Salvador as long as Nicaragua continues to provide support to Salvadoran guerrillas. **********The Administration has maintained since 1981 that Nicaragua is a main source of military aid to Salvadoran guerrillas. **********Mr. Johnstone said the Administration was frustated by the failure of Congress to approve aid to Nicaraguan rebels. Without pressure from the rebels against the Sandinistas, officials say, it will be harder to end the civil war in El Salvador. **********When the Administration asks Congress to resume aid to the Nicaraguan rebels later this year, State Department and Pentagon officials said, the connection between Nicaragua and El Salvador will be stressed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/03/business/purchasers-see-slump-persisting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PURCHASERS SEE SLUMP PERSISTING", "print_headline": "PURCHASERS SEE SLUMP PERSISTING", "body_text": " **********The economy weakened further in August, with no sign of improvement for the rest of the year, according to a report being released today by a national group of purchasing managers. **********New orders, the source of future production, remained virtually unchanged last month, and overall inventory levels increased, the National Association of Purchasing Management said. Vendor deliveries were faster and no items were reported in short supply, an indication that demand was not strong. And, after rising in June and July, employment fell. **********For the seventh consecutive month, the purchasing managers' composite index of indicators fell, although slightly. It slipped to 46.7 percent, from 46.8 percent in July. A reading below 50 percent generally indicates that the economy is contracting; above 50 percent means that it is expanding. The index is a broad measure adjusted for seasonal variation. **********The report, based on a survey of purchasing managers at 250 major companies representing 21 industries, is viewed as an early indicator of future economic activity. **********Nothing 'to Smile About' **********''I wish I could be more optimistic about the economy, but I don't see anything to smile about in the next two or three months,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc., the office-equipment company based in Stamford, Conn. ''The only hope is that we are stuck in the summer doldrums, but because new orders are down, I'm not really encouraged by that possibility.'' **********For the third month in a row, new orders continued flat in August. That is based on 26 percent of the survey respondents reporting an improvement and 26 percent reporting a decline. **********Production increased, with 21 percent of the purchasers indicating that their output was up, compared with 14 percent in the previous month. But many members also noted that this improvement was merely the result of plants starting up after being shut down in July. And for the second consecutive month, more respondents reported production had declined - 23 percent - than those reporting an improvement. **********Fourteen percent of the purchasers said inventory levels were up in August, as against 13 percent in the previous month, with many respondents indicating that they had been unable to cut back shipments quickly enough to match slowing demand. The speed at which vendors came through with their orders also picked up for the second consecutive month, with three times as many purchasers reporting faster rather than slower deliveries compared to July. **********Employment Drop **********As for employment, a significant drop was observed. Only 9 percent of the members reporting said they had increased hiring, compared to 14 percent in July, and 27 percent said hiring had decreased, versus 20 percent previously. **********For the ninth month in a row, more purchasers found prices declining. Looking at specific commodities, the survey noted that two items, resins and phenol, an ingredient of resins used in housing and automobile production, were up in price. But commodities declining in price included aluminum, steel, integrated circuits, corn, wheat, soybean oil, fuel oil, natural gas, corrugated shipping containers, folding cartons and caustic soda, which is used in petroleum refining and paper making. **********For the seventh consecutive month, no items were reported in short supply - another reflection of declining demand. **********Capital Outlays **********In answer to a special question, 32 percent of the purchasers said that their 1985 capital outlays would be lower than originally planned, while 16 percent said they would be higher. Of those indicating higher spending, 21 percent cited belief in an improving economy as the reason; 14 percent said their companies were trying to beat a deadline in the Reagan Administration's proposed tax changes regarding capital investments, and 21 percent claimed both. **********August's report, Mr. Bretz said, was also notable for the number of survey respondents who cited competition from imports as a major factor in their economic problems. **********''Many industries report being hurt by the high level of imports, which are causing lower sales, lower selling prices and lower profits,'' he said, noting that many of the complaints came from companies that make tires, textiles, lumber, shoes, aluminum, and farm and road construction equipment. **********''Many of our industries are simply unable to compete,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/31/business/bankamerica-revamps-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BankAmerica Revamps Unit", "print_headline": "BankAmerica Revamps Unit", "body_text": " **********The BankAmerica Corporation announced today a major restructuring and streamlining of its World Banking division, which serves large corporate customers and foreign governments.

He said that China had learned its lesson from history and the nation's one billion people would allow no retreat. **********Text Displayed Prominently **********''No country can now develop by closing its door,'' Mr. Deng said in the speech, which was given on Oct. 22. ''We suffered from this, and our forefa thers suffered from this,'' he declared. ''Isolation landed China in poverty, backwardness and ignorance.'' **********The 6,000-word speech was given front-page display in the New Year issues of most major Chinese newspapers and also appeared in a 72-page booklet of Mr. Deng's pronouncements over the last two years that went on sale across the country. **********The booklet included other previously unpublished texts and many of these, like the speech to the Central Advisory Commission, a group of party elders that Mr. Deng heads, dealt with the opening to the West and policies associated with it, such as the tolerance of some private enterprise. **********Two Groups Resisting Change **********The October speech appeared to have been aimed at two domestic groups that have offered resistance to the policy changes: officials within the party who fear that Marxism is being rejected and army leaders who see the emphasis on civilian economic growth as undermining military power. Parts of Mr. Deng's argument on this latter point became available last weekend through the official New China News Agency, which carried excerpts from the January issue of the party's theoretical journal, Red Flag. **********After five years in power, Mr. Deng has recently shown signs of impatience with resistance to his changes from within the party, and one explanation for the release of the documents now was that he wanted to develop popular support. **********A similar boldness has been shown recently by associates of Mr. Deng in pushing for the relaxation of policies that have not been publicly challenged since the 1950's, such as the insistence on the universal validity of Marxism and the party's right to punish errant writers. **********In the October speech Mr. Deng said that great suffering had befallen China as a result of the decision to close the door to the world during the Ming dynasty, which ran from the 14th to the 17th centuries. **********'Not Much Progress' After '66 **********Efforts to open up were made after the Opium War with Britain in the 1840's and again after the Communist takeover in 1949, he said, but the contacts then were limited to the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe. In 1966 the Cultural Revolution began and the door was again closed, and ''not much progress was made after that,'' he said. **********''We say that China will continue to draw on foreign capital and practice an open policy for a long time to come,'' Mr. Deng asserted. He said that the policy was essential to the goal of a fourfold increase in China's gross national product, to $1,000 billion, by the year 2000. **********''Even after that is accomplished there will be new goals that require an open policy,'' he said. **********Mr. Deng said that some ranking party figures worried that China would become ''capitalist,'' uprooting a lifetime's work for Communism. But there is no need for concern, he said, since the basic means of production will remain in state hands and there will be ''no new bourgeoisie.'' **********Capitalism 'Cannot Harm Us' **********''I am afraid that some of our old comrades have this fear, that after a generation of Socialism and Communism it is unacceptable to sprout some capitalism,'' he said. ''It cannot harm us, it cannot harm us,'' he declared. **********On the question of military power, subject to a strict budget holddown for five years, Mr. Deng said that economic growth was fundamental to national strength and that quadrupling the gross national product by the end of the century would make the country ''really powerful, exerting a much greater influence internationally.'' **********With only 5 percent of the GNP devoted to military spending in 2000, he said, the budget could rise to $50 billion, making it possible to acquire ''a few more atomic bombs, missiles and equipment.'' **********''It will be easier then,'' he added. **********Role of Others Stressed **********Mr. Deng seemed at pains to stress that the changes were not his alone. He said that in 1983 he had personally done ''one thing,'' pressing a crackdown on criminals, estimated by Western diplomats to have resulted in 5,000 to 10,000 executions so far. In 1984, he said, his contributions were the agreement with Britain for the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 and the opening of an additional 14 coastal cities to special foreign investment arrangements. **********''The rest was done by others,'' he said, citing in particular the long Central Committee decree of Oct. 20 laying down the nation's new urban programs. He said he had ''not written one word of the document nor revised so much as one word in it,'' an assertion that seemed intended to shift some of the responsibility to his closest associates, the party's General Secretary, Hu Yaobang, and Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang. **********As for his own future, he said, ''I hope gradually to do no work at all but still have good health.'' **********Job Still Unfinished **********''Then I can say I have fulfilled my task,'' he continued. ''It seems that I still have to do something at present.'' **********Mr. Deng avoided the formal title of party leader after regaining power in 1979 because he wanted to emphasize the need to promote a new generation of party leaders, and this was another important point of his address. He told the party leaders that emphasis should now lie on promoting officials 30 to 40 years old rather than those in their 50's, some of whom he said were competent but had the drawback that they would be in their 60's within a decade. **********He said that ''developed countries,'' meaning mainly those of the West and Japan, had lessons for China, as did some ''third world'' nations with governments composed mainly of men in their 30's. In China, the younger generation may lack experience but it will become competent after a few years, Mr. Deng said. He noted that he was only 45 when he became one of the country's top leaders in 1949. **********''If this problem is not solved, we would commit a great error.'' he said. ''We must take this road.'' **********Offer to Taiwan Repeated **********Mr. Deng also spoke of Taiwan and the opportunity for reunifying the country presented in the ''one country, two systems'' policy adopted for Hong Kong, which will become part of China while retaining its capitalist system. Addressing himself to Taiwan's leaders, who have rejected the formula, he said: ''By following the concept of 'one country, two systems,' you don't swallow me up nor I you. Isn't that good enough?'' **********The booklet also included remarks Mr. Deng made to a group of American university professors 18 months ago. Asked if the West could be sure that there would be no political upheaval here, he replied : **********''The United States brags about its political system, but the President says one thing during the election, something else when he takes office, something else at midterm and something else when he leaves. The Americans say our policies are unstable, but compared to theirs, ours are much more stable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/08/world/rene-portocarrero.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RENE PORTOCARRERO", "print_headline": "RENE PORTOCARRERO", "body_text": " **********Rene Portocarrero, considered Cuba's finest modern artist, died today at the age of 73, the state-run press agency Prensa Latina reported. **********No cause of death was given, but family members told reporters it was probably related to burns the frail artist suffered in a kitchen accident about a week ago. **********Mr. Portocarrero was best known for his abstract portraits of women in tropical settings of flowers, birds and trees.

Not only is it near a number of universities, but it is a subway ride from major users, such as Wall Street and  publishing. ''It amazes me that this didn't become the high-tech center,'' Mr. Collado said. **********That is an oversight that Mr. Collado, a 31-year-old engineer who has worked  for the likes of the GTE Corporation and the ITT Corporation, and Mr. Morales, a 32-year-old with a degree in sociology and economics from Harvard University, are trying to correct. They are the top executives and two of the six partners of Protocom Devices, a small company that has refined a device allowing otherwise incompatible mainframe computers to communicate with each other. Customers include Boeing Computer Systems, the Paradyne Corporation and Citibank. **********Since October, Protocom has been turning out its leading-edge hardware from headquarters near Bruckner Boulevard and 137th Street, just a couple of blocks from Mr. Collado's first home. Mr. Morales was born in Puerto Rico, but his family stopped off in the Bronx before settling in East Harlem. The two met in sixth grade at Monsignor Kelly Junior High School, then a school for bright but  disadvantaged boys on the Upper West Side. **********Varied Backgrounds **********After Harvard, Mr. Morales worked as a consultant to various city and state agencies, and returned to East Harlem to do community organizing. By 1983, he was in operations at the Prudential Insurance Company of America. **********Mr. Collado went to Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, then to a series of jobs  in Silicon Valley and Arizona. It should have been a software engineer's dream.  ''I had my company car and my stock options,'' he said. At ITT in Scottsdale, ''They told me, 'You're in God's country.' '' **********But like many New Yorkers, Mr. Collado felt there was something fundamentally wrong with a town where ''you couldn't get lunch delivered,'' he said. ''You couldn't get a good bagel or a good Chinese meal.'' **********Advantages of South Bronx **********To listen to Mr. Collado and Mr. Morales is to hear the kind of boosterism that, like high technology, is most often found in California. They like to point out that the South Bronx is an easy commute from middle-class enclaves in  New Jersey and elsewhere. They note that the neighborhood has plenty of parking  spaces, an advantage somehow overlooked by most companies. Even the climate is better. ''When we get off a plane from California, we breathe the air,'' Mr. Collado said. Their wives think they are crazy, the men said. **********By early 1983, Mr. Collado had moved to New Jersey and Timeplex Inc., a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. He and two other engineers, who are also now partners in Protocom, began work on a ''pad'' - a packet assembler/disassembler that packages information in a form that can be transmitted through a computer network between computers made by different manufacturers. **********According to a venture capitalist who is familiar with the company, the potential market for pads could be in the billions of dollars. If Protocom does  well, the company could achieve sales of $100 million or more, according to this source. **********At the moment, that seems light-years away. In the fiscal year ended last January, Protocom had a payroll of 13 employees in the Bronx, sales of about $1.3 million and a profit of $80,000. This looks like a $7 million year, and the company will need 55 employees, management said. **********Tolerant Vendors **********Protocom's first offices, improbably, were in borrowed quarters on Putnam Avenue in Greenwich, Conn., just down the street from the Ann Taylor, a fashionable women's clothing store. (''Very hotsy-totsy,'' said Mr. Collado.) Initially, Protocom depended for its cash flow on tolerant vendors, who forgave late payments because they had confidence in the product - not because the company's minority ownership appealed to their conscience, Mr. Collado said. **********The partners wanted to move to the Bronx, but Protocom needed Government assistance and someone expert at untangling the red tape. So Mr. Collado called  Mr. Morales, his old friend from Monsignor Kelly. **********''Ralph told me, 'We've got to show the world that people like us come out of the South Bronx,' '' Mr. Morales recalled. ''He didn't scare easily,'' said Mr.  Collado.  Why a high-technology company would want to be in the South Bronx was  a puzzlement to most people. One investment banker told them, ''You guys have a  good thing,'' but warned that it would come to grief in the South Bronx. Others  recommended Boston's Route 128. **********Even executives at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey expressed surprise. When Mr. Morales approached the Port Authority about financing a move, ''One had to ask, 'Why?' '' recalled Anthony Giordano, chief of industrial parks development. **********Another Move Soon **********In the end, the Port Authority loaned Protocom $4.4 million. The company rented incubator space from the South Bronx Development Organization. Next spring, it is scheduled to move to Bathgate Industrial Park, the new industrial  complex being erected in the South Bronx by the Port Authority and the Public Development Corporation. ''We fully expect they'll create 200 jobs,'' said Mr. Giordano. **********In the meantime, the company is doing what it can to bring together minorities and technology. It is training some students at Cooper Union and Manhattan College in Protocom technology. Mr. Collado has had discussions - ''interfaces,'' he calls them - with a handful of other small businesses about relocating to the South Bronx. Although Monsignor Kelly closed in 1972, a successor was opened last autumn. Protocom designated the new school as its ''official'' charity, and donated hardware and computers worth $50,000, Mr. Collado said. **********The hope is to provide ''a new model for success,'' Mr. Morales said. ''It's  not to grow up to be Walt Frazier, but to get on a plane and service a client, or to start your own company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/world/us-plans-military-exercise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Plans Military Exercise", "print_headline": "U.S. Plans Military Exercise", "body_text": " **********The Defense Department said today that United States and Canadian forces would hold an air defense exercise Sunday over North America.

He said the 22 others were to be let go because interrogations found that they had not done anything violent against the Israeli Army. **********In Blue Jogging Suits **********The freed men - 26 Shiite Moslems and five Sunni Moslems - in dark-colored jogging suits with red stripes, sat on the floor of Israeli Army trucks with their hands bound by nylon cord for the ride into Lebanon. **********One of the prisoners told reporters that they had been unaware of the hijacking of the Trans World Airlines jet in Athens and subsequent taking of hostages. **********Israeli military sources said again today that Israel would release more prisoners through Israeli legal procedures and in light of the security situation in southern Lebanon, but without regard to the Beirut hijackers' demands. Still, senior officials here said they were not pleased by the results of the ''feeler'' they sent to Mr. Berri by freeing the 31 prisoners. **********''We wanted to see if Berri is really in charge of the situation,'' a senior official said. ''But from what he said about not having all of the hostages under control it appears that he is not. In other words, we can release and release and release and it doesn't mean anything. This only strengthens our feeling that we should hang tough with the Americans.'' **********Split Emerges in Israel **********It was clear from the stormy debate in the Israeli Cabinet Sunday over the prisoner release that a split was emerging in the Israeli leadership over how to handle the remaining prisoners in the context of the American hostages. **********Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, both of the Labor Party, want to take a tough line, while remaining flexible enough to send out feelers such as the prisoner release today that could break the deadlock and convince American public opinion that Israel is not an obstacle in releasing the hostages. **********By contrast, the Likud bloc, led by Minister of Commerce and Industry Ariel Sharon, Minister-Without-Portfolio Moshe Arens and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, argued in the Cabinet against the release of the 31 men. They called it a hasty decision that the terrorists would interpret as a sign of weakness, Cabinet sources said. The three men declared that no more detainees should be freed under any conditions until the American hostages were let go. **********This split at the top does not appear to run uniformly through the parties. The comments of some Labor members of Parliament and Cabinet ministers appeared today to lean toward the Likud line, while some Likud members seem to have more in common with the Peres-Rabin policy. **********A special, three-hour Cabinet session was held late Sunday night to debate the issue. As the daily Yediot Aharonot newspaper put it today: ''Two approaches to the episode were clearly drawn - one which supports taking into account American public opinion which expects a good-will gesture on the part of Israel by freeing the Shiites it holds in Atlit. The other approach is to take a tough stand without any compromise on the affair.'' **********Tense Relations Could Worsen **********The paper suggested that the already tense relations between the Likud and Labor ministers could worsen, maybe to the point of a Cabinet crisis, should the United States approach Israel and request officially that it free the remaining detainees demanded by the hijackers. **********So far, the Reagan Administration has insisted that it would not do that because it would be seen as giving in to the hijackers' demands. **********Speaking at a symposium on the Lebanon War at Tel Aviv University, Defense Minister Rabin conceded that the hijacking had ''strained relations'' between both Israel and the United States and Israel and the Shiite Amal organization, with which Israel had been trying to work out a tacit agreement to keep South Lebanon quiet after the nearly total pullout of the Israeli Army, the Israel radio reported. **********Mr. Rabin added, the radio said, that if ''terrorism'' from southern Lebanon escalated, Israel could be forced back into a ''direct confrontation'' in the area. **********Taken to Southern Lebanon **********As the trucks carrying the 31 Lebanese prisoners freed today rumbled out of the gates of Atlit Prison - which was originally built by the British to house illegal Jewish immigrants to Palestine before Israel's independence in 1948 -one of the detainees poked his head up over the back of the truck, raised his bound hands and clapped them together as best he could. **********The Israeli prisoner convoy drove the detainees across the border to the South Lebanese coastal village of Ras Bayada, about three miles north of the frontier on the western edge of Israel's self-declared security zone in South Lebanon. At the Ras Bayada checkpoint, the former prisoners emerged about 1 P.M. from the Israeli vehicles, shouting ''Allah akbar!'' God is great! according to reports from the scene. **********After being counted by a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the former detainees, many of them wearing beards, the traditional sign of Moslem piety, entered a yellow school bus chartered by the Red Cross.

E. Rhoads & Sons Inc., of Delaware, established in 1702. When President Washington wanted a gift for the Marquis de Lafayette he chose Number Six cologne, a scent still on sale at the nation's oldest apothecary, Caswell-Massey Company (1752), then of Newport, R.I. **********In a nation stirred by entrepreneurship, where 90 percent of start-up businesses fail within their first decade of existence, there are still almost 40 venerable companies that have operated since the time of the Revolution and the first Fourth of July. Some of these have scarcely changed in over two centuries: The nation's oldest undertaking concern, Kirk & Nice Inc. (1761), built coffins for the soldiers that were killed when George Washington lost the Battle of Germantown in 1777; today, a Kirk scion operates the funeral home on its original site near Philadelphia. **********Other companies loosened their family ties decades ago and evolved to match their changing markets. The Dexter Corporation (1767) in Windsor Locks, Conn., the oldest company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, started as a sawmill; now it makes specialty products for the aerospace, biotechnology and electronics industries. **********Occasionally, a popular product outlives its company. Baker's Chocolate (1780), was favored by colonial cooks, and sold in Abraham Lincoln's New Salem, Ill., grocery store in the 1830's. Today it remains a staple in well-stocked cupboards. The chocolate company itself was swallowed up by the General Foods Corporation in 1927, but the original Baker's logo is still in use. **********Certain lines of business have proved to be exceptionally durable. Time has not greatly changed the citizenry's need for news, insurance and the services of banks. Such companies are strongly represented on the 200-years-plus list: for example, the Franklin Printing Company (1728) and The Saturday Evening Post (1729), both founded by Benjamin Franklin; The Hartford (Conn.) Courant (1764); Presbyterian Ministers' Fund (1717); The Bank of New York (1784); First National Bank of Boston (1784). **********Etna M. Kelley, a Greenwich Village octogenarian who has been writing about business history for more than 30 years, has compiled her own list of the hardy. Retailing concerns tend to be among the long-lived, she says. Wholesalers, jobbers and supply companies - Barnett's Laundry & Dry Cleaning (1780), a cleaning products supplier, for one - tend to hang on because they can show high profitability with a small staff. **********An old company ''gets a solidity, a loyalty, especially if it's a family business,'' said Miss Kelley. Even if other management steps in, that internal cohesiveness helps the organization to carry on. Finally, according to Miss Kelley, for reasons unknown, funeral homes and seed companies, ''symbolic of death and life,'' seem to last a long time. **********The following five companies are a sampler of the perennials of American business. **********J. E. RHOADS & SONS **********Abigail Rhoads took over the tannery when her husband died in 1732, the year George Washington was born. J. E. Rhoads had already been in business in Marple, Pa., 12 miles from Philadelphia, for 30 years. **********''It was an extraordinary thing for her to carry on,'' said Richard H. Rhoads, a member of the seventh generation in the business, which is now based in Newark, Del. ''It was a sloppy, dirty job.'' **********During the Industrial Revolution the tannery began making leather beltings to be used in machinery and conveyor belts. Over the years, leather gave way to nylon and more recently, thermoplastics. **********Now the company has a modest $5 million in annual sales, but it claims its product touches the lives of nearly everyone. ''You don't eat a bagel or a bun'' that didn't move along a conveyor belt using Rhoads's industrial belting, boasted John P. McGough, president and chief executive officer, who joined the company in 1983, the first non-family member to head operations. **********The Rhoads family was always clear about its market niche and content with it. ''One paper machine may cost more than $2 million, but it will have under $25,000 worth of belting in it. That belting, however, is vital to the machine,'' said the late J. Edgar Rhoads, Richard Rhoads's cousin and predecessor as chairman, in an interview at the time of the Bicentennial, when he was 92. He said that the company had never been especially interested in broad expansion or diversification, and he attributed that attitude to the family's Quaker religion. ''For most of the company's history, the owners have seemed to consider the business more a means to an end than an end in itself.'' Family members occasionally took time off from the business to do public service work. **********Moreover, the Quaker influence has pervaded the company's business dealings. Rhoads always refused to do business with the military or with distilleries, although Mr. McGough said that policy could change. Mr. McGough, a non-Quaker, credits Quaker practices with creating an atmosphere of respect that smoothed over the inevitable strains in the course of 283 years. **********When Mr. Rhoads resigned as chairman 10 years ago, none of his three children wanted to work in the company (although a daughter joined later and is now a regional sales manager), so he was forced to go outside for new management. The company is ''very fortunate to have Jack McGough,'' said Mr. Rhoads, who still serves on the board. Nonetheless, Mr. Rhoads maintains that owner-management has been the great strength of the company; the grandchildren are expected to join the organization eventually. ''It's a great advantage when the ultimate responsibilities and the ultimate benefits are joined,'' Mr. Rhoads said. And in times of difficulty, ''family rallies around in a way that I think is rare for employees.'' **********LAIRD & COMPANY **********Applejack was the first spirit distilled in America. The Laird family of Scobeyville, N.J., began making the cider-based brandy in the early 1700's and served it at the Colt's Neck Inn, which is still flourishing. Around 1760, a Virginia farmer named George Washington wrote the family to request the recipe. The beverage became so popular that by 1780 the Lairds established a commercial distillery in back of the inn, which they bought that year but no longer own. **********Today, a house in Scobeyville, built in the 1740's to serve as the family home, holds Laird & Company's executive offices. Brandy accounts for only 5 percent of the company's $25 million in annual sales; the other 95 percent comes mainly from spirits sold under the Laird name and ''contract bottling'' for other manufacturers. **********Larrie Laird, the president, had to consult his daughter, Lisa Laird, the assistant treasurer, to confirm that he is, indeed, the eighth generation of Lairds to run the business. His nephew, John E. Laird 3d, is vice president. **********Members of the family ''always made an effort to dig into all aspects of the business,'' Mr. Laird said. ''Everybody. The officers are capable of doing anything, from fixing a machine to conducting a sales meeting. It's very important in a small company, in a family-run company.'' And when times are tough, he says, ''the family involvement gives an individual more incentive to survive and then to find new ways to grow.'' **********Prohibition presented the single greatest threat to the company. Adhering strictly to the new law, the family closed the distillery in 1920. Mr. Laird's father, John Evans Laird, played some professional baseball, then reopened the plant as a cider mill, making apple juice. In 1931, he obtained permission to produce apple brandy for medicinal purposes, so there was an aged product readying in the warehouse when Prohibition ended two years later. **********Mr. Laird acknowledges that the nepotism inherent in a family business can discourage talented outsiders from joining a company because they know they can only advance so far: ''It's a definite drawback. But people have come to work for us and used it as a stepping stone, and they can make a major contribution while they're here.'' The main thing, Mr. Laird said, is to realize from the start ''that we'll probably only get five to seven years before they move on'' and to learn from outsiders while they are around. **********KIRK & NICE **********October 4, 1777, is remembered forthe Battle of Germantown; Kirk & Nice cabinetmakers made coffins for many of the 152 Americans and 71 British who died that day. **********The company, which has been doing business on the same spot since 1761, was one of many early establishments that made the transition from building cabinets to building coffins, and then to conducting funerals. In Pennsylvania's Lancaster County today there are many funeral homes with furniture businesses still attached, says J. Malcolm Henderson, president and owner of Kirk & Nice. ''I wish we'd kept the furniture business.'' said Mr. Henderson, grandson to Benjamin Franklin Kirk, the last of the family cabinetmakers. **********Mr. Henderson recalled recently that as a youth he had ''no interest'' in the family funeral business. He hated the taunts in school when he told what his father did and he hated the awkward note it later added to social encounters. But he was the eighth generation and heir apparent. ''Dad had the kind of talk with me that fathers have with their sons - what a wonderful opportunity it was - and I changed my mind,'' he said quietly. **********But taking on the family business has not proved entirely burdensome to the reluctant heir. Owning Kirk & Nice has allowed him to pursue much that he does love. He became enthusiastic about American history, he says, when he saw how vivid it was in his own surroundings. The reception parlors of the funeral home itself, open to the public a few hours each week, are filled with museum-quality furnishings from the 18th and 19th centuries. **********History has been more than just furnishings, though. Mr. Henderson's grandfather Kirk sheltered runaway slaves in his house across the street as part of the underground railroad, and Mr. Henderson said, ''I know we buried Abraham Lincoln's secretary.'' **********Today Kirk & Nice handles about 500 funerals a year, about half the total of 25 years ago. As more black families have moved into the neighborhood, more local business has gone to black funeral directors, Mr. Henderson said. **********Although the Federal Trade Commission has had the funeral industry under scrutiny for some time now, government intervention has not affected the way Kirk & Nice does business, except for the increased paperwork. **********''What's upset some of the funeral directors is itemizing. But we've been itemizing ever since we were in business so it didn't upset us,'' said Mr. Henderson, recalling that his grandfather Kirk, in the late 19th century, successfully led the campaign for a code of ethics for undertakers and for state licensing. **********Mr. Henderson and his wife have no children. After they are gone, he expects the business to be sold, but he has incorporated the firm - a step which, under Pennsylvania law, insures at least a nominal continuity. With evident satisfaction, Mr. Henderson promised, ''The name of Kirk & Nice will continue.'' **********CASWELL-MASSEY **********At the apothecary shop on New York's Lexington Avenue, the flagship operation of the Caswell-Massey Company (1752), the wood-panelled shelves are laden with soothing lotions, scented powders and swansdown puffs with which to apply them. So it comes as a shock to meet the no-frills industrial utility of the company headquarters in Manhattan's Chelsea district. **********The contrast is intentional. Ralph Taylor, chairman, credits the company's enduring success to the balance it struck long ago between its fanciful products and the efficient way it provided them. **********The original apothecary shop was founded in Newport, R.I., by William Hunter, a physician who loved art. The nation's social aristocracy flocked to the resort city on Narragansett Bay, demanding the luxuries that their European cousins enjoyed, and the business prospered, catering to the whims of customers at home and abroad. Sarah Bernhardt, for example, ordered quantities of cucumber night cream shipped to her in Paris. **********As new partners came and went, the company's name kept changing, but eventually the names of Philip Caswell from 1840 and William Massey in 1870 were adopted permanently. Over the years, Caswell-Massey has combined family with a kind of professional continuity. The owner has always been someone who began at the bottom of the business and worked his way up. Mr. Taylor sweptthe shop floor as a boy. But family continuity may be making a comeback at the company today. Mr. Taylor, now in his 80s, and his brother Milton, the president, are bringing along Milton's two sons: Adam is vice president, and Joshua, reflecting the changing emphasis of the business, is trained as a perfumer. When they take over, they will be the first owners who are not professional chemists or pharmacists. **********Impending expansion will bring more changes to the company, which now posts $10 million in sales annually. There could be as many as four or five more company-owned stores by year-end, bringing the total to a dozen, Mr. Taylor estimates. But the new shops are not pharmacies; they are boutiques for cosmetics and toiletries. There will also be several more Caswell-Massey franchise stores, Mr. Taylor says, to total a dozen. **********When both company-owned stores and franchises total 100, Mr. Taylor said, ''We'll ask if we want any more. When there are too many ideas about aggrandizement, you lose the essential pleasure of running a business.'' He added, ''We don't want to expand too fast, or over-expand, but we are being pushed,'' indicating somewhat ruefully that success often generates its own pressure. **********BOWNE & COMPANY **********In a way, Bowne & Company (1775), one of the nation's largest financial printers has been trying to live down the reputation of its illustrious founder, Robert Bowne, a kind of Renaissance man of early American mercantilism. Besides building his own business, Mr. Bowne founded societies to help runaway slaves, establish public schooling, and support public health services. He also helped found the Bank of New York. **********But where Bowne, the man, reached repeatedly into new areas, Bowne, the company, has consistently narrowed its focus, even as it expanded its size, according to Carl Pite, vice president for finance. **********Bowne first opened for business a few blocks from Wall Street, selling writing paper, account books, quill pens, bolting cloths, furs, nails, and cutlery. When stationery sales rose and the company took on printing, a young associate, John Jacob Astor, broke away to pursue the fur trade independently. **********By the late 1820's, Bowne & Company made what Mr. Pite cites as its first major adaptation, becoming solely a printer and stationer. New York City had emerged as a great trading center, partly because the Erie Canal, which Robert Bowne had advocated, had opened a trade route to the western part of the country. The need for documentation to serve the seaport was enormous, and Bowne was positioned to fill it. **********More than a century later, when the Securities and Exchange Commission was established, Bowne was ready to print detailed prospectuses, and the company increasingly specialized in financial printing. The next big change was the decision to go public in 1968. This, Mr. Pite says, allowed Bowne to expand and set up subsidiary companies to serve commercial centers around the country and in Canada. **********The company had sales of $119.6 million in fiscal 1984, but Mr. Pite insists it still has ''a small company feeling.'' Each subsidiary president can act independently, ''as if he is running his own company,'' and he says this keeps morale very high. **********And finally, Bowne has computerized its printing processes. This change, according to Mr. Pite, came more slowly at Bowne than at newer printing houses. But, he said, ''Now, everyone is gung-ho. In a couple of years they'll forget the linotype machine ever existed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/world/aide-to-reagan-says-summit-meeting-is-probable.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1985-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1082, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIDE TO REAGAN SAYS SUMMIT MEETING IS PROBABLE", "print_headline": "AIDE TO REAGAN SAYS SUMMIT MEETING IS PROBABLE", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's chief of staff today discounted a tough exchange of speeches by the President and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on Wednesday as political ''positioning'' with their allies and asserted that there ''probably'' would be a summit meeting between the two leaders despite the polemics. **********''These leaders are positioning themselves with their own people,'' Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview. ''Gorbachev recognizes he has to have the Eastern bloc behind him. He is not known as the leader of the Eastern bloc yet. He's getting there. He's met with them. But Reagan has also met at the summit. Notice the parallelism here.'' Mr. Gorbachev ''didn't get his job because he's a cream puff,'' Mr. Regan commented. ''He's talking tough, certainly. He's staking out positions. How about Ronald Reagan? Pretty tough stuff about the Soviet Union.'' **********Shultz Hails Trip **********His comments came as President Reagan was near the end of an 11-day European trip that Secretary of State George P. Shultz hailed today as a voyage of ''enduring significance.'' He said it had rallied the West and helped set out part of an agenda for summit talks with the Soviet leader and for his own meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, next Tuesday. Mr. Shultz left for the Middle East tonight. **********Mr. Regan acknowledged that the President had suffered ''the slings and arrows quote unquote'' of some disagreements with other leaders, of heckling by leftists at the European Parliament and of a walkout by Communists in the Portuguese National Assembly today. But he asserted that the President had not shirked his responsibility to set out his policies despite such opposition, and he contended that the trip had strengthened President Reagan's position as the leader of the West as he moves toward a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. **********Exchange of Accusations **********In a speech at Strasbourg, France, Wednesday, the President accused Moscow of developing ''first strike'' nuclear weapons that were upsetting mutual deterrence and he condemned ''Soviet adventurism'' in developing nations. In Moscow the same day, Mr. Gorbachev said American policy was ''growing more bellicose in character and has become a constant negative factor in international relations.'' **********Both leaders were speaking at celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. Taking a different tone, the two leaders also exchanged messages recalling Soviet and American wartime collaboration. **********''I would interpret this as meaning each one is signaling the other: 'Don't expect me to roll over, boy, just because you want something - I'm going to fight for what I think, what I believe, is correct,' '' a senior Administration official said of the speeches. **********'Probably' a Meeting **********''Eventually there has - there probably will be a summit,'' Mr. Regan asserted. ''I don't say there has to be. There probably will be a summit.'' But the chief of staff cautioned that the President still had not received an official reply to his letter inviting the new Soviet leader to Washington. The White House information is limited to word from the chief editor of the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda that Mr. Gorbachev would visit the United Nations this fall. **********''Well, we didn't say we'd go to New York,'' Mr. Regan said. ''We didn't say we'd go to Timbuktu. All we said was, if you'd like to meet, we'd like to have you come to Washington.'' **********On other key issues, Mr. Regan said: *********** Assuming Senate passage of a budget resolution today, President Reagan, on his flight to Washington Friday, will study a proposal for a major overhaul of the tax system and next week he will send it to Congress. *********** The Administration has not yet put together a new package for aid to Nicaraguan rebels, but is encouraged by a $42 million, two-year package offered by the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois. Mr. Regan said the Administration would seek ''humanitarian,'' not military, aid for the rebels but would want it channeled through the Central Intelligence Agency. **********Comments by Shultz **********In an afternoon press conference, Secretary Shultz commented on Mr. Gorbachev's speech, saying that the United States ''rejects'' the charges and also feels compelled to speak out about ''gross injustices'' in the Soviet Union, such as anti-Semitism, severe restrictions on emigration and the Soviet military role in Afghanistan. **********But Mr. Shultz went on to say that he preferred to look past the ''critical'' statements made by Mr. Gorbachev about American policy and to point up the Soviet leader's statement that he would ''never forget'' the wartime aid from the West to the Soviet Union, which had shown that ''socially opposite states could work together in seeking a common aim.'' **********The West, Secretary Shultz asserted, must approach Moscow with realism, strength and solidarity. But he added that ''we should be prepared always for a more constructive relationship and for negotiations.'' ----House Assails Moscow on Killing WASHINGTON, May 9 (AP) - The House voted 322 to 93 today to urge President Reagan to declare the Soviet Ambassador to the United States persona non grata unless Moscow apologizes for the killing of a United States Army major. **********The action came on a bill to freeze spending authority for the State Department and the United States Information Agency at the levels for the current fiscal year, with an adjustment for inflation. The bill was approved by voice vote and sent to the Senate. **********Rep. Daniel A. Mica, a Florida Democrat who was floor manager of the bill, said the freeze, when added to reductions made earlier, would cut about $67 million from the requested spending level in fiscal 1986, which starts Oct. 1, and $193 million in fiscal 1987. **********Mr. Mica said he reluctantly supported the amendment on the Soviet Ambassador on the ground that many members would find it politically disadvantageous to vote against it.

The raids were financed by the United States, and Colombian helicopters ferried Peruvian policemen to the site. But it was the Garcia administration that provided the crucial political decision to go ahead. **********Some officials and diplomats here believe that the police raids may mark a turning point for Peru as important as the crackdown in Colombia that followed the slaying of that country's Justice Minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, by drug traffickers on April 30, 1984. **********''We're delighted by what's happening,'' one United States diplomat here said, recalling that the Reagan Administration had tried in vain to press the Government of President Fernando Belaunde Terry, Mr. Garcia's predecessor, to act. ''There's a lot still to be done,'' the diplomat said, ''but at least the will is apparent now.'' **********Peru's Deputy Interior Minister, Agustin Mantilla, described the cocaine situation by using a huge wall map of Peru. His index finger easily covered the jungle area where the police raid had occurred. **********His hand then swept 500 miles down the lush eastern lowlands of the Andes to indicate where coca leaf cultivation is booming, and across toward the uninhabited areas bordering on Brazil. There, traffickers are believed to be setting up new laboratories and transshipment points. **********''You can see the size of the problem,'' Mr. Mantilla said. ''We need a lot more help from the United States. We need some helicopters, a few planes and weapons that can match those of the traffickers. If we get them, you'll see action.'' **********Yet in just a matter of weeks the most serious obstacle to combating narcotics - official reluctance to proceed - has apparently been removed. **********Peruvian officials have acknowledged that the campaign is motivated in part by the hope that Washington will respond with gestures to lift this country out of an economic crisis. **********Corruption Among Officials **********''We're helping to resolve an American problem,'' one senior official said pointedly. ''I hope this is recognized. The coca paste we seized at the border was not destined for Peru but for the United States.'' **********But, at the same time, the month-old Government has been jolted into action by the discovery of extensive drug-related corruption in the police, armed forces, judiciary and bureaucracy. As part of a ''moralization'' campaign, President Garcia has already forcibly retired 37 police generals, many of them suspected of being in league with drug operators. **********The cleanup received an unexpected boost when a cocaine-processing laboratory in Lima blew up July 24, just four days before the change of administrations. Its owner, Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, who apparently fled the country a few hours later, had long been known to United States drug enforcement agents as a trafficker, yet he had circulated freely among top officials of the departing Government. **********At one point, he gave his office address as the Interior Ministry, which was supposedly running the anti-drug campaign. He also maintained close friendships with Luis Lopez Vergara, a personal adviser to the former Interior Minister, Luis Percovich Roca, and with a police General, Jose Jorge Zarate. Now Mr. Lopez and Mr. Jorge have been detained for investigation, and a judge summoned Mr. Percovich for questioning. **********One of the Government's immediate challenges, therefore, is to form a new narcotics unit that can resist the corrupting force of drug dollars and be effective at enforcement. For this, it is looking for a sharp increase in the $4.4 million worth of narcotics assistance that the United States has scheduled for the coming fiscal year. **********Mr. Mantilla, who is in charge of the new campaign, believes that the police role may be the easiest aspect of combating narcotics. Although many traffickers have moved into northern Peru over the last year, Peruvian officials expect to benefit from the greater experience of both the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and of the Colombian Government. ''The police side can be dealt with within a year,'' Mr. Mantilla said. **********A Complicated Issue **********But the coca issue is infinitely more complicated in Peru, touching almost every aspect of society, from the centuries-old tradition of coca chewing among the large Indian population to the new reality that coca has become Peru's single largest export. In the form of leaves, base and paste, the three stages that precede transformation into pure cocaine, it pumps between $500 and $800 million into the economy. **********The complexity of fighting cocaine's power is most vividly illustrated in the upper Huallaga River valley, a hilly semi-tropical zone 250 miles northeast of here that alone is said to produce the raw material for about half of the cocaine that enters the United States. Coca plantations only appeared here 15 years ago, but they now cover tens of thousands of acres and sustain much of the region's peasant population. **********When enforcement, eradication and crop substitution programs financed by the United States began there three years ago, the local economy immediately slumped. Soon Maoist guerrillas of the Shining Path movement moved in to exploit the discontent. President Belaunde, alarmed by this development, ordered the armed forces into the valley in July 1984. **********Military Doesn't Fight Narcotics **********Once they had set up their headquarters in the frontier town of Tingo Maria, however, the armed forces announced they would fight subversion but not narcotics. They blamed the police for alienating the population and ordered a special police anti-drug unit to remain in its barracks. Within weeks, the coca business began to pick up again and the guerrillas disappeared. Today the armed forces are immensely popular, light aircraft fly coca base to the north daily and the local economy is swimming in dollars. **********While some Government officials express the suspicion that drug money may have reached some military officers posted in the valley, posing a delicate political issue for President Garcia, the more serious long-term problem is what to do with the thousands of farmers whose livelihood now depends on the cultivation of coca leaf. ''This is a socioeconomic problem that may take years to resolve because crop substitution has not worked so far,'' Mr. Mantilla said. A Problem for the President With the armed forces still excluding the police from operating in the region, the immediate strategy is to strike once the raw material has left the valley as base or paste. The lack of cooperation from the army and air force, however, remains a problem that can only be solved at the presidential level. **********When an operation to destroy airstrips was launched in early 1984, for example, the air force agreed to provide helicopters for a rental fee of $2,000 an hour that was subsequently paid by the United States. As a result, in a direct rebuff to the air force, transportation for the latest jungle raids was provided by a chartered Aeroperu aircraft and Colombian police helicopters. **********Foreign diplomats nonetheless believe that a successful anti-drug campaign will require closer collaboration from the armed forces. And even then it will not be easy. **********''If the paste can't get out by plane, it will go by river,'' one foreign expert said, ''If the rivers are patrolled, it will use the roads. If roads are blockaded, traffickers have vast amounts of money to help them find the route of least resistance. But at least the Government is now putting up some resistance.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/08/business/business-people-president-resigns-at-new-york-air.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   President Resigns At New York Air", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE ;   President Resigns At New York Air", "body_text": " **********Lawrence J.

The settlements border on the airport, and the hijackers simply drive on and off the runway. **********Hijackers Disappear **********Today, after blowing up the Jordanian airliner, the hijackers simply disappeared - as has every other hijacker in recent months - in a jeep headed for the shantytowns. They were protesting an Arab League meeting in Tunis that called for an end to the siege of nearby Palestinian refugee camps by the Shiite militia, Amal. **********Perhaps the most spectacular hijacking - and the most quintessentially Lebanese - occurred earlier this year when an immigration officer, wearing full uniform, - commandeered an airliner of the national carrier, Middle East Airlines. Quick-thinking flight attendants pushed the passengers down the emergency chutes before the plane could take off. As the plane flew back and forth between Cyprus and Beirut, cabin doors open and emergency chutes dangling, it developed that the hijacker's demands included a promotion, long-promised pay increases for airport workers and warmer winter coats for police and immigration officers in the drafty, shell-holed terminal. **********The hijacker, it turned out, was a Druse and after a brief standoff on the return to Beirut Airport - he said he would only deal with negotiators who boarded the plane nude - he disappeared with a jeepload of his gun-toting co-religionists toward the Druse-controlled hills south of the runway. **********He appeared at a news conference the next day at the ancestral feudal palace, Mukhtara, of Walid Jumblat, the Druse chieftain and leading Lebanese leftist. Mr. Jumblat holds the ministerial portfolios of Tourism, Transportation and Public Works in what is called the ''Government of National Unity'' and is thus responsible for the airport. Indeed, he once refused landing rights to a foreign hijacker. **********This hijacker's demands were only just, Mr. Jumblat declared, and, in any case he should not be punished until what the Tourism Minister referred to as ''the archcriminal Amin Gemayel'' - the country's President - was brought to book. **********The hijacking vogue began in the early 1980's when Shiite Moslems began grabbing planes - usually those already hedading for Beirut - to demand the return of their leader, the Imam Moussa Sadr, who disappeared on a 1978 trip to Libya and is widely believed to be dead. Generally they were greeted by a state television crew. A particular Shiite folk hero was known as Hamzi the Hijacker. Now an important Amal official, he took eight planes. **********In the early 1970's many international airlines had regularly scheduled flights to Beirut, but they began discontinuing them at the time of the civil war in 1975 and 1976. By this year, all but one foreign airline had stopped flying there. After the hijacking Monday, the last foreign airline, Alia, the Jordanian carrier, discontinued flights. Now the airport is served only by the Lebanese airline, Middle East Airlines. **********Hijacking has now become so routine it has its own rituals at the airport, with journalists and gunmen of various stripes rushing to the second floor coffee shop to munch sandwiches and peer out the cracked panoramic windows, while other flights land and take off and travelers crowd to the terminal without paying any attention."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/01/business/florida-thrift-units-backed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Florida Thrift Units Backed", "print_headline": "Florida Thrift Units Backed", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has reached an agreement with Florida officials that allows new state-chartered savings and loan institutions to receive Federal deposit insurance. **********The agreement on Friday came 11 days after the board announced that it would no longer grant Federal insurance to newly formed savings and loan institutions in Florida, Texas or California in a dispute over the adequacy of state examinations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/27/world/new-nicaragua-policy-urged.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1985-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 425, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW NICARAGUA POLICY URGED", "print_headline": "NEW NICARAGUA POLICY URGED", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence urged President Reagan today not to ask Congress for renewed aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, calling the policy an ''illogical and illegal absurdity.'' **********Speaking to the National Press Club, the committee chairman, Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, said he felt uncomfortable giving a speech on American policy in Central America, since the intelligence committee chairman is not supposed to discuss such issues in public. **********But he said he felt compelled to come forward for what he called his first and last address on the subject because, he contended, United States policy in Central America is being held ''hostage to an ill-timed, ill-planned program in support of a policy which no one understands.'' **********He Asks for New Policy **********Unless the White House proposes a new program to deal with Nicaragua, he added, ''the Executive will leave itself open to defeat by Congress.'' **********The White House had no comment on Mr. Durenberger's remarks today. **********White House officials have said they intend to ask Congress within the next few weeks to approve $14 million in renewed covert aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, even though they recognize that Congressional oppositon is strong. **********Although Mr. Durenberger said he shared virtually all of President Reagan's concerns about Nicaragua, he added that ''the controversy'' between Congress and the White House over the vote on aid ''is joined on the wrong issue.'' **********He said that ''a negative vote implies, incorrectly, that Congress and the Administration are not in agreement on the need to oppose the Sandinstas and all they stand for.'' **********Instead, Mr. Durenberger urged the White House to form a wholly new policy for dealing withh Nicaragua, instead of the ''incoherent'' policy of ''reacting after the fact to events which appear beyond our control.'' **********This month, the White House said it had considered all other policy options proposed on Nicaragua, only to find them unacceptable. **********Mr. Durenberger, offering his own plan, said the United States and the other nations should consider cutting diplomatic relations with Managua and ceasing all trade and economic cooperation. **********''If we oppose the regime in Managua,'' he said, ''why do we buy Nicaraguan beef and bananas?'' **********Further, Mr. Durenberger said, the United States should consider a naval blockade, to insure that Nicaragua does not continue importing Soviet-bloc arms.

The two-day loss was the worst since mid-September. Volume on the Big Board slowed to 78.3 million shares, the lightest in three and a half months. [47.] **********Prices of Treasury securities rose moderately in a shortened trading session. Dealers attributed most of the buying to short-covering of long-term bonds and to seasonal factors. The gains erased most of Monday's declines. [51.] **********The dollar lost some ground in lackluster pre-holiday trading. Gold was mixed. It ended a shortened trading day at $326.25 an ounce, up 75 cents, at Republic National Bank in New York. [46.] **********Livestock and meat futures prices advanced strongly in reaction to a Federal report indicating that there are 3 percent fewer hogs and pigs on the nation's farms than a year ago. [46.]  International **********Japan began to piece together a budget for next year that is partly intended to blunt foreign criticism of Japan's trade surpluses and its level of military spending. In response to American and Western European demands that Japan stimulate its economy, the Government agreed to further spending and to trim certain personal taxes a bit. Officials said the measures would encourage private spending and increase imports by perhaps $2 billion a year. But critics dismissed these efforts as too minor to have much impact on the gaping trade imbalance with the U.S. [51.]  Today's Column **********A stocking full of predictions is being offered, on consumer goods, growth, inflation and interest rates.

Some hope for an opportunity to leave forever. **********The stakes are so high and the nerves so taut that conflicts often erupt on the lines. Not long ago Marine guards had to clear the consulate in the United States Embassy after subduing battling visa applicants. **********The turbulence on the visa lines reflects a paradox that has developed since  martial law was officially scrapped in 1983. **********Obstacles Have Been Relaxed **********Before, in the months that followed the suppression of the Solidarity labor movement, the Polish Government set up the obstacles to departure by its wholesale denials of passports. Many Western governments were citing Warsaw's passport policies as proof of repression. **********But last year, under more liberalized procedures, the Government issued 700,000 passports. This year, Government sources said, they expect the number to rise to 1.15 million, or almost 4 percent of the total population, a figure that in the Eastern bloc is matched only by Hungary's. **********Now, for most of those who want to leave, the area of contention has shifted  away from the police stations where Poles apply for passports to the consulates  where they seek visas. Some of the same diplomats who complained about the scant numbers of passports issued by Poland are now privately wondering if perhaps the Government is dispensing them too freely, particularly to those who intend to work illegally in foreign lands. **********These days the longest visa line can be found at the West German Embassy, where all Poles with passports are automatically given visas. Some Poles say they believe that the practice is a form of war reparation. **********Unlike the representatives of other countries, the West Germans do not demand that applicants show invitations or prove they have sponsors or demonstrate they have sufficient funds. #3,000 Visas a Day Issued With a consular staff of 28 often very tired people, the West German Embassy is now issuing 3,000 visas a day. Most of the applicants will be leaving by train or car, mostly to shop. At the various flea markets around Warsaw, some of these returned travelers can  be seen peddling their purchases at a profit - radios, cosmetics, sweaters, jeans. **********Some of the travelers have extended their visits, either by just staying on or by formally asking for asylum. Last winter, several shiploads of people on Baltic shopping cruises left ships in West German ports, declaring themselves refugees. Two weeks ago Wladyslaw Kozakiewicz, the Polish pole vaulter who beat  two Russians for the gold medal at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, defected in West Germany. **********But apart from such dramatic declarations, the Polish Government says it has  no way of knowing how many people are staying abroad after leaving here as tourists. ''Ask the governments where these people are staying,'' said Jerzy Urban, the Government spokesman. **********At the other consulates, apart from the West German Embassy's, the question of the intent of the applicant is critical. **********''If you have a young man or woman, traveling alone, with some distant relative in the States, you almost have to assume that he or she is going to at least try to get a job and earn some money,'' a young American consular officer said. ''In that case we are technically obliged to turn down the applicant, but visa-granting is not an exact science, and a lot depends on how people strike you.'' **********'Can Change Course of My Life' **********One recent lucky applicant who received his visa confirmed the general suspicions of the consular official. ''Of course I am going to try to work,'' the 22-year-old man said, under guarantees of anonymity. ''Do you realize that if I can save seven or eight thousand dollars in a year's time, I can come back  here and change the entire course of my life?'' **********He said that with such savings, he could buy a small apartment that would otherwise take him at least 15 years to acquire, could get married and could buy a small car. **********Outside the United States Embassy, a man from the city of Kielce complained bitterly after having his application rejected. ''I know for a fact that they have issued visas to people who sold out Jews to the Nazis and to secret policemen, and they turned me down, a former Solidarity union leader.'' **********A consular worker said, ''Once they get inside this building, everybody is a  former Solidarity union leader.'' **********The American consular staff here interviews 200 applicants a day, although the line outside sometimes grows to 500. At the United States consulate in Cracow there is a backlog of 1,800 names. At the French, Italian, Spanish and British Embassies the situation is much the same, and even the Turkish Embassy has regular long lines. **********Harder for Some to Leave **********While there seems to be no doubt that the number of Poles being allowed to leave with passports is growing, there are categories of people who are finding  it harder than ever to go abroad. **********The most significant group includes scientists and scholars wanting to attend learned meetings with their passports, which fall into a slightly different category from those of people who are given passports for regular tourist reasons. Many of these people are being told that they should apply for official passports. The key difference between the two types of Polish documents is that  to receive an official passport, under new regulations an applicant must swear an oath of loyalty to the state and the Communist system. A number of scientists have elected to stay home rather than do this. **********There is also the case of political dissidents who are refused passports for  temporary travel on the grounds that they might ''endanger the state.'' **********Some of these people, such as Ryszard Bugajski, have at the same time been offered passports good only in one direction, for emigration. After three years  of such discussions, Mr. Bugajski has finally accepted emigration. At age 42, with a wife and a 2-year-old boy, he is preparing to leave for a new life in Toronto, apparently with the approval of the Polish authorities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/24/business/key-rates-141873.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/28/world/hostages-in-lebanon-berri-voices-optimism-about-hostages.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1985-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 620, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  BERRI VOICES OPTIMISM ABOUT HOSTAGES", "print_headline": "HOSTAGES IN LEBANON;   BERRI VOICES OPTIMISM ABOUT HOSTAGES", "body_text": " **********The Shiite militia leader, Nabih Berri, told reporters today that he was ''more optimistic'' than ever that the two-week old hostage crisis could be ended soon ''with American help.'' **********Mr. Berri had no immediate response to the United States demand today that seven Americans who vanished in Beirut over the last 15 months be freed along with the 39 hostages from the hijacked Trans World Airlines jetliner being held in Beirut. **********Mr. Berri, who is Lebanon's Justice Minister as well Minister of Water and Electricity and South Lebanon Affairs, has insisted that his Shiite militia, Amal, has had no control over the other abducted Americans. **********A ranking amal official, Ghassan Siblani, said the request to release the seven Americans would be passed on ''to the quarters concerned.' **********He has also said his organization had been unable to find out where the seven Americans are being held. Six of the Americans are believed to be in the hands of Moslem militants; the seventh was reported missing in December 1984, and no group has taken responsibility for his disappearance. **********Signs of Intense Talks **********Mr. Berri spoke amid signs that intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations were continuing in an effort to find a formula to free the 39 American hostages who were aboard the T.W.A. plane when it was hijacked by Shiite Moslem fundamentalists June 14.

The 1,150 included convicted terrorists. **********In the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, the Americans were apparently somewhat mollified, after threats to close Beirut's airport and blockade Lebanon, by Mr. Berri's summoning of the Red Cross to examine the hostages, and his decision, on Red Cross recommendation, to release one of them, James Dell Palmer of Little Rock, who suffered from a heart condition. **********At the news conference Wednesday in which Mr. Berri announced Mr. Palmer's release, the Shiite leader also said that two Frenchmen, Jean-Paul Kauffmann and Michel Seurat, would also be thrown into the same situation as the hijacking hostages and would be released if and when the detainees held at Israel's Atlit Prison were released. **********This, sources said, prompted American officials to press for the inclusion of the seven previously kidnapped Americans in any deal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/12/world/mitterrand-going-to-pacific-atoll.html": {"writer_name": "Frank Prial", "pub_date": "1985-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MITTERRAND GOING TO PACIFIC ATOLL", "print_headline": "MITTERRAND GOING TO PACIFIC ATOLL", "body_text": " **********The Government has announced that President Francois Mitterrand will leave Thursday for the Pacific nuclear testing site of Mururoa. **********The announcement, made Tuesday, comes amid international criticism of French testing.

For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit - the difference between what America imports and what it sells abroad - totaled $70.7 billion and the country seemed certain to far surpass last year's record deficit of $123.3 billion. **********Dollar Called Too Strong **********Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the dollar was still too strong compared with other currencies for American industry to compete in world markets. A strong dollar hurts export sales and opens the country to a flood of cheaper imports. While the dollar has declined by about 12 percent from its record highs in February, it is still 40 percent above its 1980 average.

The Canadian dollar is worth about 72.5 cents in United States currency. **********De Havilland, based in Downsview, Ontario, is a maker of small aircraft used principally in the commuter airline industry. Its leading product is the Dash 8, a 36-passenger, twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Boeing's smallest aircraft, by contrast, is the 130-passenger 737. **********Months of Negotiations **********Boeing had been negotiating for several months with the Canadian Government's Development Investment Corporation, a holding company for a number of business concerns, including de Havilland, that have been put up for sale by the Progressive Conservative Government. **********Other parties that were said to have bid for the commuter aircraft maker included a group led by Justus Dornier, a West German industrialist, and Rimgate Holdings Ltd., an investment group made up primarily of Canadians. **********The sale is Boeing's first acquisition in recent years and its first foray into the commuter aircraft market. Analysts said that Boeing in the last year had appeared to be more interested in that segment of the industry. They cited the company's disclosure last month that it had held ''very priliminary and limited discussions'' with Fairchild Industries about bidding for its Republic Aircraft unit. **********In a statement, Sinclair Stevens, Canada's Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion, said the sale to Boeing had been structured to safeguard Canadian technology and insure continued reseach and development at de Havilland. ''With the benefit of Boeing's management coupled with de Havilland's worldwide reputation in the field of commuter aircraft, we know we have a winning combination,'' Mr. Stevens said. **********Sales Have Slumped **********De Havilland has been in financial trouble in recent years and the company's sales have plummeted from their mid-1982 peak at the same time that the Canadian Government poured more than $700 million (Canadian) in equity into the company. The company last week reported a loss of $55.1 million (Canadian) on sales of $204.6 million for the first nine months of 1985, compared with a loss of $19.7 million on sales of $160 million in the same period of 1984. **********Company officials said the recession of a few years ago had caused a sharp decline in orders from commuter airlines, de Havilland's largest customer. De Havilland last reported a profit in 1982's second quarter, earning $1.9 million on sales of $450.4 million. **********In the last year, the company has relied heavily on the Dash 8 to help improve sales. However, de Havilland has spent large sums on research and development of new aircraft, offsetting modest gains in orders. Analysts said that the Dash 8 program had helped improve the company's prospects. **********Thomas R. Cole, a Boeing spokesman, said Boeing would ''spend a significant amount of money on improving facilities and conducting research at de Havilland.'' He said sales of Dash 8 aircraft were doing well and that there were no plans to make changes in personnel or in the level of the company's work force, now 4,500. **********Under the agreement between Boeing and the Canadian Government, the note ''will be discharged either through payments over a period of time or through the purchase of up to $325 million in Canadian goods and services for purposes unrelated to current de Havilland or Boeing of Canada products,'' the Government statement said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/12/business/pound-at-lowest-level-ever.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1985-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 887, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POUND AT LOWEST LEVEL EVER", "print_headline": "POUND AT LOWEST LEVEL EVER", "body_text": " **********The British pound fell to $1.1190 yesterday, its lowest level ever against the dollar and closer yet to parity to the dollar. **********The dollar also rose sharply against other major currencies, rising to 3.1685 West German marks, from 3.1490 on Thursday, and hitting 254.40 Japanese yen, up from 253.55. **********As has often been the case in the last year, there was no apparent provocation for the dollar's burst of strength. ''Everybody's looking at it with amazement, it just went,'' said Gil L. Leiendecker, manager of foreign exchange trading at Salomon Brothers, the investment bank. **********'Very Emotional Market' **********The market was described as panicky at times and erratic. ''In a word, it was chaotic, a very emotional market,'' said Albert Soria, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Swiss Bank Corporation branch in New York. The decline came in the normally thin Friday market, when movements can be exaggerated. **********Currency analysts said that there was some worry that oil prices might slip further, reducing revenues to Britain since it is a major oil producer and exporter. But they added that the pound's drop was far greater than the actual economic impact an oil price decline would have on the British economy. **********There was some effort to defend the pound in London, when major British banks pushed up their base rate - a benchmark lending rate - by three-quarters to one percentage point, to 10 1/2 percent. The increase had no impact on the pound's value, but it devastated the British equity market, sending the Financial Times index down 21 points at one time, before it closed off 14.1 at 968.3. **********Decline of 3.5 Percent **********The pound's value skidded to $1.1190, from $1.1333 on Thursday, the previous record low. That represents a 3.5 percent decline just since the beginning of the year. Sterling's trade-weighted index closed at a historic low of 71.3, down from 71.6 on Thursday. **********The decline raised new concern that sterling could fall to equal value to the dollar, or parity, a remarkable decline from its loftier heights in an era now past.

The Bundesbank, the West German central bank, intervened early in the session in Europe yesterday by selling nearly $100 million for marks, but it had little impact on the exchange rate either. **********Substantial Benefits **********Richard Watkins, director of the New York office of Phillips & Drew International Ltd., a major British securities house, said that he believed the British Government was concerned about the orderliness of the foreign exchange market, but less about the actual value of the pound because a weak currency brings substantial benefits to the economy. **********The decline, he added, makes it far easier for British industry to export goods, although it can worsen inflation. ''People in Britain know about the benefits, that's why they aren't that worried,'' he said. However, Mr. Watkins added that the decline did have some psychological impact. **********In spite of the dollar's jump, there is a growing view that the market could reverse soon, if only temporarily. ''There's a lot of expectation building up that we are about to break out of this area,'' Mr. Leiendecker said. ''Betting people are saying it will be on the down side and that the dollar will come off significantly.'' **********Gold Ends Below $300 **********By The Associated Press **********Gold prices traded around the $300 level yesterday, ending the day below it.

Two Americans in five believe their taxes would be raised, and another another two-fifths believe their taxes would remain about the same as they are now. **********Middle-Income View **********Perhaps more significant, in a country where the vast majority of people consider themselves middle class, half of all Americans believe middle-income taxpayers would have their taxes increased by the President's plan, the poll shows. **********The Administration calculates that under President Reagan's plan, nearly 60 percent of the taxpayers in the country would pay lower taxes than they pay now, while about 20 percent would pay more and the rest would pay about the same. Most people at every income level would get a tax reduction, the Administration says, with taxes paid by individuals reduced by about 7 percent over all. **********''Obviously, there's a real credibility problem,'' said John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies for the American Enterprise Institute, who generally favors the Administration's tax initiative. **********The poll was based on telephone interviews with 1,569 adults conducted from July 16 through 21. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. **********Public Support Called Critical **********President Reagan's political strategists concede that his plan, which would reduce tax rates and abolish many deductions, stands little chance in Congress unless the public can be persuaded that most people would be better off. **********A poll taken now cannot predict how public attitudes about taxes may be altered by a sustained campaign by the President after Labor Day to sell his plan. Over the years, surveys have consistently shown public disbelief that revisions in the tax law would benefit them personally. However, Mr. Reagan has proved remarkably successful in gaining popular support of other programs, and his advisers express confidence that he can convince the public of the value of his tax proposals. **********''We're right on schedule according to what our plan was,'' Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, told the United States Chamber of Commerce last week. ''We will pursue a very active course this fall in support of tax reform.'' **********The President's commitment to his tax proposals is ''total, complete, absolute and unswerving,'' Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said in an interview. **********Views of Reagan **********Throughout the poll, respondents' opinions about taxes were closely tied to their views of Mr. Reagan himself. **********For example, according to the survey, 19 percent of the people would like to see the President's plan approved intact, while 47 percent would like to see it passed with changes, and 20 percent would like the tax system left alone. Nine-tenths of those who want the proposals adopted without change say they approve of the way Mr. Reagan is conducting his Presidency, compared with 60 percent of the rest of the public. **********Among those who would like to see the plan enacted but with changes, there was no consensus on what the changes should be. But about one-third of the public could cite one deduction they wanted to see maintained despite the overall goal of eliminating deductions in order to lower rates. The deductibility of state and local taxes was cited by 9 percent of the public, more than any other item. Eight percent said they wanted home mortgage interest to remain deductible, as it would under Mr. Reagan's plan. **********How Poll Was Conducted **********The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from July 16 to July 21 with 1,569 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. **********The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. **********The results have been weighted to take account of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. **********In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. **********In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/22/business/advertising-mccann-promotions.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1985-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising;   McCann Promotions", "print_headline": "Advertising;   McCann Promotions", "body_text": " **********Michael A.

He said he expected the full text of his remarks to be published eventually in a book. **********Editors at Literaturnaya Gazeta did not return phone calls. **********It was apparent even from the censored excerpts that Mr. Yevtushenko's call for openness was echoed by other writers at the closed meeting. **********Valentin Rasputin, a novelist who writes about rural themes, said, ''Our profession demands courage.'' He described every book as ''the victory of a martyr who selects each word with great pains so that conscience and truth should glow in it with a single flick of pen and fate.'' **********'Favorable Breeze' Is Seen **********A Western diplomat, after reading the selection of speeches, said, ''It is clear Russian writers think a favorable breeze is blowing and they have raised their sails to see how far it will take them.'' **********Mr. Yevtushenko said he had received many phone calls from writers since his speech. ''It has been a remarkable response,'' he said. **********Literaturnaya Gazeta gave 10 pages to coverage of the writers' congress, which took place Dec. 11-14. It published excerpts from speeches of 50 writers and two union officials. Most were the about the same length as the excerpts from Mr. Yevtushenko's remarks. **********The weekly's version of the speech deleted Mr. Yevtushenko's comments on the privileges accorded to leading Soviet citizens, ''including the special coupons for souvenir kiosks that lie in the pocket of every delegate to this congress, myself included.'' **********References to Stalin Are Cut **********Also cut were his references to Stalin, including the following: ''We do not have the right to nihilistically forget the great firsts of industry. But we also do not have the right to be silent about the fact that in those same years, contrary to Lenin's legacy, the precious agricultural wisdom of many peasants, undeservedly branded kulaks, was being crushed underfoot, and a merciless purge was under way of the Bolshevik guard, of the best commanders of the Red Army and the industrial cadres, of the leading representatives of Leninist thought.'' **********Diplomats said the handling of Mr. Yevtushenko's speech by Literaturnaya Gazeta indicated that the writers' union and the other authorities were uncertain how to respond to the poet's challenge. **********Although writers and other intellectuals have expressed hope that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, would loosen ideological controls on the arts and literature, his views on the issue remain unclear. **********The party official responsible for ideology, Yegor K. Ligachev, has not offered much hope of liberalization in his speeches and writings. In an article recently published in Kommunist, a party journal, Mr. Ligachev wrote that artistic standards must remain consistent with Marxist-Leninist ideology and socialist realism. **********The draft of a new party program, essentially a blueprint for the nation over the coming years, offered a traditional Soviet formula for artistic expression when it was published earlier this year. **********The document, which is expected to be endorsed by a party congress opening in late February, said, ''The main avenue for the development of literature and the arts lies through strengthening the ties with people's lives, truthful and highly artistic presentation of socialist reality, an inspired and vivid portrayal of what is new and advanced and an impassioned exposure of everything that hampers social progress.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/27/business/ford-may-increase-production-abroad.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 279, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford May Increase Production Abroad", "print_headline": "Ford May Increase Production Abroad", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company is prepared to move production of some large-car engines abroad, possibly to Mexico, should the Federal Government refuse to relax fuel-economy laws for the next three years, a top company official said today. **********Louis Ross, Ford executive vice president for North American car operations, said the move could eliminate several hundred jobs in the United States, possibly at the company's engine plant in Cleveland. **********Mr. Ross said Ford was studying how best to make 25 percent of the parts of its Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis cars abroad.

The main uncertainty, analysts agree, concerns the extent to which crude oil prices may decline. **********''At present, we are not recommending for purchase any of the major domestic  oil companies,'' said Eugene L. Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds. **********We remain generally neutral to cautious on the large international oil stocks, even though we believe that the medium-term outlook is for stable prices,'' said Phillip Dodge of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''Mobil is our only current recommendation, based on potential benefits from structural changes.'' **********Strength in domestic refining and marketing has improved the outlook for oil  company profits in 1985, according to Frederick P. Leuffer of Cyrus J. Lawrence  Inc. ''The rise in downstream profit margins, brought about by higher prices for gasoline in the United States and lower crude costs, is responsible for an anticipated 14 percent gain in earnings during the second quarter for the domestic and international major oils, compared with year-earlier results,'' he  said. **********But he added: ''We believe that a rally from current levels in oil shares brought about by second-quarter earnings results would be short-lived. Once gasoline prices give way, there will be little support for further earnings improvement in the second half of 1985.'' **********Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will reconvene in Geneva next Monday. When they met in Vienna earlier this month, they failed to agree on any changes in OPEC's pricing or production. Later Mexico reduced the average price of its crude oil by as much as $1.24 a barrel.  Although Mexico is not a member of OPEC, its action may put pressure on the organization to cut its official benchmark price of $28 a barrel for Saudi Light crude. The price for this grade in the spot market is $1 a barrel lower. **********''We think the odds are four out of five that the benchmark price will go lower by the end of 1986,'' said Mr. Leuffer of the Lawrence firm. ''There is slightly better than a 50-to-50 chance, we believe, that the price will settle in a range of $22 to $26 a barrel.'' **********He currently recommends two oil stocks - Imperial Oil and Kerr-McGee - for purchase. On a long-term basis, Mr. Leuffer also believes that Royal Dutch Petroleum will outperform both the oil sector and the overall stock market. **********Wall Street's caution is indicated by opinion changes made early last week by Constantine Fliakos, who follows the international oil companies for Merrill Lynch. Although he raised slightly his 1985 earnings estimates for Royal Dutch and for Shell Transport and Trading, the analyst lowered his rating for both stocks to ''neutral'' from ''O.K. to buy'' for the intermediate term. **********''We continue to regard both stocks as among the best values in the integrated international group,'' he said. ''However, both stocks have performed relatively well in an uncertain environment, and the opinion change reflects our concern for prospects of lower oil prices and caution toward the group in general.'' **********Despite his neutral-to-cautious attitude toward the international oil companies, Mr. Dodge of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said, ''We would be prepared to take advantage of any stock price weakness in Royal Dutch or Shell Transport.'' **********''We don't see a lot of downside risk in oil stocks, partly because dividend  yields offer support for their prices,'' said B. Bryan Jacoboski of Paine Webber. ''We are recommending one domestic oil - Amoco Corporation - in anticipation of further share repurchases by the company.'' **********Despite the uncertainty over petroleum prices, oil issues have turned in a creditable performance this year. As of Friday's market close, one index of international oils was ahead 16.1 percent, while domestic oils rose 8.9 percent. The decline in the dollar was cited as an added factor benefiting the oil companies. In the same period, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.5 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average gained 10.4 percent. **********The probable scenario for crude oil prices, according to Mr. Nowak of Dean Witter, is for a ''gradual erosion'' from present levels, which would mean a cut of about $2 a barrel by the close of 1986. Nontheless, he said, the odds are one out of three that, either because of poor demand and excess supply or an unraveling of OPEC's policies, the price could drop close to $20 a barrel. In that event, he said, earnings of domestic oil companies would suffer markedly next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/23/world/unesco-votes-to-ease-up-on-politics.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNESCO VOTES TO EASE UP ON POLITICS", "print_headline": "UNESCO VOTES TO EASE UP ON POLITICS", "body_text": " **********Unesco's 50-nation executive board ended a marathon session Friday night by adopting a modest set of changes for the world educational, scientific and cultural body, promising a limited reduction in politically controversial activities that led the United States to withdraw at the end of last year. **********The proposals for change were unanimously approved after seven weeks of difficult negotiations, but many Western governments immediately cautioned that the agreement represented only a first step toward the kind of changes they want to see. **********These governments said they hoped the approved proposals would be further strengthened in October when they are presented to Unesco's full membership at the meeting of its general conference in Sofia, Bulgaria. **********Although the accord Friday night was greeted with relief and applause by the exhausted delegates, the closing stages of the meeting were marred by several incidents reminiscent of the kind of practices that encouraged the United States to leave, complaining that the organization had become overly political in its activities. **********Criticism of Israel **********Against Western opposition, members from developing countries and the Soviet bloc forced through two resolutions critical of Israel - one attacking Israeli archeological excavations in Jerusalem and the other charging suppression of the cultural and educational rights of Arabs living on the occupied West Bank. **********Unesco's Director General, Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal, also clashed with Western members of the board, announcing that he intended to use $10 million set aside as protection against inflation to help make up the loss of America's 25 percent share of the budget this year. **********Earlier, all Western members except France warned that this appeared illegal under Unesco rules, but agreed that the general conference should make a final ruling in October. **********During the meeting, Denmark became the latest Western government to submit a strongly worded letter to Mr. M'Bow expressing dissatisfaction with the way the organization is run. **********'A Complicated Test' **********At the end of the meeting, Britain, which has threatened to follow the United States out of the body at the end of this year unless there are far-reaching changes, made clear it wanted additional changes agreed to at the Sofia meeting. **********''This is a long and complicated test, the full implications of which will take some time to assess,'' the British delegate, William A.

Byrne, an acknowledged turnaround artist in the insurance business who is currently chairman and chief executive at the Geico Corporation. Mr. Byrne will be succeeded at Geico by William B. Snyder. [Page D2.]  American Express said it earned $140.2 million in the three months ended June 30, up slightly from $138.7 million in the 1984 period. On a per-share basis, earnings fell to 61 cents, from 64 cents, since there were more shares outstanding this year than last. Revenues rose to $3.8 billion from $3.2 billion. **********The stagnant earnings reflected, almost entirely, mounting losses at Fireman's Fund. American Express's travel business and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage operation both had record profits. **********Travel-related services, which include the American Express card and traveler's checks operations, reported net income of $127 million, up 21 percent from the $105 million earned in the second quarter of 1984. **********Investment services, composed primarily of Shearson Lehman Brothers, saw its net income rise to $55 million, from $18 million, helped by increased participation of individual investors in the stock market. **********An Increase in Claims **********Like virtually all other property and casualty insurers, Fireman's Fund has been suffering from an increase in claims as a result of a series of recent natural disasters as well as ever-larger awards by juries. Although the insurer had already taken big charges against earnings to account for these losses, including a $230 million reduction 18 months ago, it took an additional $187 million charge in the quarter just ended. That resulted in insurance operations over all losing $72 million in the period, compared with net income of $8.3 million in 1984's second quarter. The property-liability operations at Fireman's lost $85 million, compared with net income of $200,000 last year. **********''What we have found in the last 18 months is that we were all in a much deeper hole than anyone imagined,'' said William M. McCormick, the chairman and chief executive of Fireman's Fund, who will remain as head of the insurance company itself. **********Wall Street analysts praised American Express for facing up to its problems at Fireman's Fund. But some said they were puzzled as to why the company decided to wait until now to take the charge when claims have undoubtedly been mounting for months. **********One answer, they said, is that in light of American Express's previously announced plan to sell part of Fireman's Fund to the public, the big addition to the loss reserve now amounts to a cleansing that will allow American Express to get the maximum price for Fireman's Fund later. **********A Big Cleanup **********''What they have done is clean up the balance sheet before the sale of stock,'' said June I. Hoffer, the American Express analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''This should enable them to get a higher price for the stock.'' **********Mr. Byrne's appointment is also expected to help a stock sale. While Mr. McCormick will continue to manage the insurance company, Mr. Byrne, as head of the holding company for the firm, is expected by analysts to play a pivotal role in putting Fireman's Fund in better shape. **********If history is any guide, Mr. Byrne excels at trouble-shooting. He joined Geico in 1976 when the company was near bankruptcy. By slashing costs and by surrounding himself with skilled underwriters - people expert in weeding out bad risks - Mr. Byrne was not only able to save the Washington-based company from insolvency, but also make it one of America's most successful insurance companies. **********Geico's operating earnings per share, for example, rose to $5.11 last year, from $1.10 in 1977. Its combined ratio - an important measure of business performance in the insurance industry that relates expenses to premium income - dropped to 97.7 percent, from 111 percent. All this took place while other insurers were still bathing in red ink. **********Less Dire Situation **********At Fireman's Fund, by comparison, Mr. Byrne faces a much less dire situation. Despite its losses, for instance, A. M. Best & Company, an insurance rating agency, gives Fireman's Fund an ''A,'' meaning excellent. **********To ensure a rich price for the unit, however, Mr. Byrne must quickly steer Fireman's Fund back into the black, analysts said. That, they added, would require cost cutting, automation of claims processing and a tougher policy on who gets insurance - steps already begun by Mr. Byrne's predecessor, Sanford I. Weill, who resigned recently as president of American Express and chairman and chief executive of the insurance holding company. **********Although Mr. Weill is credited for some improvement in the profitability of Fireman's Fund, Mr. Byrne said that it would take time for all of his work to bear fruit. **********''They are going to have terrific results whether Jack Byrne is here or not,'' Mr. Byrne said in a phone interview yesterday. ''It's a shame to sell this beauty to the public.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/22/business/rockwell-brings-allenbradley-financial-depth.html": {"writer_name": "Jeffrey Leib", "pub_date": "1985-01-22", "snippet": "The Allen-Bradley Company, long one of the nation's largest - and most secretive - privately held companies, has come a long way from when it was best known for constructing the world's largest four-sided clock at its factory here. \n\n Now the comp...", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROCKWELL BRINGS ALLEN-BRADLEY FINANCIAL DEPTH", "print_headline": "ROCKWELL BRINGS ALLEN-BRADLEY FINANCIAL DEPTH", "body_text": " **********The Allen-Bradley Company, long one of the nation's largest - and most secretive - privately held companies, has come a long way from when it was best known for constructing the world's largest four-sided clock at its factory here. **********Now the company is a major force in factory automation. **********''Industrial automation companies look at the production asset base of this country and start drooling,'' said Robert Graham, an analyst who covers the machine-tool industry for Robert W. Baird & Company, a Milwaukee brokerage firm. **********Factory automation is estimated to be a $4 billion-a-year industry today and is expected to grow to $20 billion by the end of the decade. **********While Allen-Bradley has carved a solid niche in the field for itself, the industry has also attracted such powerhouses as the General Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation. **********Thus, when the trustees controlling Allen-Bradley stock for the beneficiaries of the company's founders announced last October that they were putting the company on the auction block, it gave the company the chance to find a new parent with pockets deep enough to keep the company competitive. **********The winner was the Rockwell International Corporation. In a bidding process designed by Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment banking firm hired by the trustees, Rockwell beat Siemens A.G., the West German electronics company, and an investor group that included current Allen- Bradley management. **********A 'Traumatic' Decision **********Rockwell, the Pittsburgh-based manufacturer with interests in military, aerospace, electronics and other industrial operations, will pay $1.65 billion in cash for Allen-Bradley. Allen-Bradley earned $90 million on revenues of $942 million in the fiscal year that ended Nov. 30, 1984. **********Robert Anderson, Rockwell International's chairman, said, ''We're getting a high-technology, high- growth company with a strong distribution network and a reputation for quality.'' **********Allen-Bradley produces a broad array of electronic components, industrial controls and factory automation systems. The company has 15,000 employees at plants in eight countries. About a third of its employees work in the Milwaukee area. **********''The decision to sell the company was very traumatic for us,'' said William H. Brady Jr., a Milwaukee businessman and one of the Allen-Bradley trustees. ''But, with Rockwell, we gained access to financial and technical resources that Allen-Bradley could not match on its own.'' **********Allen-Bradley was started in 1909 by two brothers, Lynde and Harry Bradley, with the financial assistance of a friend, Dr. Stanton Allen. Demand for the company's electrical components was quickly spurred by the advent of new consumer goods such as the radio. **********After Lynde Bradley died at the age of 64 in 1942, his brother placed all of the company stock in five trusts, with members of the family as beneficiaries. Harry Bradley's aim was to avoid taxes on his brother's estate and to keep the company from falling into the hands of ''foreign elements'' - public shareholders. **********It was 10 years after Harry Bradleys's death in 1965 before the company expanded into the competitive world of computerized controls and solid-state electronics. **********Automated Production Line **********That move was led by Allen-Bradley's current management, including C.R. Whitney, the chairman and chief executive, and J. Tracy O'Rourke, president and chief operating officer. **********As a centerpiece, Allen-Bradley will soon start a fully automated production line to produce a new motor starter that meets international specifications. The $16 million automated facility occupies one floor of the company's Milwaukee complex. **********Meanwhile, Rockwell International plans to operate Allen-Bradley as an independent unit. ''We have no intention of changing anything,'' said Mr. Anderson, Rockwell's chairman. ''Management will stay in place and be well rewarded.'' **********He said Rockwell's aim was to make Allen-Bradley the ''showcase'' of factory automation.

But budgetary politics and bad planning, they said, have delayed installation of the system. **********When pressed, however, both the manufacturers of Doppler radar systems and some meteorologists concede that significant refinements of the technology are needed before airport systems can go into production, even though a research version was successfully tested at Denver last summer. **********The Federal system called Nexrad (for Next Generation Radar) has already developed experimental set-ups ideal for detecting tornados, hurricanes and other large storm systems 200 miles or more away. But in its current configuration, the system is not suited for airports - where faster, more accurate radar is needed and where trucks, taxiing planes and buildings create ''ground clutter'' that can interfere with the detection system. **********More important, almost no work has been done on the computer software needed to interpret microbursts and provide a quick, easy-to-understand warning to flight controllers and pilots. **********''It's not an issue of technical breakthroughs because we have the framework for the system,'' said Stephen Delligatti, who heads the Sperry Corporation's effort to beat the Raytheon Corporation as the prime contractor for Nexrad. ''But to make a really workable airport system, there is a lot of work to do, and we just have to get at it.'' **********Radar measures the distance to an object by timing the round trip of a reflected microwave signal. If the signal is strong, it usually means the target is dense - such as a heavy rainstorm. Conventional systems, however, cannot detect motion. **********Doppler radar, by contrast, detects motion by comparing the frequency of the pulse it emits with the frequency of the reflected pulse it receives a split second later. The most familiar example of the Doppler effect is the changing pitch of a passing train's whistle. The perceived frequency of the whistle's sound wave increases as the train approaches and decreases as it recedes. **********''Everyone acknowledges that Doppler is a great boon to weather prediction,'' said Kim Elmore, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. **********From its antenna, the Doppler system surveys a circular area with a radius of about 200 miles, drawing a picture of the weather patterns between 10,000 and 70,000 feet off the ground. But it takes upwards of 10 minutes to complete the picture. This delay is no problem in most weather forecasting, but it can be deadly at an airport. **********''Microbursts are small and short-lived, and the signal returns from them are often weak,'' said Anthony Durham, the director of Nexrad for the National Weather Service. ''Ideally at an airport, you want a system that covers a lot less territory -maybe 50 miles out - and looks at patterns very close to the ground.'' The picture needs to be updated every minute or so. **********Nexrad, as even its strongest supporters acknowledge, is not yet designed for such a job. The biggest problem would be filtering out ground clutter, so that a 747 turning on the runway does not appear on the screen as a burst of turbulent air. **********And flight controllers need quick notification of a microburst along a plane's approach path. **********''It's a problem no one has begun to tackle,'' said Mr. Elmore, who participated in the Doppler radar experiments at Denver's Stapleton Airport last summer. They established that the system could detect microbursts, but there were problems. **********Because of the positioning of the radar at Stapleton, it could detect air movements no lower than several hundred feet off the ground. When a human ''spotter'' sighted a potential microburst on the radar screen, he notified Mr. Elmore in the control tower by walkie-talkie. He scribbled down the details and handed the note to the flight controllers. ''Obviously, that is no way to operate,'' he said.  But no significant development work has been done on software that could detect microburst patterns automatically and convert the data into a format immediately understandable by humans. **********The outlook for early solutions is dim. The competition between Sperry and Raytheon on the Nexrad contract - the Ford Motor Company has already been eliminated - will not end until the middle of next year. It will be mid-1988 before the first prototypes are delivered to the Weather Service, and it will take at least a year or two more before the system is modified for airports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/business/briefs-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "   Debt", "print_headline": "BRIEFS;    Debt", "body_text": " **********Belgium is issuing $300 million of 15-year floating rate Euronotes paying the mean of the six-month London interbank bid and offered rate, or the one-month London interbank offered rate, whichever is higher, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

Collectively, they managed to create an increasingly strong position for economists in the policy councils of Washington and in the public mind - a position that the Reagan Administration, through its downgrading of professional economic advice, has begun to erode. **********Some of the best-known economists of the past two decades were: **********Walter W. Heller .A witty, University of Minnesota economist who once described himself as an ''educator of Presidents,'' he is credited with being the chief architect of the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts, a successful program that today's supply- siders are fond of recalling. As head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, he raised the office to new peaks of influence, both in public and in private. Last week, he recalled Donald T. Regan's confirmation hearings at which the Treasury Secretary said that ''all things being equal'' the budget would balance. From then on, he says, ''I figured Regan had a great future in Washington.'' **********Arthur M. Okun. A fast-rising star, he became C.E.A. chairman in 1968 at age 39. A thorough believer in frequent tax and spending changes, he failed to persuade President Johnson to raise taxes to finance the war in Vietnam. This, many believe, helped bring about the sharply higher inflation rates that soon followed. Mr. Okun was the inventor of the ''misery index,'' which is obtained by adding the unemployment and the inflation rates. He died in 1980. **********George P. Shultz.  A conservative specialist in industrial relations, he served the Nixon Administration as secretary of both Treasury and Labor and as head of the Office of Management and Budget. While at Treasury he also maintained an office in the White House, prompting some to see his commanding role as somewhat similar to the one Mr. Regan will soon play. Mr. Shultz, who has written a book about economic policymaking, now serves as President Reagan's Secretary of State. **********Alan Greenspan. A Wall Street economic consultant, he raised the C.E.A. chairmanship to still greater importance under President Ford. An ardent free-market advocate, he was said in 1983 to be the leading candidate to become Federal Reserve chairman before President Reagan decided to reappoint Paul A. Volcker. He headed the commission that fashioned a compromise plan to keep the Social Security system afloat. **********Charles L. Schultze.  Jimmy Carter's C.E.A. chairman, the affable, chain-smoking University of Maryland economist played a major role as Administration spokesman but was somewhat overshadowed in policymaking by the White House staff.

Berrett was on **********the stump last month. In a one- week tour through Europe, the chief executive of the Computervision Corporation gave five speeches, sat down with reporters and salesmen in Britain and France, met with top French Government officials and logged close to 1,000 miles. **********Mr. Berrett was at it again, trying to sell an idea that he has bet his company on and that he has touted worldwide. It is that all aspects of factory production - from design to assembly to quality control - can be automated by Computervision in a system linked by several computers made by different companies. **********The system is one of the newest applications of CAD/CAM, the computerized design and manufacturing process that took designers and engineers by storm when Computervision pioneered it in the 1970's. In essence, the new application allows engineers to design and build everything from hair dryers to lawnmowers with a computer that creates blueprints on a screen and that can also drive machine tools. **********So far, however, there have been more skeptics than buyers for Mr. Berrett's new system. Many customers have spurned it, fearing that his disparate computers will not be able to work together. Instead, they have flocked to systems made by competitors - I.B.M., Intergraph and Applicon - based on a single computer line. If Mr. Berrett cannot reverse that situation soon, Computervision could lose the chance to re-establish itself as the pacesetter in CAD/CAM, and the company that was once a pioneer could become an also-ran. **********''The question in everyone's mind is this: Is Berrett's strategy ever going to happen, and if so, when?'' said Joseph B. Greeson, a former top marketing executive at Computervision and now president of his own CAM company. ''How long will it be before the new products replace revenue from the old? And can they afford to wait?'' **********The situation has grown so serious, in fact, that Computervision announced two weeks ago that it would barely earn a profit in the current quarter. For the company that was once CAD/CAM's indisputed leader, the announcement was a shock. On Wall Street, which had grown accustomed to meteoric rises in Computervision's earnings, the company's stock went into a tailspin: On a single day, the shares lost nearly one-third of their value, or $250 million. Since then, the stock has not managed to regain its strength. On Friday, it closed at $20.87, down from about $33 before the big drop March 13. **********Computervision has been No. 1 in the total CAD/CAM market for years, but its share has been slipping. In 1980, according to Merrill Lynch & Company, it held 32 percent of the market, but that fell to 23 percent last year. In 1985, Merrill estimated, I.B.M. will knock it out of the top. **********THE 45-year-old Mr. Berrett has **********not wavered from his belief in **********his integrated system, but analysts and buyers are questioning the wisdom of his strategy. Computervision's continued stronghold in the almost $3 billion CAD/CAM market, they say, is anything but sure. **********''What they've got is a hodgepodge; it hasn't been integrated well at all,'' said Kenneth C. Bonine, a CAD/CAM specialist for a major aerospace company and an early user of computer- aided design and manufacturing. **********''Basically, they had a system that had a very complicated architecture, very complicated connections,'' added Ronald J. Bienkowski, manager of computer services for engineers at the American Motors Corporation, which recently awarded a three-year $26 million CAD/CAM contract to I.B.M. **********On Wall Street, too, the criticism has been mounting since the company began shipping its new system in bulk last November. Said Bob Grandhi, a technology analyst at E.F. Hutton & Company: ''It doesn't take much wisdom to conclude that Computervision is slipping.'' **********Since taking over two and a half years ago, Mr. Berrett biggest push has been to try to return Computervision to the top of the important so- called ''mechanical CAD'' market. In that segment of the market, computers are used to design product components ranging from auto parts to airplane wings. **********Toward that end, Mr. Berrett has spent millions to boost the power of the company's main computer - to enable it to process 32 bits of information, up from 16 - so that it could compete with rival machines. He has expanded the company's vast library of manufacturing software, making software crucial to the company's success. And, critically, he started integrating computers made by other companies into Computervision's system. That decision reversed a longstanding company policy to sell only Computervision products, which had left the company scrambling when competitors came out with more powerful computers. **********Mr. Berrett insists that the new integrated computer system will set the standard for factory automation. It **********IN MILANLEONARDO AND THE COMPUTER **********Dampness had caused the plaster to crack and peel from the wall. With time, the painting's colors had faded. And, by 1983, after tens of millions of tourists had passed through Milan's Santa Maria della Grazie church where Leonardo da Vinci painted his masterpiece, ''The Last Supper,'' the painting and the refectory in which it lay had fallen into disrepair. What followed was an extraordinary example of how technology helped save art. **********Using computer-aided design, or CAD, art historians from the Milan Institute of Cybernetics in 1983 were able to partly restore ''The Last Supper.'' Working with scholars' descriptions of the painting and with old sketches of it, the art historians were able to create an image of ''The Last Supper'' on the screen of a computer built by the Computervision Corporation. Then, because the machine was able to define the dimensions and color of that image, the historians were able to determine what was needed to make the real ''Last Supper'' appear almost as it did when first painted around 1494. And the computer meant that the restoration work, which continues today, was done more quickly than it could have been otherwise. **********''Leonardo was a technician, and it seems fitting that one of the most advanced CAD systems in the world would be used to restore his work,'' said James A. Baar, Computervision's spokesman. **********To assure that colors would be accurate, the historians had access to 250,000 hues stored in an electronic palette in the computer. Ever so slightly, they would change colors of the screen's image until they matched those shown in books and sketches. And to insure the correct perspective, they used CADDS 4X, a Computervision program enabling them to create 3-dimensional images. **********CADDS's ability to evaluate perspective confirmed what art historians have believed for centuries - that the power and tension of ''The Last Supper'' lie in its ability to bring viewers into the room where Christ's last meal is said to have taken place. The program also turned up more information valued by art historians: that the mathematical center of the painting lies precisely between Christ's eyes. **********All the information has been stored on computer disks for future use, and Mr. Baar said the Italians now plan to restore another piece of art using computer-aided design. No one is saying what it is, but he calls it ''another masterpiece.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/07/business/mary-kay-shares-drop.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mary Kay Shares Drop", "print_headline": "Mary Kay Shares Drop", "body_text": " **********The price of Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.'s stock fell sharply yesterday in heavy volume as fears spread that a leveraged buyout plan is running into dificulty arranging financing.

But these three survived.  So did 23 others at St. Luke's Hospital here, living through the shooting and the inferno that engulfed the airliner when it was stormed by Egyptian troops and the hijackers set off grenades. **********The survivors were among the passengers and crew aboard the Cairo-bound airliner that was hijacked 10 to 15 minutes after it took off from the Athens airport on Saturday night. **********Today at the hospital, some of the survivors recounted their harrowing experiences. **********They Back Egyptian Decision **********All of those interviewed supported Egypt's decision to storm the plane. Their stories presented the first detailed account of the events aboard the Boeing 737, which ended in an assault on the plane by 25 Egyptian commandos. **********Their versions were not without contradictions, and significant questions remained. The identity of the hijackers - the passengers said there were only three, one of whom is still alive - the hijackers' motives, goals and destination are still in dispute, for example. **********Virtually everyone interviewed since the storming of the plane said the hijackers had been prepared to kill all the passengers, one by one, if their demands for refueling continued to be resisted. The accounts also highlighted the key role that sheer luck played in determining who would live through the 24-hour ordeal. **********Among the more fortunate was Tony Lyons, an Australian engineer and longtime resident of Britain. Mr. Lyons said he had been ''next on the list'' of passengers whom the terrorists were planning to execute. **********He was also among the first to notice the rather ''nervous looking'' hijackers on the plane. No one interviewed today could recall having seen the hijackers in the transit lounge. **********'Seemed to Be Very Nervous' **********Mr. Lyons said he was sitting in Row 2 Seat B. Next to him, in 2-A, was an Australian woman, he said, but in 2-C was an ''Arab-looking gentleman, but very well dressed in a suit,'' **********''He seemed to be very nervous, sweating profusely,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''Then I also noticed there was a chap sitting by himself in 1-A.'' **********At the time, he said, he did not think much about it. But after the plane had taken off - about 10 to 15 minutes into the flight, according to several accounts - the passenger sitting next to him, who turned out to be the leader of the hijackers, approached the stewardess to gain access to the cockpit. **********A few minutes later, Mr. Lyons said, the man in 1-A stood, ''brandishing a small pistol and a grenade whose safety pin he was attempting to remove with his teeth.'' **********Soon after, the terrorists succeeded in comandeering the plane. **********''They got everybody to stand up and they frisked them,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''They were extremely rough.'' When they got to the middle of the plane, they asked an Egyptian man in a suit for his passport. The Egyptian, who was apparently a security guard, pulled out a gun instead of his passport and shot one of the hijackers. **********'Bullets Flying Everywhere' **********The leader of the group emerged from the cockpit and shot the security guard, who slumped to the floor. **********''There were bullets flying everywhere,'' Mr. Lyons said, ''and we were ducking under our seats.'' **********After the shootout, the hijackers ordered the steward and another Egyptian to collect the passports. **********After the plane landed in Malta and the hijackers' demands for refueling were rejected, they ''asked for one Israeli girl to come forward,'' Mr. Baker recounted. **********Mr. Baker said the lead hijacker took the Israeli woman outside onto a platform at the top of the exit staircase. ''I heard her say 'Help' in English,'' he said. ''A second later, I heard a shot.'' **********''About five minutes later,'' he said, ''they asked for another Israeli girl. She was reluctant to come forward. But they finally identified her by her passport.'' **********The woman was taken to the front of the cabin and made to lie down on the floor in front of the cockpit. ''Finally,'' Mr. Baker said, ''she was taken outside, and there were two shots.'' **********Americans Singled Out **********The hijackers sorted through the passports again and picked out those of the three Americans on board - Mr. Baker's and those of Mrs. Pflug and Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, 38, of Oceanside, Calif. **********''I started forward followed by the two girls - two women,'' Mr. Baker said. **********''I went outside and stood on the edge of the platform,'' he said. ''I looked over and contemplated jumping, but it was too late. **********''I heard an explosion and felt air go through my hair. I was really confused for a split second. Why was I still standing there? **********''I went head-first down the stairs and lay there playing dead,'' he said. ''I hoped I had made a good show of it. I thought they might shoot at me again. **********''Then I felt two people picking me up. They took me to the top of the platform and dropped me over the side.'' **********Mr. Baker said that as he dropped, he struck the roof of the vehicle supporting the stairs and platform. This broke his fall. ''I rolled and hit the ground on my back,'' he said. ''My arms again broke the fall. I lay there for a few minutes, contemplating whether I should run or play dead.'' **********Mr. Baker said he concluded that the hijacker had probably gone back inside the cabin, since there were snipers in plain view of the jet. ''So I decided to run,'' he said. **********He ran under the plane, where the hijackers could not fire at him, then to the edge of the tarmac and to a field, where the Malta police were waiting. ''I sustained absolutely no injuries -pretty lucky, huh?'' said Mr. Baker, a tall, thin, handsome man, a broad smile emerging from under his sandy mustache. **********'Really Lucky' **********An equally lucky woman is Jackie Nink Pflug, one of the two American woman also shot at point-blank range by the hijacker. **********''She was really lucky,'' said Dr. A. J. Psaila, a cardiologist and head of the department of medicine at St. Luke's in Valletta. ''She suffered a bullet in her brain, but it didn't penetrate. She should be out in 10 days' time.'' **********Miss Artzi, one of the two Israeli women, was also fortunate to survive, the doctor said. The bullet scraped her ear, ''just 0.5 centimeters from death,'' Dr. Psaila said.  Miss Artzi, who lives on a kibbutz in Israel, said she was not permitted to talk with reporters. But she gave her age as 24 and said that she felt relatively well. **********The other two women victims were not lucky. Miss Rogenkamp, died as a result of her brain injuries. The other Israeli, Nitzam Mendersson, was described by Dr. Psaila as ''brain dead.'' **********Smoke Inhalation **********Dr. Psaila and other doctors at St. Luke's Hospital said few of the surviving patients were suffering from bullet wounds. He said most were suffering from smoke inhalation after the plane caught fire and had shrapnel wounds from the grenades thrown by the hijackers. **********It was not know today how many of those killed in the commando operation were hit by bullets. **********Mr. Baker said two of the hijackers spoke almost no English. When he gave one of them his passport, the hijacker asked where he was from. Mr. Baker replied that he came from a small town in Washington state. **********''From Washington?'' the hijacker inquired. ''I told him yes,'' Mr. Baker said.  ''The hijacker then said, 'Ah, I was welcome, very welcome.' **********''I thought: 'Welcome. Welcome to my nightmare.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/26/world/around-the-world-us-and-vietnam-agree-on-search-of-crash-site.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. and Vietnam Agree On Search of Crash Site", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   U.S. and Vietnam Agree On Search of Crash Site", "body_text": " **********The United States said today that Hanoi had agreed to the first joint American-Vietnamese search of a B-52 crash site in a move toward settling the issue of 2,446 Americans missing in Southeast Asia since the Vietnam War. **********A Navy spokesman, Comdr.

They have left a Marxist country that is in decline, buffeted by the pressures of war and economic disarray. Mozambique celebrated its 10th year of independence from Portugal this year but remains a prisoner to internecine fighting that leaves civilians caught in the middle. **********The refugees reached this area of wretched poverty, not unlike the impoverished land they left behind, by traveling about 100 miles through the bush. When they arrive in Gazankulu, often malnourished, with scabies and measles, they are taken in by people who speak the same Tsonga language and are given food and clothing by relief organizations. **********Told They Must Leave **********The government of the ''homeland'' has pressed South Africa to allow them to remain for the time being - South Africa calls them illegal immigrants - but Gazankulu officials say they have been told that the refugees will eventually have to return to their own country. **********For many who fled, the bush was a sanctuary for endless months in Mozambique. The soldiers and insurgents would come to kill and burn at night, they said, and many hours of darkness were spent hiding in the wilderness. Daylight would bring with it a cautious journey back to their villages. **********But these days, for the unlucky refugees, the bush holds a death sentence. The refugees speak of people being eaten by lions and other wild animals as they try to make their way to Gazankulu. Their only protection against the animals are thin sticks or herbs that the refugees believe hold the power to make others fearful of them. **********Mozambican insurgents who discover them take what little food they have and rape the women, according to some refugees, while government soldiers try to stop their treks by placing land mines at the border or by other means. South African security forces also crouch in wait, hoping to seize and repatriate them. Those who are caught often set out again for the border immediately. **********Encounters Along the Way **********''On the way, we encountered buffalo, elephants, lions and other wild animals, but we succeeded to come through,'' said Alshandro Sibuyi, standing in the gentle shade of a tree at a clinic that treats the refugees. Like others, he traveled to South Africa with only the clothes he wore and food that failed to last the entire journey. **********''Some people were unfortunate, they encountered lions that killed them. One was stampeded by a rhino, but he is alive. He is a man with a baby.'' **********But, nonetheless, they come. A fear of the unknown pales beside what they have witnessed or experienced. An elderly man, seated on a donated bag of maize meal and surrounded by bedraggled children, spoke of men slitting open a baby's belly with a knife. Another said that armed men came in night's eerie shadows. **********Many of the people in his village fled as the men ransacked houses. From the distance, the people heard gunfire. When they returned, they found a woman shot dead and the dismembered body of her husband. Their small child later died as well. **********Others speak of women being forced to watch as their husbands were murdered and of children being tortured to wrench cooperation or confessions from their parents. When asked how many had been killed in his village, an elderly man who walked here with 17 younger refugees said that he ''cannot count them; there are many.'' **********As people scatter in all directions, they lose track of their wives, their children, their husbands. They do not know what has happened to them but hope they will find their way to Gazankulu. **********''We don't know who wins the war,'' said Jostina Ndobe, who came to a nearby village with her four children, leaving her husband behind to try to sell the family's cattle. She did not know how to reach this place but simply followed a group of others fleeing her village. **********''We know nothing of what is happening,'' she continued as a young man nearby separated dry grass and sticks that would become his new home. ''The thing is we are killed by both parties. As both parties are killing us, we don't like both parties.'' **********Soldiers 'Kill Everyone' **********Mrs. Ndobe speaks for many of the refugees from the Mozambican countryside, where about 90 percent of the nation's people live. They are caught up in a conflict that holds little clarity for them. They are not interested in politics, but only in guarding the limited possibilities that their lives offer. **********They do not know which side is on their side and fear that neither is. They say the insurgents come and burn their homes and kill their people. But government soldiers reportedly do the same. In their search for the rebels, the soldiers ''kill everyone,'' as one man put it. **********The rebel army, the Mozambique National Resistance, is made up of Mozambican blacks who fought with the Portuguese Army against guerrillas of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique. The insurgents have spread terror and insecurity from the northern border with Tanzania to the southern border with South Africa and from the Indian Ocean to the frontiers with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. **********South Africa, despite its nonaggression pact with Mozambique, has admitted that it has continued to support the anti-government rebels by maintaining radio links, preparing a landing strip for them and making air force supply drops. **********The Farm Is Gone **********Julius Ndlovu, a sturdy man with a regal air, is the local nduna of this village, a title that puts him one step beneath the chief and empowers him to oversee what amounts to day-to-day operations. Against a bcckdrop of thatched huts, dusty and cracked earth and idle men, he spoke with a mixture of pride and sorrow of the farm he once owned in Mozambique. It stretched some distance, he said, and in good years there was even enough food to ''sell to the white man.'' **********Here in Tshembanenge, he is left with a small vegetable patch and lots of time on his hands. **********But he will not return to his country, even though two of his children remain behind. He fled with a wife and five children after the insurgents ransacked his home three times. His second wife followed with two other children. She came with news that Mr. Ndlovu's father had been killed when ''airplanes bombed his house.'' **********''There is now no hope for me, who is speaking now, because we have lost everything, everything, everything,'' he said, with an absence of emotion that suggested long familiarity with hardship. ''Now that we are here, we are out of every problem. To go back there is just to cause more problems.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/business/briefs-129963.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 163, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Angeles Corp., a holding company in Los Angeles, said it had acquired six real estate properties in six states for a total of $74.3 million in cash and notes during June. *********** Boeing Co., Seattle, said that Texas Air Corp. had ordered an additional six 737-300 jetliners, bringing the airline's total order to 30 planes. **********The latest order was valued at $155 million. *********** Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. said it would cut primary aluminum-making capacity at its Ravenswood, W.

But, coming as it does when the United States is attempting to encourage increased lending to the third world - by commercial banks, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - the rescheduling could provide fresh momentum to efforts to resolve the debt crisis. **********At a Washington meeting yesterday, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, appealed to bankers to aid in solving the problems. [Page D12.]  Six-Month Postponement In the Mexican situation, after a number of all-day meetings in New York with Mexican officials, 13 lenders headed by Citibank said they had agreed to put off for six months $950 million in payments. Some of them were due yesterday and the rest were due Nov. 4. The lenders, which call themselves Mexico's ''bank advisory committee,'' and which represent roughly 600 lenders worldwide, said in a statement that they would use the six months to study financing requirements of Mexico and the resources available to it ''from international financial institutions, bilateral sources, and the private sector.'' **********The bank statement offered little explanation of the decision, citing only ''recent developments.'' Sources close to the talks said the bankers concluded that forcing Mexico to repay its obligations would have dealt a crushing blow to the country, especially in light of the recent earthquakes there. **********A spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in New York said that Government officials argued that Mexico was unable to make the payments because of the earthquakes, sagging oil revenues and depleted foreign-currency reserves. ''What else could we do?'' the spokesman asked. ''We are asking for support. We are not in a position to give but only to receive at this precise moment.'' **********The debt postponement has both positive and negative aspects for Mexico. Analysts said that it would permit the country to maintain its dollar reserves, which at roughly $5 billion are already dangerously low. But it also underlines Mexico's inability to make its payments and suggests that economic conditions in the country have not improved nearly as much as Government officials or lenders had hoped when they agreed in September 1984 to restructure $49 billion of Mexico's $96 billion in foreign debt. **********The $950 million was part of a ''down payment'' that Mexico pledged to make under the restructuring to restore the confidence of banks and other lenders in the international credit markets. **********''This represents realism on the part of the banks that economic expectations have not been met,'' said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group. **********It is unclear whether Mexico agreed to any promises in return for the banks' action. Unconfirmed reports said the Mexicans had promised to begin fresh talks with the International Monetary Fund to establish new lines of credit. That seemed a realistic possibility, particularly since bankers have long considered increased financing from the fund a precondition for their own future lending. **********Concern on Austerity **********The bankers have also been concerned about reports that Mexico has fallen out of compliance with the I.M.F.'s austerity program for the country. A fund spokesman in Washington, however, said that the agency had not been approached by the Mexicans. **********It was unclear whether the United States Treasury influenced the banks on the loan action. A spokesman for Citibank declined to discuss the matter, and a Treasury spokesman said that, as far as he knew, no United States officials were involved. It is widely believed, however, that the United States would like to play a more active role in resolving the debt crisis. And analysts said they would not be surprised if the Government were involved in the move. **********Mexico's financial future remains clouded. Although the country has not formally requested added financing, it has forecast that it will need $2.5 billion in new loans in 1986. Experts, however, say that banks will balk at providing much fresh financing, choosing only to roll over existing debt as they did yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/business/sperry-net-jumps-control-data-falls.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Diamond", "pub_date": "1985-07-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 634, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONTROL DATA FALLS", "print_headline": "SPERRY NET JUMPS; CONTROL DATA FALLS", "body_text": " **********The Sperry Corporation, an apparent exception to an industry trend, reported yesterday that its earnings for the latest quarter more than doubled, as a result in part of strong revenues from its large computers serving businesses. **********Another major computer concern, the Control Data Corporation, reported a 83.8 percent drop in earnings for the latest quarter, as expected, amid a host of problems.

The Big Board has been exploring 24-hour trading in stocks of companies listed on the exchange and is studying the possibility of a merger with the Pacific Stock Exchange. **********Now, it is readying a controversial proposal that could have even more far-reaching implications. That proposal, which the Big Board's staff is expected to recommend to its board of directors in early February, would pave the way for giant, well-capitalized firms such as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. to own and operate specialist units on the floor of the exchange. **********''The specialist business has become much more risk-oriented,'' John Phelan, chairman of the stock exchange and formerly a specialist himself, said in an interview. ''It needs more capital to grow.'' **********Specialists are members of a national securities exchange whose job is to maintain an orderly market in selected stocks traded on that exchange. They stabilize the market by buying when there are no other buyers and selling when there are no other sellers. They also act as agents for the brokers who leave orders with the specialists for execution. **********There now are 58 New York Stock Exchange specialist firms that serve as market makers in 1,550 stocks. Making it more attractive for larger firms to buy specialists would bring more capital to the exchange floor and would allow the specialists to better handle the large orders of institutional investors that are increasingly dominating trading. It also would help the Big Board fend off competition from regional stock exchanges, which have been steadily siphoning off volume in New York Stock Exchange stocks they trade. **********Most Big Board specialists are backing the plan. ''Would we sell? Absolutely,'' said Peter Haas, the 57- year-old principal owner of A. B. Tompane & Company, which specializes in 25 stocks, including the United States Steel Corporation. He said he and some other partners would want to lock in profits from the sale of the firm and put it to work in the business until they retire. **********''An additional $10 million in capital could be leveraged through bank loans to more than $30 million in buying power,'' he added. **********Critics of the idea, however, contend that it could significantly change the balance of power in the brokerage community and make it more difficult to police insider-trading abuses and the manipulation of stock prices. **********At the same time, they expect that the New York Stock Exchange's auction market, where one specialist serves as the focal point for trading in a particular stock, would be transformed into a dealer market of competing market makers similar to the one that exists for trading over-the-counter securities. **********Rival Units Might Spring Up **********Brokerage firms might be compelled to set up rival specialist trading units, some Wall Street officials believe, because money managers are likely to view firms linked to specialist units as having the best pricing information. There is also the fear that corporate investment banking relationships could be swayed by a specialist linkup as well. **********''It will change the rules of the game competitively,'' said Thomas F. Ryan Jr., vice president in charge of equity block trading for Kidder, Peabody & Company, one of the firms opposing the plan. ''The issue is much bigger than attracting capital to the N.Y.S.E. floor.'' **********Many major brokerage firms view the acquisition of specialist posts as a smart move, considering the relatively high return on capital they have generally earned. The stock exchange said specialists earned a 19.4 percent return on about $600 million in capital in 1983. **********Even that return is understated, said Jeffrey Schaefer, economist for the Securities Industry Association, because a number of the most heavily capitalized specialist firms use much of their capital for other activities. **********Potential Purchasers Wary **********The large firms, however, say they are not likely to throw money at the stock exchange specialists. **********''They have an inflated view of what their franchises are worth,'' said Howard Brenner, executive vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has recently become one of the most active specialists at several regional stock exchanges. He expects that in the future there will be more of a squeeze on the commissions Big Board specialists charge brokers because of increased competition from regional stock exchanges. **********Michael Cream, a Cream & Cream specialist whose stocks include the Beatrice Companies and the James River Paper Corporation and who is vice chairman of the exchange, said the rationale of the New York Stock Exchange for recommending a new rule to its board is: ''We shouldn't place any restrictions on who can be in the game. This is part of the whole deregulation and competition trend. In the end, it will make for a more efficient marketplace.'' **********Present Ownership Rules **********Currently, ''upstairs'' firms, those that deal directly with public investors, can own ''downstairs'' specialist units only if they do not act as an investment banker or disseminate research on the stocks in which they specialize. As a result, there have been only a few firms doing business with the public that are affiliated with specialists on either the Big Board or the American Stock Exchange. **********The anticipated new rule would allow an upstairs firm to continue research and investment banking while specializing in those companies' stocks as long as its specialist unit is formally organized as a separate subsidiary, in effect, creating what the Big Board refers to as a ''Chinese Wall'' to totally isolate sensitive market information. **********The American Stock Exchange board approved a similar plan last week and has forwarded it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Tentative Discussions Held **********Firms such as Paine Webber and Prudential-Bache Securities already have talked to Big Board specialist firms about possible ownership. They say they are likely to pursue the idea more aggressively if the Big Board wins S.E.C. approval of the change. **********Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, says it has some reservations. As Sam Hunter, director of securities trading, said: ''Becoming a specialist on the New York Stock Exchange is a lot more complicated. I have no idea, for instance, what my institutional competition would do.'' **********It has been suggested that, rather than take their orders to the specialist posts of competitors, some of the big firms might boycott them by lining up both sides of a trade upstairs and handling it on a regional exchange. **********Enforcement Difficulties **********The reason for the boycott would be suspicion that, despite a Chinese Wall, a specialist unit still might tip off its parent firm's upstairs trading desk to a competitor's moves. Not all of the big institutional trading firms share that concern, but they do believe that a Chinese Wall between two related trading operations would be extremely difficult to enforce. **********Before the upstairs trading desk starts ''working'' a major sell order on the floor of the exchange and through its upstairs institutional customer contacts, for instance, it might get word to its specialist unit to avoid loading up on the stock, they say. **********''It's human nature that if a firm owns a specialist it might let the specialist know something in order to protect it,'' said Anson M. Beard Jr., a managing director of Morgan Stanley, which opposes the exchange's proposal. He also said he is concerned that a specialist of an investment banking firm might weaken the pricing of a new common stock offering at the last minute to harm a competing underwriter's reputation. **********Volatility and Hedging Cited **********''The enforcement of a Chinese Wall will be difficult to monitor'' because of price volatility and increased use of sophisticated financial hedging instruments, such as options, in the current environment, said Stanley Shopkorn, Salomon Brothers' director of equity trading. **********Advocates of the specialist rule change point out that Chinese Walls already exist and function well in the securities business. Paine Webber's manager of equity trading, Richard Falk, for instance, views those who oppose the Big Board proposal as ''alarmists.'' Investment banking firms, he points out, restrict their trading activity during underwriting. **********The American Stock Exchange president, Robert Birnbaum, said that although firms with specialist posts ''might get a leg up in dealing with institutions,'' regular monitoring of trading records would catch those firms that skirt the prohibitions on sharing of information."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/17/world/moslem-militias-clash-in-west-beirut-s-heart.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1985-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 422, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOSLEM MILITIAS CLASH IN WEST BEIRUT'S HEART", "print_headline": "MOSLEM MILITIAS CLASH IN WEST BEIRUT'S HEART", "body_text": " **********Fierce clashes broke out today between rival factions in West Beirut in the worst confrontation between Moslems there in more than a year. **********Brief battles between members of the Shiite Amal militia and the Sunni Al Mourabitoun, using rockets and heavy machine guns, were waged in most of the residential quarters in the Moslem heart of the Lebanese capital. **********The city resounded with explosions and the crackle of gunfire as political leaders on both sides failed to arrange a cease-fire.

But National Intergroup is battling back. **********Because of its past and present entanglements, Leucadia, a publicly traded company, is considered the brash new kid in the takeover field. **********Two Principals **********The two principal officers of Leucadia are its chairman, Ian M. Cumming, and its president, Joseph S. Steinberg, both 1970 graduates of the Harvard Business School. Neither would consent to be interviewed. But Wall Street sources say that Mr. Cumming and Mr. Steinberg both joined the investment banking firm of Carl Marks & Company in 1970. Mr. Cumming left the following year to head a Marks real estate unit. **********The two began working together again in 1979 when they gained control of the Talcott National Corporation, which was then controlled by Michele Sindona, the Italian financier since convicted in the collapse of one of Italy's biggest banks. That company, after the sale of its James Talcott Factors division, became Leucadia. **********Among Leucadia's holdings are the Charter National Life Insurance Company, the American Investment Company and the City Finance Company. Leucadia also has a stake in the Irwin L. Jacobs-controlled Minstar Inc. **********Mr. Steinberg apparently handles the day-to-day operation of Leucadia out of New York, while Mr. Cumming works and lives in Salt Lake City. **********But the distance has apparently not been harmful to Leucadia, which in 1984 earned $71 million on revenues of $232.2 million. In 1983 the company earned $20.7 million on sales of just $180 million. **********A Bonanza **********Leucadia reaped a bonanza in 1984 from its investment in Avco, a Connecticut finance and aerospace company whose stock Leucadia thought was undervalued. Avco agreed to be acquired by Textron Inc. to avoid a takeover by Leucadia. That deal resulted in a pretax gain of $61 million for Leucadia, on a $77 million investment. **********Leucadia, apparently believing that the marketplace has undervalued the price of National Intergroup stock as well, has amassed 9 percent of its shares. **********Earlier this week, Leucadia proposed a four-part plan that it says will help increase the price of National Intergroup's stock. The proposal, which National Intergroup has already rejected, calls for the spinoff of National Intergroup's First Nationwide Financial Corporation subsidiary, payment of $4 in cash and $4 in new notes, ''direct participation'' by shareholders in promissory notes of the Weirton Steel Corporation, which National Intergroup spun off to Weirton employees, and retention of the remaining steel and aluminum operations of National Intergroup. **********In addition, Leucadia began a proxy fight to place four directors on National Intergroup's board. **********In recent years National Intergroup has been scaling back its steel operations; last year it sold half of the National Steel Corporation to Nippon Kokan of Japan. **********Leucadia had some untraditional sources of advice for the plan, relying on a study conducted by Jefferies & Company, a brokerage firm more noted more for its off-market trading activities. **********And in true loner fashion, Leucadia is apparently pushing forward on the National Intergroup proposal on its own, having split with its usual investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel Burnham disagreed with the values attached to the breakup of National Intergroup determined in the Jefferies study, according to sources close to the situation. **********The Jefferies report, issued earlier this year, concluded that National Intergroup might be worth between $50 and $55 a share, a figure disputed by some Wall Street analysts whose estimates are as low as $32. National Intergroup's stock closed at $25 yesterday, up 50 cents. **********The Jefferies study also evaluated National Intergroup's plan, which was later dropped, to merge with the Bergen Brunswig Corporation, and concluded that ''from a financial point of view, the proposed merger is unfair to the holders of National Intergroup.'' **********Now it is National Intergroup that thinks Leucadia's proposal is unfair. In advertisements directed to its stockholders that ran in several newspapers yesterday, National Intergroup said the plan would impair the company financially, strip it of its assets without regard to shareholder concerns and endanger its debt repayment. **********National Intergroup's chairman, Howard M. Love, said the Leucadia plan was ''just not feasible.'' He added: ''I spent a lot of time with them, talking to them, trying to understand. If they had a reasonable program we would have adopted it.'' **********Analysts are a bit skeptical of the Leucadia plan, saying they do not have enough information. But some say Leucadia may be trying to force National Intergroup to find another merger partner. **********Mr. Love said his company was not close to any other merger deal, but said it was willing to look at anything.

Colonel Sierra said the school had received 80 applications for 50 places in the initial courses. **********The school, the basic purpose of which is to build ties between the United States and Latin America, has sought to expose Latin American officers and their families to life in the United States, largely by introducing them to civilian families in the surrounding community. **********Most of the Latin American students speak little English. But the school has been able to find enough people speaking Spanish around Columbus, the nearest city, to help the Latin Americans and their families adjust to American society. **********Whether the school will remain at Fort Benning has not been decided, according to officials here and in Washington. There has been pressure from the Congressional delegations of Texas, Florida and other southern states to have the school, which has a budget of $3.5 million a year, moved to their states. **********Cost of Moving Would Be High **********Army officials said privately they thought the school would remain at Fort Benning because it would cost so much to move it and to build the facilities needed. They also mentioned the influence of Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. **********Last fall, after many months of negotiation, the United States and Panama could not agree on conditions under which the School of the Americas could remain there. The basic disagreement was over control of the school, which the United States insisted on retaining. **********On Sept. 30, the school closed after 38 years in Panama, and packed up 500 tons of books, equipment and printing plant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/12/business/golden-pacific-deposit-rule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Golden Pacific Deposit Rule", "print_headline": "Golden Pacific Deposit Rule", "body_text": " **********The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ruled yesterday that it would repay $16 million in deposits accepted from individuals outside the New York area by the Golden Pacific National Bank, which is based in New York's Chinatown and which was closed by Federal authorities last month. **********It had not been clear whether the funds were covered by the F.D.I.C. because under Federal law it was illegal for the New York-based bank to take out-of-state deposits. **********In its ruling yesterday, the F.D.I.C. said that it did not matter that the bank accepted the deposits illegally.

It was the second such protest this year about Soviet use of force against Americans assigned to monitor the movements of Soviet forces in East Germany under postwar agreements. **********In March, an Army major, Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., was shot and killed by a Soviet sentry while on a reconnaissance mission in East Germany. The killing provoked angry words between Moscow and Washington. **********Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the latest incident occurred shortly after midnight on Saturday morning, German time, near Satzkorn, northeast of Berlin. A 5.5-ton Soviet truck hit the rear of a Land-Rover carrying three Americans, including Col. Roland Lajoie, 48 years old, of Nashua, N.H., who is commander of the liaison team in East Germany. **********Vehicle Had Special Plates **********Mr. Hoffman said Colonel Lajoie sustained fractures around one eye when his face hit the front seat after the collision. The American vehicle, which had special identification plates with the American flag showing it was authorized to be there, was able to drive to the American headquarters in Potsdam, where Colonel Lajoie was hospitalized. **********The driver of the Land-Rover was Sgt. Jessie Schatz, who was also the driver for Major Nicholson when he was killed near a Soviet tank shed in Ludwigslust, northwest of Berlin. **********The other American in the vehicle on Saturday was identified as Maj. Wickie L. Lyons of Durham, N.C. **********Mr. Hoffman said the Americans were observing Soviet troop movements when the incident occurred. It was not clear whether the ramming by the truck was a deliberate action or an accident. **********''The intent of the Soviets involved in the incident is unknown,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''But whether it was an accident or a deliberate act, it accentuates once again the problem that we have faced in recent times: the difficulty that our perfectly legitimate liaison teams have been experiencing in East Germany. We view this matter very seriously.  ''We are still awaiting a full report,'' he said. ''If it shows the Soviet driver was acting in an unduly aggressive manner, the State Department will make its feelings known to the Soviet Union.'' **********Some State Department officials said the available information strongly suggested that the ramming was not deliberate, but was a result of reckless driving by the Soviet driver. **********Under postwar accords, the United States, Britain and France each have liaison missions attached to the Soviet Army headquarters in East Germany, and the Soviet Union has missions attached to the forces of each of the three Western allies in West Germany. **********The teams are permitted to drive around and observe military movements in areas that are not closed to them. Over the years, each side has tried to prevent the other from gaining sensitive information, and sometimes there has been harassment. Until Major Nicholson's death, no American had been killed. **********In describing the events leading up to the incident on Saturday, Mr. Hoffman said that ''a Soviet vehicle, described as about a 5.5-ton truck, with at least two military personnel, approached close behind the U.S. vehicle shortly after midnight.'' **********''The Soviets, we are told, turned on their high beams,'' he said. ''The U.S. vehicle then speeded up and subsequently, when the U.S. vehicle was pulling off the road to turn around, the Soviet vehicle rammed it from the rear.'' **********He said that the Americans were ''observing a Soviet unit returning to garrison.'' **********Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said in an interview today that ''we don't have all the facts yet,'' but that the American vehicle was ''where it should have been, and it was hit very hard from the back and injuries were caused.'' **********''Certainly, the Soviet behavior in the next few days would indicate whether there's been any change in that behavior,'' he said.

According to the state's key witness, they were part of a conspiracy that led to the attempt on the Pope's life in St. Peter's Square on May 13, 1981, and Italian justice officials say circumstantial evidence supports the charge. **********The witness, Mehmet Ali Agca, who is now 27 years old, is serving a life sentence in a Rome prison after his conviction in July 1981 of having shot and seriously wounded the Pope during his weekly general audience. **********During his trial, Mr. Agca, who was seized in St. Peter's Square, the site of the shooting, claimed to have acted alone. He later changed his testimony, saying that the assassination attempt was a result of an international plot, masterminded by the Bulgarian diplomats, in which he received the equivalent of $1.2 million from a Turkish underworld figure living in Bulgaria. **********Four Defendants Missing **********Only four of the eight defendants will be present at the trial, which is expected to last several months. It will be held in a specially constructed high-security courtroom, dubbed the Trial Bunker, that was converted from a former gymnasium at a sports complex near the Olympic Stadium in Rome. **********The courtroom has previously been used for trials of members of Italy's Red Brigades terrorist bands, including the men convicted of the kidnapping and slaying of Aldo Moro, the Italian political leader, in 1978. **********In addition to Mr. Agca, who faces charges of smuggling into Italy the 9-millimeter Browning pistol he used in the shooting, attention at the trial will focus on Sergei Ivanov Antonov, 37, the former Rome station chief of the Bulgarian state airline, Balkanair, and the only one of the accused Bulgarians in Italian custody. **********Mr. Agca told investigators, in sometimes contradictory testimony, that the Bulgarian helped plan the plot and drove him and a second Turkish gunman to St. Peter's Square on the day of the shooting. **********Mr. Antonov was arrested in Rome on Nov. 25, 1982, following Mr. Agca's testimony. He was transferred from Rebibbia Prison here to house arrest in a specially protected apartment last June because of failing health, Trial Called C.I.A. Plot Italian medical experts permitted the transfer to house arrest after Mr. Antonov began suffering intense headaches and gastric problems in prison. At a Bulgarian-arranged news conference in Rome last week, at which the trial was described as part of a Central Intelligence Agency plot, his sister, Tania Gheorgeva, said his failing health would prevent him from conducting ''an active defense.'' **********He would ''only try to reply to the court's questions,'' she said. **********While under house arrest, Mr. Antonov has been constantly accompanied by Bulgarian Embassy officials. Some Italian officials have expressed concern that he is under the influence of drugs and close attention will be paid to his behavior during the trial. **********With firm Bulgarian Government backing, Mr. Antonov has denied any involvement, and his lawyers say they will produce witnesses to prove that he was in his office at the time of the shooting. **********The Other Defendants **********These are the other defendants in Italian custody: *********** Omer Bagci, 39, a Turk arrested in Switzerland and extradited to Italy. He is charged with delivering the weapon to Mr. Agca in Milan four days before the shooting. *********** Musa Serdar Celebi, 33, the head of a right-wing Turkish organization in West Germany, accused of aiding Mr. Agca in the plot by assuring him places to stay and channeling large sums of money to him. **********The four other defendants, who will be tried in absentia, are: *********** Todor Stoyanov Aivazov, 40, a Bulgarian diplomat and former cashier at the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome, who is accused of supporting the plot. *********** Maj. Zhelyo Kolev Vasilev, 42, the former deputy military attache at the Bulgarian Embassy, who together with Mr. Aivazov left Italy in 1982 and is now in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, also accused of complicity. *********** Bekir Celenk, 50, a Turkish racketeer now living in Sofia, whom is charged with procuring the $1.2 million used to finance the plot and with masterminding it on behalf of ''unidentified instigators.'' *********** Oral Celik, 25, a Turk accused of being a backup gunman in St. Peter's Square. Mr. Celik is at large, but has reportedly been seen in France in recent months. **********Bulgaria Refuses Extradition **********The Bulgarian Government has refused official Italian requests for extradition to Italy of the three defendants in Sofia. But Italian court officials have said that the court, which consists of two magistrates, including Chief Judge Severino Santiapichi, and six lay judges, or jurors, might apply to travel to Bulgaria to hear the four as witnesses. **********Virtually the only uncontested item in the 1,243-page writ of indictment is the fact that Mr. Agca, who was sentenced to death by a Turkish court in 1979 for the murder of a Turkish newspaper editor, shot and wounded the Pope in May 1981. **********But conviction hinges on whether the court is convinced by the testimony of Mr. Agca and what Italian justice officials say is a wealth of circumstantial evidence. If convicted, the defendants in Italian custody face lengthy jail sentences. **********''It is not necessary to produce a smoking gun,'' said Virginio Rognoni, who, as Interior Minister at the time of the Pope's shooting, was in charge of police affairs. ''The court can bring a conviction on the basis of circumstances.'' **********Improved Relations Sought **********The trial is particularly sensitive for the Italian Government because of the implication that the Bulgarian Government, with the possible collusion of the Soviet Union, was responsible for the purported plot against the Polish-born Pope. **********Italy has sought to improve its relations with the Moscow and its East bloc allies, including Bulgaria, which soured after Rome decided to station new United States nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on its soil. **********Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany and a close ally of Moscow, visited Rome recently on his first trip to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization capital, and Prime Minister Bettino Craxi of Italy is to visit Moscow one day after the trial begins to discuss a range of topics, including East-West relations. **********The assassination attempt took place at a time of severe labor unrest in Poland, a key Soviet ally. Moreover, since his elevation to the papacy in October 1978, John Paul has pursued a policy of opposing leftist church groups that have favored revolutionary change in underdeveloped countries and have often led opposition in Western Europe to the planned deployment of the new United States nuclear missiles. The missile issue is of prime strategic concern to Moscow. **********Slander Is Charged **********The Soviet and Bulgarian Governments have vehemently denied any involvement in the purported plot and have accuse Western intelligence agencies of promulgating reports of their collusion to slander the Soviet boc. **********Last year, the deputy Italian prosecutor in the case, Antonion Albano, said the Soviet bloc viewed the Pope as a threat because of his support for the outlawed Solidarity trade union in Poland. Judge Ilario Martella, the 49-year-old magistrate who conducted the 23-month investigation that ended last October with the indictment of the three Bulgarians and five Turks, has said this question will not be at issue in the trial. But he has emphasized that ''it must be considered certain that there was an international plot to kill the Pope.'' **********Defense lawyers have said they will stress Mr. Agca's unreliability as a witness, although this could prove difficult since, under Italian criminal procedure, cross-questioning is restricted almost entirely to the chief judge. **********'No Evidence at All' **********Giuseppe Consolo, a well-known Italian trial lawyer who is defending Mr. Antonov, said there was ''no evidence at all.'' **********'The only evidence,'' he said, ''concerns the lies of Mr. Agca, and there are so many.'' **********But trial observers have noted that additional evidence could emerge as the proceedings advance, both in cross-examination by the judges and through continuing investigations into several criminal cases that could prove to be related to the trial. **********In one such case, magistrates are examining charges that Bulgarian Embassy officials sought information from the Red Brigades terrorists who questioned Brig. Gen. James L. Dozier, a United States Army staff officer, after they kidnapped him in December 1981. The magistrates are also investigating charges that the embassy officials planned an attack on Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, when he visited Rome in 1981. **********Moreover, it is thought possible that four Turkish extremists now imprisoned in Western European countries might disclose information under questioning that would cast light on unexplained elements of the case. **********Abdullah Catli, a Turk implicated by Mr. Agca in drug and weapons suggling in Bulgaria, has been in jail in Paris on heroin charges since last October. Another Turk, Mehmet Sener, 29, who was originally identified by Mr. Agca as the man who provided him with the gun for the shooting, is now on trial in Basel, Switzerland, charged with involvement in the same heroin dealings. **********Another Turk Is Seized **********Mr. Agca has accused Yalcin Oezbey, a Turk now serving a jail sentence in Bochum, West Germany, for using forged identification papers, of committing the murder of a Turkish editor for which Mr. Agca was sentenced to death in 1979. Another Turk, whose identity remains unknown, was arrested May 14, the last day of Pope John Paul's recent turbulent trip to the Netherlands, while trying to enter that country from West Germany with forged papers. **********The man, who gave as his name as Aslan Esmet, was carrying a loaded 9-millimeter Browning pistol that police say may be one of a cache of weapons that also produced the pistol Mr. Agca used to shoot the Pope."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/business/commodities-firms-hit-by-cftc-penalties.html": {"writer_name": "Jeffrey Leib", "pub_date": "1985-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMMODITIES FIRMS HIT BY C.F.T.C.

They were charged in an 11-count administrative complaint with filing false reports and failing to keep required records in violation of C.F.T.C. regulations as well as wash sales. The commission said that the wash trading scheme involved more than 900 violations, each of which could be subject to a $100,000 civil penalty. **********A Shatkin spokesman said the concern would have no comment until they had seen the complaint. **********The C.F.T.C. also announced consent settlements totaling $102,000 with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and one of its financial consultants for violating requirements that the consultant be registered with the commission. Shearson and the consultant settled without admitting or denying guilt. A Shearson spokesman said that the action was ''an aberration and not indicative of any problem.'' **********The C.F.T.C. announced several other settlements, primarily stemming from violations of the commission's registration requirements, totaling $60,000.

His travails in the polls have alarmed the national Christian Democrats and heartened the Social Democrats, who have convinced themselves of something that seemed unthinkable a short while back - they could win the 1987 general elections. **********A large and genial man, Mr. Kohl is good at plunging into a crowd, and he seems to derive strength and renewal from physical encounters with ordinary Germans. **********A Lot of Nervous Energy **********The duties of a federal Chancellor, however, demand a greater solemnity - and a lot of ceremonial sitting. When he is sitting, whether in Parliament or here before the committee looking into tax swindles, Mr. Kohl's considerable nervous energy is obvious: he fidgets, jiggles his necktie and radiates unease. **********The issue before the nine-man committee in Mainz is $80 million in corporate donations purportedly funneled to the local Christian Democrats and Free Democrats through tax-exempt foundations from 1968 to 1980. **********Under questioning, Mr. Kohl used the same defense he employed in November when he was grilled for seven hours in Bonn by the committee investigating political payoffs by the giant Flick corporation: a very bad memory. ''Anybody who knows the weight of my work schedule,'' the Chancellor said, ''will understand that I cannot remember after decades a thing that has no importance.'' **********The words were spoken with seeming aplomb. The Chancellor's fingers and thumbs, however, fidgeted visibly, and television cameras zoomed in on them. When he poured mineral water out of a green bottle into a short-stemmed glass, his right hand trembled violently. **********Once or twice, Mr. Kohl took the offensive, denouncing as a ''scandal'' the reading aloud of confidential letters by Social Democratic committee members and attacking ''a specific form of sewer journalism'' that he said was trying to ''criminalize'' legitimate fund-raising by political parties. **********Symbolic Importance **********By the end of a long morning, Mr. Kohl appeared to have avoided saying anything that might ensnare him in future legal difficulties. Few politicians say they believe any heads will roll because of the Mainz investigation. **********The importance of the event lay more in the symbolic realm, confirming the image of a Chancellor stumbling from one scandal and embarrassment to another. **********It has been a long list since Mr. Kohl became Chancellor in October 1982, and it has lately included the emotional storm over President Reagan's visit to a German military cemetery, the resignation of the Chancellor's spokesman because of tax evasion and nonstop squabbling in the governing three-party coalition in Bonn. **********On Aug. 29, the trial begins in Bonn of Otto Lambsdorff, the former Economics Minister, who resigned after being indicted on charges of taking payoffs from Flick. The word in Bonn is that Count Lambsdorff is determined to take others with him if it appears he will be convicted; he gave a whiff of a warning by telling the Mainz committee that he had spoken to Mr. Kohl and written to him about the tax-exempt foundations in 1973 - something the Chancellor did not recall. **********Traditionally in West German politics, a Chancellor is a vote-pulling ''bonus'' for his party. But Mr. Kohl's nationwide esteem has sunk, and Bonn politicians are talking about a ''Chancellor minus.'' This dismays younger Christian Democratic deputies, particularly ones from northern Germany who might lose seats in the 1987 election. **********Stunning Loss in May **********In May, a key election in West Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, delivered a stunning absolute majority to the Social Democrats and their well-liked Minister-President, Johannes Rau. **********The victory has poised Mr. Rau to lead the Social Democrats nationally against Mr. Kohl in 1987. A recent sounding by the polling organization Forschungsgruppe Wahlen gave Mr. Rau a popularity rating of 2.1 on a scale of minus 5 to plus 5. The Chancellor was rated 0.1. **********Yet those who know Mr. Kohl insist that he is not demoralized by the unhappy turn in his fortunes, particularly as no credible challenger has emerged from the ranks of his Christian Democratic Party. ''He knows the instruments of power,'' said Klaus Hofmann, a Rhineland-Palatinate journalist who has known Mr. Kohl for 37 years, ''and he is convinced that he is going to win the 1987 elections.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/27/world/the-israel-egypt-beach-tug-of-war.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1985-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 999, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE ISRAEL-EGYPT BEACH TUG-OF-WAR", "print_headline": "THE ISRAEL-EGYPT BEACH TUG-OF-WAR", "body_text": " **********-Egyptian Border, Jan. 25 - Israeli and Egyptian diplomats are to meet in the Negev town of Beersheba on Sunday to try again to settle their long- running dispute about Taba, a 750-yard stretch of desert with a bizarre past and an even more bizarre present. **********Taba, on the northern Gulf of Aqaba, less than a mile south of the Israeli port of Eilat, has come to represent many things to many people. **********For the Egyptians, it is ''sacred'' Egyptian soil that the Israelis did not evacuate as they should have when they completed their withdrawal from Sinai in April 1982. **********For Rafi Nelson, restaurateur, yachtsman and one-eyed Israeli cowboy extraordinaire, Taba is the palm- tree-lined resort village he built on a lease from the Israeli Government and developed into one of the most charming topless beaches east of the Riviera. **********For Eli (Papo) Paposhado, an Egyptian Jew who immigrated to Israel in 1949, Taba is his 312-room Sonesta Hotel, which he built on the disputed border strip with assurance from the Israeli Government that the land was and would always remain Israeli. **********Too Small for Most Maps **********For Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, Taba is a molehill the Egyptians turned into a mountain in order to justify cooling off the Camp David peace treaty with Israel. **********How did a sandy stretch of land too small to appear on most maps become the center of an international dispute? **********In 1906, a British surveyor was asked to delineate the border between Egypt, then controlled by Britain, and Palestine, under Ottoman control. The surveyor apparently used a very thick pencil on a map scaled 1:250,000. The width of the pencil mark on the map is roughly the width of Taba on the ground. **********Israel says the international boundary between it and Egypt is at the southern edge of the pencil smudge, and Egypt asserts that the border is at the northern edge. Each country has a different set of 19th-century geography books to buttress its claim that such and such a palm tree or stone marker constitutes the exact border. **********An Agreement to Negotiate **********When Israel withdrew from Sinai on April 25, 1982, the two countries agreed to negotiate their differences over Taba. But all talks to date - the last were held in March 1983 - have failed, and the Egyptians have made it clear that there will be no fully normalized relations with Israel until the matter is settled. **********In the interim, the two nations agreed that the Israeli border would remain where the Egyptians believe it should be, and the Egyptian border post would remain where the Israelis believe it should be. The few hundred yards in between, called Taba, would be controlled by the 10-nation Multinational Force and Observers that monitors the Camp David accords. **********The Egyptian position, said Hassan Issa, the Egyptian Consul in Eilat, is that all of Taba must return to Egyptian sovereignty. But while the negotiations over sovereignty take place, the Egyptians argue, security in Taba should be maintained by the multinational force, since this would eliminate any vestige of Israeli sovereignty. **********'If It's Mine, It's My Dignity' **********''Egypt has had its borders for 7,000 or 8,000 years,'' Mr. Issa says, ''so we know where the border runs. Sure it is a teeny-weeny piece of land. But I don't care if it's a meter, a hundred meters or a hundred miles. If it's mine, it's my dignity and I want it back.'' **********The Israelis contend, however, that Taba is theirs, and that because the tourist activities are Israeli-owned, law and order in Taba should be the responsibility of the Israeli police. The multinational force should only ''observe the order'' until ultimate sovereignty is established, the Israelis say. **********To support their claim, the Israelis allowed several ''facts'' to be created in Taba during their occupation of Sinai. Fact No. 1 is Rafi Nelson's beach club, for which Mr. Nelson holds a 98-year lease from the Israeli Government. **********He has invested thousands of dollars in building thatched-roof huts, a restaurant and even life-size statues of the biblical golden calf and Moses, which look down from the hill above. Mr. Nelson has made his patch of Taba bloom with foliage, and today it is a cozy Tahiti-style hideaway, in which his ducks, turkeys and chickens cavort alongside the topless bathers. **********'I Built This With My Own Hands' **********''I was located 30 miles south on the Sinai coast, and the Government came to me in 1970 and said I had to move because it wanted to set up an experimental oyster station,'' said Mr. Nelson, wearing his uniform of black cowboy hat and bathing trunks, with a beer in one hand and a cigar in the other. ''So I moved up here. I built this with my own hands, and I would never have done it if I didn't think it was 100 percent Israel.'' **********The same goes for Mr. Paposhado. Israeli fact No. 2 is the 12-story, $30 million Sonesta Hotel, which he began in 1977 and which he opened in November 1982. The solution Mr. Paposhado favors is a businessman's compromise. **********''Why not make Taba a joint venture between Egypt and Israel?'' he says. ''It is silly to have a conflict over such a small piece of land. Both sides have blown it up out of all proportion. People talk about Taba like it's the Alps. We have to bring it back to its real size, and then I am sure a solution can be found.'' **********Mr. Nelson agrees. ''You have to tell the world what this place is,'' he said, sitting in his ''office'' - a picnic table on the beach under a palm tree. ''I mean, you can go from one end of Taba to the other running in two minutes - or you can do it in five minutes walking and drinking a bottle of beer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/28/world/around-the-world-danes-seek-legislation-to-settle-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Danes Seek Legislation To Settle Strike", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD;   Danes Seek Legislation To Settle Strike", "body_text": " **********The Government unveiled legislation today aimed at ending a three-day-old nationwide strike, the largest in state- run industry in 12 years. **********Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said the legislation, which includes a general economic overhaul, would bypass normal parliamentary procedure in an effort to bring 320,000 striking and locked-out workers back to their jobs by Monday. **********The legislation would keep wage increases to within 2 percent next year and to within 1.5 percent in the following one.

But representing a younger generation opposed to his once-autocratic rule, they said they were willing to run the risk to broaden the party's appeal. **********''We are making the party more democratic, more dialectic,'' its secretary general, Gerardo Iglesias, 39, said in an interview, ''taking into account the social changes in Spain and on the left. **********''We want a party that is more capable to unite and not more capable to dominate,'' he said. **********Only 4 Percent of 1982 Vote **********The once-powerful party, crippled by infighting, won less than 4 percent of the vote in the 1982 elections and remains politically isolated by the center-left Socialist Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. **********The Spanish Communist Party, which led the resistance against Franco until his death in 1975, peaked in membership at about 200,000 in 1978. That number has dropped to around 60,000 today, party leaders say. **********Mr. Iglesias represents the new generation seeking change. A coal miner from the northern region of Asturias, he never attended school beyond the age of 12. He said he educated himself during the six years he spent in Franco's jails for protesting. Today, with his natty suits and well-chosen words, Mr. Iglesias projects the image of a Communist yuppie. **********It is the antithesis of the short and balding Mr. Carrillo, a grizzled Civil War veteran whose askew ties and ever-dangling cigarettes, combined with a barbed wit, had given him a personal, if outdated, charisma. **********New Policy of 'Convergence' **********After the expulsion of Mr. Carrillo and 18 supporters from the Central Committee, Mr. Iglesias led the majority in appointing negotiators to carry out the new strategy, which is called ''convergence.'' **********It means ending the party's opposition to other leftist parties and allying with Socialists unhappy over the centrist policies of Mr. Gonzalez and with single-issue groups, particularly feminists, pacifists and ecologists. **********Mr. Iglesias said he hoped to build an organized leftist opposition to the Socialists, who hold a majority in Parliament. The strategy could deny Mr. Gonzalez a majority in elections scheduled for 1986 and force a coalition. **********The Communists are particularly taking aim at the Government's free-market economic policies, its tough antiterrorist law and its efforts to keep Spain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The model for convergence is an anti-NATO coalition that has barred party insignia in its protests, including one planned for the visit of President Reagan next month. **********''We don't want to absorb or represent the other forces,'' Mr. Iglesias said, ''but to converge with them, to understand them and develop new spaces for new forms of doing politics. **********Success Is Questionable **********A move toward the center was actually begun under Mr. Carrillo, who in championing Eurocommunism rejected the model of Soviet dictatorship and embraced pluralist democracy. But some elected leaders of the new generation, such as a popular Mayor in Cordoba, even play down the hammer-and-sickle emblem, and Mr. Iglesias sounded almost Socialist in upholding a mixed economy. **********What success the new strategy might have is questionable, because to many of the targets for convergence, it sounds suspiciously like the old Communist tactic of infiltrate and take over. **********''Convergence is little more than an attempt to appropriate the capital the feminist movement has built after 10 years of work,'' said Lidia Falcon, head of the Feminist Party. ''It's curious that the party is concerned about women now, and not 10 or 15 years ago, when most of us were members.'' **********Heads of neighborhood associations said it would be political suicide to ally with any party, and even in the Communist-allied union federation, the Workers Commissions, many of the 500,000 members do not vote Communist. **********Carillo Sees Impotence **********To Mr. Carrillo, meanwhile, convergence is going too far. ''It implies a profound change in the party's nature and could leave it wrecked and impotent,'' he said. He wants the party to reunite with small splinter groups. **********Mr. Carrillo was purged for having opposed convergence, boycotting party meetings and leading a power play to regain the position of secretary general he had given up three years ago. He commands almost a fourth of the party's members, but the purge has clipped his power. **********Moreover, many of the splinter groups reject him. In his 22 years as secretary general, he purged many members for being Stalinists or ''renovators'' seeking internal party democracy. Mr. Iglesias, who rose as Mr. Carillo's protege, surprised his old mentor by championing the renovators. **********''If I had to make a self-criticism,'' Mr. Carrillo said, feeling betrayed, ''it would be having opened the leadership to too many young people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/21/world/quake-mexico-fear-worry-north-border-mexico-holding-off-accepting-us-aid-offers.html": {"writer_name": "Ben Franklin", "pub_date": "1985-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 922, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  MEXICO HOLDING OFF ON ACCEPTING U.S. AID OFFERS", "print_headline": "QUAKE IN MEXICO: FEAR AND WORRY NORTH OF THE BORDER;   MEXICO HOLDING OFF ON ACCEPTING U.S. AID OFFERS", "body_text": " **********American officials said today that the Mexican Government had declined, for the time being, to accept offers of financial help from the United States to aid in earthquake relief. **********Starting Thursday night, and throughout the day today, President Reagan, both houses of Congress and spokesmen at the State Department made repeated offers of aid.

''I have no report of any formal request from Mexico for U.S. assistance,'' he said, ''although it is my understanding that the United States has made clear its readiness to offer assistance.'' **********Mr. Kalb was able to say that it was ''the feeling'' of the State Department that Mexico's problems with its foreign debt would ''undoubtedly be held in abeyance'' by the International Monetary Fund pending an assessment of the economic implications of the earthquake disaster. **********Mr. Kalb said the State Department was referring offers of help by Americans to the Pan American Health Organization, based in Washington. Officials said the offers numbered in the hundreds. **********Claude DeVille, the disaster relief coordinator for the health organization, also spoke of the need for Mexico to complete ''an assessment of needs'' before the group sent assistance. ''We have told quite a few volunteers that we have no need for their services,'' he said. There is little risk of disease in Mexico, he said, adding that ''it will be three or four days, while they go on their own resources, before they really know where they stand.'' **********In Austin, Tex., despite protestations from the Mexican consulate official there that his Government had made no requests for help, Gov.

Botha, seemed to represent a new setback for the Reagan Administration's policy of ''constructive engagement'' in the region. The policy includes the idea that a Cuban pullout from Angola would persuade South Africa to relinquish its disputed hold on South-West Africa, a former German colony widely known as Namibia. **********South Africa's position was made known a week after Pretoria acknowledged for the first time that it had sent troops into northern Angola. The South Africans say their commandos were on an espionage mission, but Angola says they had been sent to sabotage American-operated oil installations in the northern enclave of Cabinda. **********Two South Africans were killed and one was captured in the clash with Angolan troops. The captured officer, Capt. Wynand du Toit, said at a news conference in Luanda, the Angolan capital, this week that his mission was to sabotage oil installations owned in part by a subsidiary of the Gulf Oil Corporation, which earn some 90 percent of Angola's foreign exchange. The raid has been widely interpreted here as a bungled effort to bring economic pressure on the Angolan Government to accept South Africa's demands in the region. **********'Seeking a Pretext' **********''The Luanda Government has informed South Africa through United States channels of its intention to break off negotiations with the republic,'' Foreign Minister Botha said. ''If indeed this is the position of the Luanda Government, it would appear that they were seeking a pretext on which to break off negotiations on the question of a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, and it would reveal that they have never been serious about this problem.'' **********The statement said South Africa was committed to accepting a formula proposed by five Western nations - the United States, Britain, Canada, France and West Germany - for the independence of South-West Africa, ''provided a firm agreement is reached on Cuban withdrawal from Angola.'' **********''In the light of the position adopted by the Luanda Government, the South African Government is no longer sure to what extent this goals remains attainable,'' Mr. Botha said. **********A withdrawal of the 25,000 to 30,000 Cuban troops supporting Angola's Marxist Government is a principal goal of American policy in the region. **********Since ''constructive engagement'' was initiated over four years ago by Chester A. Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, he and his assistant, Frank G. Wisner, have held many negotiating sessions with Angola and South Africa. The effort sought a trade-off by which the Cubans would withdraw from Angola and the South Africans would pull out of South West Africa, where Angola-based insurgents are fighting a low-key guerrilla war. Mr. Crocker recently put forward a set of compromise proposals. **********South African Rebels Cited **********But the issue has now been clouded by South Africa's assertions that Angola is playing host to insurgent groups opposed to both South Africa's control of South-West Africa and to its policies of racial separation. **********South Africa's statement today seemed designed to shift responsibility for the breakdown in talks to Angola and to respond to the debacle caused by its soldiers in northern Angola. **********''Sooner or later,'' it said, ''the Luanda Government will have to realize that they cannot continue playing host to tens of thousands of foreign forces and to terrorist groups such as the A.N.C. and Swapo, all of whom are hostile to peace and stability in southern Africa.'' The A.N.C. is the African National Congress, the most prominent of exiled groups seeking the violent overthrow of the South African Government. Swapo is the South-West Africa People's Organization. **********The South African statement did not address the assertion by Pretoria's neighbors that it is the source of instability in the region. It said, for instance that ''there can be no peace in southern Africa unless all foreign forces are removed and unless all the countries of the region agree not to accommodate on their territory those whose declared policy it is to commit acts of violence or subversion against other states in the region and to use violence to achieve political objectives.'' **********The implication seemed to be that South Africa's incursion into northern Angola did not fit this category. **********Pretoria's Plans for Namibia **********The statement also seemed to reinforce speculation here that South Africa wants to pursue its own settlement in Namibia in a manner that will ignore both United States policy and the Angola-based insurgents. **********Next month, South Africa plans to install an administration in South-West Africa drawn from anti-insurgent political groups, and it has called a multiparty conference. In its statement today, South Africa said it would consult with groups, including the United States and the multiparty conference, to determine ''whether withdrawal negotiations can still be conducted.'' **********The incident in northern Angola has been interpreted by South African commentators as certain to strengthen calls in the United States for withdrawal of business investments here. **********Moreover, South African political analysts said, the premises of ''constructive engagement'' now seem undermined. The policy is based on the notion that confrontation with South Africa's white rulers will not bring change, but persuasion will."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/19/business/key-rates-102424.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/18/business/insurance-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insurance Pact", "print_headline": "Insurance Pact", "body_text": " **********The Alexander Syndicate Mangement Ltd. said that terms had been agreed to for an offer of $:13.4 million, or $19.2 million, by Alexander Howden Underwriting Ltd. and the Alexander Howden Group to settle a claim on behalf of two insurance syndicates.

But Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. kept going strong. Its shares reached a record high of 48 1/4 a year ago and the Houston-based bank holding company was hailed as ''the Loan Star'' by an admiring Wall Street. **********Earlier this month, the cheering suddenly stopped. After reporting steadily higher profits for 65 consecutive quarters, Texas Commerce made a shocking announcement. Earnings for the current quarter, it estimated, will drop to 92 cents a share from $1.41 a year ago. At long last, Texas Commerce, too, had fallen prey to energy-loan problems. In the stock market, this disclosure sent a chill through the shares of Texas bank issues that had enjoyed a mini-rally during the first two months of 1985. Analysts quickly chopped their earnings estimates and wondered where the next shoe would drop on Texas banking. **********There is no sure sense today of what lies ahead for Texas banks that are major lenders to the energy and real estate industries. But caution clearly abounds on the investment front. **********Robert B. Albertson, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, takes a ''neutral to negative'' stance on Texas bank stocks. **********''In the area of drilling and service-and-supply companies particularly, loan portfolios have been deteriorating steadily,'' he said. ''Over the next three to six months, we expect to see the loan loss provisions at banks going up and the earnings estimates coming down. Thus, we would expect further negative surprises in Texas banks and perhaps even in banks outside Texas that face similar problems.'' **********There are two time frames to consider for Texas banks, according to James J. McDermott Jr., research director for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a firm that makes bank securities its specialty. **********''The near-term problem relates to lowered expectations for bank earnings in the first quarter of 1985,'' he stated. ''Along with other factors, this reflects a slowdown in loan growth from the final quarter of 1984 and the pressure on net-interest margins. The near-term outlook for Texas bank stocks generally is unfavorable.'' **********''The critical element for the longer term must focus on the ultimate floor for oil prices,'' he added. ''And, at present, that remains an unknown.'' What is known, Mr. McDermott said, is that ''bank regulators have their sharp pencils out and are closely reviewing the energy and real estate sectors of Texas bank loan portfolios.'' **********Texas Commerce earned $5.64 a share in 1984. Mr. Albertson of Smith Barney has cut his estimate for this year to $5.25, from $6. He remains ''neutral'' on the issue. Taking a more critical view is George M. Salem, who follows the stock for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He chopped his profit estimate for 1985 to $5 a share, from $5.60, describing the $5.60 figure as ''the lowest on the Street.'' Mr. Salem continues to regard Texas Commerce shares as ''a source of funds,'' or a ''sell'' recommendation in the vernacular of the brokerage business. ''Moreover,'' he said, ''the Texas Commerce situation has caused us to become concerned about possible deterioration in the quality of energy loans on the books of other Texas banks, as well as non- Texas banks with large energy portfolios and major banks with material energy exposure.'' **********So far, it is unclear, Mr. Salem said, whether the newly disclosed problems in the energy portfolio of Texas Commerce ''are a function of the deteriorating environment or related to slower recognition of older problems by the company's management.'' **********He also remains negative on prospects for the Interfirst Corporation, the largest bank holding company in Texas. Interfirst had compiled an enviable record of earnings growth until it reported a $194 million operating loss for the third quarter of 1984, described then as the biggest loss in a three-month period for any American bank. This loss, reflecting charge-offs for bad loans, mainly in the oil and gas sector, later was increased by $54 million. **********Texas Commerce's stock has never moved above the high of 48 1/4 set a year ago. It closed yesterday at 35 1/2, down 1/4, on the New York Stock Exchange. Interfirst reached a record high of 32 3/8 in mid-1981. Yesterday, the stock finished at 10 3/4, up 1/4. **********After Texas Commerce made its disclosure earlier this month, Arthur P. Soter, banking analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, reduced this year's earnings estimate to $5 a share - a revised forecast he regards ''with above-average uncertainty'' - from $6.35 previously. **********Mr. Soter, who has been consistently ''bearish or cautious'' on stocks of the four largest Texas banks since 1981, recommended that investors reduce holdings in Texas Commerce, as well as in Interfirst, the Republicbank Corporation and the First City Bancorporation. **********Mr. Albertson of Smith Barney takes a ''neutral'' position on Republicbank and MCorp, the state's second-largest bank holding company.

Another is assigned to an antiaircraft machine gun. **********A third said he joined the Afghan rebels to save his life; a fourth, out of disillusionment. A fifth compares the rebels' cause to that of the partisans fighting the Germans in World War II. **********The five, in their early 20's, are all Soviet citizens. They are among the tens of thousands of Soviet conscripts sent to Afghanistan to fight the rebels since 1979 and among the scores who have, for various reasons, deserted and defected. **********All have adopted Afghan names and dress: long shirts that go down to the knee, baggy drawstring pants and turbans or chitralis, hats that are flat on the top and have a tightly rolled rim. **********Some Become Moslems **********Some are learning Persian, the most widely spoken language of northern Afghanistan, and some spoke the language fluently. Some had become Moslems. Others are preparing to convert to Islam, the religion of Afghanistan and the source of fighting zeal for the rebels. They said they had been living with the insurgents for periods varying from two months to more than three and a half years. **********There have been reports in the past of a number of Soviet conscripts defecting and fleeing to the West, some of whom later decided to return to the Soviet Union. **********But reports on Russians living with rebels inside Afghanistan are rare, and rarer still are interviews with them. The five were tracked, found and interviewed by a reporter during a nine-week, 600-mile journey through Afghanistan in the company of rebel commanders. **********Estimates of 100 to 200 **********While it is not known how many Soviet soldiers are in rebel hands, foreign diplomats, relief workers and others who watch the situation in Afghanistan estimate that there are between 100 and 200. **********Like Soviet deserters who have spoken out after arriving in London or New York, the defectors in Afghanistan denounced the Soviet presence in the country. They also reported atrocities committed by Soviet troops against Afghan civilians, bad treatment by commanders and widespread discontent and use of drugs among enlisted men. **********According to Western diplomats and others in Pakistan, most of the Soviet troops here are conscripts with little education and training. Their main duties are to guard large cities and towns and protect supply lines. They are said to be bored and prone to serious morale and disciplinary problems, the use of drugs and defection. None of the five who were interviewed admitted that he had deserted through any fault of his own. Some said they were idealists or blamed bad treatment by their officers. **********Resented Military Discipline **********The defectors' accounts suggested that they resented military discipline and that some had acted on the spur of the moment, not thinking of or knowing the consequences. Once in rebel hands, there is usually no turning back: The defectors said they must live with their choice because they would be killed if they returned. **********The five were found and interviewed separately in rebel camps in two different provinces in northern Afghanistan. In each case, the participants sat on rugs spread out on the ground and sipped tea. Four of the five men were armed as the interviews were conducted. All were unguarded and mingled freely with the rebels. **********Once, a rebel commander offered to introduce a sixth Soviet defector. Later he said that was not possible because the defector had been sent somewhere else. Apparently the rebels decided they did not want the man to be interviewed. **********There was no way to independently corroborate what was said by those who did talk with a reporter. What follows are their accounts of life before and after joining the rebels - ''mujahedeen,'' or ''holy warriors,'' as they call themselves. Ahmed: In Army 'Everything Was Bad' **********Ahmed, a name given him by the rebels, said that he was born Aleksandr Yuryevich Levenets and that he was from the town of Melovatka in the Ukraine. His grandfather lives in Canada, he said, but he did not know exactly where. **********Interviewed at a rebel ammunition base near the Afghan town of Fulool, he spoke in Russian that was translated into Persian by an Afghan rebel who said he studied the language for four and a half years in Minsk. As was the case with the others who spoke Russian in the interview, it was first translated into Persian and then into English by a rebel interpreter who also acted as the reporter's guide. **********A 21-year-old with a slight beard and mustache and brown eyes, Ahmed wore a small turban over his short hair. He said he attended school through the 10th grade and then became a driver ''and played different kinds of sports.'' **********He was drafted into the army in April 1983, he said, and spent three months in training at Azerbaijan before being assigned to the large Soviet military base at Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. There, he worked as a driver for Soviet officers and found widespread discontent among conscripts such as himself. **********'Had to Work All the Time' **********''No one wants to be in Afghanistan,'' he said. ''If they were told that they could leave, they would not wait for a truck or a plane but would walk 10,000 kilometers back to their homes. **********''Everything was bad at our base. We had to work all the time and did not even have a chance to wash our clothes. The dining hall was dirty, and there was a bad smell. If a soldier was hurt or wounded, he was given first aid and was not sent to a hospital and put in a bed. Every week, someone tried to escape.'' **********The Soviet troops ''can't find the mujahedeen so they kill civilians,'' he said, adding: ''Our officers said we must go into a village and kill all the people and animals, sheep, horses, even dogs and cats. But I thought it was the mujahedeen who were fighting against us, not elderly people and dogs and cats.'' **********The treatment that he and a friend from his village in the Ukraine had to endure, he said, led to their decision to leave and join the rebels. **********But they abandoned the plan for a time, he said. After a few months they were sent north to a Soviet base at Abadan, just inside the border in Afghanistan, where ''I had a fight with another soldier and was put in jail for 15 days.'' **********Trouble With Drunken Officer **********''When I was released I was made a driver,'' he continued. ''One day there was something wrong with the car and it would not start. An officer told me to get it. I told him it would not go, but he was drunk and insisted that I bring it to him.'' **********When the officer saw that it would not start, ''he got angry and we had a fight,'' Ahmed said. ''He called another soldier to beat me and my hand was wounded.'' **********He said his friend had come to his tent to say he was also in trouble: He had been in a car accident and was afraid he would be punished. ''We talked about what we could do,'' Ahmed said. His friend said, ''Come, let's go to the mujadhedeen.'' **********The two left the base, walking along a highway to a bridge over a river where there was a Soviet guard post and two tanks. ''We went around it,'' Ahmed said.  Eventually they came to an Afghan village, where they hid overnight. **********Watermelons From Shopkeeper **********In the morning, he said, ''we found a shopkeeper who gave us some watermelons to eat.'' The shopkeeper told them where to find the rebels. ''We soon met them, and they took us to their base.'' **********To get them to learn Persian more quickly, the rebels said, they separated Ahmed and his friend, who was given the Afghan name Mohammed Yusef. According to a rebel commander, Mr. Yusef was killed by Soviet troops in a battle in March. **********Ahmed said he had now been with the rebels for 11 months. While he has not been on any operations with them, he is assigned to an anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. **********''Compared with being a Russian soldier, I am happy here,'' he said, adding that his officers ''warned us that if we joined the rebels, our noses and ears would be cut off and we would not be kept alive.'' **********''But I have been with the rebels,'' he added, ''and find them very kind. '' Faiz Mohammed: 'Like the Partisans' **********Faiz Mohammed also remembered warnings from Soviet officers confronted with the rebels. ''The officers said we should never allow ourselves to fall into the hands of the Afghans,'' he said. **********Mr. Mohammed - who said he was formerly named Vladimir Semyonovich Semyonov, from ''Kashira, about 150 kilometers from Moscow, House No. 6, Room No. 2'' - said he had been given specific instructions on what to do: **********''They said if we thought we would be captured, we should pull the pin on a grenade and blow ourselves up.'' **********Interviewed in a village near Khanabad in Kunduz Province, he said he had been with the rebels for about two months and was studying Islam. **********He spoke Russian in an interview that was tape-recorded and translated by an Afghan rebel, who said he had learned the language because it was mandatory at his school in Kabul, the Afghan capital. **********Avoids Eye Contact **********A fair-skinned 21-year-old with blue eyes, Mr. Mohammed wore a denim vest over his Afghan clothes and a blue skull cap over his short hair. He kept looking down, avoiding eye contact, apparently still feeling uneasy in his new surroundings. **********He said that he had ''worked on the railways'' before being drafted at 18 and that he had received military training in the Soviet city of Ashkhabad for six months. **********''I came to Afghanistan to the air base at Kunduz,'' he said. ''I was a soldier with the tank force. I was put in a post with 25 soldiers. The treatment was bad. They rotated 20 of the soldiers out but left five of us there, and we did all the work.'' **********He had planned to escape with an officer and another soldier who, he said, ''for a long time had contact with the Afghans who lived near the airport.'' **********'I Think They Were Killed' **********''I left with the officer, but the other soldier did not come and the officer went back for him,'' he said. ''They did not return, and I think they were killed.'' **********Of the insurgents, he said: ''The mujahedeen of Afghanistan are fighting against the Russians like in the Second World War the partisans were fighting against the Germans.'' **********The Soviet officers, Mr. Mohammed recalled, had told him and the other conscripts that ''we would be fighting Americans, Chinese and Pakistani soldiers.'' **********''But since I have been with the rebels, I have not seen any of these, and I have only seen weapons captured from the Russians.'' Naik Mohammed: Contempt for Officers Naik Mohammed, a 21-year-old with wide eyes and reddish hair, said he had also been told he would be fighting foreigners - Americans, Chinese and Pakistanis. **********''But I have not seen any soldiers except the Afghans,'' he said, adding that he held Soviet officers in contempt and that their abuse had led him to defect. **********''I did not like the officers,'' said Mr. Mohammed, who gave his Soviet name as Gennadi Anatolyevich Tsevma, from the town of Donetsk in the Ukraine. ''They were always hitting us and being cruel.'' **********Mr. Mohammed, who has been with the rebels for about two years and spoke fluent Persian, was interviewed in a village near Khanabad, once a major city of northern Afghanistan. It has been destroyed by Soviet troops. The civilian population has long since moved to farms and villages spread across the adjacent plain. Only rebels now haunt the crumbled walls and deserted gardens. **********Trained as Tank Driver **********Mr. Mohammed said he had been trained as a tank and armored-car driver for nearly three months and was then assigned to the airport at the large Soviet base near Kunduz, which is about eight miles west of Khanabad. He had been there for eight months, he said, when he decided that he had to defect. **********''I had no contact with the mujahedeen,'' he said. ''About 5:30 one morning, I took my Kalashnikov and came out to the highway in front of the base. **********''There was a tank and guard, but no one stopped me. I walked slowly to the nearest village. I saw an old man saying his prayers. He was frightened and picked up two stones and threw them at me to chase me away. **********''I signaled to him, no, and that I wanted to go with him,'' he continued. ''He took me to a house and kept me safe. Then the mujahedeen came.'' They took him to Khanabad. A Happy Memory One of his happiest memories, Mr. Mohammed said, was when he went with a group of rebels to get arms and other supplies from Pakistan. He spent some time in Teri Mangal, the nearest Pakistani town across the Afghan border, where, he said, he met two other Soviet defectors. **********While he was still at the Soviet base at Kunduz, he said, ''I heard about Taj Mohammed - all the soldiers there knew about him.'' **********Taj Mohammed was a Russian who, according to the rebels, defected, spent several years with the insurgents, married an Afghan woman and had a son. He was later said to have been killed in a fight with Soviet troops. **********The defector was asked why he had not sought refuge while in Pakistan. **********''I left the army to join the mujahedeen,'' he said, ''not to ask for political asylum.'' Nasratullah: 'Russians Cannot Win' **********Nasratullah - he uses no other name - said he has been with a rebel group for three years and seven months, longer than any other Soviet defector found in Afghanistan. **********In an interview at a mountain base east of a huge Soviet installation at Qiligai, he chain-smoked filter-tip Soviet cigarettes that can be bought in some Afghan bazaars. **********He had been with the rebels so long, he said in fluent Persian, that ''the Russians know I am here and want to capture me or kill me.'' **********A 23-year-old with a prominent nose, large wide-set eyes and brownish-black hair worn long over his ears, Nasratullah would neither allow himself to be photographed nor give his Soviet name or hometown. He would say only that he was from the Ukraine and that he had served at a Soviet base at Qiligai. **********Last year, he said, the Afghan Prime Minister, Sultan Ali Kishtmand, sent him a letter through some villagers. **********False Letter From 'Father' **********''It had in it a letter in Russian that was supposed to be from my father,'' he said. ''It said he was waiting for me near Qiligai and wanted to see me. But we have a special sign in our family that we put on letters. The letter did not have the sign, so I knew it was false and they were sitting in ambush waiting for me there.'' **********Speaking of his life in the Ukraine, he said that after finishing high school, ''I worked in a military factory hiddden under a river.'' He added, ''I volunteered to go to Afghanistan to see what kind of war it was.'' **********He was sent to Qiligai, where he worked as an assistant to the commander of a tank and bus repair unit ''instead of being used as a soldier.'' **********''I came here for fighting, but they gave me a job at the base,'' he said. ''And they were killing civilians, even burning them with flame throwers.'' **********Once, he added, ''I saw them with binoculars running over civilians with their tanks at a village near the base.'' **********The Soviet soldiers, he added, ''are always thinking of ways to escape.'' **********''While I was there, I heard of two who tried to run away,'' he said. ''One got away, but the other, who was behind, was shot and killed by the guards.'' **********The rebel group he has joined has a captured radio used by Soviet troops in the field, and now, he said, ''I listen to the conversation between the Russians.'' **********An Escapee Captured **********''About a year ago, they talked about a soldier who was captured after escaping,'' he said. ''They put a mine under him and exploded it to kill him.'' **********Nasratullah said that when he decided to flee, he left the base and told the guards he was going swimming in a nearby river. **********''I was not in a fighting unit and had no gun, so they did not stop me,'' he said. **********Within hours, he said, he met an Afghan rebel who took him to his group hidden in a spot 20 minutes away. **********During the interview, he was asked if he had taken part in rebel attacks. ''Yes, five times,'' he said. ''I use a recoiless rifle.'' **********As for the fighting, he said: ''The Russians cannot win, because the Afghans are not fighting them face to face. They are fighting a partisan war and keep changing their bases and withdrawing when they are attacked. **********''The rebels,'' he added, echoing the remarks of dozens of rebel fighters interviewed in Afghanistan in the last year, ''are fighting for their country and for Islam.'' Rahmatullah: Tried to Escape Rebels Rahmatullah came to join the insurgents in a different way: He was captured three years ago in a rebel ambush while selling gasoline from a tanker truck, according to rebel commanders. **********In his first months with the rebels, they said, he tried to escape several times. Then, he said, he realized that if he was returned to the Soviet Army he would be killed. He agreed to join the rebels and became a Moslem. **********Wearing jogging sneakers and a blue zippered jacket with a BMW patch over his Afghan clothes, Rahmatullah, 23, recalled those early days in an interview in Waliyan. The town is about 10 miles south of the Qiligai base, where he once served in the Soviet Army.

The arrears will also make it more difficult for Nicaragua to get help from other institutions or banks. **********The World Bank document, a 45- page information statement released two weeks ago, states only that it has placed on ''nonaccrual status'' the debt of ''one member country,'' which it does not identify. But the debt figures of this unnamed country exactly match those of Nicaragua listed elsewhere in the same report. **********Developing nations have occasionally fallen behind in repaying loans to the World Bank. But they have always scrupulously avoided falling six months behind, because at that point the World Bank puts the loan on nonaccrual status. This means that the bank does not credit payments as income until they are actually made. Under the standard accounting practice, payments are entered in the books when they fall due, even if they have not been received. **********Bank Spokesman's Statement **********A spokesman for the bank declined to confirm that Nicaragua is on nonaccrual status. The bank's spokesman said, however, that the country mentioned in the report was believed to be the first ever to fall behind by six months. The report said that the country, as of Dec. 31, was behind on $4.55 million of principal payments and $9.55 million of interest payments. **********Nicaragua's total debt to the World Bank is $134.14 million; the country's total foreign debt is a little more than $4 billion. It has also fallen behind in repaying private banks, which are now reviewing a debt-management proposal submitted about two weeks ago by Managua, according to a banker familiar with the negotiations. **********''It is true that Nicaragua has been in contact with the World Bank in order to settle the effects of the economic difficulties Nicaragua is having,'' said Marcos Wheelock, financial counselor in the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington. ''Nicaragua is behind in payments.'' **********Mr. Wheelock said he could not confirm that his country was six months behind, but he said talks were under way with the World Bank and that no repudiation of the debt was being considered. **********''We are under economic stress imposed by the C.I.A.-financed war by National Guards of Somoza, accompanied by some ex-members of the Sandinista revolution,'' he said. ''That places an extra burden on us in addition to the burden of the world depression.'' **********Nicaraguans Blame U.S. **********Last month, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua described his country's economic situation as ''hellish'' and blamed the Reagan Administration for ''orchestrating a campaign of lies'' that had cost Nicaragua more than $1 billion in lost credits and exports during the last four years. **********Francisco de Paula Gutierrez, a private consultant on Central America based in Costa Rica, said in a telephone interview that the World Bank arrears would make it more difficult for Nicaragua to get financing to buy imports or to arrange the sale of exports. Other Central American countries and East bloc nations have already begun to cut off credits to Nicaragua, he said, and are demanding immediate payment in all trade transactions. **********''I don't see how the Nicaraguans will be able to pay their debts unless they get external financing,'' Mr. Gutierrez said. ''And I don't see how they will get external financing unless they pay their debts.'' **********The United States has blamed ill-advised economic policies and an expensive military buildup for Managua's deepening economic crisis. The United States has urged the Inter-American Development Bank, which is now holding its annual meeting in Vienna, to reject a $58 million loan to Nicaragua. The arrears to the World Bank are expected to bolster the arguments of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who wrote to the development bank in January that ''Nicaragua is not creditworthy'' and warned that a loan to Nicaragua would make it more difficult to win Congressional passage of funds for the development bank. **********The World Bank's loans to Nicaragua are less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the lending agency's total loans, and a World Bank spokesman stressed that the bank's liquidity was in no way jeopardized by the arrears. **********The World Bank and the Inter- American Development Bank are not private commercial banks but are jointly sponsored by a number of nations to lend money to countries for development."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/06/business/mellon-bank-sues-sharon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1985-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mellon Bank Sues Sharon", "print_headline": "Mellon Bank Sues Sharon", "body_text": " **********The Mellon Bank said yesterday that it had filed two suits against the Sharon Steel Corporation seeking $33 million in missed interest payments on Sharon's debentures.

Bricker, the chairman of the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, has carried his impulsiveness too far. **********Mr. Bricker, a strapping 52-year- old chemical engineer, has long been known as a man willing to move quickly and take big risks. Named Shamrock's chief executive officer in 1976, he has marshaled its resources into a series of major acquisitions and huge investments in oil exploration that have almost completely reshaped a company. **********But now, after his aborted agreement with Occidental, the qualities that had earned Mr. Bricker a reputation for aggressiveness are being characterized on Wall Street as hastiness and poor judgment. Many analysts maintain that Mr. Bricker has left Shamrock vulnerable to hostile takeover offers and say he has generated hard feelings among shareholders that will severely damage his authority. **********'Must Be Losing Sleep' **********''Bill Bricker has always been a risk-taker,'' said Amantha Raman, a chemical industry analyst who heads Amantha Raman & Company. ''But in light of what happened with Oxy, he clearly made a mistake, and he must be losing sleep over what comes next.'' **********''Bricker is the kind of guy who reacts first and then thinks about the consequences,'' said Andrew Gray of Pershing & Company. ''In the oil business, that is sometimes necessary because things move so rapidly. But in this case, he doesn't look good.'' **********For his part, Mr. Bricker has no apologies for Shamrock's decision. A company spokesman, Ginger Shearborn, said that the company intended to conduct ''business as usual'' and would continue to pursue a strategy of reducing its business in chemical manufacturing while expanding its operations in the oil industry. **********Hallmark Strategy **********That strategy, which Mr. Bricker put into place shortly after he was named Shamrock's chief executive, has been the hallmark of his career. And until now, although they have questioned the timing of his moves, analysts have generally given him high marks for performance. **********Mr. Bricker, who holds a master's degree in chemical engineering and started his career as a salesman of agricultural products, joined Shamrock in 1969. The company had been formed two years earlier through a merger of the Diamond Alkali Corporation, a chemical manufacturer based in Cleveland, and the Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, an oil and gas producer in Amarillo, Tex. **********By 1976, when he was named chief executive, the Arab oil embargo had already resulted in soaring increases in oil prices, and Mr. Bricker began a restructuring of the company that was to last into the early 1980's. As a result of a series of acquisitions in the oil business, the company's chemical business, which had contributed more than 60 percent of its operating income in 1976, contributed only 20 percent of its $131 million in operating income for the first nine months of 1984. **********Income More Than Doubled **********Shamrock's largest operations involve oil and gas exploration and production and refining and marketing, which accounted for more than 70 percent of its earnings. For the nine- month period, Shamrock reported net income of $185.4 million, or $1.36 a share, more than double its $73.9 million, or 96 cents, the year before. **********Sales for the nine-month period increased 21.4 percent, to $3.4 billion, from $2.8 billion. **********But the effort to transform an old- line chemical company with minor holdings in the oil business into an oil and gas concern with a small interest in the chemical business did not always go smoothly. Mr. Bricker's investment decisions have confounded Wall Street, and sometimes resulted in large losses. **********Mr. Bricker, who took on the title of chairman in 1979, has adopted a strategy in oil exploration of passing by relatively small investments that hold a high likelihood of success for big, expensive and high-risk plays. ''He has always gone after the elephant fields,'' Mr. Raman said. **********Going after the large fields meant a high loss in 1983, when Shamrock reported a $194.7 million charge against its earnings as a result of losses from its exploratory drilling in the Mukluk field, an offshore area in northern Alaska that produced some of the most costly dry holes in the history of the oil business. **********As the result, Shamrock reported a 1983 loss of $56.2 million, compared with net earnings of $185 million, or $2.94 a share, the year earlier. **********Mr. Bricker, meanwhile, has also become known for a dominant, assertive management style and an outspokenness that has sometimes caused hard feelings. Many residents and former Shamrock employees in Cleveland, for example, recall a bitter dispute between Mr. Bricker and Dennis J. Kucinich, that city's former Mayor, when Shamrock announced in 1979 that it would move its headquarters from Cleveland to Dallas. **********In a widely publicized exchange at the time, Mr. Bricker said the company was leaving Cleveland in part because it was a ''declining city.'' **********And the Shamrock chairman's reputation as a risk-taker was heightened in 1983, when he made two major acquisitions in the oil industry at the very time when oil prices were beginning to weaken and oil company profits were sharply narrowing. These included the $1.4 billion acqusition of the Natomas Corporation, an oil and gas concern with major oil reserves in Indonesia, and the Sigmor Corporation, a gasoline refining and marketing company in Texas for which Shamrock paid $151 million. **********Acquisitions Were Criticized **********Many analysts criticized both acquisitions, saying that Natomas's Indonesian reserves meant too much of a commitment to foreign operations, and that falling profit margins in refining and market would plague Sigmor for years go come. **********This year, the operations added through both the Sigmor and Natomas acquisitions have been profitable. **********After backing out of the Occidental merger, some analysts maintain that Mr. Bricker is bound to face a loss of credibility among investors, detractors on his board and even other members of Shamrock's senior management."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/07/world/opec-fails-again-in-effort-to-unite-to-keep-prices-up.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1985-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1044, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPEC FAILS AGAIN IN EFFORT TO UNITE TO KEEP PRICES UP", "print_headline": "OPEC FAILS AGAIN IN EFFORT TO UNITE TO KEEP PRICES UP", "body_text": " **********Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed again today to agree on measures to bolster world oil prices, despite a warning by Mexico that it might cut its oil prices next week. **********It would be Mexico's second price cut in a month in response to declining demand for its oil. Analysts say a price cut by Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, would almost certainly lead to a renewed decline in world oil prices, rendering the cartel's price structure increasingly unrealistic and fragile. **********After two days of apparently fruitless talks here, Indonesia's Oil Minister, Subroto, who is presiding over the meeting, told reporters he had asked ministers to return on Sunday to suggest ''immediate steps'' to defend the cartel's price structure and its share of the world market. **********Mexico to 'Defend Interests' **********In a letter to the OPEC ministers, President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico said his country would ''fully defend its national interests'' if the cartel failed to take decisive action to stem the world decline in oil prices. **********In an interview on Mexican television, Oil Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa said Mexico might reduce its oil prices as early as next week. Mr. Labastida Ochoa is attending the meeting here as an observer. **********Another factor complicating the situation was the unhappiness of Saudi Arabia over its role as OPEC's ''swing producer,'' the nation that adjusts its oil output to support prices. **********The Saudi Oil Minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, was reported to have made it clear today that his country was insistent on increasing its oil output, and he is said to have indicated that the other members would have to choose between accepting the lower prices that would result from an overall increase in production, or reducing their own quotas to offset a Saudi increase. **********OPEC is now widely perceived as facing the most serious crisis of its 25-year existence, with its ability to set international oil prices and even its continued existence in question. **********Tensions Among Members **********Declining demand for its members' oil, increasing production by non-OPEC countries and widespread violation of OPEC's established prices by its own members are undermining its control of the world market and creating deep tensions among its 13 members. **********Earlier today, Mr. Subroto said OPEC planned to set up a monitoring body to oversee oil sales and crack down on members' violations of OPEC quotas and official prices. **********But tonight he said the group had decided that such a monitoring body ''will take some time to set up.'' Instead, he said, ministers decided to turn their attention to ''short-term steps'' to bolster their price structure and market share. Other delegates said several members, including Saudi Arabia, opposed a new monitoring body because of doubts that it would be able to stop violations or stabilize world prices. One delegate described the idea as ''effectively dead.'' **********Several delegates said OPEC would now be forced to consider price and output reductions, which Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were advocating before this weekend's meeting as the best approach. **********Although OPEC has set itself an official production ceiling of 16 million barrels a day, its members are currently able to sell only about 14.1 million barrels. But some are producing more than their quota and offering discounts of as much as $4 a barrel below OPEC's official price of about $28. **********As a result, Saudi Arabia has absorbed all of OPEC's loss of market share. Its daily production has shrunk to 2.1 million barrels from an official ceiling of 4.3 million. **********Oil trading sources said the proposal for a monitoring organization appeared to be intended to create the impression that OPEC remained in control of world oil markets, but they said the move was unlikely to alter the fundamental downward trend of energy prices. **********Other recent attempts by OPEC to tighten its grip on the world oil market and discipline its members have come to little, the sources noted. Last December OPEC asked a Dutch accounting firm to set up an auditing system to monitor members that exceeded their production quotas. **********Some Have Barter Arrangements **********But in January OPEC was forced to cut the price of Saudi light crude oil, the benchmark grade, by $1, to $28. And industry sources say many OPEC countries are selling oil at discounts to secure contracts, often through complex barter arrangements under which they exchange oil for other goods. **********OPEC's efforts to enlist the support of oil producers outside the cartel, such as Egypt, Mexico, Britain and Norway, have also come to nothing. All these countries have reduced their prices in recent weeks below OPEC levels. **********Nigeria, Ecuador and Venezuela are among the heavily indebted OPEC countries that analysts say are exceeding their production quotas in an increasingly desperate effort to earn revenue. In many of these countries a debate has begun about the continued usefulness of OPEC membership, according to these sources. **********Warning by Saudi Leader **********King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has warned publicly that the kingdom might deliberately increase production, forcing world prices still lower, unless other OPEC members accept his proposals for tightening discipline. **********But other OPEC oil ministers favor continuing the group's existing price structure. Nigeria, Libya and Algeria are said to fear that the reductions sought by Saudi Arabia would favor heavy crude oil at the expense of their own lighter grades. **********Conference sources say thatSheik Yamani has not repeated the threat to increase output at the meeting and appears eager to avoid a confrontation. **********Saudi Arabia is currently producing less oil than Britain and has the largest deficit in the world on its balance of payments after the United States. It is drawing down its reserves at a rate of $20 billion a year to finance development plans. **********But poorer and more heavily populated OPEC countries say they are unsympathetic to the Saudi complaints, arguing that they have a greater need for oil revenues. They want the Persian Gulf countries, with their vast financial reserves, to yield them a larger share of the declining world oil market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/world/winnie-mandela-jailed-for-return-to-soweto-home.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1985-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WINNIE MANDELA JAILED FOR RETURN TO SOWETO HOME", "print_headline": "WINNIE MANDELA JAILED FOR RETURN TO SOWETO HOME", "body_text": " **********The South African police arrested Winnie Mandela today after she defied a ban imposed Saturday forbidding her to enter Soweto.

Earlier, she told a Dutch television interviewer that she refused to be dictated to by ''the occupiers of this country.'' **********Charges Are Expected **********In another interview before her arrest, she said she had ''full knowledge that if they ever find that I have set foot in the house, they will eliminate me.'' **********Her lawyers said she was expected to be charged with offenses relating to restrictions placed on her Saturday, forbidding her to visit Soweto, which is home to more than 1.5 million blacks and is viewed by the authorities as a tinderbox of political unrest. **********The police said she would be charged under South Africa's catch-all security legislation. Her lawyers said they had been permitted to see her in the Krugersdorp detention cells. **********Husband Jailed for Life **********Mrs. Mandela is married to Nelson Mandela of the outlawed African National Congress, who has been in jail for more than 20 years. He is serving a life sentence in Pollsmoor prison outside Cape Town for sabotage and plotting revolution. **********On Saturday, the policemen who served the restriction notice on Mrs. Mandela manhandled her out of her home, witnesses said, after she refused to accept it. She reportedly suffered a sprained ankle and bruises. **********The ban, the latest in many imposed on Mrs. Mandela for more than two decades, relaxed previous restrictions in force since 1977 that confined her to the remote town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. **********Move Seems to Backfire **********But the new move - evidently an effort by the authorities to show themselves in a better international light by relaxing Mrs. Mandela's restrictions -seems to have backfired since her defiance has shifted attention to police actions in enforcing the restrictions. **********South Africa's authorities are under strong pressure from Western nations, including the United States, and creditor Western banks to provide evidence of readiness for racial changes. **********Over the last 15 months, violent racial protest has claimed over 1,000 lives and prompted the enforcement of emergency rule in areas around the major cities of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth.

They permit her to move away from Brandfort and to attend social gatherings, but still make it an offense for her to be quoted in South Africa and forbid her to address political meetings, enter educational institutions or join some political movements. **********Assembly Is Forbidden **********Mrs. Mandela is still what is known as a ''banned'' person in South Africa, a form of punishment without trial that restricts the movements of people the authorities consider a political threat. For the last eight years, she has been forbidden to assemble with more than one other person other than her immediate family. ----#6 Journalists Are Detained JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 22 - Six white journalists were arrested today outside Mrs. Mandela's home in Soweto and were briefly detained. **********The journalists were taken to a police station while Mrs. Mandela was being removed from her home.

To many, the decision to start talking again seemed little more than a restoration of the pre-Reagan status quo. **********''There has been no forward movement unless you are counting from the total breakdown of talks at the end of 1983,'' said Dr. Stephen F. Cohen, professor of Soviet politics at Princeton University. ''They are simply resuming talks that had gone on for two generations and then were broken off.'' **********It is unlikely that the decision to resume arms control negotiations will have a ''spillover'' effect that will stimulate progress on such key questions as Poland, Afghanistan and the Middle East, analysts agreed. In fact, they maintained, continued tension in those areas may actually decrease the possibilities for success in the arms control field. **********''There have to be political talks too,'' said Dr. Adam B. Ulam, director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University. ''Arms control negotiations cannot conceivably succeed without some sort of formula that would enable both sides to deal with those issues while attending to the immediate problem of the arms race.'' **********While agreeing that the Russians have an interest in avoiding further heightening of an arms race that can only drain their resources and strain the fabric of their society, most analysts and former Government officials predicted that the Russians would continue to seek American concessions. Only Henry A. Kissinger argued otherwise. **********''The Soviets seem to me so eager for an agreement that if we are patient, if we do not get over-eager, we can achieve the objectives that have been set by the President,'' the former Secretary of State said on the ABC television program ''Good Morning America.'' **********The decision to organize the talks in an ''umbrella'' format, with three subgroups dealing with various aspects of arms control, also drew comment. Malcolm Toon, a former Ambassador to Moscow, called it ''an ingenious approach to a very difficult problem,'' while others classified it as a gesture intended to let the Soviet Union save face. **********''To some extent, it is a procedural device to give the Soviets the alibi that they are not just going back to the old talks they aborted,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to President Carter. ''In fact, what we are doing is reopening two old sets of talks and adding a third set,'' he said. **********But most analysts also maintained that American concessions had been matched on the Soviet side, especially in view of earlier Soviet statements that negotiations would never resume while American Pershing 2 and cruise missiles were deployed in Western Europe. They said it would be impossible to argue that the first round of talks had produced a clear winner or loser. **********''Not even Solomon himself could weigh that,'' Mr. Vance said. **********In Washington, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said of the Geneva agreement: ''We were very excited about it. At least it is continuing the dialogue.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/04/business/business-people-an-economist-gets-key-rothschild-job.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1985-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  An Economist Gets Key Rothschild Job", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   An Economist Gets Key Rothschild Job", "body_text": " **********Rothschild Inc., a Wall Street investment banking house, announced yesterday that Irwin M.

This time, he said there was a fourth Turkish conspirator in St. Peter's Square when he shot the Pope on May 13, 1981. **********Mr. Agca, a 27-year-old Turk who is the star witness against three Bulgarians and four Turks charged with complicity in the shooting, said last week during his 12th day of testimony that he would not answer any more questions. **********Prosecutors based their case against the seven defendants largely on his statements to investigators after he turned state's evidence. Mr. Agca is serving a life prison term for the attack, which wounded the Pope. **********Initially, Mr. Agca testified that one other Turk, Oral Celik, was in the square. Later, he changed that version and said another Turk, Omer Ay, was also there. **********Today, he changed his story again and said there was a third Turk, in addition to himself, in the square. **********''The other man was Sadat Sirri Kadem, my schoolmate,'' Mr. Agca said. He said the accomplice's code name was Akif. **********Mr. Kadem is a leftist activist from Mr. Agca's hometown who now is in prison in Turkey, according to documents read aloud by Judge Severino Santiapichi. **********Mr. Agca did not explain why a leftist would be cooperating with him and other members of the Gray Wolves, a right-wing Turkish terrorist group. **********Mr. Kadem's name had come up before in the trial because of allegations by a Turkish friend of Mr. Agca that Mr. Kadem was with Mr. Agca in the square during John Paul's general audience. **********In the first five weeks of the trial, Mr. Agca insisted that Mr. Kadem had nothing to do with the shooting. **********In confusing testimony two weeks ago, however, Mr. Agca at first seemed to identify a man in a photograph taken in the square as Mr. Kadem, but then reversed himself and said the man was probably Mr. Ay. **********Neither Mr. Kadem nor Mr. Ay has been charged in this case because investigators have yet to verify Mr. Agca's statements, Antonio Marini, the prosecutor, told reporters. **********Last Wednesday, Mr. Agca said he would have nothing more to say, so on Thursday and again on Monday the court heard testimony from Musa Serdar Celebi, a Turkish defendant. **********At one point, the judge asked a question of Mr. Agca, who was sitting in his metal defendant's cage, and Mr. Agca said he would like to ''clarify'' a few things. **********The judge allowed him to return to the stand, where he made a statement trying to explain why his testimony has been inconsistent and why he had refused to answer any more questions. **********'Examination of My Conscience' **********''I wanted to make a deep examination of my conscience,'' he said. ''There is something to be said, naturally, for why I said many contradictory versions. **********''Why?'' he said. ''Because the Gray Wolves and the Bulgarians kidnapped Emanuela Orlandi so that I would retract the accusations against them, confuse the trial and then I was to discredit the Western press'' **********Emanuela Orlandi, the teen-age daughter of a Vatican employee, disappeared two years ago after music lessons. Her self-proclaimed kidnappers have demanded Mr. Agca's freedom, but they have offered no public proof that they have the girl. **********Mr. Agca said that before the assassination attempt, there was an agreement that if one conspirator was caught, the others would kidnap someone to exchange for him."}}
