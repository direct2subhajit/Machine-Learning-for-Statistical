But companies making larger computers did not perform as well because the recession and high interest rates dampened business orders. **********Apple Computer, a leading maker of personal computers, reported an 83 percent increase in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1982, ended Dec. 25. And Wang Laboratories Inc., a leading maker of small business syste ms, said earnings in its second quarter jumped 32percent. **********Prime Computer Inc., however, reported flat earnings for its fourth quarter last year, while the Harris Corporation said earnings for its second quarter had plunged 42 percent. Both companies concentrate on relatively large computers for businesses. **********Apple's gain reflected heavy Christmas buying of the Apple II system, which was heavily promoted late last year as a family computer and contains programs for as video games and budget planning. **********Apple's earnings rose to $13.6 million, or 24 cents a share, on revenues of $133.6 million. In the comparable period last year, Apple reported earnings of $7.4 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenues of $67.6 million. **********Ulric Weil, a principal at Morgan Stanley & Company, argued that earnings would have been higher except for a rise in research and development expenses, which almost doubled from the similar period last year, to reach $7.9 million. ''These expenditures dampen earnings immediately, but they speak well for the future as far as new product announcements,'' he said. ''No one in the personal computer spends as much for research as Apple, and that's a good sign.'' **********Second-quarter earnings at Wang rose to $25.2 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenues of $273.4 million. This compares with net income of $19 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenues of $201.7 million for the similar period last year. The increase was attributed to strong sales for office automation systems.

Less than two weeks before its annual meeting, the company found out that Alan E. Clore, a British investor, was waging a proxy fight for control of the ailing mining and chemicals concern. Almost before Gulf Resources's top executives could catch their breath, they were ousted in one of the fastest proxy contests on record. **********Mr. Clore's victory and its modest price tag of $1.5 million did not escape notice on Wall Street, where he captured the attention of many professionals and investors who rarely give faltering companies such as Gulf Resources a second glance. In short order, merger and acquisition specialists, along with disgruntled shareholders, began to wonder whether they, too, could take over a company with the expenditure of so little money and so little time. **********Indeed, in the wake of the Gulf Resources contest, many Wall Street analysts expect a new wave of proxy fights, in which dissident investors, rather than trying to buy a company outright, will seek to wrest the reins from management by winning shareholder support for new corporate strategy. **********''I think Gulf Resources was a tremendous eye-opener,'' said Stephen Schwarzman, a partner at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. ''All these businessmen are trying to buy companies and getting rebuffed by management, and here's this guy from Britain who moves in quickly and gets control, relatively cheaply. That deal tells you something has changed.'' **********Most of what has changed is the business climate. As long as stock prices remain severely depressed and high interest rates make it difficult to finance an acquisition, analysts believe that dissatisfied investors, particularly those with large stock holdings, will find the proxy fight an increasingly popular tactic for winning control of a company. **********In fact, a significant upturn in the number of proxy fights is already apparent, according to Georgeson & Company, a leading firm in the business of soliciting shareholder proxies. Its figures show that there have been 11 major battles so far this year, including Gulf Resources and the pending Global Natural Resources fight, compared with with only 17 for all of 1981 and the same number in 1980. **********Though Gulf Resources is the most dramatic example, similar proxy wars have brought new management to several other companies. Last spring, 33-year-old Neil Leist won control of American Bakeries, the nation's fourth-largest commercial bakery. A few months later, after a bitter two-year contest, Michael Buchsbaum took over Holly Sugar.  Last year's successful proxy fight at Penn Central was more limited.  Instead of trying to gain control, dissidents sought only to block Penn Central from completing a $1.4 billion merger with Colt Industries. **********Because shareholders usually differ on what constitutes salvation, most proxy fights stir up considerable ill will. In this year's fight for control of the Tosco Corporation, for example, management charged that dissident Kenneth Good, who was trying to get Tosco to pull out of the Colony Oil Shale Project, was obtaining nonpublic information on Tosco through his girlfriend, the director of the Colorado Department of Local Affairs. By the May annual meeting, the confrontation had become so heated that Tosco management disconnected Mr. Good's microphone when he began personal attacks on the officers. **********Bitterness, however, is almost inevitable in any battle to take over a corporation, whether it be by a proxy challenge or by a tender offer.  Yet, the proxy routehas a singular advantage: it is relatively inexpensive. In asking shareholders to vote for a new slate of directors, or to oppose a management decision, the dissident shareholder must only win support of a majority of those who return their proxy ballots. The costs of waging such a battle tend to be limited to legal and advisory fees as well as advertising costs. **********In most cases, the dissident investor has already purchased a substantial block of shares himself and may be able to win his fight by merely enlisting a handful of other large stockholders.  Mr. Clore had accumulated more than 15 percent of Gulf Resources's stock in the seven months before its May 11 meeting, while Mr. Good spent more than a year acquiring his 8.8 percent share of Tosco. **********''In a proxy fight, the shares you do buy, you buy at close to the market price, and of course you don't have to buy as many shares as you do to get control of a company through a tender offer,'' said Brian Young, the vice president in charge of mergers and acquisitions at First Boston. **********Although proxy battles can be an inexpensive way to gain control of a company, financial experts stress that they will not replace tender offers. **********While individual stockholders may be satisfied with taking over the board, they say, most corporations want to acquire, not just control, other companies. And for most large corporations, proxy fights are too long and their outcome too uncertain to be an attractive option.  The Gulf Resources fight took only two weeks, but most contests involve months of battling, with allegations of mismanagement and fraud bandied about in court, in newspaper ads, and in mailings to shareholders. These knock-down, drag-out battles are, in large part, why the tide turned in favor of tender offers in the early 1960's. **********''In the 40's and 50's, you had a lot of proxy fights,'' said Martin Lipton, a takeover specialist with the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. ''Then in the 60's, everyone turned to tender offers, which are quicker, neater and cleaner,'' he said, recalling an era when tender offers were relatively free of regulation.  ''But,'' he continued, ''for individual investors, activity in proxy fights is being significantly revived this year. Most have been in the smaller companies, but I'd expect 10 or 12 fights this year at companies with market values over $50 million.'' **********The current faltering economy is a perfect environment for proxy contests. Stock prices are depressed, with many companies barely clinging to survival. And, as a general rule, proxy fights are more apt to take place in the less successful companies. **********''When a company is performing badly, it's easy to convince shareholders a new team would do better, even if the problems were due more to the general business climate than to bad management,'' said Mr. Schwarzman, who added that large pools of money are now being formed to buy stakes in vulnerable companies. **********Many people feel that the market is so bad right now that, as one takeover expert puts it, ''nearly every company seems like a real dog.'' So aggressive, disgruntled shareholders - Victor Posner and Carl Icahn are repeatedly mentioned as examples of the kind of investor likely to be alert to the possibility of waging a proxy fight - may find it the right time to try to leverage a minority interest into control of a major corporation. **********Often the investor's purpose in waging a proxy war is to gain control with the idea of liquidating the company, or parts of it, for a quick profit. Indeed, the campaign promise that won Gulf Resources for Mr. Clore was that he would consider ''redeployment of some or all'' of the company's assets. **********MR. CLORE'S battle began on April 23, a Friday night, when he called from Paris to tell his lawyers at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher that he wanted to wage a proxy fight for Gulf Resources in time for the company's annual meeting, just 18 days later. The proxy fight the lawyers organized that weekend was a triple triumph: they won, they won fast, and they won against one of the kingpins of the takeover bar, New York lawyer Joseph Flom. **********Ousting the mangement of a publicly held corporation may be relatively inexpensive, but it is not simple. In addition to marshalling the majority of votes, the challenger faces many legal and procedural hurdles, from getting Securities and Exchange Commission approval for every proxy solicitation, advertisement or announcement he wants to put out to getting the shareholder list so that votes can be solicited. **********The Gulf Resources contest broke all rules for speed. ''The generally accepted wisdom is that you have to begin making a proxy fight six to eight weeks before the annual meeting if you're going to have a chance to unseat the management,'' said Mr. Lipton, who vies with Mr. Flom for the distinction of being the country's top takeover lawyer. ''I can't think of another case in which a dissident group won in such a short time.'' **********Even Kenneth Bialkin, the senior partner at Willkie Farr, who spearheaded Mr. Clore's fight, was uncertain that Gulf Resources could be won so quickly. ''We had no program, no slate of directors, no public relations firm, no investment banker, no proxy solicitor and no team of lawyers,'' he said. But Willkie Farr entered the battle and mapped its strategy during the first weekend. **********The firm realized that the institutional investors who held the majority of the stock would be unhappy with the company's recent performance: Gulf Resources lost $77.9 million in 1981 after closing down lead, zinc and silver mining operations. **********Most people familiar with the company, however, say the main impetus behind the shareholders' desire for change was the fact that management had rejected a $42-a-share offer from Placid Oil two years ago as inadequate and the stock had fallen below $10 a share in the first quarter of 1982. **********The Willkie Farr lawyers made that resentment a prime element of their strategy: ''We decided there was already so much discontent with the management of Gulf Resources that we didn't need to make specific charges of mismanagement or get into personal attacks,'' said Stephen Flood, who worked with Mr. Bialkin. **********In order to get quick S.E.C. clearance and be as litigation-proof as possible, the Clore group's proxy solicitation was designed to avoid controversial statements. Simplicity, the lawyers thought, was the key to speed. On Monday, April 26, they called the S.E.C. to say they were planning a fight and ask for accelerated treatment. The next day, they filed disclosure forms and the fight was on. **********Between Monday and Friday, the lawyers had to find at least eight people to run for Gulf's 14-member board of directors in order to gain control. **********Appealing to a sense of adventure, Mr. Bialkin said, was the only way to find recruits on behalf of a foreign client for a proxy fight that was sure to involve litigation - against Mr. Flom, who is no shrinking violet. One director-designate, Sheldon Atlas, was recruited late at night when he ran into Mr. Bialkin in the elevator of the Central Park West apartment building where both men live. **********By Friday, the Willkie Farr lawyers had filed their proxy solicitation with the S.E.C., naming a slate of seven directors, along with a notation that an eighth name would be forthcoming. **********The time problem remained serious, though, in part because of New York Stock Exchange rules on voting by the brokerage houses and other institutions which hold most of the stock on behalf of the owners. Under the rules, the broker who holds the stock must mail proxy solicitations to the real owner and then await voting instructions. But if, 10 days before the annual meeting, the broker knows of no proxy fight and has received no voting instructions, he can go ahead and vote as he pleases. Willkie Farr solved this problem by taking out full page newspaper ads to publicize the fight. **********The Willkie Farr lawyers could not get the proxies out to shareholders until the weekend because of another 10-day rule.  Corporations are required to make their shareholder list available for inspection at corporate headquarters during the 10 days prior to the annual meeting - again, beginning Saturday, May 1. Often there is some legal squabbling about exactly how available the list must be. **********A specialized photographer was sent to Texas to take two pictures of the list Saturday; one was developed immediately to check legibility, and the other was developed directly onto mailing labels so the solicitation could be mailed immediately. There was a mild faceoff: The Willkie Farr lawyers said the management expected them to show up with Mr. Clore's power of attorney, which would have been technically deficient, and were ''waiting at the door to turn us away.'' But because the photographer had a power of attorney from a shareholder of record he was admitted. **********EVEN though the shareholder list was not made the object of litigation, the Gulf Resources proxy fight had, in typical fashion, already become mired in lawsuits. ''You know when you go into one of these that everything imaginable is going to end up in court,'' said Irwin Jacobs, who is still involved in litigation arising from his unsuccessful fight for Pabst. Mr. Jacobs, who is now trying to take over Pabst through a tender offer, said he had heard the phrase 'scorched earth,' describing takeover lawyers' tendency to use every possible device to destroy the opposition, too often to be surprised by the array of lawsuits. **********The week before the annual meeting was largely taken up with the litigation. The nominated directors were to give testimony, including Mr. Clore, who arrived in the United States Thursday night for the first time since the fight began. The meeting May 11 was anticlimactic. It lasted a calm 20 minutes, with proxies coming in right up until the polls closed. When the vote was counted and certified, Mr. Clore's Committee for New Management had won 3,371,814 votes, against the old management's 2,859,977. **********Although a sweet victory for Mr. Clore, the Gulf Resources battle is an ominous warning for other beleaguered managements. ''I already know of at least five proxy fights coming up in major corporations, one of them in the Fortune 500,'' said Arthur Long of D.F. King & Company, a major proxy solicitation firm.  ''More and more blue chip companies are going to have problems because shareholders are feeling caught. Next year, there's going to be a whole shooting gallery of proxy fights.'' HOLD IN TECH FOR ALIX **********Rites and Rituals of the Proxy Game **********STEP 1: Dissidents, dissatisifed with a company's management or direction, file a 14-B form with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing their intent to wage a proxy fight. **********STEP 2: Dissidents make a formal request to the company for a copy of its shareholder list. Typically, the company resists, the parties go to court and the dissidents usually prevail. **********STEP 3: A strategy is developed for contacting shareholders on the list, particularly those whose stock is held by brokerage houses. The dissidents decide which issues to raise with shareholders. **********STEP 4: Proxy ballots and other sollicitation materials are sent to shareholders in anticipation of the company's annual meeting. **********STEP 5: Direct personal contact is made with large shareholders, and as many small shareholders as possible are reached through telphone calls and letters. **********STEP 6: Dissidents go to annual meeting with their votes, where ballots are counted and certified, making sure that only the shareholder's last ballot is recorded. To win, one side must get at least 50 percent of the proxy ballots returned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/16/business/worcester-bancorp-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORCESTER BANCORP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "WORCESTER BANCORP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/01/world/plan-to-put-nuclear-missiles-in-sicily-assailed-by-bishops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Plan to Put Nuclear Missiles In Sicily Assailed by Bishops", "print_headline": "Plan to Put Nuclear Missiles In Sicily Assailed by Bishops", "body_text": " **********Two leading Italian bishops have spoken out against plans to install nuclear missiles in Sicily and sided with American bishops condemning the nuclear arms race. **********Announcing a New Year's Eve peace march in Milan, Bishop Dante Bernini of Segni, president of the justice and peace commission of the Italian Bishops' Conference, and Bishop Luigi Bettazzi of Ivrea, president of Pax Cristi, an international Roman Catholic peace movement, said: **********''We express our solidarity with the American bishops who have denounced the immorality of the unrestrained atomic arms race, and we share the perplexity of those who fear the start of atomic rearmament in Europe with the installation of missiles in Comiso as well as the exploitation of the South.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/business/company-news-refractories-co-restructuring.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Refractories Co.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, who will assume the post at the meeting in Tripoli. **********African foreign ministers open their preparatory discussions in Tripoli on Monday, and the summit meeting begins Aug. 5. Thus the foreign ministers have at least a week in which to come up with ideas for resolving the most serious split in the organization's 19-year history, a dispute over Western Sahara. **********The rift opened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in February when 26 African nations decided at a foreign minister's meeting to admit the Polisario guerrilla front as the organization's 51st member, representing Western Sahara. The decision prompted a boycott of the gathering by 19 nations under the leadership of Morocco, which administers Western Sahara and is fighting a war against the Polisario insurgents. O.A.U. Policy Prejudged **********The decision to admit the Polisario Front raised the question of whether the guerrillas fulfilled the O.A.U.'s membership criteria requiring newcomers to be sovereign in their own lands. **********It also prejudged the organization's policy toward Western Sahara.  At last year's summit meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, the organization called for a referendum so the people of Western Sahara could decide for themselves how they wanted to be ruled. **********The decision prompted such a fierce division between O.A.U.  members supporting Morocco and more leftist nations backing Polisario that two subsequent ministerial meetings were disrupted by boycotts. **********The crisis is bound to come to a head in Tripoli, because the organization's rules require a quorum of two-thirds of its members for a meeting to be legal. Morocco and at least 11 other nations have indicated that they will not attend the meeting, and Rabat is leading a campaign to prevent a quorum. 34 Needed for Quorum **********A quorum would be formed by 34 members, so Morocco needs to persuade at least 18 nations to boycott the meeting. This would reduce the gathering to an illegality unprecedented in the O.A.U.'s history and would belie the organization's title and aspirations. **********Robert Ouko, the Kenyan Foreign Minister, said before leaving for Tripoli that he believed the foreign ministers' meeting would form a quorum. Still in question, however, is the the summit meeting's ability to muster enough heads of state if the foreign ministers make no progress toward a settlement. **********A failure, Western diplomats said, would mean at least a temporary collapse of the organization and a severe lessening of its ability to represent an African viewpoint in international gatherings. It would also cap a year of embarrassments for the organization's current chairman, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya. Chad Initiative a Failure **********The main initiatives undertaken during Mr. Moi's leadership have been on Western Sahara and Chad, where the organization deployed its first peacekeeping force. But the presence of the 3,500-man Chad force, made up of soldiers from Nigeria, Senegal and Zaire, was not enough to enforce a political settlement or to prevent rebels from overrunning the Chadian capital of Ndjamena and forcing President Goukouni Oueddei to flee. **********Some Western diplomats have attributed the organization's failures this year to indecisiveness by the Kenyan leadership. But that assessment ignores a fundamental weakness in the organization: Like other international bodies, it lacks an effective form of censure against members that flout its directives and thus has little power beyond appeals to good will and African solidarity. **********The organization was created in 1963 as a symbol of an emergent continent's aspirations for a pan-Africanism that would prove stronger than the colonialism its new rulers were replacing. **********But with the colonial foe routed or reduced in influence, the organization increasingly resembles a collection of sovereign nations whose interests coincide only on broad issues, such as abhorrence of white minority rule in South Africa or the need to end South Africa's domination of South-West Africa. Credibility Its Only Resource **********The organization's role has been to provide a symbolic cohesiveness for the continent, not to create practical projects, for which economically troubled Africa does not have the resources. Its credibility is its stock in trade, African diplomats said, and that credibility is now in jeopardy. **********It is for this reason, the diplomats said, Nigeria, in particular, has embarked on a diplomatic campaign to save the Tripoli meeting.  ''It is not the issue of Polisario that motivates us,'' a Nigerian official said, ''but the principle of the survival of the organization.'' **********Another argument is that the organization is Africa's only emblem of solidarity and its collapse would open the way for a re-enactment of the 19th-century European scramble for influence on the continent, this time embroiling East and West."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/28/business/devon-group-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEVON GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "DEVON GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/23/business/imf-asks-nations-to-keep-up-battle-against-inflation.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1982-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.M.F.

It said part of the trouble lay in ''inflexibility'' in the structure of wage rates. **********As an example of flexibility, the fund cited what it called ''a noteworthy feature of the Japanese system'' - the large share of labor earnings in the form of bonuses that are linked to profitability of employers. **********The I.M.F., which lends money chiefly to developing countries hurt by a decline in foreign-exchange earnings, reported that slack world trade was increasing strains on the finances of the third world. **********The pressure on export earnings of the poorer countries coincides with greater selectivity by commercial banks in lending to the poor countries, according to the report, which was written before the financial problems of Mexico reached a crisis last week. **********Mexico was the latest of a number of countries seeking to reschedule the payment of foreign debts because of shrinking foreignexchange reserves and to obtain emergency assistance from the I.M.F. 'Adjustment Policies' **********The report suggested that for the ''continued availability of substantial financing'' - both from the fund and commercial banks - countries should show that they are willing to adopt ''appropriate adjustment policies.'' Adjustment policies generally mean politically unpopular belt-tightening, including the curbing of food subsidies and other government payments. **********Such topics are at issue now in talks between the fund and Mexico over the conditions for a $4.5 billion loan.  The report said that for the first time since 1975, there was no growth in the volume of overall world trade in 1981, and it said the volume may decline this year. Problem of Protectionism **********On top of the weak trade, it said, protectionist measures by the industrialized countries ''would be particularly injurious to the trade prospects of the developing countries,'' whose foreign earnings have been severely affected by the decline in the prices for primary product. **********On economic prospects for the United States, the I.M.F. analysts took a position similar to most American economists in forecasting a ''modest economic expansion'' during the second half of 1982 because of some rebuilding of inventories and the effects on consumption of the July 1 reductions in tax rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/27/business/asbestos-claimants-angered-by-filing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 687, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS ANGERED BY FILING", "print_headline": "ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS ANGERED BY FILING", "body_text": " **********Lawyers and consumer groups representing the thousands of workers involved in asbestos-related lawsuits reacted angrily today to the Manville Corporation's decision to file for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws and vowed to block the move. **********''This appears to be an attempt to avoid their responsibility, and we're prepared to go into the bankruptcy courts and challenge Manville on this,'' said Michel F.

But they're guilty, and they shouldn't be allowed to do this merely because the law says they can.'' **********There are about 16,500 cases pending against Manville in which the claimants contend that the company provided inadequate information about the physical danger of working with asbestos and insufficient protection against the hazards. The Position of Other Suits **********Industry analysts emphasized that Manville's action today would not affect the thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits still pending against more than 400 other companies. In the past, attorneys representing asbestos claimants have been criticized for seemingly clogging the courts with cases and endangering companies, but failing to win adequate compensation for the victims. **********Michael Mealey, editor of the Asbestos Litigation Reporter, estimated that there were about 30 major law firms and hundreds of attorneys across the country acting as plaintiffs in asbestos-related litigation. **********''They've got just one less pocket to reach for - a pretty big pocket,'' Mr. Mealey said, ''but the litigation will move forward. I just don't see asbestos attorneys folding up their tents and moving away because of Manville.'' **********Manville's action, industry observers said, could also increase pressures on Congress to act on some form of legislation that would remove from the courts the thousands of lawsuits still pending. **********Earlier this year, hearings were held on a bill sponsored by Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, that would establish a Federal system using industry contributions to provide payments to victims of asbestos-related health problems. So far, however, the idea has garnered little support in Congress. **********Representative Miller said today: ''It's a fairly ruthless act on the part of Manville to escape liability to a lot of injured and diseased workers they have responsibility for.

Accordingly, industry executives said, new orders would have to increase for two consecutive months before they felt confident a recovery was in progress. **********''After the sizable rise in machine tool orders in January, the report of February's activity is particularly disappointing,'' James A. Gray, president of the association, said. **********''We have bottomed out basically, but the width of the valley is yet to be determined,'' said Clifford Meyer, president and chief operating officer of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine tool producer. 20 Percent Decline **********New machine tool orders in February were down 20 percent, to $163.8 million, from $205.2 million in January, and were 41 percent less than the $280.1 million in orders received during February last year. Thus far this year, machine tool orders are down 35 percent, to $369 million, from $570.8 million in the first two months of 1981. **********''The industry is skidding along the bottom of the trough,'' said Patrick McCarthy, a spokesman for the Bendix Corporation, the nation's second-largest producer of machine tools. Most analysts expect orders to follow an erratic path until late this year. **********Mr. McCarthy pointed out that orders from the oil industry continue to be strong, while orders from the auto industry and smaller machine shops remain depressed. Bendix has laid off about 600 employees, or 10 percent of its workforce, in the last six months, he said. **********Most machine tool companies have a large backlog of orders that carry them through slow periods. However, new orders have been coming in at such a slow rate that many companies are beginning to work through their old orders. The industry backlog dropped to $2.9 million in February, from $3.1 million in January. In February 1981, the backlog in orders stood at $5.2 million. **********''Beyond the middle of the year you will begin to see a significant effect on the companies if orders don't pick up,'' said Eli S.  Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins Inc. Prospect for Improvement **********As an indication that things might get better soon, Mr. Meyer, of Cincinnati Milacron, said that his company had experienced a significant increase in customer inquiries about new equipment. ''I think this indicates that there is a large pent-up demand,'' he said. ''There is a great deal of interest.'' **********Machine tool orders can be expected to increase when factory utilization begins to pick up significantly. In February, capacity utilization stood at 71.8 percent, a slight increase from January but still below December's level of 73 percent. **********The decline in foreign orders increased substantially last month.  In February, orders from abroad dropped 64.7 percent, to $14.6 million, from $41.4 million in February 1981. Japan is the largest importer of American-made machine tools, accounting for more than 30 percent of the market, followed by West Germany, Britain and Switzerland. **********Domestic orders last month fell 37.5 percent, to $149.2 million, from $238.7 million a year ago.  Shipments of machine tools dropped 14 percent in February, to $359.4 million, from $422.1 million last year. Shipments declined 6.3 percent from January.

After two days of preliminary strategy planning and briefings on bankruptcy law procedures here, the session was to continue in New York on Monday. **********The preliminary conference, which ended today, was planned by the Barnwell, S.C., firm of Blatt & Sales so plaintiffs' lawyers could begin mapping a course of action to address what attorneys here called Manville's ''fraudulent'' bankruptcy petition. **********Manville executives said when they filed last Thursday for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws that the cost of the 16,500 damage claims pending against the company could not be met and that the company's total liability could reach $2 billion. The effect of the filing has been to suspend the suits and avoid the filing of new ones. **********But the attorneys here said Manville's action was unwarranted.  ''They're a solvent firm,'' said Ronald Motley, a partner with Blatt & Sales and a leading attorney in the asbestos action. ''It's nothing but a perversion of the bankruptcy laws.'' Mr. Motley's firm represents 3,000 plaintiffs in asbestos-injury cases, 90 percent of them against Manville. **********Exposure to asbestos can cause asbestosis, a lung disease that can be disabling or fatal, and cancer. The suits filed against Manville, the largest single asbestos maker in the world, contend that the company did not make the risks known to workers or take proper precautions against the diseases. **********Many of the lawyers here said that the suddenness of Manville's bankruptcy petition and their own lack of familiarity with the intricacies of bankruptcy laws had delayed and handicapped the group's response. **********''Before this thing I didn't know how to spell bankruptcy,'' said one attorney, speaking for many of his colleagues. ''I think we all know how to do that now.'' **********Among those giving legal briefings here were Robert Evans, a New Haven attorney with experience in the field of creditors' rights, and Philip Lacey, a bankruptcy expert and professor at the University of South Carolina Law School. **********Mr. Evans told the lawyers there were several factors he considered unusual in the Manville bankruptcy petition. First, he said, was the lengthy explanation Manville included in the petition, giving its reasons for seeking reorganization. **********Second, Mr. Evans said, only 20 of Manville's 51 subsidiaries included on the bankruptcy petition were listed as seeking reorganization; the other 31 are not involved. ''They selected a portion out for reorganization,'' he said. ''They did not file an action for all of their assets. I've never seen anything quite like it.'' Suits Against Officers, Holders **********Later, in the strategy sessions, the attorneys debated several legal moves to force Manville to begin dealing with the asbestos lawsuits. **********Mr. Motley and other attorneys said they were considering suits against John H. McKinney, chairman and chief executive officer of Manville. And attorneys were considering separate suits against Manville's directors and possibly against its shareholders.  Congressional leaders also will be asked to support the group's actions, the attorneys said. **********But the first item of business, Mr. Motley said, will be to seek to dismiss Manville's bankruptcy petition. The group also will try to set up an information network so its actions can be made known to thousands of plaintiffs scattered across the country. **********Nearly every attorney told of the sudden and dramatic effect the action had had on the lawsuits. Mr. Motley, for instance, said he was taking depositions last week in Louisiana when word of the Manville petition reached him. ''The attorneys for the defendants simply packed up and walked out,'' he said. ''I don't blame them.  They weren't going to be paid.'' **********Tom Taft, an attorney from Greenville, N.C., who represents 40 plaintiffs, recently settled a case for $800,000, the second-largest asbestos settlement on record. He said his client - the family of a 38-year-old college professor who had been exposed to asbestos when he was a shipyard worker two decades earlier and who had died of the rare lung disorder mesetheliona - collected more than half the settlement from Manville before the company's petition was filed Thursday. ''They had some concern about whether they should settle or not,'' said Mr. Taft. ''I think now they're pretty pleased they did.'' **********Many of the attorneys will leave here tonight and reconvene for more sessions in New York on Monday to complete their planning.  The group already has dispatched paralegal assistants, one from Mississippi and one from Tennessee, to be in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York by early Monday morning.  There they will collect information about the court and copy Manville's file."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/17/business/hewlett-introduces-a-desk-top-computer.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HEWLETT INTRODUCES A DESK-TOP COMPUTER", "print_headline": "HEWLETT INTRODUCES A DESK-TOP COMPUTER", "body_text": " **********The Hewlett-Packard Company introduced a desk-top computer yesterday that it said was far more powerful than other machines of its size on the market. **********The machine is capable of handling 32 bits, or pieces, of information at a time.

And lately, this expansion has continued for quite a different reason: The companies are not bound by union contracts to hire union craftsmen. **********Many clients believe that nonunion builders can offer better prices, so while the rest of the construction industry flounders in deep recession, Southern companies are as entrenched and healthy as the kudzu vine that creeps over and around every Southern pine in its path. **********Construction industry giants such as the Fluor Corporation and the Bechtel Group, which have traditionally been unionized, have been acquiring building concerns or setting up subsidiaries that are not unionized. **********Two of the largest companies in Greenville, Daniel International and Yeargin Construction, were acquired in the late 1970's. Daniel's Profits Up Sharply **********Fluor paid $230 million for Daniel, which analysts thought was high at the time. They have changed their minds. Last year Daniel's profits jumped 21 percent, to $54 million. Yeargin was acquired by the Perini Corporation of Framingham, Mass. **********''Virtually every large contractor has or is looking for 'merit shop' capability,'' said Hugh Rice, vice president of Fails Management Institute, a consultant to the construction industry. ''I see nothing but an ever-increasing move toward merit shops. If you are a merit shop and large, you have a very marketable commodity.'' **********What the construction industry means by a ''merit shop'' in the industry is a system under which the contractor sublets jobs - to electricians and plumbers, for example -to the lowest qualified bidder regardless of whether that bidder is unionized. While salaries for craftsmen, unionized or not, will generally be comparable, union wages for unskilled workers are higher. Union Wages Spurred Shift **********The shift to this low-bid system in the construction industry began in the 1970's when clients found that strikes by unionized employees sometimes caused the price of a project to rise dramatically. As union wages rose, some clients turned away from union contractors. **********''There was a period when a lot of workers abused the system, and utilities and others broke away,'' said a spokesman for the Building and Construction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, who asked not to be identified. He maintained, however, that in recent years the unions had taken measures and had blunted the growth of the low-bid system. **********The unions have started drives in such places as California and the Pacific Northwest. And strikes, one of the main complaints of clients using union shops, are occurring less frequently. The unions have started to sign project agreements, which virtually rule out the possibility of a strike. **********In addition, the unions have the advantage of a large, trained work force that contractors can easily tap by going to the hiring hall. A low-bid contractor depends on the local labor pool and trains its own workers. Some industry executives believe that because work has been scarce for the past couple of years, these contractors have had the advantage of drawing from the pool of unionized craftsmen. Price Advantage Cited **********''The merit shop should always be less expensive,'' said Buck Mickel, chairman of Daniel, who asserted that although there was a clear price advantage, clients did not make their decisions solely on price. **********Certain segments of the market, such as companies that constuct downtown office buildings, are still bastions of union contractors.  And clients often decide in these cases that it would be a mistake to put a low-bid system in the middle of the union's territory. **********Sometimes clients build with the system because they want to keep the unions out of the plants once they are up. ''The people who are moving to the Sun Belt want to keep their factories nonunion, and so they begin by building nonunion,'' said Dan Knise, a director of the Associated General Contractors of America, a trade association that was historically a union group but now has a membership split evenly between union and nonunion contractors. **********The recession has exaggerated the advantage of the low-bid system.  As companies try to hold down spending, they are either postponing work or looking for less expensive contractors to do the building. In 1981, contractors using the low-bid system performed 63 percent of construction in the United States, up from 59 percent in 1980, according to Associated Builders and Contractors. Union Jobless Rate High **********''Merit shops will always be a threat, particularly in this time of heavy unemployment,'' the spokesman for the building unions said. He added that unemployment in unionized shops was averaging 20 percent, and in some local unions was as high as 80 percent. **********Mr. Mills of Yeargin said that in little more than five years the ratio of construction work along the Gulf Coast done by nonunion workers had shifted to 80 percent from 20 percent.

No payment on this debt has been made since the Falkland crisis started last spring, and British bankers say that about $200 million in interest payments is past due. **********The British announcement said that lifting the sanctions reflected British concern over Argentina's huge foreign debt and the problems it is having making debt payments on time. The Treasury said it welcomed ''Argentina's current approach to the International Monetary Fund and wishes to facilitate an appropriate early agreement between the Fund and Argentine authorities'' for an emergency I.M.F. loan. **********Restrictions on Britons **********An agreement between Argentina and Britain would also end restrictions that have been placed on British companies operating in Argentina and on British citizens living here. Since the war this summer, they have been prohibited from sending money overseas or selling assets, which are valued at $4 billion to $5 billion. **********The Argentine Economics Ministry said in a communique that the British proposal was ''spontaneous and is not a consequence of any previous accord with our Government.'' But the communique sounded an optimistic tone, echoed by senior Argentine officials, who said that the sanctions might be mutually lifted in a few days. **********(Monday night the British Treasury acknowledged a delay in lifting the sanctions. Reuters quoted the Treasury as saying the delay stemmed from legal procedures the Argentine Government must take. The sanctions were to have been lifted at midnight Monday, London time, according to the original Treasury announcement, issued early in the day.) **********Julio Gonzalez del Solar, president of Argentina's central bank, said in an interview: ''We are studying the British suggestions with the utmost interest. It would ease our dealings with the international banks and be alleviation for them, too.'' **********A particular snag, he said, consists of complications involving Argentine laws on ending the restrictions. Most of them were established by presidential decree and may have to be ended the same way. **********Lifting the financial sanctions, however, would not affect the trade embargoes still in effect between Britain and Argentina, Buenos Aires officials said. Diplomatic relations between the two countries also remain broken. **********The Economics Ministry statement tied a move to end the trade sanctions to Argentina's aspirations to obtain sovereignty over the Falklands, saying that ending the sanctions ''would create better conditions for negotiations'' in the coming United Nations debate over the islands. **********Officials of Argentina had promised in the past that they would use the frozen funds in Britain to repay their British loans, but there were no statements here or in London today as to whether such a repayment was still planned. **********In addition to its British debt, Argentina has been in danger of default on much of its nearly $40 billion in total foreign debt, much of it short-term. Argentina is already $2 billion behind on its payments to all its creditors and is scheduled to repay $12 billion by the end of the year. **********The administration of President Reynaldo B. Bignone has been trying to refinance some of the short-term debt and has opened negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a possible standby loan.  But international banks and the I.M.F. have been reluctant to lend Argentina money until the financial dispute with Britain is settled. **********In a related development, the Argentine Government today announced it was imposing price controls on industrial products and was devaluing the peso's commercial exchange rate by 5 percent. The commercial rate covers imports and export transactions, and the devaluation raises the rate for these transactions from 25,570 pesos to the dollar to 26,850. **********The devaluation also requires importers and exporters to carry out 15 percent of their transactions at the exchange rate in the financial market, which is 39,000 pesos to the dollar. The effective devaluation of the commercial exchange rate thus averages 12.1 percent. **********The move was intended to spur exports and is a step toward unifying the country's diverse exchange rates. It is a move also favored by the International Monetary Fund, but officials here declared they were not trying to court I.M.F. favor for a standby loan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/23/business/commodities-selling-silver-bars-to-public.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commodities; Selling Silver Bars To Public", "print_headline": "Commodities; Selling Silver Bars To Public", "body_text": " **********THERE were two ways of looking at last week's surge in the price of silver bullion, which raised the metal by $1.535 an ounce, to $7.78, based on Friday's close of the spot August Comex futures contract. **********One view was that silver was now back to its price of late 1981, when it was still falling from its record level of $50.30, set Jan.  21, 1980. **********The other view was that silver took off from that level in the fall of 1979 and didn't stop climbing until it reached its record price.  While not even the most courageous silver bull today thinks the metal will cross the $50 mark in the foreseeable future, two of the major houses in the precious metals industry believe there are enough sound reasons why the metal should interest investors. **********They are Handy & Harman, a leading fabricator of silver and other precious metals, and J. Aron & Company, the giant commodities brokerage house acquired last year by Goldman, Sachs & Company, investment bankers. This Wednesday, J. Aron will start marketing silver bullion made by Handy & Harman to the public through banks, brokerage houses and other retail dealers for the first time. **********More important, J. Aron promises to create a highly liquid two-way market in their bars in which the buy-sell spread would be narrower than is commonly the case in precious metals bars, the company said. **********Given the fact that a number of their competitors, such as the Engelhard Corporation, the Mocatta Metals Corporation and Johnson & Matthey, also offer silver bullion, what prompted the Handy & Harman-J. Aron entry into this market at this time? **********The question was first addressed to M.H. Townsend, chairman of Handy & Harman, who said last week: ''Until a few months ago, we thought the 1979-80 boom and bust in silver had ended the public's interest in the metal as an investment for a long time. Then we became aware that there was once again a rising demand for silver from all kinds of people.'' **********Renewed interest in silver bullion began mounting after its price dropped to a recent low of $4.24 an ounce last June 21 and grew substantially as interest rates began to fall soon afterward. **********While falling interest rates made it less expensive for the trade to carry inventories, it also encouraged buying by ordinary investors. Why? The yields on competitive investments such as money market funds, Treasury bills and various bank certificates of deposit became less attractive. Indeed, it was the high yields on short-term investments as much as anything else that had tarnished the appeal of precious metals. **********This factor, combined with the recent string of insolvencies among a number of financial institutions and fears that others will be adversely affected by their inability to recover huge loans made to Mexico and other foreign countries, has once again prompted many investors to look upon precious metals as a financial security blanket. **********But Mr. Townsend noted, ''We also were aware that we had no expertise in dealing directly with the public. Since our company was founded in 1867, it has basically been a fabricator of silver in many forms to the manufacturing trade. We couldn't see ourselves dealing with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of banks, brokerage houses, coin shops and other potential outlets.'' **********Robert E. Burke, Handy & Harman's vice president-marketing, joined in: ''It then ocurred to us that J. Aron, with whom we have been doing business for many years, had the distribution expertise we lacked because they deal in all sorts of commodities. While J. Aron doesn't deal with the public, they are well connected with banks, brokers and other who do.'' **********At J. Aron, Morris A. Sandler, vice president, described his house's part in the new venture: ''First off, we will only deal in bars of 100 troy ounces that are .999 fine, the top grade in the trade. Buyers of smaller bars usually pay higher premiums in percentage terms. We expect our markup to be about 3.5 percent above the daily Handy & Harman quote, which is the standard in the silver market. The brokerage houses that will retail the bars, such as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Shearson/American Express, will charge a fee that should be competitive. We expect many other brokerage houses to carry our bars, as well as banks all across the nation.'' **********Mr. Sandler added that buyers need not take physical delivery of the seven-pound bars from the retailers, but instead could have them stored in vaults in Delaware, which would save on sales taxes. **********Herbert J. Coyne, J. Aron's chairman, said that, ''while nobody knows how much silver was being held privately, Delaware depositories were believed to hold almost as much of the metal as West Point.'' **********The vaults at the military academy hold most of the Government's stockpile of 139.5 million ounces. The rest is at the San Francisco mint. More important to investors and traders has been the steady drop in exchange-licensed warehouse stocks of the metal since last March, when investors began to re-enter the market. **********Last March 1, the combined stocks at the three key markets - New York's Commodity Exchange, the London Metals Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade - totaled 128.4 million ounces, of which 78.3 million were at the Comex. By Aug. 9, the total stocks, in rounded figures, had dropped to 114.4 million and last Monday they stood at 111.5 million. Of that amount, 61 million were in Comex-licensed warehouses, 36.6 million in London, and 13.8 million at the Chicago Board of Trade's warehouses."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/23/business/atwood-oceanics-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ATWOOD OCEANICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "ATWOOD OCEANICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/26/business/republic-pay-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Republic Pay Cuts", "print_headline": "Republic Pay Cuts", "body_text": " **********The Republic Steel Corporation said it would cut officers' salaries 10 percent and all other nonunion employees' wages 7 percent effective Oct. 1.

The combined force now numbers 3,400 men. **********Although the two-hour session at the White House and a later meeting involving senior aides were described as having gone well, there was no optimism at the end of the day among American officials that there would be a rapid solution to Lebanon's problems. 'Difficult Negotiation' Foreseen **********Reporters were told by the senior State Department aide that large problems lay ahead in trying to work out a formula for ending the Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian military presence in Lebanon. **********Taking into consideration not only the talks with Mr. Gemayel, but last week's discussions here with Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, and talks held in Damascus with Syrian officials, the official said, ''It will be a very difficult and complicated negotiation.'' **********He reaffirmed that the United States would play a central role in trying to find an acceptable formula, and that it would stick to a target date of the end of this year. But it seemed that the differences among the parties had been sharpened by Mr. Gemayel's visit, rather than diminished. Israelis Want Security Pact **********These are the main problems, as outlined by officials at the end of the day: **********- The Israelis are insisting on signing a ''security agreement'' with Lebanon as a first step toward a peace treaty, as a condition for the withdrawal of their forces from all of Lebanon. Mr. Gemayel indicated to the United States today that he would have ''a serious problem'' signing not only a peace treaty but also a security agreement with Israel, because this would cause him trouble with other Arab nations.  He is counting on the Arabs to provide Lebanon with billions of dollars in reconstruction aid. **********- There is no consensus on how to bring about the withdrawal. The Syrians, who have 30,000 troops in Lebanon at the request of the Arab League, say they will withdraw but only after Israel, an ''invader,'' pulls its troops back. Israel demands that the Palestine Liberation Organization's 8,000 troops leave first, with Syria and Israel to pull their troops out simultaneously after the proposed security agreement with Lebanon is signed. The P.L.O. has not said when it wants to depart. **********- The Israelis want no international peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, only Lebanese forces. But the Lebanese made clear today that they did not believe their army was able to deploy itself around the country now. They would prefer that a combination of the 7,000-man United Nations force and an expanded American-French-Italian force assume larger responsibiities, not only in the south but in other parts of Lebanon as well. Differing Perceptions **********At the root of the problem, the senior American official acknowledged, is the different perceptions that Israel and Lebanon have of each other. **********The Israelis, he said, believe that by their defeat of the P.L.O.  and Syria they have given the Lebanese Government a chance, for the first time in seven years, to unify the country. They want, he said, to cooperate openly with Mr. Gemayel's Government - in effect, to be regarded as ''liberators'' of Lebanon. **********But Mr. Gemayel left the impression with the Americans that while the Lebanese at one time may have appreciated the Israeli actions, they now increasingly regard the Israelis as ''occupiers'' and do not want to be seen signing any agreements with Israel, the official said. **********According to the State Department official who briefed reporters after this morning's two-hour meeting at the White House of the two Presidents and their top aides, Mr. Gemayel ''raised the possibility of an expanded role and expanded force'' for the American, French and Italian troops. Mr. Gemayel said he hoped that these forces would remain in Lebanon until the last Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian fighter was withdrawn. Response by Reagan **********Mr. Reagan responded, the official said, by saying, in effect, ''We hear you, we appreciate that our troops are so well received, that you believe they are so important, and all these matters will have to be given serious consideration.'' **********No specific numbers were discussed, the official said, but other Lebanese have asked that the three-nation force be raised from 3,400 men to as many as 20,000. An American official said there was no specific request that the United States contingent be enlarged. But if there is to be an increase in the total strength, the American force would almost inevitably have to be raised from its current 1,200 marines, officials said. **********In the talks today, there was discussion about expanding the role of the three-nation force beyond its limited assignment in Beirut.  The American marines are currently restricted to the international airport. There was discussion, officials said, of the force's assuming a role in the Bekaa Valley, in eastern and northern Lebanon, where Syrian and Palestinian forces are situated, and in the south, where the Israelis are. Pullout Called 'Shared Objective' **********Mr. Gemayel, in his remarks to the press after meeting Mr. Reagan, said he was committed ''to the immediate removal of all foreign forces from our soil and to work hand in hand with all sectors of Lebanese society to build a nation in which all citizens have equal privileges, rights and responsibilities.'' **********Mr. Reagan said that the ''particular focus'' of the talks was on ''our shared objective of prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.'' **********There was considerable discussion during the day of Lebanon's need for large-scale help in rebuilding the country and its economy. Some Lebanese have talked of a need for as much as $10 billion to $15 billion. **********But the United States, committed at present to about $100 million in the current fiscal year, has no intention of initiating a largescale aid program of its own, the senior official said, and this is recognized by the Lebanese. Rather, they will be helped primarily by the World Bank, to which the United States will contribute, and by Saudi Arabian and other Middle Eastern investors, including Lebanese.  Reconstruction Discussed **********Mr. Gemayel met this afternoon with A.W. Clausen, president of the World Bank, and they discussed the role the bank would play in the reconstruction effort. A World Bank spokesman said it was agreed that as a first step a mission would be sent to Lebanon next month to ''identify the needs and map out the assistance process.'' **********Later, Mr. Gemayel - the first Lebanese President to make an official visit to the United States - conferred with Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger on future American military assistance to Lebanon. A Pentagon team has just returned from a survey trip and is drawing up its report. **********Mr. Gemayel was said to have assured the Americans that his Government was making efforts to insure security for every person in Lebanon. He defended the recent crackdown in West Beirut as necessary to eradicate ''terrorism,'' which he said was ''a cancer'' in the Middle East, a senior official said. **********Gemayel Leaves U.S. **********WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (AP)-President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon left Washington for Paris tonight after a two-day visit to the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/10/world/violence-is-reported-across-north-ireland.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Violence Is Reported Across North Ireland", "print_headline": "Violence Is Reported Across North Ireland", "body_text": " **********Irish nationalists ambushed a police patrol in Armagh early today and youngsters hurled gasoline bombs in three other cities in protests marking the 11th anniversary of Britain's internment without trial order in Northern Ireland. **********Five policemen and one British soldier were wounded, none seriously, and the authorities jailed at least 42 people in disturbances that erupted after midnight, the police said.

Armco accounted for about 6 percent of the 4.2 million tons of steel pipe and tubing shipped by the domestic steel industry in 1981. **********Armco's expansion program, which would have been completed in 1984, consisted of $343 million for a new finishing facility at Gulfport, Miss.; $290 million for a pipe plant at Ashland, Ky., and the rest for additional investment in an existing plant at Ambridge, Pa.

How Market Has Grown **********Since 1979 the market for pipe and tubing has grown more than 75 percent as rising oil prices stimulated exploration. In the last year this segment of the business was responsible for the profitablity of the steel industry. Since the price of oil and gas has weakened, however, oil companies have started to use the pipe they already have rather than purchase additional supplies. **********Most analysts estimate that shipments of pipe and tubing in 1982 will decline as much as 25 percent.  Construction of Armco's proposed plants was scheduled to begin in April. Mr. Aiken said that some site work and engineering had started and that the engineering work would continue. **********The only other major expansion in sight for pipe and tubing is a $650 million project planned by the United States Steel Corporation.  That program is being financed by the oil companies that would purchase the products. A spokesman for U.S. Steel said yesterday that its expansion project was proceeding without delay. **********In yesterday's announcement, Armco said it would go ahead with a $90 million outlay for a continuous caster at its Ashland plant."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/08/business/comark-is-under-study.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Comark Is Under Study", "print_headline": "Comark Is Under Study", "body_text": " **********The California Department of Corporations is examining the financial condition and record-keeping methods of Comark, a Government securities firm that is late in filing its 1981 financial statement, Steven Gourley, deputy commissioner, said today. **********Attention was focused on the small Newport Beach-based company last week when the Marine Midland Bank briefly refused to act as a clearinghouse for its transactions until Comark provided more collateral.

Most notably, some $6 million in mostly small contributions has poured in from dismayed supporters. **********''There's no doubt about it; Sir Freddie wouldn't say anything like this unless he is 100 percent certain,'' a Laker spokesman said. ''I understand that Sir Freddie is hoping to be able to announce details tomorrow.'' Charter Businesses Sold **********The success of a new venture by Sir Freddie, who is 59 years old, is likely to depend on his ability to persuade financial backers that such an enterprise could succeed. It also did not appear that there were any legal obstacles to starting a business so soon after the Laker bankruptcy. Tonight, Sir Freddie was reported discussing possible financial support with Roland Rowland, chief executive of Lonrho Ltd., a British mining conglomerate. **********In a move that saved an estimated 322 jobs, Sir Freddie today sold his two holiday charter businesses for $8.4 million. Arrowsmith Holidays was sold to Greenall Whitley, a 200-year-old British Brewery, for $7.5 million, while Laker Air Tours went for $930,000 to Saga Holidays, an English company specializing in holiday charters for the elderly. **********The two new owners were quickly given approval by Britain' s Civil Aviation Authority to begin operations. British officials have been eager to keep the tour companies in operation to prevent losses by vacationers of prepayments. **********As for a new airline, sources close to Sir Freddie said today that he believed the venture could start within a month on four American routes, to New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Tampa. Using Laker Equipment **********A new service would reportedly use at least four of the 11 groundedLaker DC-10's and up to half of Laker Airways' more than 2,000 staff members. The effort to start an airline would involve raising enough money to buy these aircraft from Laker creditors.  Laker also owns three Airbuses, four BAC-111's and two Bo eing 707's. **********However, some experts, noting the large losses being made on trans-Atlantic routes by all carriers, predicted that Sir Freddie's new venture might be forced to focus on charters and tours, a more profitable business. **********Sir Freddie himself was silent today and reported to be meeting with financie rs in an effort to raise needed money. In addition, Sir Freddie would have to persuade civil aviation authorities here to transfer the necessary licenses to his new venture. **********''I can't say anything officially but these things are obviously not far from Sir Freddie's mind,'' said Mrs. Robyn Flood, the Laker publicity manager. ''Freddie fought for 12 years to get these licenses and he is not going to let them go,'' she said. Role of Contributions **********In part, Sir Freddie's new business would be supported by the contributions, many of which have been going to a ''Freddie Friendly Fund'' organized by Kay Hardy, a Sussex hotel owner, and Colin Raworth, a West London shopkeeper. Britons by the hundreds have been dropping into branches across the country of Lloyds Bank, where the fund's account has been opened. **********Because of potential legal complications, Sir Freddie has appealed to the public to delay donations until a proposal is developed. ''I do not know as yet the amount of support which any new venture may require and because of that, I would ask that no further contributions be sent in for the time being,'' he said Tuesday night. **********Laker employees, whose jobs are in jeopardy, have also been active. On Monday, several busloads of nattily dressed flight attendants and other staff members demonstrated outside 10 Downing Street, the office and residence of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has refused Government aid to Sir Freddie. **********''The decision not to provide state funds for Sir Freddie was for the sake of the future of private enterprise,'' said Cecil Parkinson, chairman of Britain's Conservative Party, in a speech today. ''Far from helping the private sector thrive and flourish, a state handout would have been greatly damaging to the morale and spirit of entrepreneurs up and down the country.'' **********Today, six of Sir Freddie's grounded flight attendants announced that profits from a record they made this week as ''the Laker Girls'' would be given to the fund. The record is called ''Let Us Fly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/business/september-orders-up-by-0.7-durables-drop-inventories-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 575, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "September Orders Up By 0.7%; Durables Drop; Inventories Off", "print_headline": "September Orders Up By 0.7%; Durables Drop; Inventories Off", "body_text": " **********New orders for the manufactured goods of American companies rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported today. **********While the gain was seen as too modest to indicate any major shift in the economy, the factory orders are considered a leading indicator of the direction of the economy because they are likely to be translated into later production and, theoretically, into sales. **********The advance from August's revised 2.7 percent decline was concentrated in orders for nondurable goods such as food- and oilrelated products, with orders declining for durable goods such as cars, the report said. **********'Somewhat of a Mixed Bag' **********''It's still somewhat of a mixed bag,'' Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said of today's report, ''but it's a heck of a lot better than the uniformly poor reports we were getting earlier this year.'' **********In September, the orders report said, manufacturers' inventories of unsold goods dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $272.2 billion, the ninth drop in the last 10 months and the biggest decline since May, with the decrease again mainly in nondurables. **********If manufacturers were expecting a substantial recovery from the recession, they might be expected to be starting to build up inventories rather than continuing to whittle them down. However, Mr. Ortner said, ''I suppose business firms are not yet persuaded that it's wise to carry larger inventories.''

Orders for nondurable goods rose 1.5 percent, to $82.6 billion, including a 3.8 percent gain for petroleum products and a 3.1 percent increase for food products. **********Orders for durable goods declined one-tenth of 1 percent, pulled down by a 20.2 percent decline in orders for military goods. Without that negative impact, orders for durables would have risen 1.5 percent. **********Mr. Ortner said the decline for durables should be considered significant for the overall economy only if one expected military orders to remain down - an unlikely prospect in light of the Reagan Administration's efforts to increase military spending. **********Orders for nondefense capital goods, including heavy machinery, were up 4.7 percent for the month, and Mr. Ortner said that this ''possibly is the first step'' toward a recovery in business investment in general later on. Favorable Factors Cited **********''The orders are at a relatively low level and we need further increases,'' he added.

There was a gain of 6 percent for nonelectrical machinery and one of 4.4 percent for electrical machinery. **********- August's 2.7 percent drop in orders was revised slightly from the 2.8 percent estimated a month ago.

But the experiment is drawing stiff opposition from brokers, who say that the new system may cut sharply into their profit margins. **********The system, developed by the National Association of Securities Dealers and scheduled to begin March 1, allows the automatic execution of over-the-counter stock transactions. It will be linked with the current Intermarket Trading System, which routes orders among the New York, American and several regional exchanges. **********In addition, firms trading in certain O-T-C stocks will be subject to a new transaction-reporting method that, among other things, requires them to report price and volume information on trades almost immediately. **********But the system has garnered sharply critical reviews from brokerdealers, and because of its technical complexity, N.A.S.D.  officials concede its initial run may even be delayed past the March 1, deadline. **********''Many of the traders are highly upset by this development because they feel picked upon,'' said John McCarthy, manager of the O-T-C trading department at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., **********''We still don't have a national market system, as Congress intended - a good system where all orders could be executed in a simple place.'' **********Peter J. DaPuzzo, executive vice president in charge of O-T-C trading at Shearson-American Express Company, was more emphatic: ''I see this as the beginning of the end of the way we do our business.'' **********The new system will begin reporting on 43 O-T-C, including such well-known issues as Apple Computer, MCI Communications, Pabst Brewing and Tandem Computers. Firms trading in these issues will be required to report the price and volume of each transaction within 90 seconds of execution. **********As a result, data on the most recent sales price and volume, highs and lows and cumulative volume will be available throughout the day.  And instead of the current practice of publishing the best bid and ask prices, newspaper stock tables will include high, low and actual closing prices. **********The primary complaint among broker-dealers are the new reporting requirements. Currently, traders in the over-the-counter market tally their volume at the end of the day and report only the best bid and ask offers. But the new system requires that they report each trade, thus exposing their trading activities to competitors and customers. **********Disclosing such vital information would disrupt their business, say traders, because they do not charge commissions. Instead, they make money on the difference between bid and ask prices - a spread that can be measured in fractions for active stocks or can run to several points for seldom-traded issues. **********At Merrill Lynch, for example, Mr. McCarthy predicts that the firm will be forced to increase its clerical staff in order to comply with the new reporting requirements. **********Perhaps more important, Mr. McCarthy said, the firm's traders will be spending considerably more time in monitoring price and volume movements in stocks they make markets in and those of their competitors. **********''We're going to either have to find more people to trade our stocks, or drop some of them,'' Mr. McCarthy said.  Another complaint is that the new system does not provide any method of insuring that a ''limit-order'' entered with one broker will be executed if a trigger price is reached with another broker.  Limit orders are left by customers with brokers or an exchange specialist to be executed when a stock's price reaches a certain level. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission has recommended that the nation's stock market's develop a ''central file'' that would electronically pool and display limit orders from all markets. But the new system fails to address this problem, traders say. **********James B. Raphalian, senior vice president and manager of the O-T-C trading department at Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, said the lack of a systematic limit order system may prove detrimental to investors: ''When a limit order is already in the market, and a stock trades at a discount or premium, how is the investor going to be protected? What is the moral obligation of the person who has it?,'' Mr. Raphalian, said. He added, ''No one would say that the system is no good, the point is that it's premature as far as having any of the bugs worked out.'' **********Gordon Macklin, president of the N.A.S.D., the self-regulatory organization developing the new system, concedes that considerable discontent exists among many brokers. **********''It's always difficult to find anyone intersted in buying new equipment and changing their way of doing business, and given this, you have a very uneasy environment,'' Mr. Macklin said, adding, ''it would be very hard to fault any of the individuals in this controversey, because they're doing what they do best -representing their economic interests. Remember, we're not building a hospital or charitable institution here.'' **********The S.E.C. is closely monitoring the progress of the new system because it will be the most comprehensive test so far of the effect of dropping restrictions on trading exchange-listed stocks away from exchange floors. Those restrictions are viewed by many as the primary obstacle to a national market system for securities that Congress mandated in 1975. **********The national market idea, first conceived by the S.E.C. more than a decade ago, envisions a nationwide system that would permit all investors and their brokers to execute instant trades in whatever market offers the best price for a particular security."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/10/world/britons-stage-new-landing-but-the-cost-is-called-high.html": {"writer_name": "R.

It said that at least 6 and possibly as many as 11 of the Argentine warplanes involved in trying to disrupt the landing were shot down.  They were reportedly intercepted and hit by Harrier jump-jets. **********In disclosing sketchy details of the action on Tuesday, the ministry said that the 2,800-ton frigate Plymouth and two 5,674-ton landing ships, the Sir Tristram and the Sir Galahad, had been damaged by enemy bombs, with five British troops suffering wounds. Much Darker Picture **********But a dispatch from Michael Nicholson of Independent Television News, who witnessed one Argentine attack painted a much darker picture. The Sir Galahad burst into flames, with black smoke pouring from her hold, he said, after ammunition boxes and fuel tanks blew up. He said a large number of British casualties had been incurred, with many men burned, and indicated that the ship had been abandoned. **********Another report suggested that the casualties were worse than those suffered in the sinking of the destroyer Sheffield on May 4, in which 20 men were killed and 24 hurt. **********Tonight military sources said that the Sir Galahad had probably sunk, and the Defense Ministry confirmed that casualties had been minor in air attacks at Lively Island and in Falkland Sound but \"much heavier\" in the raid off Fitzroy. The two landing ships were hit off Fitzroy and the Plymouth was hit in the sound, farther west. Argentina Assertions Denied **********The ministry strenuously denied Argentine assterions that the Plymouth had been sunk. **********It was not clear whether the losses would delay the long-awaited attack on Stanley, but senior officers conceded that Tuesday's attack was clear evidence that Britian had not yet established full air superiority. The shortcoming could complicate that battle for the capital, analysts believe. **********In a television interview, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was \"almost impossible\" to say when the British attack on Stanley would come. But she added that she hoped the assault on the Falkland capital, where about 7,000 Argentina troops are surrounded by the British, would not be \"too distant.\" **********\"The time when the military commander moves is up to him,\" she said. \"He is there. He knows the positions. He knows exactly how much he has to move before he makes the final assault. We can't fight a battle around the Cabinet table. He must fight it on the spot.\" **********Mrs. Thatcher repeated her assertion that a quick and honorable surrender of the Argentine garrison could easily be arranged, and that only such a surrender could prevent a battle for Stanley.  Despite her past offers, she said, she had seen \"no sign whatever\" that the enemy commander, Brig. Mario Menedez, was interested. **********In another development, the Denfense Ministry said that the Americanowned supertanker Hercules, hit by a bomb in the South Atlantic on Tuesday, had been ordered in a radio message moments earlier to head for and Argentine port. If it did not, the message said, \"you will be attacked in 15 minutes.\" **********The message, the minisry said, was preceded by the call sign of an Argentine radio station, believed to be in Ushuaia, and was addressed specifically to the Hercules, using her call sign. It was repeated for 13 minutes over an international distress frequency, according to the ministry spokesman, Ian McDonald, and was monitored by the British hospital ships Uganda and Hecla, which were operating at the time in the same area, about 500 miles northeast of the Falklands. **********In a telex message to the ship's Italian agents, the 220,117-ton tanker's master said none of his 28 crew members had been hurt. He reported that the ship had been attacked twice and had been \"slightly damaged\" by a bomb dropped in the first of the attacks fromwhat was described as a high-winged, four-engine, propellor-driven aircraft. **********The only planes known to be involved in the Falkland conflict that meet that description are Argentine C-130 transports, one of which dropped a bomb on a British tanker on June 2 without causing much damage. **********Information released during the night by the Defense Ministry, amplified by on-the-spot reports today, considerably altered previous assumptions about British troop movements. It had been thought, on the basis of background briefings by military officers here, that most of the Fifth Brigade had arrived in the mountains just west of Stanley. **********It had also been thought that the Second parachute Battalion, which took Darwin and Goose Green, had moved rapidly on to Fitzroy and Bluff Cove, a pair of small settlements on the southern track across the upper part of East Falkland. **********In fact, today's developments make clear, most of the 3,500 men of the Fifth Brigade who began coming ashore at San Carlos Bay remained there, with some Grukha units moving into the interior of the island and others reaching Mount Kent, the forward base near Stanley. Most of the Paratroopers remained at Darwin and Goose Green, patrolling. **********Late last week, an advance force of the Fifth Brigade moved out along the southern track. Last Saturday, from Swan Inlet, about halfway to the capital, the brigade commander, Brig. Tony Wilson, made a telephone call from a public booth, dropping a British 50-pence coin into the slot. He called a house in Fitzroy as a longshot, and to his astonishment a Falklander named Reg Binney answered. The brigadier asked whether any Argentine troops were there. **********\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Binney, \"but they're not her today.\" **********\"I think I'll join you then,\" Brigadier Wilson told him. **********\"That seems a good idea,\" came the reply. \"You'd be welcome.\" Vital Bridge Seized **********The commander called on the helicopters to ferry some of his men from Port San Carlos to Fitzroy. They seized the vital wooden bridge across the Fitzroy River, which had been damaged by retreating Argentines. **********Others were flown to Lively Island, south of Choiseul Sound, and loaded there into landing ships for an amphibious invasion near Fitzroy and Goose Green to conserve time.

The rate for three-month Treasury bills, for example, was 12.65 percent early in the day, but rose to 12.86 percent by closing. In the long bond market, the 14 percent Treasury issue due 2011 closed at about 103 1/2 to yield 13.5 percent compared with 104 17/32 around midday. **********''The volatility of the market has scared a lot of people, who just don't want to do anything while prices jump around,'' said one institutional salesman at a government securities firm. While yesterday's fluctuations were mild compared with the most hectic trading sessions, dealers said price changes could easily have been much greater because trading volume was so light. In the past six weeks the 14 percent Treasury bond has fluctuated between 94 3/4 on Feb. 10 and 105 on March 5. 10.61% for Certificates **********Among new issues, the Treasury sold $5.25 billion of new one-year bills at an average rate of 12.509 percent, which later rose to 12.66 percent in trading after the auction. Based on the bill sale, new one-year tax-exempt savings certificates may be offered starting Sunday at a yield of 10.16 percent, down from 10.79 percent since Feb. 21. The 14 1/8 percent Treasury notes due in two years were offered at 99 22/32 to yield 14.27 percent compared with an average of 14.14 percent at Wednesday's auction. **********Amid conflicting predictions about the course of the economy, credit demands, and money supply, many market participants said they preferred to wait on the sidelines until they were more confident about the direction of interest rates. **********For example, Donald L. Raiff, vice president at the Northern Trust Company, Chicago, said he expected short rates to fall two or three percentage points in the next three of four months, but added that ''this is one of those times when you want a balanced position in the market before the Fed's Friday money supply announcement.'' **********In such an uncertain environment, analysts said the cost of financing inventories was an important reason for lower prices yesterday. Overnight repurchase agreements - which are an important way securities firms borrow - cost about 14 1/4 percent using Treasury issues as collateral, a level where financing costs exceeded yields on issues held in inventory. Overnight Rate **********The cost of financing inventories is closly related to the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, which was at 14 7/8 percent most of the day. That rate was higher than many dealers expected, and contributed to the drop in prices. **********In the tax-exempt market, a $60 million issue of Aa-rated Sacramento, Calif., Municipal Utility District electric revenue bonds was offered by a Blyth Eastman Paine Webber group at yields ranging from 8.25 percent in 1983 to 11 percent in 1992 and slightly more than 12 percent in 2002. **********Because California issues have special appeal to California investors, underwriters said the Sacramento ''muds'' could be sold with yields considerably lower than other like rated electric revenue bonds of issuers outside the state. For example, earlier this month an Aa-rated issue of San Antonio electric revenue bonds was publicly offered with a 13.5 percent yield for bonds due 2001, and in secondary market trading since then the yield has increased slightly. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new one-year Treasury bills:"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/02/business/transamerica-to-buy-fred-s-james.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1982-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 758, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRANSAMERICA TO BUY FRED S.

JAMES", "body_text": " **********The Transamerica Corporation, one of the nation's leading insurance companies, has signed an agreement to buy Fred S. James & Company, the big insurance broker, for about $300 million, both said yesterday. **********Terms call for Transamerica -owner of the Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company, Budget Rent-a-Car and Transamerica Airlines - to offer shareholders $33.50 a share for James's roughly nine million shares outstanding. **********Analysts said the move could spur interest among other big financial service concerns, such as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Sears, Roebuck and American Express, to move into the insurance brokerage business. **********Word of a bid for James spread through Wall Street last week, with the stock spurting $2.375 a share, to $27.50, just before 11 A.M.  last Friday, when James halted trading in its stock pending an announcement. Reports had spread that both Sears and Merrill Lynch were buying the company. **********After the official announcement that Transamerica was the buyer, James ended the day at $32.875, up $5.375, in brisk trading. Corroon & Black, another big insurance broker, advanced $1.25, to $26.75, largely in sympathy with the news. **********James, one of the world's largest insurance brokers, has reported that its net income for the first six months of 1982 fell 9 percent, to $8.9 million, or 99 cents a share, from $9.8 million, or $1.08 a share (restated) a year earlier. Revenue rose slightly, to $123.6 million from $122.6 million in 1981. The company, with more than 400,000 clients, has 80 offices in the United States and 18 overseas. **********Unlike insurance agents, which represent insurance companies in the sale of insurance, brokers represent the consumers in their purchase of insurance and attempt to package policies and place coverage to the best advantage of these clients. **********Investor interest in insurance brokers was heightened last September when Ryder System, the truck-leasing company, bought 4.9 percent of Frank B. Hall & Company, an insurance broker based in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., as part of a plan to buy at least 15 percent for investment purposes. Suspecting a takeover attempt, Hall bought Jartran, a Ryder competitor, thus creating a potential antitrust conflict. Ryder now has 9.5 percent of Hall and a Federal court in Chicago has rebuffed efforts by Hall to prevent Ryder from buying more. **********Charles A. O'Malley, James's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that the Ryder situation was ''a real hair raiser'' and that this and other factors put James on the defensive initially. **********But Mr. O'Malley said: ''We soon began to feel that the way to go is to become part of a bigger organization. Then the decision was, which one.'' **********Last spring Transamerica, which is based in San Francisco, bought a 3.5 percent interest in Chicago-based James. While the two companies were ''getting to know each other,'' Mr. O'Malley said, James was ''looking at other opportunities,'' which he declined to mention.  ''We came to the conclusion,'' he said, ''that we intended to make a move outside our operation, that we were on the threshold of a huge change in the industry'' and wanted to be a part of it. **********In a telephone interview, James R. Harvey, 48, president and chief executive of Transamerica, said the deal ''allows us to add some very highly specialized insurance services.'' **********He noted that last summer Transamerica had sold the United Artists Corporation to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Film Company for $380 million. The bulk of the funds for the James venture, he said, would come from that deal, with the balance to come from general borrowing. **********The Transamerica-James deal appeared to have developed originally out of an earlier one involving the Prudential Insurance Company of America. As related by John Lathrop, vice president of the First Boston Corporation, which represented Transamerica, Prudential had asked First Boston to sell a small insurance services company owned by Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. Transamerica had been approached as a potential buyer and noted at the time that it might be interested in a fairly large insurance broker. Coincidentally, James was also a First Boston client. As put by James's Mr. O'Malley, ''it was a mutual approach to each other.'' **********A joint news release said James had granted Transamerica an option to buy up to 1.65 million shares from the company at $33.50, a device used to discourage other bidders. Mr. O'Malley, the announcement added, would continue in his present post and join Transamerica's board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/business/gilbert-associates-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GILBERT ASSOCIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "GILBERT ASSOCIATES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/lone-star-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/jobs/the-national-employment-outlook-the-southwest.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Reinhold", "pub_date": "1982-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE SOUTHWEST", "print_headline": "THE NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK; THE SOUTHWEST", "body_text": " **********THE jarring recession that has hit the oil industry has clouded whatu ntil recently seemed a bright outlook for geologists, petroleum e ngineers and other major occupations in the Southwest. Similarly, t he slump in the semiconductor industry has brought substantial l ayoffs in the Dallas area. **********But manpower experts generally say the downturn is cyclical and that the long-run prospects for this region are fundamentally good.  ''In the longer term, we see strong demand for technical occupations,'' said Sharon Cohany, an economist with the regional office of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas. ''The economy is still stronger here than in many other parts of the country.'' **********Still, demand has slackened dramatically. The Texas Employment Commission reports that only 30,000 new jobs were created in the state over the last year, compared to 90,000 in the comparable 1978-79 period. And while there was an average of 1.5 applicants per job opening in 1979, this year the figure was 3 people per opening. **********Hardest hit have been oil and electronics production workers. Now, however, higher-paid workers are also coming under pressure as large oil companies retrench and smaller ones fold. Dorothy Roddy, head of Roddy and Associates, a technical and executive-search company that serves the oil and gas industry, has seen a dramatic change in just one year. Last year, she said, landing a job for a qualified engineer might take three days to three weeks; now it takes 30 to 90 days, and salaries have leveled off. **********Dale Crumbaugh, a labor analyst with the Houston office of the Texas Employment Commission, said that drilling engineers with less than 10 to 15 years' experience were finding the going rough, with the picture about the same for geologists and computer personnel. **********There is no agreement here on how long the slump will last, but few experts are optimistic about a speedy recovery, given continuing softness in oil prices. The Houston office of Manpower Inc., providers of temporary help, takes a quarterly survey of 300 companies in the Houston area. ''Nobody I have talked to feels much will change until April, and it will be slow,'' said Ron Kapche, president. ''But by next fall things will be much better.'' **********Most analysts agree that the long-range outlook is good for geologists, engineers, mechanics, health specialists, computer experts and other technically oriented jobs in the Southwest. Mr.  Crumbaugh, for example, expects a growing demand for oil and gas accountants versed in the complexities of excess-profits taxes, depreciation allowance and such. The employment commission forecasts that 6,800 petroleum engineers will be working in Texas by 1985, up from 4,700 in 1978. **********''I still see some very high-paying job offers for engineering students coming out of college,'' said Sharon Cohany of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''That leads me to believe that employers in the oil industry are looking to the long term. They know we are still very oil dependent. They are saying this recession does have an end.''

If all goes well at the 95-acre site in nearby Frederick, Md., the breeder is expected to begin turning out solar cells toward the end of the summer. **********In contrast to the nuclear breeder, about which there has been considerable controversy, the solar breeder would be ''clean'' - producing minimal waste material, and truly self-renewable. ''In a nuclear breeder you eventually run out of fuel,'' said Dr. Lindmayer. ''It's not a true breeder. A true breeder is one that doesn't run out of fuel.'' **********Most of the $6 million for the project was put up by Standard Oil of Indiana, for which Solarex designed a $300,000 solar powered gas station near Chicago. Indiana Standard, which like many in the oil industry is spreading its energy bets, has acquired roughly 26 percent of the Solarex stock since 1978. **********The south roof, the side of buildings receiving the most sunlight, will be slanted to the ground at a 40 degree angle and covered with 3,120 large panels, each with 72 cells, for a total of 224,640 cells and a cost of $3 million. The plant would produce 1,000 cells an hour or over 2 million a year. Each cell would in turn produce a little less than a watt of electricity, with potential applications ranging from powering entire villages to lighting up a railroad crossing signal. **********Raymond A. McFarlane, director of advanced facility development for Solarex, contends that solar cells can produce residential electricity more cheaply than utilities over an 11- to 15-year period: Roughly 3 cents a kilowatt hour compared to current utility costs in Maryland of roughly 8 cents. **********''You have to make a big front end investment with solar cells,'' said Mr. McFarlane, who spent 25 years at RCA as an electromechanical engineer. ''But if somebody is patient enough to use them for 20 years, solar cells will be cheaper over the long run.'' **********Dr. Lindmayer emigrated from Hungary in 1956 and eventually became director of physics at COMSAT Laboratories, working on producing solar cells for use in space. He set up Solarex in 1973 with Peter Varadi, a co-worker at COMSAT, who is currently Solarex vice chairman. **********In 1974, around the time of the Arab oil embargo, Dr. Lindmayer came up with the idea for the breeder. But, he said, ''most people didn't know what I was talking about. I had to fight against a prevailing attitude that it takes 30 to 40 years to recover the energy used in manufacturing a solar cell.'' **********The breeder is, admittedly, not cost-effective yet. But Dr.  Lindmayer contends that it will take only 10 years to recover the initial $6 million investment and that the original solar panels will be churning out more cells for another ten years at minimal cost. **********That's if all goes well. But there are potential hazards. For one thing, Solarex is counting on semicrystalline photovoltaic cells, made by casting silicon into cubes and sawing the cubes into square cells. That process would be a lot easier than making traditional single crystal cells, which must grow from a seed crystal, but it's still a new technology. **********Then too, there is the question of whether the strict waste heat management that the company has incorporated in the solar breeder will work. The idea is to use heat generated by the factory's machines to heat and cool the building. If it doesn't, there may be a power problem. The breeder will not be connected to the utility grid at all, although a diesel generator will provide emergency backup power and lead-acid batteries will have the capacity to store enough electricity to run the factory for four days. **********Still, Dr. Lindmayer foresees a sparkling future for the breeder.  Eventually he hopes to export entire solar factories, providing enough electricity for 25,000 square feet of assembly type workspace. **********''Just as we have prefabricated housing,'' Dr. Lindmayer asked.  ''why can't we have a prefabricated industrial building with the power attached to it?'' **********Lyndon Stambler"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/16/business/advertising-mccaffrey-mccall-chosen-by-avis-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McCaffrey & McCall Chosen by Avis Unit", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; McCaffrey & McCall Chosen by Avis Unit", "body_text": " **********Avis Rent A Car System, a subsidiary of Avis Inc., part of Norton Simon, has named McCaffrey & McCall to handle its domestic advertising account, which last year billed about $10 million. **********The car rental company, which began an agency review last January, made the selection from seven other advertising agencies, a review in which Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn said it would not participate.

Blue is the personal trademark of Estee Lauder, as pink was Elizabeth Arden's. And just as surely as Mrs. Lauder has nailed her color to the company's mast, she has stamped her personal imprint on the group, by some measures the most successful cosmetics company in the United States. **********Last week, with a fanfare it normally reserves for a new body lotion, the group announced some executive changes. Leonard Lauder, the 49-year-old president, also became chief executive officer; his brother, Ronald Lauder, 38, executive vice president, assumed the additional title of chairman of the company's substantial overseas operations. **********As befits a cosmetics business, however, there were signs that the changes were mainly skin-deep. Although the entire family granted one of its rare interviews to publicize the promotion of the ''sweet boys,'' as their fond mother described them, Mrs. Lauder also made it clear that she is not stepping down anytime soon from her active chairmanship, nor is her husband, Joseph, withdrawing from management of the group's factories. ''What we are doing is setting the stage for the next 20 years,'' said Ronald Lauder. **********Indeed, it is perhaps the family's proudest boast that the younger and older generations have worked together long and well, almost from the founding of Estee Lauder Inc. by Mrs. and Mr. Lauder in 1946.  Today, Estee Lauder is a household word. Its Youth Dew is one of the nation's top three selling fragrances. The group has approximately 10,000 employees worldwide. **********It accounts for an estimated 30 to 50 percent of department store sales of cosmetics and fragrances. And Mrs. Lauder, a blonde, hazeleyed woman on no specified side of 70 (''Age?'' she hoot ed, when the subject was broached. ''You're kidding.'') has outlived her rivals: Charles Revson of Revlon, Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden. ''I'm the only one left,'' she said last week. ''Thank God.'' **********More precise measures of the group's success are harder to obtain.  It is still privately held by the senior Lauders, their two sons and their four grandchildren. But the rest of the industry and Wall Street, which watch it closely, estimate that revenues currently approach $1 billion. The figure is neither confirmed nor denied by management. Leonard Lauder says only that the group has had a compounded annual growth rate of 20 percent in its 36 years. **********Profits are an even more speculative matter, but the picture is decidedly less rosy: Estee Lauder's profit margins are believed to fall below the 5 percent mark. The primary reason, suggested Jack L.  Salzman, an analyst for Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company, is that the company was built on a pattern of discounting. The technique is known more elegantly in department stores as purchase-with-purchase or gift-with-purchase, in which customers who buy a certain amount receive additional items at reduced prices or free. ''It's a very expensive proposition,'' Mr. Salzman said. **********Related to that is Estee Lauder's heavy reliance on department stores. ''There's a fallacy that if you sell through department stores, you're better off,'' said Mr. Salzman. In fact, he added, ''prestige department stores set the tone, and they make the manufacturers pay for it'' by, for example, offering more and better discounts. **********That is the choice that the Lauders made from the first, and to which they have adhered. The company's strategy has always been to sell top-of-the-line products through top-rated outlets, for top dollar, rather than through drug stores and discount chains like Woolworths and K marts. **********Over the years, the Estee Lauder group has enhanced its appeal through a combination of line extensions, genuine new-product introductions and savvy positioning. The company now has four divisions: the original Estee Lauder; Clinique, a hypo-allergenic line, gaining quickly on Estee Lauder; Aramis, men's toiletries, and Prescriptives, a high-tech skin-treatment line. In addition, the group is growing rapidly overseas, which accounts for half of its sales. **********In large measure, the company has got where it is through the considerable energy and creative talents of Mrs. Lauder, who still has a copy of her first order, for $1,045.44 from a Philadelphia distributor in 1946. **********It is difficult to determine the extent of her involvement now, but her presence at the group's offices is hard to ignore. She loses little time in ushering a female visitor into her private marbledand-mirrored bathroom and painting her with Country Market and Regatta, two recently introduced Estee Lauder cosmetics lines. **********Mrs. Lauder frequently visits the group's offices and retail outlets, and when she is in New York, comes to work daily at the group's headquarters in the General Motors Building. (Because Lauder and Revlon are major tenants, wits call it the General Odors Building.) **********She denounces rival products - ''Lancome is nothing,'' she said, of the French cosmetics company regarded as one of the Lauder group's toughest rivals. She complains that competitors raid the group for staff, hoping to poach its creativity, but to no avail. ''After three, six months, they run out of my ideas,'' she declared. She has unswerving faith in cosmetics, and unstinting praise for her own.  ''It gives you a finished, clean, natural look,'' she said of her make-up. ''You can't wash your face with soap and go out. That's not natural.'' **********In the group's creative matters - color, fragrance, even advertisements - Mrs. Lauder appears to have the final word. She lays claim to an almost sixth sense in fashion, foreseeing a future season's colors and a line of complementary cosmetics. She says she can see and feel fragrances as well as smell them. **********When she retreated to Palm Beach last winter, she regularly summoned the group's researchers south. (''How can they judge colors when New York is so gray and dreary?'' she asked.) ''If my mother calls and makes a valid point, it's accepted,'' said Ronald Lauder.  ''And 99 percent of the time, it's a valid point.'' **********As a marketer, analysts say, the company has performed superbly. It diversified early into other product lines, under different names - Aramis in 1964, Clinique in 1968, Prescriptives in 1979 - that have allowed the group to compete with itself for customers and to take up more square footage of prime department store space than any other cosmetics company. It has positioned the two other women's divisions carefully, to avoid cannibalizing the original Estee Lauder business; Clinique is identified with health, Prescriptives with the space-age and science. **********The image is supported by the use of a single model for each of those divisions. Since 1971, for example, advertisements for the main division, Estee Lauder, have used a single model, Karen Graham, to project the requisite elegance and sophistication.Only recently, as Miss Graham began to project a certain maturity, too, did the company bring in Shaun Casey, a model in her 20's, for more youthful lines such as American Desert. **********''The Estee Lauder advertisements have not changed in 20 years,'' boasted Leonard Lauder. ''They're styled carefully. The hair, dress, settings are exactly right.'' They provoke strong demand not only at cosmetics counters, but also for featured jewelry and furniture. ''We get hundreds of letters after each ad, asking, 'Where'd you get that breakfront? That table'?'' said Mr. Lauder. **********While it has kept the images consistent, the group has simultaneously spawned numerous new products and variations within each line. Clinique, Aramis and Estee Lauder have their own shampoos and fragrances. Last autumn, the Estee Lauder division introduced European Body Spa, a line that includes no fewer than 10 new products, including a body buffer, a foot cream and a bust conditioner. **********Such brilliant and successful marketing has made the group the darling of the stores - and of the buyers, too. According to an annual survey by Smith Barney, the group leads all popularity polls for servicing the retailers. That is just fine with the Lauders, who scorn the mass-merchandising route taken by Charles Revson. ''The fewer stores we sell, the more successful we are,'' said Leonard Lauder. ''We roll things out very, very slowly.'' Although the Lauder lines are in only a handful of stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for example, sales per capita exceed New York's, where the distribution is wider. **********But the relationship cuts two ways. To increase their department store sales, the Lauders in the 1950's pioneered a posher form of discounting, through gift-with-purchase offers. The group's sales soared, but so did the stores' and customers' expectations. Thus, the Lauder group and its competitors were forced into a costly round of gift-with-purchase and purchase-with-purchase discounting. **********''Department stores now demand these,'' said Mr. Salzman.  Furthermore, by foregoing chain and drug stores, he added, the Lauder group not only sacrificed bigger volume, with consequent economies of scale, but also lost outlets where competition is less fierce and advertising expenses more fairly shared. By now, the group may be a prisoner of its marketing strategy, unable to branch out without incurring the wrath of the department stores, Mr. Salzman noted. **********With its outlets limited, industry analysts say, the next logical area of growth for the group to enter is hair-care products. The group is including a hair laboratory in its new research-anddevelopment facility, near its largest factory, in Melville, L.I. But any product to emerge must bottle a technological breakthrough, according to Leonard Lauder. ''The business has been dominated by the mass-marketers: Procter & Gamble, Bristol-Myers,'' he said. ''They give good value. Women aren't waiting for a new shampoo.'' The group's major efforts will remain in skin care, he added. **********For the Lauder group, as for a number of packaged goods companies, the potential is far greater overseas. Starting in 1960 with sales to Harrods in London, the group now does half of its volume - though substantially less of its profits - abroad in 75 countries, and sales should grow by 30 percent this year, Ronald Lauder predicts. **********He is enthusiastic about opportunities in Spain, France, Australia, Japan. In many countries, it is perceived as a prohibitively expensive line. The answer, he said, is not to cut prices, but to ''position it in a broader market,'' through heavy advertising and other forms of promotion. ''We'll make Estee Lauder a household word throughout the world,'' he vowed. **********Not everything, however, that the Lauder group touches turns to gold. It has been faulted for its handling of Aramis, its line of men's toiletries, where its sizeble lead has been reduced by the entry of a number of new, higher-priced products. But the family emphasizes that it is in the cosmetics business for the long term, and is prepared to invest accordingly - a determination made more feasible by its private ownership. But can the group outlive its dynamic founder? **********''Mrs. Lauder is like a conductor of a great symphony orchestra,'' said Leonard Lauder, using the impersonal form to speak of his mother in business discussions. ''The challenge is to orchestrate so that it goes on and on, without a stop.'' XX-BOX WITH LAUDER adv18 c. 1982 N.Y. Times News Service **********OTHER EMPIRES: REVLON, ARDEN, RUBENSTEIN Of the great entrepreneurs of the American beauty business, only Estee Lauder survives. And of those individuals' cosmetics empires, only Mrs. Lauder's group continues in much its original form. **********Mrs. Lauder's archrival, Charles Revson, who built the Revlon empire from a Depression-era nail polish distributorship, died in 1975. Under his successor, Michel Bergerac, Revlon has been transformed into a $2.4 billion company that derives half of its revenue from health-care activities. In addition to its lipsticks and nail polish, Revlon makes medical instruments, contact lenses and ethical pharmaceuticals. **********After years of record growth, however, Revlon's earnings fell 9 percent last year, to $175 million. A major factor was the stronger dollar, which reduced Revlon's income overseas. But analysts suggest the company was also hurt by fierce competition, a mature domestic market for cosmetics and difficulty at absorbing its many health-care acquisitions. **********Behind the red door at Elizabeth Arden, however, things are looking up. Four years after the death in 1966 of Elizabeth Nightingale Graham, its Canadian-born founder and sole owner, the company was sold to Eli Lilly & Company, the large pharmaceutical concern. **********Its $271 million cosmetics business has not consistently been a star performer for Lilly. Recently, however, sales have benefited from such best-sellers as Chloe fragrance, Visible Difference and Millenium, a skin-care line akin to Estee Lauder's Prescriptives. **********The venerable Helena Rubinstein Inc., whose Polish-born founder died in 1965, has had the spottiest history. The cosmetics manufacturer was bought for $142 million in 1973 by the Colgate-Palmolive Company. **********When the acquisition kept losing millions, Colgate sought to sell it - first to the Kao Soap Company of Japan, then to L'Oreal S.A. of Paris. It was finally sold two years ago to Albi Enterprises, a privately company, for $20 million. **********For sheer sales growth, the reigning beauty queen may be the founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics, formed in 1963, where sales spurted last year by 41 percent, to $235 million. But prices are moderate and distribution is door-to-door, thus excluding Mary Kay Ash from Mrs.  Lauder's exclusive club."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/08/business/business-people-bobbie-brooks-inc-appoints-president.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1982-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bobbie Brooks Inc.

Haig Jr. before Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies and made public by the State Department: **********It is a melancholy fact of the modern age that man has conceived a means capable of his own destruction. For 37 years mankind has had to live with the terrible burden of nuclear weapons. From the dawn of the nuclear age, these weapons have been the source of grave concern to our peoples and the focus of continuous public debate. Every successive President of the United States has shared these concerns.  Every administration has had to engage itself in this debate. **********It is right that each succeeding generation should question anew the manner in which its leaders exercise such awesome responsibilities. It is right that each new administration should have to confront the aweful dilemmas posed by the possession of nuclear weapons. It is right that our nuclear strategy should be exposed to continuous examination. **********In debating these issues, we should not allow the complexity of the problems and the gravity of the stakes to blind us to the common ground upon which we all stand. No one has ever advocated nuclear war. No responsible voice has ever sought to minimize its horrors. **********The Only Strategy **********On the contrary, from the earliest days of the postwar era, America's leaders have recognized the only nuclear strategy consistent with our values and our survival - our physical existence, and what makes life worth living - is the strategy of deterrence. The massive destructive power of these weapons precludes their serving any lesser purpose. The catastrophic consequences of another world war - with or without nuclear weapons - make deterrence of conflict our highest objective and our only rational military strategy in the modern age. **********Thus, since the close of World War II, American and Western strategy has assigned a single function to nuclear weapons: the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. At the heart of this deterrence strategy is the requirement that the risk of engaging in war must be made to outweigh any possible benefits of aggression. The cost of aggression must not be confined to the victims of aggression. **********This strategy of deterrence has won the consistent approval of the Western peoples. It has enjoyed the bipartisan support of the American Congress. It has secured the unanimous endorsement of every successive allied government. **********Deterrence has been supported because deterrence works. Nuclear deterrence and collective defense have preserved peace in Europe, the crucible of two global wars in this century. Clearly neither improvement in the nature of man nor strengthening of the international order have made war less frequent or less brutal.  Millions have died since 1945 in over 130 international and civil wars. Yet nuclear deterrence has prevented a conflict between the two superpowers, a conflict which even without nuclear weapons would be the most destructive in mankind's history. Requirements for Deterrence **********The simple possession of nuclear weapons does not guarantee deterrence. Throughout history societies have risked their total destruction if the prize of victory was sufficiently great or the consequences of submission sufficiently grave. War, and in particular nuclear war, can be deterred, but only if we are able to deny an aggressor military advantage from his action and thus insure his awareness that he cannot prevail in any conflict with us.  Deterrence, in short, requires the maintenance of a secure military balance, one which cannot be overturned through surprise attack or sudden technological breakthrough. The quality and credibility of deterrence must be measured against these criteria. Successive administrations have understood this fact and stressed the importance of an overall balance. This Administration can do no less. **********The strategy of deterrence, in its essentials, has endured. But the requirements for maintaining a secure capability to deter in all circumstances have evolved. In the early days of unquestioned American nuclear superiority, the task of posing an unacceptable risk to an aggressor was not difficult. The threat of massive retaliation was fully credible as long as the Soviet Union could not respond in kind. As the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal grew, however, this threat began to lose credibility. Concept of Flexible Response **********To sustain the credibility of Western deterrence, the concept of flexible response was elaborated and formally adopted by the United States and its NATO partners in 1967. Henceforth, it was agreed that NATO would meet aggression initially at whatever level it was launched, while preserving the flexibility to escalate the conflict, if necessary, to secure the cessation of aggression and the withdrawal of the aggressor. The purpose of this strategy is not just to conduct conflict successfully if it is forced upon us, but more importantly to prevent the outbreak of conflict in the first place. **********Flexible response is not premised upon the view that nuclear war can be controlled. Every successive allied and American government has been convinced that a nuclear war, once initiated, could escape such control. They have therefore agreed upon a strategy which retains the deterrent effect of a possible nuclear response, without making such a step in any sense automatic. **********The alliance based its implementation of flexible response upon a spectrum of forces, each of which plays an indispensable role in assuring the credibility of a Western strategy of deterrence. At one end of the spectrum are America's strategic forces, our heavy bombers, intercontinental missiles and ballistic-missile submarines.  Since NATO's inception, these forces have been the ultimate guarantee of Western security, a role which they will retain in the future. Role of Conventional Forces **********At the other end of the spectrum are the alliance's conventional forces, including U.S. troops in Europe. These forces must be strong enough to defeat all but the most massive and persistent conventional aggression. They must be resistant and durable enough to give political leaders time to measure the gravity of the threat, to confront the inherently daunting prospects of nuclear escalation and to seek through diplomacy the cessation of conflict and restoration of any lost Western territory. The vital role which conventional forces play in deterrence is too often neglected, particularly by those most vocal in their concern over reliance upon nuclear weapons. A strengthened conventional posture both strengthens the deterrent effect of nuclear forces and reduces the prospect of their ever being used. **********Linking together strategic and conventional forces are theater nuclear forces, that is, NATO's nuclear systems based in Europe.  These systems are concrete evidence of the nature of the American commitment. They are a concrete manifestation of NATO's willingness to resort to nuclear weapons if necessary to preserve the freedom and independence of its members. Further, the presence of nuclear weapons in Europe insures the Soviet Union will never believe that it can divide the U.S. from its allies or wage a limited war with limited risks against any NATO member. Averting a Third Rescue **********The strategy of flexible response and the forces that sustain its credibility reflect more than simply the prevailing military balance. Western strategy also reflects the political and geographical reality of an alliance of 15 independent nations, the most powerful of which is separated from all but one of the others by 4,000 miles of ocean. **********Deterrence is consequently more than a military strategy. It is the essential political bargain which binds together the Western coalition. Twice in this century, America has been unable to remain aloof from European conflict but able to intervene in time to prevent the devastation of Western Europe. Neither we nor our allies can afford to see this pattern repeated a third time. We have, therefore, chosen a stategy which engages American power in the defense of Europe and gives substance to the principle that the security of the alliance is indivisible. **********What U.S. Is Trying to Do **********During the past decade the Soviet Union has mounted a sustained buildup across the range of its nuclear forces designed to undermine the credibility of this alliance strategy. Soviet modernization efforts have far outstripped those of the West. The development and deployment of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles now pose a serious and increasing threat to a large part of our land-based ICBM force. A new generation of Soviet intermediate range missiles are targeted upon our European allies. **********In the last 10 years, the Soviets introduced an unprecedented array of new strategic and intermediate range systems into their arsenals, including the SS-17, SS-18 and SS-19 ICBM's, the Backfire bomber, the Typhoon submarine and several new types of submarine-launched missiles and the SS-20 intermediate range missile. In contrast, during this same period, the U.S. exercised restraint, introducing only the Trident missile and submarine and the slower, air-breathing cruise missile. What Reagan Has Done **********In order to deal with the resulting imbalances, President Reagan has adopted a defense posture and recommended programs to the U.S.  Congress designed to maintain deterrence, rectify the imbalances and thereby support the Western strategy I have outlined. **********His bold strategic modernization program, announced last October, is designed to insure the maintenance of a secure and reliable capability to deny an adversary advantage from any form of aggression, even a surprise attack. **********The President's decision, in his first weeks in office, to go ahead with the production and deployment of the Pershing 2 and groundlaunched cruise missiles, in accordance with NATO's decision of December 1979, represents an effort to reinforce the linkage between our strategic forces in the United States and NATO's conventional and nuclear forces in Europe. A response to the massive buildup of Soviet SS-20's targeted on Western Europe, this NATO decision was taken to insure that the U.S.S.R. will never launch aggression in the belief that its own territory can remain immune from attack or that European security can ever be decoupled from that of the U.S. Relationship of 3 Kinds of Forces **********The improvements we are making in our conventional forces - in their readiness, mobility, training and equipment - are designed to insure the kind of tough and resiliant conventional capability required by the strategy of flexible response. **********It is important to recognize the interrelationship of these three types of forces. The requirements in each category are dependent upon the scale of the others. Their functions are similarly linked. The Soviet Union understands this. That is why they have consistently proposed a pledge against the first use of nuclear weapons, an idea which has achieved some resonance here in the West. **********NATO has consistently rejected such Soviet proposals, which are tantamount to making Europe safe for conventional aggression. If the West were to allow Moscow the freedom to choose the level of conflict which most suited it and to leave entirely to Soviet discretion the nature and timing of any escalation, we would be forced to maintain conventional forces at least at the level of those of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. The Consequent Costs **********Those in the West who advocate the adoption of a ''no first use'' policy seldom go on to propose that the United States reintroduce the draft, triple the size of its armed forces and put its economy on wartime footing. Yet in the absence of such steps, a pledge of no first use effectively leaves the West nothing with which to counterbalance the Soviet conventional advantages and geopolitical position in Europe. **********Neither do Western proponents of a ''no first use'' policy acknowledge the consequences for the Western alliance of an American decision not to pose and accept the risk of nuclear war in the defense of Europe. A ''no first use'' policy would be the end of flexible response and thus of the very credibility of the Western strategy of deterrence. In adopting such a stance, the United States would be limiting its commitment to Europe. But the alliance cannot function as a limited liability corporation. It can only survive as a partnership to which all are equally and fully committed - shared benefits, shared burdens, shared risks. Perpetuating Inequality **********Another concept which has recently attracted interest is that of a freeze on nuclear weapons. While being sensitive to the concerns underlying this proposal, we have had to underscore the flaws in such an approach. A freeze at current levels would perpetuate an unstable and unequal military balance. It would reward a decade of unilateral Soviet buildup and penalize the United States for a decade of unilateral restraint. As President Reagan stressed last week, such a freeze would remove all Soviet incentive to engage in meaningful arms control designed to cut armaments and reduce the risk of war. **********Much of the argumentation for a nuclear freeze revolves around the question of how much is enough. Each side possesses thousands of deliverable nuclear weapons. Does it then really make any difference who is ahead? The question itself is misleading, as it assumes that deterrence is simply a matter of numbers of weapons or numbers of casualties which could be inflicted. It is not. Who Is to Be Deterred **********Let us remember, first and foremost, that we are trying to deter the Soviet Union, not ourselves. The dynamic nature of the Soviet nuclear buildup demonstrates that the Soviet leaders do not believe in the concept of ''sufficiency.'' They are not likely to be deterred by a force based upon it. **********Let us also recall that nuclear deterrence must work not just in times of peace and moments of calm. Deterrence faces its true test at the time of maximum tension, even in the midst of actual conflict.  In such extreme circumstances, when the stakes on the table may already be immense, when Soviet leaders may feel the very existence of their regime is threatened, who can say whether or not they would run massive risks if they believed that in the end the Soviet state would prevail. **********Deterrence thus does not rest on a static comparison of the number or size of nuclear weapons. Rather, deterrence depends upon our capability, even after suffering a massive nuclear blow, to prevent an aggressor from securing a military advantage and prevailing in a conflict. Only if we maintain such a capability can we deter such a blow. Deterrence, in consequence, rests upon a military balance measured not in warhead numbers but in a complex interaction of capabilities and vulnerabilities. Pick up first add **********The Military Balance **********The state of the military balance and its impact upon the deterrent value of American forces cast a shadow over every significant geopolitical decision. It affects on a day-to-day basis the conduct of American diplomacy. It influences the management of international crises and the terms upon which they are resolved. **********The search for national interest and national security is a principal preoccupation of the leaders of every nation on the globe.  Their decisions and their foreign policies are profoundly affected by their perception of the military balance between the United States and the Soviet Union and the consequent capacity of either to help provide for their security or to threaten it. **********More important still, perceptions of the military balance also affect the psychological attitude of both American and Soviet leaders, as they respond to events around the globe. For the foreseeable future the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union will be one in which our differences outnumber points of convergence. Our objective must be to restrain this competition, to keep it below the level of force, while protecting our interests and those of our allies. Our ability to secure these objectives will be crucially influenced by the state of the strategic balance. Every judgment we make and every judgment the Soviet leadership makes will be shaded by it. Complicating Soviet Calculations **********Thus the Soviet leadership, in calculating the risks of subversion or aggression, of acquiring new clients or propping up faltering proxies, must carefully evaluate the possibilities and prospects for an effective American response. Soviet calculations must encompass not only American capabilities to influence regional developments, but American willingness to face the prospect of U.S.-Soviet confrontation and consequent escalation. American leaders, for their part, must go through comparable calculations in reacting to regional conflicts, responding to Soviet adventurism and seeking to resolve international crises in a manner consistent with U.S. interests. **********Put simply, our own vulnerability to nuclear blackmail, as well as the susceptibility of our friends to political intimidation, depends upon our ability and willingness to cope credibly with any Soviet threat. A strong and credible strategic posture enhances stability by reducing for the Soviets the temptations toward adventurism at the same time that it strengthens our hand in responding to Soviet political-military threats. Arms Control and Deterrence **********In no area of diplomacy does the military balance have greater effect than in arms control. Arms control can reinforce deterrence and stabilize a military balance at lower levels of risk and effort.  Arms control cannot, however, either provide or restore a balance we are unwilling to maintain through our defense efforts. **********Just as the only justifiable nuclear strategy is one of deterrence, so the overriding objective for arms control is reducing the risk of war. The essential purpose of arms control is not to save money, although it may do so. Its purpose is not to generate good feelings or improve international relationships, although it may have that effect as well. Arms control's central purpose must be to reinforce the military balance, upon which deterrence depends, at reduced levels of weapons and risk. **********On Nov. 18, President Reagan laid out the framework for a comprehensive program of arms control designed to serve these objectives. He committed the United States to seek major reductions in nuclear and conventional forces, leading to equal agreed limits on both sides. The Steps U.S. Has Taken **********Last week he reviewed the steps we have taken.  In Geneva we have put forth deailed proposals designed to limit intermediate range nuclear forces and to eliminate entirely the missiles of greatest concern to each side. This proposal has won the strong and unified support of our allies. **********In Vienna, we are negotiating, alongside our allies, on reductions in conventional force levels in Europe. These negotiations have gone on without real progress for over eight years. Because we are now facing diplomatic atrophy, we must urgently consider how to revitalize East-West discussions of conventional force reductions and stimulate progress in these talks. **********Our highest priority, in the past several months, has been completing preparations for negotiations with the Soviet Union on strategic arms. Here, too, we will be proposing major reductions to verifiable, equal agreed levels. Here, too, we will be presenting detailed proposals when negotiations open. **********The prospects for progress in each of these areas of arms control depend upon support of the President's defense programs. This imperative has been caricatured as a policy of building up arms in order to reduce them. This is simply not true. As President Reagan's proposals for intermediate range missiles make clear, we hope that we never have to deploy those systems. But we must demonstrate a willingness to maintan the balance through force deployments if we are to have any prospect of reducing and stabilizing it through arms control. 2 Examples of the Pattern **********Negotiations in the early 1970's, on a treaty limiting antiballistic missile systems, provide an historic example. At the time, the Soviets had already built a system of ballistic missile defenses around Moscow. The United States had deployed no such system. Arms control offered the only means of closing off an otherwise attractive and expensive new avenue for arms competition.  Yet it was not until the American Administration sought and secured Congressional support for an American ABM program that the Soviets began to negotiate seriously. The result was the 1972 treaty limiting antiballistic missile systems, which remains in force today. **********This same pattern was repeated more recently with intermediate range missiles. For years the Soviets had sought limits on U.S.  nuclear forces in Europe but refused to consider any limits upon their nuclear forces targeted upon Europe. Only after NATO took its decision of December 1979 to deploy U.S. Pershing 2 and groundlaunched cruise missiles did the U.S.S.R. agree to put its SS-20 missiles on the negotiating table. The Morality of the Issue **********In the area of strategic arms, as well, there is little prospect the Soviet Union will ever agree to equal limits at lower levels unless first persuaded that the United States is otherwise determined to maintain equality at higher levels. It is, for instance, unrealistic to believe that the Soviet Union will agree to reduce the most threatening element of its force structure, its heavy, multiwarheaded intercontinental missiles, unless it is persuaded that otherwise the United States will respond by deploying comparable systems itself. **********For many opposed to reliance on nuclear weapons - even for defense or deterrence - the issue is a moral one. For those who first elaborated the strategy of deterrence and for those who seek to maintain its effect this issue is also preeminently moral. A familiar argument is that, in a nuclear age, we must choose between our values and our existence. If nuclear weapons offer the only deferrent to nuclear blackmail, some would argue we should submit rather than pose the risk of nuclear conflict. This choice, however, is a false one.  By maintaining the military balance and sustaining deterrence, we protect the essential values of Western civilization -democratic government, personal liberty and religious freedom - and preserve the peace. In failing to maintain deterrence, we would risk our freedoms while actually increasing the likelihood of also suffering nuclear devastation. Avoiding the Extremes **********As human beings and free men and women, we must reject this false alternative and avoid the extremes of nuclear catastrophe and nuclear blackmail. In the nuclear age, the only choice consistent with survival and civilization is deterrence. **********An eminent theologian once described our age as one in which ''the highest possibilties are inextricably intermingled with the most dire perils.'' The scientific and technological advances so vital to our civilization also make possible its destruction. This reality cannot be wished away. **********Americans have always been conscious of the dilemmas posed by the nuclear weapon. From the moment that science unleashed the atom, our instinct and policy has been to control it. Those who direct America's defense policies today share completely the desire of people everywhere to end the nuclear arms race and to begin to achieve substantial reductions in nuclear armament. **********Confronted by the dire perils of such weapons, America has responded in a manner that best preserves both security and peace, that protects our society and our values and that offers hope without illusion. The strategy of deterrence has kept the peace for over 30 years. It has provided the basis for arms control efforts. And it offers the best chance to control and to reduce the dangers we face. Not Automatic Nor Cheap **********Deterrence is not automatic. It cannot be had on the cheap. Our ability to sustain it depends upon our ability to maintain the military balance now being threatened by the Soviet buildup. If we are to reinforce deterrence through arms control and arms reduction, we must convince the Soviets that their efforts to undermine the deterrent effect of our forces will not succeed. **********The control and reduction of nuclear weapons, based on deterrence, is the only effective intellectual, political and moral response to nuclear weapons. The stakes are too great and the consequences of error too catastrophic to exchange deterrence for a leap into the unknown. The incentives for real arms control exist and we have both the means and the duty to apply them. **********Let us be clear about our objectives in the nuclear era. We seek to reduce the risk of war and to establish a stable military balance at lower levels of risk and effort. By doing so today, we may be able to build a sense of mutual confidence and cooperation, offering the basis for even more ambitious steps tomorrow. But above all, we shall be pursuing the ''highest possibility'' for peace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/22/business/rsi-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RSI CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "RSI CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/07/world/2d-ranking-austrian-official-starts-on-official-trip-to-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2d-Ranking Austrian Official Starts on Official Trip to U.S.", "print_headline": "2d-Ranking Austrian Official Starts on Official Trip to U.S.", "body_text": " **********Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz of Austria left here today for an official visit to the United States during which he will meet Secretary of State Alexander M.

Unlike older public interest law groups, with their liberal orientation, Mountain States is part of a counterwave of public interest firms that bring a free market philosophy to court.  James G. Watt, the former president of Mountain States, was appointed Secretary of the Interior last year, and Roger J. Marzulla replaced him. The Reagan Administration shares Mountain States' views on many public land questions the foundation has addressed, so Mr. Marzulla thinks it has an opportunity to tackle broader issues such as business regulation and tax policy. Recently Mr. Marzulla, 34 years old, discussed the foundation's work. **********Q. What does the Mountain States Legal Foundation do? A. It does something absolutely crucial: It defends free enterprise, which we have tended over the last 20 years or so to downgrade. The fact is that civil liberties in this nation are dependent upon economic liberties, and the only economic system which is consistent with democracy is the free market system. If the Government controls the means of production, if it controls the way in which you make your living, then you cannot expect the Government to avoid controlling freedom of speech, freedom of religion and so on. **********Q. Has your focus changed since Mr. Watt left Mountain States? A.  We've taken on a number of additional issues. When Mr. Watt started as the only lawyer, he obviously didn't have the resources we have now, with 13 lawyers. There's a preconception that all we are involved in is the environment and that the Sierra Club is our only adversary, but that isn't so. We have a docket of 40 to 50 cases.  Our mandate is to defend the free enterprise system, private property rights and individual liberties against excessive Government intrusion. **********Q. Has the change in Administrations affected your program? A.  Primarily, it has put us on the other side of the counsel table.  During the last Administration, we were primarily engaged in bringing lawsuits to challenge the new regulations that were promulgated. Now the Adminstration's actions are being challenged by others. Our job now is more often to defend the Administration's actions. **********Q. What do you see as your most pressing issue? A. The use of the public lands. The Western United States is actually more than 50 percent owned by the Federal Government. Most of the mineral and energy resources of this nation are located in precisely that same area, and the Government has not been a good steward of those lands in terms of utilizing those natural resources. We become involved in cases where we see the Government going awry. Ultimately I would like to see privatization of a substantial portion of those lands. I believe those lands would be better taken care of in the hands of a rancher or an individual utilizing them for housing or for mineral development. Obviously, I'm not talking about the areas that have significant wilderness potential. **********Q. What kinds of cases are you involved in right now? A. The most significant business case we are working on right now is a challenge to the crude oil windfall profits tax - I should say the so-called windfall profits tax, because what it really is is an invidious severance tax. What that tax means is that if the American populace gets upset with a particular industry, it can take away that industry's profits. And if that can happen to oil, it can happen to any other industry. **********Q. Wouldn't the views of big business be well represented in court even if Mountain States didn't exist? A. When you talk of big business, you're talking about business with sufficient clout to be part of the system. We represent small business, like the mom-and-pop grocery stores that don't have the resources to be heard. Our view is that government regulation of things like trucking or communications ought not to occur. That puts us at odds with big business - those with the permits. There are many situations in which we do not take the same position as big business.

Habib, went into effect. At least 70 people were killed and more than twice that number wounded in the barrages, security sources said. **********Israeli tanks tried to advance on Palestinian positions and refugee camps just south of Beirut International Airport and along the coastal highway leading from Ouzai to Beirut. Israelis Reach Terminal Building **********The Israeli armored units, which were already in control of the airport runways, managed to drive on the runways into the terminal building and a short distance down the road leading toward the city.  This left them only a few hundred yards from the biggest Palestinian refugee camp in west Beirut, Burj al Brajneh. **********But according to Palestinian sources and the state-run Beirut radio, the guerrillas were able to keep a toehold in the airport area and blocked the Israeli advance from Ouzai toward Beirut. **********Lebanon's President, Elias Sarkis, was quoted by the Beirut radio as remarking that the large-scale Israeli raid had come ''at a time when negotiations for the evacuation of the guerrillas were moving ahead.'' **********A three-way meeting had been scheduled for today between Palestinian, Lebanese and, indirectly, American officials, to discuss a timetable for withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization fighters from west Beirut. The meeting was canceled, but Mr. Habib told Lebanese officials he hoped to reschedule the talks for Monday. **********P.L.O. officials said they believed that the Israeli raid had been intended to put more pressure on them to pull out from west Beirut unconditionally and immediately and that it reflected Israel's frustration at not having been able so far to obtain a withdrawal. **********The officials said that while they wanted the negotiations to go forward, the Palestinians had proved their ability to stand up to the Israelis and would continue to stick to their demands for what they consider an honorable withdrawal from west Beirut, preceded by a disengagement of forces and deployment of international peacekeeping troops. **********While the fighting raged around the airport, Israeli gunboats and artillery bombarded wide areas of west Beirut containing no guerrillas or even Palestinians, leaving whole neighborhoods devastated. **********So many buildings were set on fire in the southern suburbs of west Beirut that the entire area was engulfed in a huge black cloud of smoke through which not a single building could be made out. By late afternoon the sky, which had been perfectly clear, was full of black and white clouds. **********The Beirut radio said that at least 50,000 Israeli shells landed on west Beirut. The P.L.O. press agency said that Israeli fighterbombers had flown more than 165 sorties in a daylong wave of divebombing raids on Palestinian camps, gun positions and residential areas. **********P.L.O. officials were jubilant over the ability they said their fighters had shown to hold off the advance by Israeli tanks in a bitter firefight. Lebanese Angry at U.S. **********Lebanese Government officials involved in the negotiations with Mr. Habib over a guerrilla withdrawal are growing increasingly exasperated with what they describe as the Reagan Administration's inability to exert any pressure or control on the Israelis, even on so small an issue as getting the water supply for west Beirut turned on again. **********''The tail is wagging the dog and has been from the start,'' said Saeb Salam, the former Lebanese Prime Minister who has become the main intermediary between Yasir Arafat, the head of the P.L.O., and Mr. Habib. Mr. Salam gave as an example today's efforts to arrange a cease-fire. **********''I started calling Habib at 8 A.M. asking for a cease-fire,'' said Mr. Salam. ''I had Hani al-Hassan of the P.L.O. with me at the house all afternoon and they were ready anytime. Habib called me back and said he had a provisional agreement from Israel for a 2:30 P.M.  cease-fire. Then he called me back and said that wouldn't work; how about 3 P.M.? I said 'O.K.' Just before 3 P.M. he said it would have to be 3:30. Finally he called back and said the Israelis would agree to a cease-fire at 5 for certain, so it was 5 P.M.'' **********Mr. Salam described Mr. Habib as ''rather embarrassed on the phone'' at his inability to get the Israelis to agree to a ceasefire on a day when crucial negotiations had been planned with Mr. Habib himself. **********The Israeli attack on west Beirut began at 3 A.M. when Israeli tanks, moving down from around Shuweifat and the southern end of the eastern and western runways of the Beirut airport, began pushing toward the Palestinian refugee camps. **********Another group of Israeli armored personnel carriers and tanks tried driving through the Palestinians' front lines at Ouzai. The Ouzai attack, according to Palestinian military sources, was completely halted. **********In the airport, however, the Israelis were able to move into the terminal area and down the road a few hundred yards toward the Cocodi traffic circle, where they were halted by a combined force of Palestinian guerrillas, Syrian troops and Shiite militiamen fighting alongside the Palestinians. The Syrians were members of a Syrian force that had controlled the Cocodi area - a former amusement park near the airport - and who had remained in Beirut. **********A Palestinian military official said the guerrillas had used three main tactics to hold the Israelis back.  First, they kept up a steady barrage of ''area fire'' from their Katyusha rocket launchers on the Israeli armored units moving through the open ground around the airport. The official conceded that the effect of the Katyushas was negated somewhat by the fact that Israeli planes kept trying to knock them out all day, and consequently they had to be fired from the more protected built-up areas, which made accurate aiming difficult. Artillery Fire Concentrated **********Second, the guerrillas concentrated heavy 130-millimeter fire on the advancing columns. The 130-millimeter artillery pieces, the Palestinians' largest, still have not been destroyed by the Israeli planes. **********Finally, and most effectively, the official said, the guerrillas let the Israelis approach to within short range of their rocketpropelled grenades, RPG-7's, which they said were very effective in close-quarter fighting. **********The Palestinian press agency, Wafa, said that more than 80 Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in the airport battle and that 30 Israeli armored personnel carriers, tanks and other vehicles were knocked out. **********Israeli gunboats, which bombarded the west Beirut coastline, approached close to the shore near the Ramlet el Baida beach but came under heavy fire and made no attempt to land troops. **********Apparently as a diversionary tactic, the Israelis also opened up with tank and artillery fire at the Museum and Galare Saman crossing points between east and west Beirut. At least 10 civilians were killed in Christian east Beirut when the guerrillas returned the fire, security sources said. **********It was west Beirut, however, that bore the brunt of the destruction. Hundreds of buildings throughout the southern suburbs of Fakhani, Bir Hassan and Corniche Mazraa, not to mention the Palestinian refugee camps, were pockmarked with shell holes, gutted by fire, riddled with shrapnel or completely destroyed. **********A drive through Fakhani and the Corniche Mazraa thoroughfare found buildings with their balconies torn loose and left dangling, their windows blown out and gaping holes in their walls. One building, with most of the facade blown away, looked like a big doll's house, with all the bedrooms and living rooms open to view."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/17/business/company-news-heublein-backed-on-general-cinema.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Heublein Backed On General Cinema", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Heublein Backed On General Cinema", "body_text": " **********A Federal court order cleared the way today for Heublein Inc., the international food and beverage company, to buy more stock in the General Cinema Corporation.

Fernando Berios, two days ago. **********The Health Minister, a close associate of Mr. d'Aubuisson, had reportedly privately criticized the President and let it be known that he favored Mr. d'Aubuisson for the presidential post. **********On Thursday Miguel Muyshondt, another minister from Mr.  d'Aubuisson's party, which is known by its Spanish acronym, Arena, was embarrassed when all 8,000 employees of the Ministry of Agriculture walked out demanding higher wages. The employees of the Government tourist agency, which is also headed by an Arena member, have said they will join the work stoppage on Monday. **********The strike, though banned by a two-year-old decree, is the largest of its kind in recent Salvadoran history. The main movers behind the walkout, according to one member of the Government, are the opposition Christian Democratic Party. The party leadership, the sources said, is seeking to promote social pressure against the Arena forces who oppose the moderate economic and social changes on which the continuation of vast United States military and economic aid hinge. 200 Peasants Demonstrate **********Moreover, a group of 200 peasants demonstrated in the town of Santa Tecla, near the capital, last Wednesday denouncing the ''halting of the agrarian reform'' efforts and ''the corruption'' among officials involved in the program. **********Although a shakeup in the armed forces on Nov. 8 has been officially described here as a ''routine rotation,'' diplomats said the shift of seven top commanders also involved ''questions of loyalty'' to the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, who supports the United States. **********One diplomat here said that doubts had been raised about the loyalty of Col. Nicolas Carranza, now moved from the politically sensitive state communications agency, where he had security responsibility. to the Government electricity company. The army high command, according to this diplomat, believes that information intercepted by the agency was ''being provided to people other than Government officials.'' Colonel Carranza is close to Mr. d'Aubuisson, who proposed him as president of the nation after the March elections. **********Diplomats familiar with the inner workings of the Government here also said that in August and September military officers close to Mr. d'Aubuisson, a former major in the national guard, had tried to gather enough support among the officer corps to vote General Garcia out of office. One well-placed diplomat said that ''these were weeks of tension and pushing and shoving'' among the military. ''They got some votes against Garcia, but remained quite short,'' he said. ''If they have succeeded it would have been a democratic coup.'' **********Since then in Salvadoran political circles there has been much comment about tensions between General Garcia and Mr. d'Aubuisson. 'Absolutely No Differences' **********In an interview today Mr. d'Aubuisson denied these reports, saying there were ''absolutely no differences'' between him and the Defense Minister. He said that the report about an attempt to gather votes against General Garcia was ''absolutely untrue.'' This and the ''many other rumors spread against me,'' he said, are part of a campaign ''to discredit me.'' **********''On the contrary, I have seen a lot of companionship these days in the security forces,'' he said.  He also dismissed as ''rumor'' the maneuvers by his political opponents to weaken his power in the Constituent Assembly. Although the army high command and the United States Embassy are the determining factors in Salvadoran politics, the assembly is important because it is the scene of intense political bickering as a new constitution is being written. **********Sources close to the President's office said that one maneuver being planned by the Christian Democratic leadership was to vote Mr.  d'Aubuisson out of his assembly post.

The Bureau of National Affairs reports that hiring projections for the first quarter of 1983 are the lowest recorded since it began to survey employers on the job outlook in 1974. Its new survey finds that only 9 percent of the employers who responded plan an increase in their production work forces in the first quarter of the new year. If anything, the survey results were biased on the optimistic side, since only companies still in business could respond. **********Interpreting Mr. Reagan's proposal, Edwin Meese 3d, the President's counselor, said: ''This may really involve in some cases not letting someone go that they might have to, by staggering work hours or something like that. That's what the President is talking about.'' **********But businesses, struggling to survive, are trying to put their balance sheets in better shape by cutting payrolls. The Bureau of National Affairs finds the proportion of companies with workers on layoff at a record level, with layoffs more common among employers with fewer than 1,000 workers than among larger companies. While the pain may be more widespread in small businesses, it may be more intense in heavy industry. Nearly half of the steel industry's 450,000 workers have been laid off, probably half of them permanently. **********Clearly Mr. Reagan found the simplicity of his hire-one-worker proposal appealing, because, he said, ''There are more businesses in the United States than unemployed.'' According to the Census, in 1977, the last year for which data are available, there were 14.7 million businesses in the United States, and last month there were less than 12 million unemployed workers. But 11.3 million of the businesses were proprietorships, most of which have no or few employees. **********For Mr. Reagan, it is not just a question of numbers, which are not his strong point, but the ''neighborly spirit'' of the thing. He seems to see unemployment as what economists call a ''microeconomic'' problem, in which every individual and business can solve the problem on his, her or its own initiative. Solutions involving Government are decried as ''quick fixes.'' **********A reporter last week reminded Mr. Reagan that he had spoken on various occasions of his father's losing his job during the Christmas holidays during the Great Depression, and asked the President what he thought his father's and mother's reactions would have been if the Congress of that period had passed a $5 billion bill ''that would have gotten him back to work right away when you were little.'' **********Mr. Reagan replied, ''Well, I've always thought my father, God rest his soul, had the common sense that he would know that temporary fixes wouldn't work.'' **********But when his father finally did get a job, Mr. Reagan added, ''it happened to be for the government.'' He and the county supervisor of the poor, the President said, ''shared a secretary and were in charge of the help - they called it relief in those days - for the people in our community.'' **********Yet his father believed in free private enterprise. He went around town, Mr. Reagan said, lining up private jobs for the unemployed, who would come into his office and say: ''When is it going to be my turn? When do you get to my name again? It's been a long time since I've had some work.'' **********''And guess what?'' the President asked rhetorically. ''The Federal Government then intervened and figured it out that they couldn't take that work, because if they took that work they were denied relief. **********''So they were forced onto permanent relief,'' he said. ''They couldn't work.'' **********However, when President Reagan took office, a person on welfare - Aid to Families with Dependent Children - could keep $30 plus onethird of his or her earnings without loss of welfare benefits.  That provision, ironically enough, was knocked out by the celebrated tax act of 1981, which made earnings from work by a welfare recipient subject to taxation at a 100 percent rate. **********Unemployment certainly has its ''micro'' as well as its ''macro'' aspects. But the big determinant of employment and unemployment is the course of the national economy. The decline of gross national product at an estimated annual rate of 2.2 percent in the final quarter of 1982 almost certainly means higher unemployment, no matter how much neighborly spirit businesses may feel. There is simply no substitute for effective monetary and fiscal policies to get the economy growing more strongly again, to get unemployment down."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/business/gte-income-climbs-13.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GTE Income Climbs 13.8%", "print_headline": "GTE Income Climbs 13.8%", "body_text": " **********The GTE Corporation, citing increased revenues in its telephone operations, said its third-quarter net income rose 13.8 percent, to $199.1 million, or $1.11 a share, from $175 million, or $1.03 a share, in the similar period last year. **********GTE, the nation's second-largest phone company after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said its revenues rose more than 9.2 percent, to $2.98 billion, from $2.73 billion. **********The company said that telephone rate increases were a major factor in improved telephone operation revenues and net income.

What will this new fad be? A good guess is that the ''Flat T axers'' will replace the ''Supply Siders'' on the hit parade of e conomic slogans. **********In the next few months, of course, the debate about taxes will revolve around finding the economic equivalent of a perpetual motion machine: A tax measure that stimulates the economy without raising the deficit. **********The net effect of the two most current tax proposals - the gasoline tax cum road building program and moving up the 1983 tax cut - is unclear but will probably raise both the deficit and unemployment in early 1983. **********Whatever the merits of current proposals, the long-term question about the fundamental structure of our tax system will surely reemerge next year, and the flat tax will be one of the leading proposals. **********In preparation for this assault on the nation's coffers and common sense, the following is a quick review of the forces.  The ''flat tax'' represents a complete overhaul of personal and business income taxation, replacing the current system of graduated tax rates with a single uniform tax rate applicable to all income. **********Although there are numerous half-baked flat-tax plans, the most sophisticated version, and the one I will use as a model, has been elaborated by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, economists from Stanford University. **********The Hall-Rabushka proposal has four features. First, all businesstype income (rents, profits, etc.) is taxed as it flows through companies and partnerships and is completely excluded from personal income taxes. Second, the personal tax system includes all labor income (including fringe benefits) and disallows all deductions. Third, all capital gains and losses are excluded from income at every level. Finally, all business and personal income (above exemptions for individuals) is subject to a uniform 19 percent tax. **********Discussions of a flat tax, and comparison with the current tax system, generally focus on issues of the breadth of the tax system, incentives, simplification and distribution. **********Breadth of the tax system. The most important and politically most problematic feature of the flat tax would be to include in taxable income a wide variety of sources of income that are currently sheltered from taxes. For example, a comprehensive flat tax would not allow deductions or exclusions for interest, for state and local taxes on home mortgages, for charitable contributions, or for fringe benefits. The flat tax proposal would also tax income currently buried in the underground economy - items like baby sitters' wages or under-the-counter plumbing jobs - an idea that is more fantasy then reality. **********Incentives. The second key feature of the flat tax is the contention that lower tax rates will provide the incentive for people to work harder, save more and innovate faster. Including both business and personal taxes, income today is taxed at rates anywhere from zero to 75 percent. And there is little doubt that high tax rates, say from 50 percent on up, induce tax avoidance or may simply discourage work or savings. **********By lowering average marginal tax rates from the current 30 percent range to 19 percent, flat taxers argue that there will be an explosion of work effort and innovation. Mr. Hall and Mr. Rambushka estimate, for example, that the gross national product will be 9 percent, or $270 billion, higher than otherwise at the end of the decade following the implementation of their proposal. Impressive if true, but don't bet on it.SIMPLIFICATION. One of the major arguments of flat taxers is that i t will simplify the systems. The Hall-Rabuska proposal provides a v ery innovative way to simplify business taxes. **********As concerns the personal tax, it is simply incorrect that the flat tax will itself allow an enormous simplification. Many complexities arise from requirements for verification or from the need to differentiate between different types of income, not from the graduated tax structure. **********Base broadening might allow some simplification (thus, the tedious capital gains calculation could be eliminated). On the other hand, some base broadening (including the value of fringes and free meals in income, or documenting baby sitters' wages) would add considerable complexity. But replacing the broad-based graduated personal tax with a flat tax generates no simplicity - it merely facilitates the arithmetic. **********Distribution. As Mr. Hall and Mr. Rabushka admit with charming candor when discussing effects on income distribution, ''Now for the bad news.'' This Strangelovable comment is reminiscent of the mythical American general advocating bombing the Russians into the stone age. After describing the Soviet wasteland, he adds, ''Now for the bad news - New York will be a pile of rubble.'' **********The main bad news about the flat tax, then, is that it would lead to a wholesale redistribution of after-tax income from middle income groups to the rich. As shown in the accompanying table, those with incomes below $50,000 would find themselves paying higher taxes, while those above that point would receive tax reductions, huge ones at the top. **********Those at the very high end, with incomes of $1 million or more, might well begin to salivate in anticipation of a reduction of almost three-quarters of their 1984 taxes and an increase in their after-tax income of 45 percent. By contrast, a family with $25,000 of income will see its taxes rise 18 percent. **********In reviewing these considerations, what is a reasonable way to weigh the competing arguments on the flat tax?  The first point is that the central objective of tax reform should be to broaden the tax base. By eliminating special tax treatment - such as for charitable contributions, homeowning, saving and medical care - tax rates can be lowered considerably on normal occupations and investments. Base broadening will also promote simplification by removing the requirement to separate different categories of income or consumption. **********Second, once the base is broadened, the further gain in simplification or incentives from a flat rate is highly uncertain.  There is no professional consensus on the boost our economy will receive from lower tax rates, with estimates ranging from nil at the low end, to the Hall-Rabushka estimates at the high end. Today's economic malaise has many roots, but progressive taxation is surely not the major contributor to the decline of the West. **********In the end, then, the decision to move from a graduated to a flat tax must rest on a value judgment -whether we find progressive taxation just, and whether the uncertain costs of high tax rates are too high a price to pay for the equality we receive. **********In my view, the political benefits from perceived fairness and justice of a progressive tax system are far too important to be sacrificed for the small and conjectural increase in material well being proffered by the flat taxers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/business/advertising-chattem-consolidates-business-at-marschalk.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chattem Consolidates Business at Marschalk", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Chattem Consolidates Business at Marschalk", "body_text": " **********Marschalk, one of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is picking up some $8 million in billings from Chattem Consumer Products, part of Chattem Inc. of Chattanooga, Tenn. **********The assignment follows a decision by the client - under its new vice president and general manager, Robin D.

Now they can expect a spurt in corporate profits. **********In 1983, after-tax profits may be up as much as 15 percent, following a 15 percent decline in 1982. Moreover, it is likely that per- share earnings for the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 of the nation's premier blue-chip companies will jump 26 percent or so, to $120 in 1983.

There are several ways to go. The investor can ride the ''cyclical'' roller coaster, buying shares of companies whose profits rise and fall with the economy. Or he can climb aboard the ''cyclical growth'' train, buyings stocks of companies whose profits advance from recession setbacks to successively higher levels with each economic expansion. **********Other investors will fly the ''classic growth'' airliner, those companies offering a reasonably certain 10 to 15 percent growth in earnings each year. Or the investor can embark on the rocket of ''high growth'' and pray the mission is not aborted. **********Cyclical Stocks **********A modestly advancing economy may do little for the profits of cyclical companies and even less for their shares. Leon Cooperman, market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, wrote in September that a broadbased commitment to cyclicals was ''premature'' and added that evidence of an economic recovery was important before investors took the plunge. In whatever cyclical area, the strongest companies are, of course, safest. **********In the transportation group, highly leveraged airlines have been a favorite trading vehicle in the past.

Lower interest rates reduce the cost of carrying their heavy debt. Those ameliorative factors could provide dramatic changes in profitability with only modest revenue gains.  Delta is a perennial favorite among major carriers. The regionals Southwest and Frontier are favored by Wall Street. **********Automobile companies are considered by many to be among the best of all cyclicals since their fortunes are tied to the brightening outlook for increasing consumer spending. For months now, Wall Street has been recommending shares of both General Motors and Ford, and their shares have already risen sharply. **********Chrysler, which may be coming back from the brink of bankruptcy, is considered an interesting speculation. Chrysler's break-even point has been dramatically lowered so that relatively small gains in revenue would bring sharp gains in profit. Peter Lynch, portfolio manager for the top-rated Fidelity Magellan Fund, considers Chrysler to be one of the most attractive cyclical plays. He is especially impressed with the company's $1 billion cash trove. The stock has more than doubled this year, however. **********The near-term outlook for capital goods companies is less clear.  Deere and Sundstrand could excel. James R. McCann, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, cites Sundstrand's leadership position and a proven ability to gain market share. But he recently reduced the stock from a buy to a hold for the near term after paring his current earnings estimate. He still favors the shares for the long term. Wall Street analysts had been expecting $3.75 a share this year, which would be the first drop in a decade, reflecting weak power transmission and commercial aerospace orders. **********Railroad shares, long-favored by the investment community as natural resource plays because of large holdings of mineral-bearing lands, are, generally speaking, believed to be relatively unattractive holdings in the present disinflationary environment.  Robert Long, who follows the rails for the First Boston Corporation, believes the most leveraged carriers should do well in a modest economic recovery. **********The steel industry, the essense of so-called smokestack America and the very backbone of industrial production, is deeply troubled today. James Lack, a Boston-based financial consultant, says that careful analysis of steel company income statements and balance sheets indicates that on an inflation-adjusted basis some steel companies do not operate profitably, even in good times. **********He said: ''I agree with the analysts who charge that long-term borrowings are being used to pay dividends in some instances. Perhaps the most telling comment about the industry came with U.S. Steel's acquisition of Marathon Oil. That was clearly a decision by management to reduce drastically its dependence on steel.'' **********Major chemical companies are part of smokestack America and so need a recovery of major proportions for enhanced profitability. Current modest growth prospects may not bring them major market gains. **********Richard A. Derbes of Oppenheimer & Company says that a lot of companies with exposure in autos and housing may do well since ''we expect major jumps in production even though, historically, the numbers may be small.'' He adds: ''We've been recommending PPG Industries, which is certainly a cyclical. But two-thirds of PPG's sales relate to autos and housing.'' **********Housing starts are expected to reach 1.6 million units annually by 1984, up from about a million units in 1982, reflecting lower mortgage rates and heavy pent-up demand. If the rates stay down, there could be major growth in the housing and building materials markets. But it is probably too early to seek share gains here. **********Home builders will be a more direct beneficiary of improving trends. The well-financed Ryland Group and Ryan Homes are being talked about. **********Specialty companies such as Standard Brands Paint and Lowe's Companies, a 231-unit retail building materials concern, are widely mentioned. But Jim Walter, Owens-Corning Fiberglas and Armstrong World Industries, all troubled with asbestos-related litigation, remain out of favor. **********On the other hand, savings and loan stocks, which will benefit in any developing housing boom, have already moved up sharply -as much as 200 percent, says Jerome Baron, who follows the group for First Boston. He is looking for further advances based on the expectation of continued moderate interest rates through 1984. **********Retail companies, expected to be early beneficiaries of a pickup in consumer spending, have advanced sharply. Federated Department Stores and J.C. Penney are called quality long-term commitments. Wal-Mart is growing faster than other discount chains. Toys 'R' Us is a standout specialty chain. Revco Drug and Rite Aid are being written up among drugstore companies. **********Utility companies have benefited from disinflation and lower interest rates. American Telephone and Telegraph, soon to be a former utility, is favored as it prepares to spin off operating companies while retaining its highly regarded Western Electric technology and Bell Laboratories. **********Cyclical Growth Stocks **********The rising profits offered by cyclical growth companies in successive economic recoveries make them continually popular.  Broadcasters lead the cyclical growth companies because their airwave franchises produce high cash flow. These companies usually commit limited sums to capital expenditure since it is not necessary to make constant additions to plant. Moreover, broadcast asset values tend to grow at rates well in excess of inflation. **********Capital Cities Communications, Cox Broadcasting, LIN Broadcasting and Storer Broadcasting have been successful and have good prospects.  Storer and Cox are heavy participants in cable television, whose long-term prospects are bright. Meanwhile, they are spending heavily on wiring within their separate cable franchises. **********Some cyclical growth issues combine both airwave and newspaper franchises. Among these are Gannett, Harte-Hanks Communications and Knight-Ridder Newspapers. Edward Dunleavy of Salomon Brothers has had a buy recommendation on Gannett for a year. He believes U.S.A. Today, the chain's new national daily newspaper, is somewhat risky. But he thinks management ''has the discipline'' to discontinue U.S.A. Today if it is not successful. ''Early results are favorable,'' he said, ''but it's too soon to say if it will succeed.'' **********Natural resource companies, once a favorite inflation hedge, have fallen victim to moderating price increases. Companies with large timber holdings were highly valued by investors as recently as 18 months ago. Everyone thought timber would continue to appreciate because of the scarcity factor. Now that inflation has eased, such holdings could lag. **********But Chad E. Brown of Kidder, Peabody notes that both Weyerhaeuser and Georgia-Pacific have done well in the bull market. He believes they will continue to do so if interest rates keep coming down since the housing outlook will be improved. Georgia-Pacific's new management has cut the dividend, ''an indication of a more conservative outlook on housing,'' Mr. Brown said. On balance, he added, ''that's a favorable development.'' **********Inflation comments apply to oil shares, too. Many oil stocks produced tenfold gains and more after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised the price of oil by a factor of 10 in the 1970's. Performance in the last 18 months, during a period of temporary oil glut, has been dismal. It is the rare oil company that has Wall Street's blessing today. **********Still, Shell Oil has its fans, as does Standard Oil (Indiana). Both have substantial reserves, heavy cash flow and good refining capability. Analysts have little enthusiasm for the international oils for now. **********Gas production companies have considerable gas on hand. It is widely assumed the excess will not be worked off until 1984. Oil service companies may not impress investors for many months to come.  Halliburton and Schlumberger, old favorites, have lost popularity. **********In the lodging industry, shares have rallied sharply and modest economic growth means further gains could be difficult. La Quinta Motor Inns, a San Antonio-based chain, sold at 20 times earnings recently. Analysts are impressed with its five-year annual profit growth of 27 percent. **********President Reagan's reluctance to cut back on planned defense spending increases is a plus for investors in se-lected defense shares. Analysts emphasize electronic specialists such as Loral and Tracor. Among major contractors, Boeing may be suspect due to dependence on weak commercial airline orders. **********The recent upswing in Atlantic City casino profitability has focused attention once again on gaming industry shares after two years in a stock market backwater. Golden Nugget is considered a well-managed casino company since it produces the industry's best profit margins. **********In the fast food area, Steven A. Rockwell of Alex. Brown & Company says the group outperformed the market in 1982 but underperformed it in the summer rally. **********''The reason the stocks have done well this year is the disinflation scenario that brings down food costs and controls labor costs,'' he said. ''Both these developments help margins. On the sales side, disinflation means more disposable income and greater demand for fast food restaurants.'' So far, there has been no increase in sales, he added. But he expects the sales to pick up sometime during 1983, and that could well carry the stocks higher, he concluded. **********In the service company sector, A.C. Nielsen has been regarded as a quality holding. Its prospects for continued success reflect the company's dominant market position in the field of television ratings. **********The financial services sector ranks among the most promising industry groups. Many believe these issues will move out of the cyclical growth category to become classic growth companies in this decade. **********Analysts are beginning to focus on insurance, bank and brokerage companies as potential market leaders. The few remaining independent brokerage firms are expected to get careful scrutiny as possible takeovers in the years ahead. **********In insurance, the Kemper Corporation, a casualty insurance company, has become a financial services supermarket with the recent acquisition of Prescott, Bell & Turben, and Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, stockbrokers. Aetna and Travelers, among multiple-line companies, are in many institutional portfolios. Jefferson-Pilot and U.S. Life are leaders among life insurers. **********Shearson/American Express, Sears, Roebuck and Transamerica have become diversified financial service companies and get Wall Street attention. **********Banks are benefiting from an improved interest-rate environment but are suspect due to concerns over credit quality. Earlier weakness in some bank shares reflected concern over Mexico's possible default on loans from United States banks and other troubling international financial developments. **********Citicorp and Morgan are said to be quality major bank holdings. The regional Sun Belt banks, particularly those in Florida and Texas, get the most attention in view of their impressive growth potential.  Barnett Banks of Florida and Texas Commerce are analyst choices, as is Valley National of Phoenix, Ariz. **********Classic Growth Stocks **********The so-called nifty fifty growth stocks dominated institutional portfolios in the 1960's and early 1970's. For years, these shares carried excessive price/earnings multiples. The high multiples persisted long after the general market slumped in 1970 and 1971. But in 1973 and 1974, most of these isssues were dumped by institutions.  One disappointing quarter was enough to start the move. **********For almost a decade, these classic growth issues have taken a back seat as institutions have focused on smaller high-growth companies.  But the Nifty Fifty are beginning to find favor again. Many believe large-capitalization growth issues will be market leaders all this decade. **********The Nifty Fifty's fall from favor reflected the realization by institutions that these companies could not in fact control their own destinies. They could not continue to post 15 percent earnings growth no matter what the economic environment, the institutions concluded. **********The oil crisis proved this point emphatically. Raw material costs soared and profit margins were squeezed for such stalwarts as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Procter & Gamble, Eastman Kodak and Merck. Their shares were heavily sold. **********But these enterprises have adjusted. They have dif-ferent cost structures now, but new products and methods have restored growth.  P.& G., whose margins dropped in part due to higher raw material costs following the oil crisis, has introduced new products and has adjusted pricing to cover its added raw material costs. Recently, its return on equity has rebounded along with profits. **********In the beverage sector, Coca-Cola is the choice. But its acquisition of Columbia Pictures last June dismayed fans who liked Coca-Cola as a pure play in the highly profitable beverage business, which Coke dominates. The company's 1983 earnings are expected to rise 12 percent. **********Drug companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, American Home Products and SmithKline Beckman, offer classic growth opportunities.  Hospital supply and hospital management began doing exceptionally well with increased government emphasis on medical services years ago. Johnson & Johnson, despite the Tylenol setback, remains a leader and is expected to regain earnings momentum quickly. Similarly, American Hospital Supply and Baxter Travenol offer solid growth prospects. **********International Business Machines, the industry leader in mainframe computers, has recovered its glamour image with institutional investors to a degree. That reflects in part its accelerating earnings growth. But this is a short-term factor. I.B.M. is so big that its fortunes these days have become more reflective of the economy. **********The mainframe computer business is becoming a mature industry and market saturation is approaching. Moreover, minicomputers from such aggressive manufacturers as Digital Equipment and microcomputers from Intel and others are so powerful these days that they are chipping away at I.B.M.'s bread-and-butter mainframe market. **********Two companies dominate in the entertainment and leisure area: Warner Communications and Walt Disney Productions. Warner has become a diversified entertainment company whose acquisition of Atari in 1976 added spectacularly to earnings. Disney is no longer in the high growth phase of the 1960's and 1970's but has solid prospects for satisfying earnings gains. **********High Growth Stocks **********No sector of the stock market is so appealing, so seductive, so fraught with peril yet so full of promise as the high growth area.  High growth is virtually synonymous with high technology though an occasional company without it offers the hoped-for 25 percent annual growth. **********Microprocessors, computer software, telecommunications, robotics, biotechnology and medical technology are major areas of high growth.  Companies that offer smaller computer systems with specialized applications often excell. NBI, a word processing company based in Denver, has shown 40 percent annual earnings growth over five years.  Tandem, known for durable terminals, has had five-year average growth of 45 percent a year. The older Wang Laboratories has provided 35 percent annual earnings growth, and Computervision, a computer graphics leader, has done well. **********After serious market setbacks last year and early this year, these and many other high-technology companies have roared back and are believed to be richly priced by those who fear high growth will falter. **********The telecommications sector offers MCI and Mitel, which have muchrooming sales and earnings.  Genentech, though public, has not fully emerged from the developmental stage. Its modest profits to date represent consulting income and not earnings arising out of its gene-splicing efforts. At present, Genentech, has not produced earnings growth, much less the 25 percent growth expected by investors in the high growth area.  However, the approval of Humulin, an insulin derived from human sources, may begin a flow of profits that could be impressive over time. Eli Lilly is marketing the new substance, and Genentech earns royalties. **********Investors monitor these and other technology companies carefully.  Competition arrives quickly and can change prospects dramatically.  BESIDES PROVIDING Wall Street with ample opportunities for investment, the computer age enables analysts and money managers to sift through a myriad of data on thousands of companies in search of only those stocks that meet certain investment criteria. Considering the speed with which this can be done and the varied combinations of criteria that can be fed into a computer, it is no wonder that the so-called bargain stocks do not remain undiscovered for long and that Wall Street is called an efficient market place. **********In pursuit of value, for instance, an analyst might ask the computer to screen out those stocks that are selling at a price below their equity, or book, value per share. Since equity is what remains after a company's liabilities are subtracted from its assets, this measure indicates which stocks are good buys based on their company's current net worth. **********To narrow that list of stocks even further, the analyst might ask the computer to screen out only those that also have most recently shown earnings high enough to result in a return on equity of at least a certain percentage. **********The four stock tables in this section are based on screens that answer some of the most topical investment questions of the day. One focused on earnings growth. Another sought out stocks with the strongest dividend growth. A third screen concentrated on stocks with low price/earnings ratios. And the fourth culled out the stocks that have been the best performers for the year to date. **********The tables were compiled by Media General Financial Services, a diversified communications company, from its data base of 3,800 companies listed on the New York and American Stock Exchanges or traded over the counter. Stocks trading for $1 or less were not included in the screenings. Trading prices are taken from the closing of Nov. 17, and the published lists include only the top performers in any given category. **********Investors should not purchase a stock just because it is listed on one of these tables, however. Far more analysis is required and an investor should consult his broker. The computer screens merely narrow the field when certain standards are set. The data by which the stocks are selected is, by necessity, historical. Current earnings and financial data that have yet to be reported may have taken a turn for the worse. An investor should ask, for instance, why a stock is trading at a relatively low level. **********The first table (Page 37) lists the stocks with the most impressive earnings growth in recent years. Many investors favor such stocks on the theory that if history repeats itself they will be ahead of the game. To be named, a stock first had to show positive and increasing earnings for the last five years. **********It also had to have an average annual growth rate for that period of at least 20 percent. In addition, all the stocks listed had to have a profit margin on sales of at least 10 percent and an aboveaverage return on equity of at least 13.5 percent for the last 12 months. **********To a large portion of the market, though, earnings growth is only important if it insures rising dividends. That is why Table 2 (Page 38) places its emphasis on stocks with the highest annual dividend growth rate in the last five years. To be included, the dividend growth must have been consistently positive for each of the last five years and the latest annual dividend has to offer at least a 5 percent yield on the current trading price. To monitor earnings strength of these high-dividend stocks, the rate of return on the latest 12-month earnings is also included. **********For those investors who like the best of both worlds, high returns and low prices, there is Table 3 (Page 46). Here, the first priority was to search for stocks with an above-average return on equity of at least 13.5 percent for the last 12-month reporting period. In the period of disinflation and relatively slow economic growth that is predicted, an historically high return on equity is important because it shows a company is productive and can make the most of what it has. Beyond that, a dividend yield of at least 5 percent was specified. This was aimed at insuring an investor a tangible return on his investment while he waits for the stock's price to appreciate. **********Also requested as measures of value for Table 3 were a trading price of no more than 80 percent of common equity and a price/earnings ratio (trading price to latest 12-month earnings per share) that is equal to or less than the average 8.8 of large stocks listed on the Big Board. Since the price-earnings ratio is actually a reflection of investors' perception of future earnings growth, a relatively low ratio signals that either the market is not expecting earnings growth to at best be average or it has not fully recognized the company's potential. **********The goal, of course, is to end up with a winning stock, such as those found on Table 4 (Page 50). The stocks listed there have scored the best performance for the year to date. While some investors like to climb aboard the biggest gainers and hope they continue to outperform the market, there are not many money managers who have stayed at the top of the charts by investing that way. Even if earnings prospects are still bright, the question that must be asked is whether the market has already discounted that growth. If so, a stock's best days may be behind it. Fred R.

The large 1981-82 crop is rolling headlong into a market made sluggish by high interest rates and slack consumer buying. As a result, prices have plunged well below the break-even point, and the coming season for farmers looks even worse. **********''I'm negative right now,'' said Fred L. Starrh, general manager and one of seven partners in SVG Farms Inc., a major cotton producer in the San Joaquin Valley. **********In the main, many Western growers suffered heavy losses last year and face a particularly difficult time this year because they are heading into a new planting more deeply in debt. **********''Their general economic condition is pretty lousy,'' said Gene Lundquist, a vice president of Calcot Ltd., the cotton marketing organization that sold 2.3 million bales of cotton last year for its 3,800 members. There are 480 pounds to a standard bale. **********The Reagan Administration's answer to the cotton growers' plight is to have them pare their cotton acreage by 15 percent next season to qualify for farm subsidies. The idea is that a smaller cotton crop would reverse the price drop. **********Mr. Starrh said that the acreage cut made sense for farmers in Texas and the Southeast, where few bills are run up on idle land, largely because they do not have the cost of irrigation. He said, however, that he would not comply with the acreage plan, even though it could bring him $50,000, the maximum subsidy. **********Mr. Starrh said he would lose more by leaving the land idle than by growing cotton and selling it at depressed prices. **********Most Western farms, like SVG, are large and highly mechanized.  Moreover, irrigation has transformed the desert, which surrounds SVG's 7,000 acres, into the world's richest cotton fields. The annual cost of that lush soil for SVG is about $300 an acre, whether it is farmed or not, Mr. Starrh said. **********SVG Farms (the name is taken from its original activity, Shafter Vegetable Growers) averaged more than 1,100 pounds of cotton an acre on 4,000 acres last year, more than double the national average, which was just shy of a record at 545 pounds an acre. **********The farm turned away from vegetables to cotton, alfalfa, hay, wheat and almonds because prices for those crops were more attractive throughout most of the last decade. Drought Aided Prices **********SVG ''just about broke even'' on $5.1 million in crop revenue last year, Mr. Starrh said. That was after two profitable years, when drought narrowed the harvest elsewhere and cotton prices reached 92.5 cents a pound. **********In general, California cotton growers need about 73 cents a pound to cover their costs. With the current price mired at around 62 cents, and December futures pegged at 72 cents, growers would be happy to slash their new cotton planting in favor of crops that have a more favorable price outlook. **********But such crops are difficult to find. ''The whole commodity price complex is in the doldrums,'' Mr. Starrh said. ''We may have a slight reduction, but our cotton planting is going to be about the same.  What are the alternatives?'' Mr. Starrh placed part of the blame for agriculture's tailspin on the Federal R eserve Board's monetary policy, which he believes contributed t o high interest rates, and on the State Department for foiling effor ts by American farmers to develop export markets, including tho se in Soviet bloc countries. **********''I don't understand how we can continue to be used as a major weapon in international diplomacy and have our markets disrupted as they have been,'' Mr. Starrh said. Pondering the weak commodity prices, he added in disgust, ''The basic solution now is for somebody else to have a disaster.'' Long-Term Outlook Hopeful **********Despite low prices and anxious times, long-term patterns look good for cotton. Consumers are buying more cotton clothing and linens, compared with synthetic fibers, due in part to the introduction of no-iron, all-cotton shirts and sheets. The jeans fad also was a boon. **********Most growers made money in 1979 and 1980, enough to recover from sharp losses caused by heavy rains and a plant bug infestation that ruined crops here in 1978. The extra cash allowed them to pay off debt. **********As a result, ''there are not likely to be many bankruptcies, despite the squeeze'' on growers' profits, said Everett E. Welch, an agricultural lending officer with the Security Pacific Bank. **********''Top management and good soil are key ingredients to good farming,'' he said. ''If someone in that category can't meet a loan, you just carry it over.'' He added, however, that another year of depressed prices might force some growers out of business. **********The large farms weathered the ups and downs in the 1970's by borrowing on the sharply rising value of their land. SVG Farms, for instance, has borrowed an average of $2,000 an acre, up from $300 an acre 25 years ago, according to Mr. Starrh. Farm Prices a Factor **********He said he regretted borrowing against the land. ''It doesn't make sense to draw off your equity in order to live,'' he said. But political pressure against rising farm prices will bind the growers' fate even more closely to the value of their lands, he said. **********Calcot, the biggest broker of California cotton, estimates that domestic consumption will be stagnant at an average of 5.8 million bales this year, the same as last year, but predicted that it would be rising at an annual rate of 6.2 million by December. **********Large textile manufacturers such as West Point-Pepperell, J.P.  Stevens and Burlington Industries are the biggest users of cotton fiber. High interest rates caused the mills to trim inventories and orders through 1981. **********Exports for the 1981-82 season are expected to rise to 6.1 million bales of the total crop, put at 15.7 million bales by the Department of Agriculture. Industry sources, more optimistic, are predicting exports of 7.1 million bales. That crop, the rise in exports notwithstanding, is thus expected to result in a surplus of 3 million to 4 million bales."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/27/world/two-groups-in-us-contend-el-salvador-violates-civil-rights.html": {"writer_name": "David Shribman", "pub_date": "1982-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 374, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TWO GROUPS IN U.S. CONTEND EL SALVADOR VIOLATES CIVIL RIGHTS", "print_headline": "TWO GROUPS IN U.S. CONTEND EL SALVADOR VIOLATES CIVIL RIGHTS", "body_text": " **********The American Civil Liberties Union and the Americas Watch Committee accused the Salvadoran Government today of a systematic denial of human rights, including dozens of politically motivated murders each week and the widespread use of torture. **********In a 275-page report designed to persuade the Reagan Administration not to continue military assistance and sales to El Salvador, the groups also accused the Government there of responsibility for the disappearance of more than 600 people, of repressing the Catholic Church and of suspending freedom of the press. **********Continued American aid to El Salvador depends on certification from President Reagan that El Salvador is trying to foster human rights and is working to end torture and murder by elements of its armed services. **********''The violations of human rights taking place in El Salvador are not aberrations,'' the report said.

Shultz, returning to Washington today after 12 days in Europe, has asserted that his chief goal for 1983 is to find a way to bring about an expansion of the world economy. **********Although Mr. Shultz says he also gives high priority to settling problems with the Soviet Union and to bringing about a solution in the Middle East, he has made it increasingly clear that he regards the state of the American and international economies as of probably overriding, basic importance. **********In a meeting with American reporters late Friday, Mr. Shultz said he was less concerned now about the difficulties caused by large debt problems in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Yugoslavia and more worried over the increasing tendency of countries around the world to impose austerity programs to solve their debt problems. **********These programs, often under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund, call on countries with debts to cut back sharply on imports and to try to increase their exports. Mr. Shultz said these ''austerity-type programs'' are not helping the countries to expand their economies. **********Economic Expansion the Key Aim **********''Out of it all, I think, I'll express my own view that we ought to have as our objective for 1983, economic expansion,'' he said.  ''We want an expansion in 1983, and setting that objective clearly in our sights is important.'' Mr. Shultz, who was Secretary of Labor, director of the Office of Management and Budget and Secretary of the Treasury, all under President Nixon, was formerly dean of the business school at the University of Chicago and is a strong advocate of free trade. He has given more attention to economic issues in his five months as Secretary of State than any predecessor in recent history. **********On his European trip, Mr. Shultz began to speak out much more openly about his concerns over the world economy. He said he was aware that this was a field normally the preserve of the Treasury Secretary, Donald T. Regan, but explained that he and Mr. Regan were old friends and seemed to have a basic understanding on the need to foster an expansion of the world economy. Conference Proposed by Regan **********Mr. Regan, in a meeting with reporters in Washington on Dec. 6, said the groundwork had to be laid for some type of international meeting devoted to this question of expanding the world economy, but he added that such a meeting would ''take a lot of time because these problems are not easy to solve and as yet I don't think there has been any focus on it.'' **********Mr. Shultz, who has not endorsed Mr. Regan's plan for discussing a new global conference, said that he had met with some leading political figures in Britain at lunch here on Friday and that he and the others agreed that the idea of a new Bretton Woods type of international meeting ''isn't a good idea unless you have something that you are pretty secure about to meet about, and at this point ideas are hardly formulated at all.'' The international conference held at Bretton Woods, N.H., in July 1944, resulting in the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, is regarded as a financial landmark. **********''There is a sense that there is a problem out there and that we need to define it and figure out what it is,'' he said, ''and then depending upon how you define the problem, you may be led to some types of solutions or institutional rearrangements that you think will be more helpful.'' Meeting of Top Aides **********A senior aide to the Secretary said that he called an unpublicized meeting of his top advisers at the State Department last month and told them that he regarded the world economic problem, particularly the tendency toward austerity and away from expansion, as the most critical issue. Mr. Shultz pointed out, in the meeting, that because of the large debts incurred by many countries, international banks were becoming more reluctant to extend new loans and the countries themselves were under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to cut back on foreign expenditures and to export more. **********Meanwhile, the opposite problem exists: the chief industrialized countries, facing their own recessions, with high unemployment, are under political pressure also to import less and export more. But with all countries practicing the same austerity, it becomes virtually impossible to find new markets abroad. **********The problem is to find a way for all countries to export more as well as import more - in other words to expand their economies - Mr.  Shultz reportedly told his aides. But he said he had no solution to this vexing question, and he called on people in the State Department to start coming up with ideas. A Shift in Emphasis **********In part because of Mr. Shultz's interest in economic affairs, and his expertise, as well as the fact that major problems in the Western alliance are often now in the economic sphere, allied foreign ministers are discussing in much more detail issues that used to be talked about mainly among finance ministers and bankers. **********Francis Pym, the British Foreign Secretary, said at a news conference Friday that he and Mr. Shultz had discussed world economic problems, a subject that Mr. Shultz had also talked about at dinner Friday night with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/13/business/patents-compound-to-prevent-blood-clotting-disclosed.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1982-03-13", "snippet": "A compound that keeps blood from clotting my prove valuable in treating stroke and accident victims.

Three thousand ... three-three ... now six ... now seven ... three-seven ... now eight ... now a half ... I've got 38 and a half ... Okay, 38 and a half.'' **********It's Thursday, so it must be auction day at Pete Murray's Northway Exchange, about 12 miles north of Albany. They sell used cars here.  Car dealers and reconditioners haul in vehicles they don't want and gavel them off to other dealers who just know they can move them for a profit. Nobody from the general public gets through the gates. **********The sick economy has twisted the life out of the new car business, but spiffy-looking used cars are cherished items. And one of the main places for dealers to find them is the auction, where used cars still move the way new cars once did. Pete Murray has got one of the biggest around. It opened in 1965. Every Thursday morning at 11:30 sharp he starts selling cars, and before he stops about 700 vehicles have gone on the block. **********The auction is held in a low-slung, buff-colored building set on 40 acres. There are four lanes: one for 1980 and newer cars, one for 1978's and 1979's, one for 1977's and older and one for imports and small trucks. At the end of the day, the X category parades through, consisting of big trucks, bulldozers, buses, motorcycles and occasional boats. **********A seller pays $20 to bring in a car, $10 more if the car is sold.  The buyer chips in a fee ranging from $15 for a car bought for less than $495 to $50 for a car fetching more than $10,000. A good auction, dealers say, can net its owner into six figures a year. **********Pete Murray was trying to straighten up his desk, but that was impossible. He is a florid, perky man of 57 with an ingratiating smile. He has trouble keeping track of things. At the moment, he was facing an audit with the Internal Revenue Service and was unable to recall some past transactions. So he was hunting for a hypnotist to see if that would jog his memory. **********''I've lost two pair of glasses in a year,'' he said. ''I'll try to find them, too.'' He took a couple of phone calls, and then talked auctions. ''Many years ago, when one dealer was hurting for money, he had to sell his vehicles to a wholesaler and there was nothing competitive about it and he never knew what the fair value was,'' he said. ''Now, using auctions, we're the stock market of the industry. **********''All together, there are perhaps 200 auctions in the country and they handle more than three million cars,'' he continued. ''The first auction was in 1938, in Leesville, S.C. Still going. After the war, auctions sprang up all over - in any old tobacco shack or barn. They had an awful reputation, a place to get rid of bad cars. In the late 50's, the car factories started running auctions of their leased cars and the image began to improve. Today, the factories tell their dealers to use the auction. **********''The profit today if you want to keep your business alive is in used cars,'' Mr. Murray said. ''That's where the demand is.'' A 1978 Skylark, 39,805 miles on it, rumbled down the B lane.  Dealers nudged each other and nodded, and glances flicked up and down the car. Maybe 500 dealers had shown up today, coming from as far away as Virginia and Florida. **********''It's the image that's the main thing,'' whispered Tim Anspach. He is 95, and walks with two canes. He used to run horse auctions in Omaha, then started the first used-car auction in New York. Now, he still runs a dealership in Albany and patronizes Pete Murray's auction. **********''You got to create the image,'' he said. ''The tires got to be clean. The wheels have got to sparkle. It's image that gets the car sold.'' **********On the B lane, Ralph Tambasco of Tambasco Auto Sales in Amsterdam, N.Y., yawned and gazed moodily at a misbegotten '73 Camaro. He felt the upholstery. He hadn't bought any cars yet, but expected that he would. **********''I'm looking for intermediate four-doors with reasonable mileage,'' he said. ''Under 50,000 miles is reasonable.'' How do you know what to buy? he was asked.  ''If you know anything about cars, you open the door and you know,'' he replied. ''You've got that sight sense. It's the same as a meat man. And you always look at the guy you're buying from. If you've never done business with a guy, you don't buy a toothpick from him.'' **********By the rules of the auction, a buyer has 39 minutes after he takes a vehicle to check it out before the sale is final.  To aid dealers, there's a twisting quarter-mile test track at the rear of the property, with one turn tilted at a 30-degree angle so a dealer can tear around and see if the car's got brakes or if the gearbox is pathetic. A seller is expected to be forthright about any bugs in his car, but just in case, there is Norman Guay. **********Mr. Guay is a husky man with the demeanor of a minister. He is the auction's arbitrator. He works out of a cramped office with a desk and two chairs. People who come in for arbitration, however, usually stand and fidget. **********''I would say at a 700-car auction that I would get maybe 38 cases,'' Mr. Guay said between tussles. ''What we do is, if it's a valid complaint - and a valid complaint means something major like a noise in the engine or transmission malfunctions or play in the drive lines - then I have a mechanic take the car out. If he agrees, then I call the seller in and tell him what we've found and see if he wants to negotiate the price down with the buyer. The buyer has the right to reject the car or adjust the price. About 90 percent of the time we have a price adjustment.'' **********A stoutish dealer came in, saying that the car he hoped to sell had been doing a steady 80 miles an hour on the interstate - then, just now, had started spewing oil. **********''I'll announce it as a noisy engine,'' he said.  ''No, you won't,'' Mr. Guay retorted. ''You'll sell it with a bad engine.'' Some 600 cars have been offered on the block on this particular Thursday, Aug. 12; most sold. Some of the weirder vehicles now rattled down the lane. A burgundy 1926 Model-T Ford, spitting smoke.  A 1960 General Motors school bus. It had bad brakes. No odometer. It looked fed up. **********Peter Murray uncorked his cajolery: ''You can start your own school! Paint it blue and you can have your own Baptist church! It's got bad brakes. But, gee, look at that thing go! A cheap motor home!'' **********A sinewy man with close-cropped hair bid $500.  ''Sell the thing,'' Mr. Murray said. ''I don't dare let it go through again. It'll never make the corner.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/andrea-radio-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANDREA RADIO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "ANDREA RADIO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/business/lobbyists-take-aim-at-ftc-antitrust-rules.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOBBYISTS TAKE AIM AT F.T.C. ANTITRUST RULES", "print_headline": "LOBBYISTS TAKE AIM AT F.T.C. ANTITRUST RULES", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON CHAIRMAN James C. Miller 3d's booming voice could be heard far down the corridor as he delivered a mock pep talk to his top Federal Trade Commission aides. The final legislative battles against the roving bands of lobbyists in ''white coats and stethoscopes'' now deployed throughout Capitol Hill will be muddy and hard, he told his troops, but victory over the nation's doctors could nevertheless be theirs. **********The fiercely contested issue of whether doctors and other statelicensed professionals should be given immunity from increasingly energetic F.T.C. regulation, however, is only the most visible of a half dozen similar efforts by business and trade groups to carve out special niches of antitrust immunity. **********Should they succeed, consumer activists predict higher prices and, in some instances, reduced consumer choice as well.  ''If doctors can fix prices and restrict advertising, there will not be any price competition in health care,'' says Jay L. Angoff of Congress Watch, a group founded by Ralph Nader. Without making any attempt to quantify what the doctors' proposed F.T.C. exemption might do to swell medical costs, Mr. Angoff predicts that the nation's $287 billion health-care bill last year would rise significantly. **********Beer prices too may move up if wholesalers in that industry get their way. They want to protect their members from the pricing tactics of big, often distant, competitors - ''transhippers'' - who pounce on an area and cream off supermarket and other big customers by offering to sell beer on razor-thin margins. **********Richard B. Thornburg, director of legislative affairs for the National Beer Wholesalers Association, said his group was inspired by the example set by soft-drink bottlers, who two years ago obtained legislation barring the Government from breaking up exclusive distributorships. **********The surge in exemption activity has been bolstered by the stiffer competition caused by the recession and by the far-reaching deregulation of such fields as airlines and trucking. **********These challenges may also in part be inspired by the Reagan Administration's effort to curb Government regulation, and the fact that antitrust enforcement has shifted focus and may also - at least in the eyes of business - be somewhat less vigorous. Another factor, analysts said, was the rise of the political action committee in the 1970's, which permitted business to raise money for political purposes more readily than before. **********In addition to the beer wholesalers and the fight over F.T.C.  immunity for professionals such as doctors, the bills now before Congress involve the following: *********** The National Football League, which is seeking a Federal antitrust exemption similar to the one long enjoyed by major league baseball. *********** Agricultural cooperatives, which want existing antitrust exemptions broadened so the F.T.C. would have to get permission from the Secretary of Agriculture to prosecute anticompetitive behavior. *********** The maritime industry, which seeks expanded immunities to allow carriers to pool revenues, share cargoes, cut overcapacity and control access to ports. *********** Credit unions, which want exemption from F.T.C. regulation, to put them on the same footing with banks and savings and loan associations. **********Most of these initiatives involve exemption only from the commission. The industries fighting against F.T.C. jurisdiction would still be subject to general antitrust attack by the Justice Department which shares enforcement of the Clayton and Sherman antitrust acts with the commission. Moreover, some industries, such as banks, are highly regulated by other Federal or state agencies that watch for anticompetitive behavior. **********Still, some analysts see a disturbing trend in the various attempts to win immunities.  ''The antitrust law is certainly gray at the margin,'' said Mr.  Miller, noting that recent shifts in its ''intellectual underpinnings'' are a large factor in the host of efforts to escape F.T.C. scrutiny. The changed antitrust climate is probably best reflected in the Administration's more relaxed attitude toward conglomerate and vertical mergers, where companies are not direct market competitors. This has led some to conclude that the attitude might affect requests for specific immunities from the F.T.C. **********The current assault on the commission represents a continuation of the effort to clip its wings, which was begun two years ago. Congress then gave itself veto power - first employed this summer to block a new used-car sales rule -over F.T.C. regulations. Mr. Miller, an economist and former deregulation chief for the Reagan White House, believes some of the current legislation involves a legitimate effort to reduce regulatory uncertainties. But the chairman has strenuously resisted the assault by doctors, which is expected to come to a vote this week in the House of Representatives. JOINING the F.T.C. and Congress Watch, in unaccustomed alliance against the measure, which is tied t o the commission's three-year reauthorization bill, are the N ational Association of Retired Persons, the American Nurses A ssociation, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores and the W ashington Business Group on Health, a corporate group worried about t he cost of employee health-care and insurance plans. **********They are supported by six former heads of the Justice Department's antitrust division - Sanford M. Litvack, John H. Shenefield, Donald I. Baker, Thomas E. Kauper, Edwin M. Zimmerman and Donald F. Turner - who wrote Mr. Miller to declare: **********''While the professions do have certain unique characteristics, those engaged in the sale of professional services are clearly engaged in commercial activity. We see no reason why Federal laws that protect against restraints of trade and monopolistic or deceptive practices in our free market economy should not apply to the sale of professional services.'' **********The legislation would also cover perhaps 15 other professions, including accountants, lawyers and architects, but it is the doctors who have been the principal supporters. Many lawyers and accountants, in fact, oppose it. **********Joseph F. Boyle, chairman of the American Medical Association, which is the main force behind the anti-F.T.C. legislation, stressed the doctors' view that the issue is not mainly about economics.  Federal bureaucrats, he insisted, are not qualified to intervene in physicians' business by seeking to review, for example, the guidelines offered by local medical associations for physicians' fees. **********''The question is whether you have an agency involved in standardsetting,'' Dr. Boyle said. ''The extension of this would seem almost endless.'' **********The role of industry political action committees is also increasing.  ''There's an awful lot more money accumulated to gain access'' to legislators, asserted Philip L. Verveer, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust matters for Pierson, Ball & Dowd, a Washington law firm. **********And Robert D. Tollison, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of economics, said that he thought this private financial muscle was threatening the adequate policing of anticompetitive behavior. **********''At some point,'' he argued, ''that tide's got to stop.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/21/business/florida-steel-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLORIDA STEEL reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FLORIDA STEEL reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/14/business/l-stock-tables-190681.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCK TABLES", "print_headline": "STOCK TABLES", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: I liked Mr. Tisch's format very much.

You guys stink!'' Prudential Bache Securities had just lost a trade to another brokerage firm, and William Schlicher, senior vice president of institutional stock trading, hurled his insult across the floor to the block traders, who ignored it for the 10th time yesterday. **********As the bull market continues its stampede down Wall Street, the traders are thundering, too. Yesterday, with volume reaching a record level of 149.4 million shares, including a phenomenal 46.6 million traded in the first hour alone, the excitement in trading rooms reached fever pitch. From the opening bell until noon, ''we were totally swamped,'' said Mr. Schlicher, 39 years old, who plainly relishes the pace. ''We were really hopping.'' **********An Elusive Seller **********All day long, Mr. Schlicher and his colleagues were on the phone - to the block traders across the room, to Prudential Bache's traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, to some institutional clients. It was a cacophony of orders, laments, demands and pep club cheerleading, carried across the crowded, noisy room by loudspeaker. **********''We wanna buy K Mart, let's go!'' Mr. Schlicher bellowed across the room. The traders had heard that there was a seller in the market, but had been unable to locate him. **********''You guys, let's not lose track of this one,'' William Bee, who trades in banks, health-care and drug company stock, boomed.  ''Chemical Bank, we still have a buyer.'' **********''First he won't buy what I tell him to buy,'' Richard Farrell, a trader in 200 leading industrials, complained about a floor broker.  ''Then he overbuys.'' **********''How much are you short?'' Mr. Schlicher asked.  ''That's what I'm figuring.'' ''On the H!'' A trader is summoned to the telephone line that goes to the firm's main room near the floor.  Like H (and J and K), many of the references are in code. ''Cha, Cha, San Fran'' - Charles Sciascia, the over-the-counter liaison, had a telephone call from Prudential Bache's San Francisco office.  ''Pick up Loose Wheels'' - Lucille Savino, a clerk on the floor of the exchange, wanted to talk to a trader. **********The trading room was a study in perpetual motion. Mr. Schlicher lit another cigarette and drummed his desk. Mr. Bee tugged at his mustache. Mr. Farrell rarely sat down. Clerks chewed toothpicks and pens. Come lunchtime, they wolfed down soft drinks, pretzels and cookies, with a cigarette between courses. **********Mr. Schlicher, a two-and-a-half-pack-a-day man, pulled out $10.  ''Who needs cigarettes besides me?'' ''Me.'' ''Me.'' ''Me.'' Hot on Sohio **********To everyone's regret, the lunchtime lull lengthened into afternoon, and the two mad hours were not repeated. As the traders sat and waited, Mr. Farrell announced that another brokerage firm had sold 100,000 shares of K Mart. **********''You guys stink!'' Mr. Schlicher informed the block traders. Like everything else in the trading room, his anger was temporary. ''Hi, pal,'' he said to a caller. ''Oh, tiptop today.'' **********''Chief, chief,'' Thomas Heck, a trader in oil and transportation stocks, said urgently to Mr. Schlicher, still on the telephone. ''I got to talk to you.'' Shortly after 2 P.M., with Mr. Schlicher's goahead, he bought 100,000 shares of Standard of Ohio at 37 1/2. The next task is to find a buyer. Meanwhile, Sohio stock has begun to drop. **********''Sohio, we're hot,'' Mr. Schlicher said over the loudspeaker. ''We missed K Mart, let's go.'' By 3 P.M., with the market down nearly 3 points, the traders have grown bored with their unwonted leisure. ''It's dead, dead,'' Mr.  Schlicher complained. **********''I'm falling asleep,'' Mr. Heck said.  ''Yesterday went so fast,'' Mr. Farrell recalled.  A clerk, sent out 15 minutes before for coffee and soft drinks, has still not returned. ''Where'd he go for the Pepsi, Chicago?'' Mr.  Schlicher said. **********The sarcasm deepened. Mr. Heck, who earlier had looked in vain for a private seller for Texas Oil, informed the block traders that he was able to buy the stock more cheaply on the market. ''I would like to thank you for not finding a seller at that silly price I was offering,'' he said. **********But in the last half-hour, with the market ''tanking'' - falling - tension mounted again. ''Nineteen minutes of jeopardy,'' Mr. Bee said. Sleepless Night Ahead **********''It's been an excellent commission day,'' Mr. Schlicher summed up. ''We lost some money in trading for our own account.'' Prudential Bache has held onto some large blocks of stock, a fact that will trouble him until trade opens today. ''Absolutely I lose sleep,'' Mr. Schlicher said. ''Absolutely I take it home with me, wake up at 2 A.M.'' **********At 3:42 P.M., Mr. Heck, who had been studying his Quotron intently, noted that the Dow had fallen to 1,049.85. ''How disgusting,'' he said. Sohio, however, had recoverd to 37 1/8. **********''Come on, Sohio, come on,'' Mr. Schlicher said.  ''It's up one-eighth, what do you want?'' Mr. Heck said.  ''A quarter.'' At 3:54 P.M., Mr. Heck groaned. Sohio had dropped to 36 3/4.  Finally, 4 o'clock. Sohio has closed at 37. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed down 15.27 points.  ''They can't hurt us anymore, guys,'' Mr. Schlicher said.  ''They can't get me until tomorrow,'' Mr. Heck said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/30/world/britons-venting-their-anger-at-things-argentine.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Rattner", "pub_date": "1982-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 826, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITONS VENTING THEIR ANGER AT THINGS ARGENTINE", "print_headline": "BRITONS VENTING THEIR ANGER AT THINGS ARGENTINE", "body_text": " **********When a tape of a pre-Falklands Royal Variety Gala was recently broadcast on television, viewers were treated to the entire 90-minute spectacle - with one exception. Elaine Page's performance of ''Don't Cry for Me Argentina,'' from the musical ''Evita,'' was eliminated. **********''As one of the songs had to be cut, we thought it would be silly for Elaine to sing Argentina in case it might be misconstrued,'' Tim Rice, the lyricist, told reporters. **********As this country moves closer to a stepped-up military confrontation with Argentina, Britons have been venting - in conversation and in highly symbolic actions -their unhappiness about the South American nation's actions. **********Going beyond import curbs, for example, Argentine food was banned from restaurants in Government buildings at Westminster and Argentine corned beef was removed from the shelves of 500 supermarkets. A liquor store in Chelsea poured its supply of Argentine wine down the drain. Internment Hardly Considered **********And as the possibility of more military action grows, consideration is being given to what would happen to Argentines in Britain. Few expect that Argentines would be interned, particularly because there is no law to permit it. But officials pointed out that powers do exist for specific individuals to be detained if they are suspected of sabotage or other offenses. **********For Britons, the antagonism toward things Argentine represents part of the struggle to recapture the self-respect lost when the Falkland Islands were so easily occupied. David and Andrew Banks, for example, were fined the equivalent of $90 each for throwing two cans of corned beef at the Argentine Embassy in Belgravia. **********''We just had to do it,'' said Andrew Banks. ''The invasion hurt my pride.'' Other Britons have been booing Argentine-born soccer players as they set foot on the field. **********To some extent, Britons have been aroused by the provocative actions of their Government, such as the breaking of diplomatic relations and the ban on Argentine trade. Last week three Argentine yachtsmen, arriving in England at the end of a round-the-world race, were quickly expelled by the Home Office. World Cup Spot in Doubt **********A few days earlier, Neil MacFarlane, the Sports Minister, urged British sports organizations to call off any matches planned to take place in Britain against Argentine teams. In addition, a Government committee is considering whether England should withdraw from the World Cup soccer tournament to be held in Spain this summer. **********''In present circumstances, I would urge British sporting bodies not to complete any bilateral fixtures against their Argentinian counterparts scheduled in the U.K. and to refrain from issuing further invitations,'' Mr. MacFarlane said in a statement to Parliament. **********The evident tension has left Britain's fragmented Argentine population nervous and uncomfortable. Only a few thousand Argentines are thought to be living in Britain and many of those are married to Britons or otherwise part of the British community. **********No incidents have been reported and most Argentines say they are being treated cordially by their British hosts. Nonetheless, nearly all of them are so sensitive about their new-found prominence that they refused to discuss their experiences. Friends Keeping Their Distance **********''Some Argentinians here are finding their friends keeping their distance,'' said Raoul Fain-Binder, an Argentine journalist here.  ''The jingoism and that sort of thing that you see in British papers is also very disturbing.'' **********Regardless of their political sympathies, Argentines here are unhappy about the continuing attacks in British newspapers of the Argentine Government, the Argentine economy, the administration of the Falklands and just about anything Argentine. ''Forced out at gunpoint,'' proclaimed the Daily Mail a few days ago in recounting the departure of a group of islanders. **********''I feel isolated, particularly without an embassy and an ambassador,'' said one young Argentine student. ''I don't hide my nationality but I don't go out as much.'' **********A number of Argentines have had difficulties with their personal finances, as a result of a Bank of England action to freeze Argentine deposits in Britain. The action was not intended to reach individuals but many were affected by the initial confusion. In addition, suspension of a no-visa agreement between Britain and Argentina has made travel far more difficult. 'People Look Twice' **********''Argentine residents here are just trying to go about their business normally,'' said Alan Tabbush, chairman of the Anglo-Argentine Society. ''People, of course, are sensitive. Now when a man says he's an Argentinian, people look twice.'' **********Some of the repercussions have seemed almost silly. The National Rifle Association here has decided to change the name of its 33-yearold ''Argentina Shooting Match'' to ''The N.R.A. 300 meters match.'' And a newspaper suggested that Prince Charles dismiss his Argentineborn polo pony groom even though he has a British passport, is married to an Englishwoman and was hired before the crisis began."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/20/world/portuguese-coalition-starts-its-search-for-a-new-premier.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 470, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PORTUGUESE COALITION STARTS ITS SEARCH FOR A NEW PREMIER", "print_headline": "PORTUGUESE COALITION STARTS ITS SEARCH FOR A NEW PREMIER", "body_text": " **********Portugal's right-wing coalition Government began seeking a new Prime Minister today after the resignation of the Social Democratic Party leader, Francisco Pinto Balsemao, after almost two years in the job. **********Announcing his decision earlier today during a meeting of his party's national leadership, Mr. Balsemao said he had been betrayed by opponents within his own movement and other members of the threeparty coalition. **********Mr. Balsemao, 45 years old, became Prime Minister in January 1981, after his friend and predecessor, Francisco sa Carneiro, was killed in a plane crash. He resigned briefly in the summer of that year but formed a second Government when the Social Democrats failed to put up an alternative candidate. **********His statement pointed to a split in the Democratic Alliance coalition, which faces a crucial test over his successor.  The Social Democratic Party is the largest group in the coalition, which also includes the more conservative Christian Democrats and the tiny Monarchist Party. **********The alliance has held a clear majority in Parliament since January 1980. A general election is not due until 1984.  Today the Socialist and Communist opposition called on President Antonio Ramalho Eanes to dissolve Parliament.  In his statement today Mr. Balsemao said he had long ago decided to step down in order to dedicate himself to the Social Democrats, but a setback suffered by the party in local elections on Dec. 12 appeared to have precipitated his resignation. **********The alliance only dropped five points in the voting and maintained its hold on the local government structure. But, by scoring big gains at the expense of the Social Democrats, the Christian Democrats increased the strain within the coalition. **********The three leading candidates to succeed Mr. Balsemao are former Prime Minister Carlos Mota Pinto, who held office for six months in 1979, Finance Minister Joao Salgueiro and Joao Mota Amaral, head of the Azores regional government. **********The decision on whether to appoint a new alliance government or call early elections will be made by Mr. Ramalho Eanes after Mr.  Balsemao formally presents his resignation on Monday. **********In northern Portugal, rioting erupted today when authorities tried to repeat local elections canceled last Sunday after protesters stormed polling stations in the small town of Vizela in support of demands for their own local council. **********Today hundreds of residents, summoned by church bells and fire alarms, again wrecked polling booths and tore up voting slips after defying riot policemen with shouts of ''this is not Poland.'' The police charged the demonstrators but later left the town. **********The problem at Vizela is mainly economic. It has also caused friction within the alliance as the monarchists support the town's claims, while the Christian Democrats oppose them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/23/business/nowsco-well-service-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NOWSCO WELL SERVICE CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "NOWSCO WELL SERVICE CO reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/14/business/pennsylvania-real-estate-investment-trust-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PENNSYLVANIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Feb", "print_headline": "PENNSYLVANIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Feb", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/business/stocks-soar-again-dow-is-over-1000-first-time-in-year.html": {"writer_name": "Alexander Hammer", "pub_date": "1982-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW IS OVER 1,000 FIRST TIME IN YEAR", "print_headline": "STOCKS SOAR AGAIN; DOW IS OVER 1,000 FIRST TIME IN YEAR", "body_text": " **********In the fourth day of an exuberant stock market rally, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.94 points yesterday and closed above 1,000 for the first time since mid-1981. **********The rise in the average reflected the growing conviction that interest rates will continue to decline.  The Dow average, which measures the performance of the stocks of 30 major corporations, finished at 1,012.79, its highest close since April 28, 1981, when it ended at 1,016.93. If it were to continue the pace of the last four sessions - rising a total of 110.96 points -the Dow average would break the record high of 1,051.70 well before the end of the week. That record was set on Jan. 11, 1973. **********Seldom Above 1,000 for Long **********The Dow average broke the 1,000 mark on several occasions during the first six months of the Reagan Administration, going as high as 1,024.05 on April 27, 1981. But it is a barrier that often convinces investors to sell and as a result, it has seldom remained above 1,000 for long. **********Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday climbed to 138.5 million shares, the second highest ever. The record was set last Thursday, when 147.1 million shares changed hands. **********The volume of stocks bought and sold yesterday was considered particularly impressive because many of the nation's banks and companies were closed in observance of Columbus Day. 'Confidence in the Economy' **********President Reagan hailed the market's rally, telling a cheering Republican audience in Irving, Tex., that ''the surge reflects increased money market confidence in the economy.'' **********Analysts attributed the market's strength yesterday primarily to a statement Saturday by Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, confirming a more lenient monetary policy. Mr. Volcker said that, while the Federal Reserve would continue to combat inflation, ''that policy does not imply continuing pressures on interest rates.'' Mr. Volcker's statement shores up the conviction of many economists that the Federal Reserve will encourage a further decline in interest rates to buttress the nation's faltering economy. The Federal Reserve sets the scene for lower interest rates by increasing the amount of money that banks have available to lend. **********''The remarks of Mr. Volcker on Saturday indicate that interest rates will continue to move lower, and that's what stimulated the market today,'' said Ralph Acampora, vice president of Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Lower interest rates attract investors to stocks by reducing the yields on competing investments, such as bank savings certificates and money market funds. **********The other leading market indicators yesterday also made large gains. The New York Stock Exchange composite average, which includes all the common stocks traded, advanced 1.91, to 76.91, its highest close since Aug. 14, 1981, when it ended at 77. **********The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.42, to 134.47, its best closing since April 27, 1981, when it finished at 135.48.  For the Dow, which is generally considered the market's bellwether indicator, the 1,000 level is considered important mainly for its psychological effect on investors. The average last closed above that benchmark figure on June 23, 1981, when it reached 1,006.66. **********''There is a good chance that the Dow's move above the 1,000 mark today is for real and, unlike previous attempts, that the Dow will spend more time above 1,000 in the future than below it,'' said William M. LeFevre, market stragetist of Purcell, Graham & Company. **********He based his optimism on the fact that both inflation and interest rates were declining at the same time. Since the early 1970's, when the Dow first closed above 1,000, interest rates would decline periodically while the nation's economy generally experienced a rising rate of inflation. **********Nevertheless, breaking the 1,000 barrier had its sobering affect yesterday. The Dow dropped back in the final hour of trading, after having advanced by 34 points at 3 P.M. from Friday's close. The heavy trading put the tape that records transactions behind more than 30 minutes at the close. For a while during the day, it had been behind as much as 42 minutes. **********Falling interest rates have been the main reason for the market's record two-month surge. Since Aug. 12, the Dow has climb 235 points.  Heavy institutional buying by pension, union and bank funds as interest rates declined has led the market's sharp advance, especially in the last four sessions. The large-capitalization issues have posted the biggest gains. **********The market's advance yesterday was broadly based, with advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbering declining stocks by more than a 5-to-1 ratio. The best performers again were the stocks of the bluechip corporations, technology and transportation companies. **********In the blue-chip category, American Express climbed 4 1/8 points yesterday, to 57 7/8; General Motors 3, to 53 1/2; American Telephone 1 1/4, to 62 3/4; Merck 2, to 82 1/2, and International Business Machines 2 1/8, to 83 1/4. **********Among the stocks that make up the Dow industrial average, Procter & Gamble since the beginning of this month has gained 12 1/2 points, to 111 1/2; Eastman Kodak 12 1/4, to 95 1/4; Minnesota Mining 10 1/4, to 75 3/8, and I.B.M. 9 1/4. **********The smallest gainers in the group during this period included U.S.  Steel, which advanced only 1/8, to 18; Woolworth 1 1/8, to 31, and Bethlehem Steel 1 3/8, to 17. Energy Issues Gain **********The energy issues, which have lagged the market since the start of the rally, are now beginning to participate. Texaco rose 2, to 32; Exxon 1 3/8, to 30 5/8, and Standard of California 3/4, to 31. The energy issues had been under pressure for many months because of the oil glut and declining prices. **********Among the stronger technology issues yesterday, Texas Instruments soared 5 7/8, to 107 5/8; Digital Equipment 5 3/8, to 94 7/8, and Honeywell 3 3/4, to 90 1/2. **********The heavy volume in the last four sessions continued to buoy the brokerage stocks, which derive much of their profits from high volume. Merrill Lynch added 3 3/8, to 46 7/8; Paine Webber 2 3/8, to 29 3/8, and E.F. Hutton 1 1/2, to 39. **********On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index added 4.95, to 304.09, while its option contracts volume rose to a record 364,132 contracts. **********In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.42, to 202.31."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/business/shaklee-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHAKLEE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "SHAKLEE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/18/business/hayes-albion-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 27, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAYES-ALBION CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "HAYES-ALBION CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/27/business/stevens-jumps-83-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stevens Jumps 83% in Quarter", "print_headline": "Stevens Jumps 83% in Quarter", "body_text": " **********J.P.

Current annual billings are about $28 million, according to the airline. **********The carrier was known to be reviewing its worldwide relationship with Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, following a corporate reorganization instigated by Sir John King after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher installed him as chairman of the Government-owned airline. Saatchi & Saatchi Garland-Compton, the British publicly held agency that is the controlling member of the Saatchi & Saatchi Compton organization, is also the agency for Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party. **********F.C.B. Communications, also a public company but with headquarters in New York, is an American corporation even though its London office first started working for B.A. in 1948. The account has been called the ''heart of the F.C.B. international operation.'' **********''I think British Airways probably chose us because they thought it appropriate that the nation's flag-carrying airline should have a British advertising agency rather than an American one,'' said Simon Mellor, assistant to Charles and Maurice Saatchi. He added that the current theme, ''Fly the Flag,'' probably would be scrapped in favor of a best-in-the-world theme. **********''It looks like a political act of which we are the victims,'' John E. O'Toole, chairman of Foote, Cone, said of the switch.  In London, Bill Barry, head of F.C.B. there, remarked: ''We are proud to stand by our work. We are sad that Sir John King appears to have so summarily dismissed one of the airline's main pillars in its flight for the future.'' **********But there is no doubt that the Saatchi & Saatchi operation is the fastest growing and hottest shop in England. It is also the largest, a position generally held by American agencies in the past. And under its umbrella are the S.& S. Garland-Compton organization and the Dorland agency, both of which will be handling different divisions of the reorganized client, while Compton Advertising will do the American part of the job. **********Its main divisions are the European; Intercontinental, which takes care of the rest of the world, and Holidays, a tour packager.  F.C.B., which will continue doing the work for three months, has handled the airline in some 80 countries. S.S.C.W. has offices in 44 countries and probably will not be adding to them. **********The victorious agency, one of a number of British-based shops interviewed by the carrier during the last three months or so, has three airlines on its client list and each had been informed of the possibility of the British Airways move. They are British Caledonian, KLM and Air New Zealand. **********In disclosing the new account on this side of the ocean, O. Milton Gossett, chairman and chief executive officer of Compton in New York and chairman of S.S.C.W., said he considered the new account another indication that the Compton-Saatchi merger last March creating a $1.3 billion shop was a wise move.

He will be in charge of ''Baby Bell,'' the name that many use to refer to the Bell subsidiary that will be established to handle operations in unregulated businesses. **********In typically diffident Bell fashion, Mr. Marshall downplayed his appointment when reached at his Basking Ridge, N.J., office.

In addition, he said, his assignment to create, head and run Baby Bell was simply an example of placing an executive with recent line experience at the top of a prospective national line organization. **********This organization ''makes as much sense now as it did two months ago,'' Mr. Marshall said. Under a proposed antitrust settlement announced this month by Bell and the Justice Department, 22 regional Bell operating companies are to be divested.

''I just got the job,'' he responded, ''but clearly what we'll want to do is follow our technology and bring our customers the newest type of communications.'' **********Mr. Marshall started his career at Illinois Bell in 1953, where he spent many years, interspersed by two previous tours of duty at A.T.& T., before first becoming a vice president. The only other Bell unit on his resume is the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, where he was once a vice president. **********The mission that has been given to all A.T.& T. executive vice presidents, Mr. Marshall observed, was to operate their own segments and keep the office of the chairman informed about proposed policy changes.

Wounded Reported Unattended **********According to an account by a young man who escaped the city Tuesday night, the stench of corpses hung over the city. He said many bodies were buried under collapsed buildings and other dead and wounded were unattended in the streets because of the heavy firing. **********Many residents have not been out of their houses in more than two weeks because the troops were shooting at anything that moved, the young man said. His account was similar to those pieced together by diplomats of at least six embassies here. **********The Government has declined to give any details of the fighting.  The Minister of Information, Ahmed Iskander Ahmed, has described the reports circulating among diplomats as the ''stuff of dreams.'' **********The fighting is the largest uprising in the 12-year-old Government of President Hafez al-Assad, but diplomats here believe that the President, backed by his brother, Rifaat, commands a security apparatus still capable of controlling the country. **********Nevertheless, these diplomats say the Government appears to be faced with a determined opposition in the outlawed, fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood organization, which could serve as a spearhead to other discontented but unorganized elements of society. **********Just how determined the opposition is was shown again Thursday afternoon when a man tried to drive a truck full of explosives that was disguised as a magazine delivery van into the new 10-story building housing the Ministry of Information and the Baath Party newspaper. **********He was cut down by machine-gun fire and the explosives went off prematurely, blowing the facade off the building but causing no deaths. Moslem Brotherhood organizations abroad took responsiblity. **********The incident was only the latest in a chain of terrorist strikes by the Brotherhood that began with the massacre of more than 60 artillery cadets in Aleppo in June 1979 and has included assassinations of Government officials and Soviet advisers. Last November a huge car bomb went off in the crowded Azbakiyeh neighborhood of Damascus, killing more than a hundred people. Shorty afterward, diplomatic sources here say, a large, eight-wheeled truck was discovered packed with explosives near Omayyad Square, a major landmark. How Fighting in Hama Began **********Intelligence agents, hard-looking young men in blue jeans and leather jackets or windbreakers cradling Soviet-made assault rifles, are a fixture on Damascus streets and have been noticeably strengthened in the hillside neighborhood of President Assad's palace. In the last week they have added hand grenades, pistols, aprons of extra ammunition clips and walkie-talkies to their equipment. **********The fighting in Hama, diplomats say, was sparked by long-simmering resentment of the Alawite-dominated Government of President Assad among the Sunni Moslem majority. The city has a reputation as both a center of Sunni orthodoxy and a thorn in the side of the Government. **********Accounts pieced together from diplomatic reports and residents indicate that the fighting began on Feb. 2 when 300 or more regular Syrian soldiers of the 21st Mechanized Infantry Brigate, 3d Armored Division, a heavily Alawite unit stationed near Hama, tried to raid a Moslem Brotherhood arms cache. **********The unit was surrounded and wiped out as it attacked the hideout, according to these accounts. A Western diplomat said he monitered a military radio broadcast reporting 300 deaths among the soldiers.  Several diplomats heard reports that the insurgents donned the uniforms of the dead soldiers, possibly giving rise to accounts that army units had deserted. City Is Sealed Off **********The troops were acting on a tip that the Moslem Brotherhood was stockpiling arms for a major operation, possibly involving dissident military personnel, according to some sources. An East European diplomat said the arms - including piles of antitank rockets and automatic rifles - had been brought in from Jordan and the money had been supplied by Iraq. **********With a call to rebellion from the minarets of the mosques, the fighting spread, and residents attacked Government and Baath Party buildings and killed party members and security officers. The Government sent in more troops, including the 47th Independent Brigade and units of the special troops commanded by Rifaat Assad.  The fighting has continued since. **********The city has been sealed off and no one is allowed to leave or enter. The Government has reopened the main road between Damascus and Aleppo, which skirts the city, but has kept Hama isolated. Western journalists have been warned not to go to the area. Market and Old Part Are Hit **********According to the young man who escaped Tuesday night and the accounts of others, the ancient Hadhir district, where the rebels barricaded themselves, has been destroyed, as has the souk, the traditonal market place that in Hama dealt mainly in wool and cotten. **********At least three mosques have been destoyed, according to accounts reaching Damascus.  There is no electricity, very little food and water and no telephone communication, the young man said, adding that soldiers had been looting homes and the souk. The young man, a member of a Sunni merchant family, said he was able to escape because he had a relative in the security forces. **********Thus far, the trouble in Hama does not appear to have spread to other cities such as Aleppo, Latakia or Homs, where there have in the past been Sunni outbursts against the Alawite-dominated Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/21/business/ncr-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "NCR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/business/electronic-data-gets-army-contract.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 277, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ELECTRONIC DATA GETS ARMY CONTRACT", "print_headline": "ELECTRONIC DATA GETS ARMY CONTRACT", "body_text": " **********The Army announced yesterday that it had awarded to the Electronic Data Systems Corporation a 10-year contract to install and operate what will be one of the Government's biggest data processing networks.

In the last few years more than 6,000 stores opened to sell and rent prerecorded tapes of movies. But now the business faces an uncertain future. **********Movie producers have raised prices and in some cases will only rent tapes, not sell them, to retailers. Last October a Federal court in California declared home videotaping illegal. And Congress is considering revoking the copyright law's First Sale doctrine, which lets a dealer buy a tape and then rent it to customers countless times without paying extra royalties to the movie studio. **********The video copyright question is a key issue at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show, now under way here. Frank Barnako Jr., president of the Video Software Dealers Association, a six-month-old trade group, discussed the prospects facing his industry. Mr. Barnako owns the Video Place, a five-store chain in the Washington area. **********Q. A few months ago dealers were up in arms about plans by the movie studios to only rent tapes. What has happened since then? **********A.  The number of new titles coming in rental-only has slowed to a crawl. I think the number of dealers picking up titles that were rental-only has also slowed to a crawl. Dealers have seen they can survive without blockbusters. Studios have seen their cash flow significantly reduced. The rental-only programs are slowly fading away. **********Q. What are the chances that Congress will levy a royalty on the sale of blank videotapes and video cassette recorders? How would that affect dealers in prerecorded software? **********A. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the appeal of the California case, nothing is going to happen in Congress. If the Court won't hear it, I think there will very likely be a royalty. Our biggest concern is the revocation of the Right of First Sale. That permits us to buy a tape and do what we want with it. An amendment in the Senate bill would take this away and give the studios a monopoly forever. If that happens, 95 percent of our members will have to go out of business or drastically change the way they do business. **********Q. Isn't the existing situation unfair to studios? Should retailers be able to buy a tape and rent it over and over and over again without reimbursing the studios? **********A. The studios don't have to sell it. They have the right now to say this is rental-only. **********Q. Is there a shakeout starting among video software retailers? **********A.  I'm feeling it. If you talk to a distributor, you'd probably hear that the number of refused c.o.d. shipments is higher than three months ago. A refused shipment means that a dealer has a good business on the weekend and calls up on a Monday and orders four ''Star Wars'' and three ''Time Bandits,'' and by the time the tapes arrive on Wednesday he can't pay for it. **********Q. How many of the dealers will not last? **********A. It's fair to say that 30 to 40 percent of the guys are looking around and hoping to hear someone say, ''I want to buy you out.'' **********Q. If dealers can't buy everything, does that mean they will stop carrying tapes made in Sony's Beta format and carry only the more popular VHS format? **********A. On some titles I'm not sure about, I've passed on Beta. So Beta does have a bit of a problem, but I don't think it's serious. **********Q. Do you see a market developing for the videodisk? **********A. No. It doesn't do enough. My experience with videodisks has been disappointing. We've tried cutting prices. We've tried disk giveaways. We've tried $50 rebates. It just doesn't sell. **********Q. ABC recently said it would broadcast pay TV at night to subscribers to record on video cassette recorders. Does that and other forms of pay TV threaten software dealers? **********A. They are competition for a finite resource: your time. The new options will increase hardware sales - no question about that. In the software area, they have to keep putting new products out in video cassette form if we are to do well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/26/business/tiny-copier-maker-taking-a-big-step-in-deal-with-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TINY COPIER MAKER TAKING A BIG STEP IN DEAL WITH CHINA", "print_headline": "TINY COPIER MAKER TAKING A BIG STEP IN DEAL WITH CHINA", "body_text": " **********In the copier industry, dominated by giants, Otto A. Clark and his company, the Clark Copy International Corporation, are minuscule: Clark Copy has only 23 employees and 300 stockholders. Total sales last year barely exceeded $1 million, and it spent only $1.2 million on research and development. **********But this nondescript, five-year-old company, which makes paper copiers and cassette tape-copying machines in a cramped factory outside of Chicago, has beaten the world leaders in the paper copier business - Xerox, Olympia, Minolta, Sharp - to a lucrative 20-year contract with China. **********''I never even heard of the company before this,'' said Eugene G.  Glazer, a stock analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''Now they're the talk of the town. This contract may not put them on the Fortune 500 list, but it's an awful lot of business.'' Indeed, the deal with China could bring Clark Copy $65 million in sales during the contract's life. **********But the real question, some analysts say, is whether the company can meet the terms of its production contract, or whether it has gotten in way over its head. Undercutting the Competition **********The machine that may make Clark Copy a household name - at least in China - is the CMC 2000, an unspectacular-looking plain-paper copier that makes 18 copies a minute and requires no warm-up time. Because the 75-pound machine employs the latest technology, Clark Copy is able to undercut the prices of most similar machines by almost half: The CMC 2000 sells for less than $2,000. **********''It's the fastest, the smallest, the most efficient and the least expensive paper copier in the world,'' boasted Mr. Clark, the company's 56-year-old founder and president. **********The CMC 2000, named after his daughter Catherine Marie Clark, is a no-frills machine that is made of only 200 parts and takes two hours to assemble, compared with more than 2,000 parts and 20 hours for assembly for other copiers, Mr. Clark said in an interview. **********Instead of using a conventional photographic lens costing $175, Mr. Clark said, his copier uses a $35 fiber-optic lens. It employs a $5 belt to transfer images to paper, instead of a $270 drum, which uses more energy to heat the image as the transfer is made. **********''It would cost the large companies twice as much to make the same machine because of their large overhead,'' he said. Terms of the Contract **********According to the terms of the contract, which was signed April 10 in Peking, Clark Copy will manufacture and deliver 1,000 assembled copiers, and the parts for another 5,000 machines, which the Chinese will assemble. This phase, which will bring the company $5.5 million in revenue, will begin with the delivery of 50 assembled copiers and the parts for another 200 in September. The company will then ship 100 assembled machines and the parts for 500 others each month. **********In the second phase of the contract, Clark Copy will be expected to train Chinese technicians, who are then to manufacture in the following three years 200,000 copiers at a new plant in Kweilin for domestic sale and export. This stage will bring Clark $60 million, or $300 per machine. **********Clark Copy will also upgrade the paper copier over the years, reducing its size ''so it will be able to fit inside an attache case,'' Mr. Clark said. The company will also sell to China the technology to its cassette tape copier machine. **********Although the company has made plans to hire an additional 100 workers by June and raise $7 million through stock issues and debt, some analysts harbor doubts about whether the company will be able to handle the contract. Doubts Expressed **********''The Chinese Government may be left holding the bag,'' Dean Witter's Mr. Glazer said. ''This company doesn't have a track record.'' **********However, Mr. Clark, who has started two paper copier businesses in the past and sold them both, has more confidence.

REPORT", "body_text": " **********A United Nations study sharply critical of the International Monetary Fund's loans to South Africa has languished unpublished for more than a year, according to U.N. officials. **********The study charges that loans from the monetary fund have helped South Africa maintain its system of apartheid and have contributed to that country's military buildup. In addition it concludes that the I.M.F. has treated South Africa more favorably than other African countries and has ignored declarations by the General Assembly and Security Council that South Africa's occupation of Namibia is illegal. **********Jean Gazarian, director of General Assembly Affairs in the office of the Secretariat, said he could recall no other instances in which a United Nations report of this nature was not published as an official document and translated into the U.N.'s official languages.  He called the treatment of this report ''very strange'' but said he did not know what had happened. **********Special Panel's Project **********The study was commissioned by the Secretariat at the request of the Special Committee of 24. Its jurisdiction includes overseeing the carrying out of United Nations declarations on decolonization. **********Frank Abdulah, chairman of the Special Committee of 24, declined to say why the report had not been translated and disseminated like other U.N. studies. **********''I think you had better ask the United States Government that,'' said Mr. Abdulah, who is the chief representative to the United Nations from Trinidad and Tobago. **********The Reagan Administration, seeking to improve relations with South Africa, has allowed high-ranking South African military officers to come to the United States and has adopted a more flexible policy regarding sales of nuclear materials to South Africa. **********But Joan Dickie, an information officer at the United States Mission to the United Nations, rejected the idea that the United States had influenced any decision not to publish the report. ''We are not members of the Committee of 24,'' she said. ''We have no power to influence what the committee publishes or does not publish.'' **********The I.M.F.'s representative to the United Nations declined to make any public comment. Request for a New Loan **********The study has acquired new significance because South Africa recently requested a $1.1 billion loan from the monetary fund. A resolution opposing the loan was introduced by Guinea in the General Assembly yesterday. **********According to the study, some $543 million in South African drawings from the I.M.F. from 1975 to 1977 ''helped to pay increases in South African defense expenditures.'' During that period, South Africa's military outlays increased by $450 million, the study found. **********''Defense expenditures leading to budget deficits, budget deficits leading to inflation, inflation leading to balance-of-payments problems - that is the indirect path by which South Africa arrived at the I.M.F.'s door,'' the report said. ''In addition there was the direct increment to the balance-of-payments deficit caused by rising arms imports.'' **********The study charged that I.M.F. loans to South Africa have ''demonstrated to the world financial community that, despite increasingly violent confrontations between the majority black populations and the white minority Government in South Africa, the I.M.F. would continue to support the status quo and the white authorities.'' Share of Credits Analyzed **********Without I.M.F. loans, and the potential for future loans, the report continued, South Africa would be faced with the ''domestic financial and political costs of its controversial racial policies and of its illegal occupation of Namibia.'' **********During recent years, the report charged, South Africa received a ''disproportionate share'' of I.M.F. credits that went to African nations. As an example, the study noted that Nigeria, a nation of comparable economic stature, was a current net contributor of $592 million to the I.M.F. last year while South Africa had a net debt of $10 million. **********The report was sharply critical of the monetary fund's agreement in 1969 to buy gold from South Africa at the official price of $35 an ounce. The report said this decision was ''ostensibly'' for the purpose of stabilizing the world price of gold, but it added, ''In practice, the decision worked to aid South Africa and to destabilize world gold markets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/business/union-carbide-canada-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNION CARBIDE CANADA LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "UNION CARBIDE CANADA LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/business/kroger-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-9.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KROGER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 9", "print_headline": "KROGER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 9", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/08/business/advertising-mcdonald-s-in-dutch-shift.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonald's In Dutch Shift", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; McDonald's In Dutch Shift", "body_text": " **********There are some new business assignments that bring to the victorious agency more pleasure than the mere size of the billings would justify. **********Such is the landing of the McDonald's fast-food business in the Netherlands by the Dutch affiliate of Needham, Harper & Steers. **********The previous agency was the Leo Burnett Company, which a couple of years ago took McDonald's $53 million United States account away from N.H.& S.

Volcker, the board's chairman, should resign. **********''I can't respond to that because the Federal Reserve System is autonomous,'' the President said at a news conference, when asked if he agreed with recent calls for Mr. Volcker's resignation. ''There is no way I can comment on that,'' Mr. Reagan added. **********The President also said that the recent jump in the money supply, to an annual rate of growth far above the Federal Reserve's targets, ''sends, I think, the wrong signal to the money markets.'' He added that this signal had contributed to the recent stall in the decline in interest rates. **********'A Little Caution at Work' **********''I think there's a little caution at work, and perhaps a part of that is waiting to see what the Federal Reserve System is doing,'' the President said, in trying to explain why businesses are not investing significantly in response to the tax cuts and other incentives in his economic program. **********Aides to the President, right after the nationally televised news conference, sought to play down the impact of Mr. Reagan's remarks about Mr. Volcker, who is the architect of the tight monetary policy that has led to high interest rates. David Gergen, the senior White House spokes man, said that the President was not intending to avoid an endor sement of Mr. Volcker.  ''It was strictly a statement of neutrality,' ' he added. **********When asked why Mr. Reagan did not endorse Mr. Volcker, as he has in the past, Mr. Gergen said that the President did not intend the statement of neutrality to carry the implication that he did not endorse Mr. Volcker. Indication of Support **********Just a week ago, when Representative Jack F. Kemp, a Republican from upstate New York, suggested that Mr. Volcker resign, Larry Speakes, the deputy press secretary, indicated that the President supported Mr. Volcker's present policy. **********The statements today by Mr. Reagan and his aides added to the general confusion about the Administration's stand on monetary policy. Since last summer, the Administration has criticized the Federal Reserve for being both too tight and too easy in its control of the money supply - on both occasions attributing high interest rates to these factors. **********Nevertheless, the President's economic program endorses the Federal Reserve's general goal of slowly reducing the growth rate of the money supply over time. **********Before the President's news conference, the Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy and the Administration's economic policies were attacked by three winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, James C. Tobin of Yale University, Wassily Leontief of New York University and Lawrence R. Klein of the University of Pennsylvania. **********All three suggested, in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, that the current tight Federal Reserve policy was one of the key blocks to renewed growth and said that the Federal Reserve should ease its tight grip on the money supply. Mr. Tobin said that the only real route to a recovery in 1983 and 1984 was not tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the budget deficits, but ''an easier monetary policy.'' During the news conference, the President defended his economic policy in the face of the present recession by contending that the rise in unemployment, which is now expected to top 9 percent, had begun during the Carter Administration.  Administration officials could not say where the President got his figures for such a conclusion and did not defend the assertion. **********''I realize there's been an increase in unemployment,'' the President said. ''It's been a continuation of an increase that got under way in the last several months of 1980.'' **********''It was increasing very much more in the last six months of 1980,'' he added. Peak in October 1980 **********According to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate, which reached a peak in 1980 at 7.6 percent in October, was declining at the end of the year and into 1981, falling to 7 percent in July. It climbed to 8.9 percent last month. than in December 1980. The President also incorrectly said that the average unemployment rate in 1981 was 8.1 percent and, in 1980, 7.4 percent.  The correct Labor Department figures were 7.6 percent in 1981 and 7.1 percent in 1980. **********But Mr. Reagan was correct that, on average, there were one millionmore people w orking in 1981 compared with 1980.  Repeating h is statements that his program will lead to economic recovery and a decline in unemployment, the President said: ''I have the greatest sympathy, I think anyone does, for those who are unemployed.'' **********''But the people today have a lower interest rate than they had when we started,'' he went on. ''The inflation rate is sizably lower.'' **********And, Mr. Reagan added, ''we have in place a program now that is just getting under way that is designed to reduce the unemployment and to resolve these problems that are so bothersome today.'' Business Tax Cuts Defended **********The President also defended his business tax cuts, which were designed to spur new business investment, against recent Government figures showing that new investment is not increasing. It was in making this defense that Mr. Reagan said that the recent spurt in the money supply had helped stall the interest rate decline. **********The President said that the halt in the fall of interest rates was one of the reasons that businesses had not been investing in new plants and equipment in response to the business tax cuts. ''I don't think they have failed,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''I know that a great many industries have the plans all ready for modernization and expansion.'' He specifically cited the steel industry. **********But, he added, ''they want to be more sure that interest rates and inflation are going to continue coming down a s they have been.'' In making this comment, the President acknowledg ed what many outside economists have been contending about the Rea gan program - that the Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy, by k eeping interest rates high, could stop the investment boom that is the heart of the Administration's recovery program. **********Leading business executives, including top Reagan supporters, have said that they would not make a major push for new investment until they were sure that the economy was growing strongly again and the recession was over. Reflection of Regan Remarks **********The President's comments about the spurt in the money supply reflect remarks made recently by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan.  Through a spokesman tonight, Mr. Regan said that ''the President did not mean to imply any change in attitude toward the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; he was merely expressing his concern over the growth of the money supply in the last 10 to 12 weeks, a concern shared by the Federal Reserve.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/04/world/vietnam-and-china-engaging-in-renewed-verbal-hostilities.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1982-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 910, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VIETNAM AND CHINA ENGAGING IN RENEWED VERBAL HOSTILITIES", "print_headline": "VIETNAM AND CHINA ENGAGING IN RENEWED VERBAL HOSTILITIES", "body_text": " **********A series of border incidents during the Lunar New Year holiday last month has prompted new recriminations between China and Vietnam, which have been on hostile terms since their border war three years since their border war th ree years ago. **********Today The People's Daily accused Hanoi of hypocrisy in proposing a cease-fire on three recent occasions and then instigating 44 ''military provocations'' during the 10-day holiday that the Chinese call Chunjie and the Vietnamese call Tet. **********The article by Ji Ying of the New China News Agency charged that a Chinese peasant was killed and two others wounded along the rugged border of the southern provinces of Yunnan and Guanxi between Jan. 18 and 28. ''The Vietn amese authorities ''The Vietn amese authorities never tire of talking about their desire for pe ace, yet they have failed to show it in their actions,''the article s aid. **********Propaganda Coup by Hanoi **********The charges come only a few days after Vietnam scored a propaganda coup by encouraging the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to agree to mediate in the Chinese-Vietnamese border dispute. Mr. Perez de Cuellar assured Pham Van Dong, the Vietnamese Prime Minister, that he was ready to help ''contribute to a peaceful solution.''Mr. Perez de Cuellar has combined with Vietnam's public truce offers to put China on the defensive. The People's Daily took note of the Vietnamese proposals on Dec. 28, Jan. 14 and Jan. 30, and charged that Vietnam had circulated them at the United Nations ''in an attempt to achieve maximum benefit from this propaganda stunt.'' **********Some Peking-based diplomats have speculated that China must be particularly annoyed because it helped Mr. Perez de Cuellar obtain the post by its adamant opposition to another term for Kurt Waldheim. **********China told Vietnam last September that there could be no negotiations before Vietnamese forces pulled out of Cambodia. The Chinese have also contended that a truce is superfluous because the Vietnamese are to blame for the border hostilities. Convenient Point of Pressure **********''As long as Vietnam refrains from making any future military provocations or incursions into Chinese territory,'' The People's Daily said today, ''the question of fighting back simply will not arise and peace and tranquillity will prevail in the border area, festival or no festival.'' **********While it is almost impossible to determine who is at fault from the verbal exchanges, the Chinese have found the border a convenient point of pressure on Vietnam at a time when Hanoi is trying to buttress its client regime headed by Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh.  According to Western intelligence reports last year, the Chinese were tying down up to two-thirds of the Vietnamese Army, which might otherwise be available for duty in Cambodia. **********Peking also seems aware that any agreement with Hanoi would be interpreted in Asia as a softening of China's opposition to Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, particularly when other Southeast Asian nations are trying to promote a coalition of resistance movements there. China continues to champion the ousted regime of Pol Pot. **********But some diplomats here feel that Vietnam, realizing that China does not want to talk, may find it advantageous to press publicly for a truce while embarrassing the Chinese with border incidents. Five Violations Cited **********The Chinese press has been specific about at least five violations that it said took place recently. On Jan. 18 the Vietnamese were accused of shelling a village in the Hekou Autonomous County of Yunnan Province. On Jan. 22 Tan Jianmao, a commune member in Guanxi Province, was killed while traveling to visit relatives in a nearby village. **********On Jan. 25, the Chinese charge, Vietnamese fired at and broke up a holiday celebration in the Guanxi town of Congxin, while firing into the Hekou area on the same day for three hours. The next day, the Chinese assert, two civilians in Yunnan were wounded by Vietnamese mines. **********The Vietnamese had previously said that Chinese troops fired across the border or intruded into Vietnamese territory on more than a dozen occasions between Dec. 28 and Jan. 13. Paracel and Spratley Islands **********The quarrel has extended to conflicting claims of sovereignty over the barren Paracel and Spratley Islands in the South China Sea. These scattered reefs and atolls have taken on value because of the possibility that oil may be found in the area. **********Last month the Chinese press buttressed Peking's claim with a long historical study seeking to show that the Chinese had been there first. Vietnam responded by publishing a ''white paper'' and a long magazine article supporting its claim to the islands. **********So me conflicting reports are mirror images of each other. On Jan.  15 China announced that it had freed seven Vi etnamese soldiers captured while ''intruding into Chinese terri tory to conduct reconnaisance and sabotage,'' as well as four grateful Vietnamese fishermen whose boat sank while illegally in Chinese waters. At the same time, China said, 11 Chinese ''illegally captured and detained''were returned by Vietnam. **********On the same day, Vietnam announced that it had released ''11 Chinese captured while illegally intruding into Vietnamese territory'' o n spy missions, and that 11 Vietnamese ''kidnapped whileworking on Vi etnamese territory by intruding Chinese soldiers'' were handed back t o Vietnam."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/21/world/in-congress-the-invasion-has-eroded-israel-s-almost-automatic-support.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1982-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1398, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN CONGRESS, THE INVASION HAS ERODED ISRAEL'S ALMOST AUTOMATIC SUPPORT", "print_headline": "IN CONGRESS, THE INVASION HAS ERODED ISRAEL'S ALMOST AUTOMATIC SUPPORT", "body_text": " **********After six weeks of war in Lebanon, Israel's support in Congress has been significantly eroded to what some members describe as its lowest point. But in their view it has not reached the stage where substantial numbers would oppose further American aid to Israel. **********In more than a score of interviews, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress warned that an Israeli assault on west Beirut could bring a change in support for Israel and lead to moves for legislative retribution. **********Already, both critics and long-time supporters of Israel talk freely of ''a wave of revulsion'' caused by pictures of civilian casualties in Lebanon and of a shift in the almost automatic support Israel has enjoyed in Congress. They say there is frustration at the use of American arms by an ally that feels unrestrained in taking actions that jeopardize United States interests in the Middle East. **********Anger Directed at Leaders **********Both in Congress and in the Reagan Administration, the frustration is directed at Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon. Leading members of Congress repeatedly draw a distinction between their support for Israel and disagreement with Mr. Begin's policies. **********The Administration has been careful to mute its irritation with the Begin Government. But senior officials say President Reagan and his aides have been particularily chagrined in recent days over the Israeli effort to cut off water, power, food and the movement of Red Cross officials into west Beirut, all widely reported on television and in the press. **********''It could turn out to be, if it continues this way, Israel's Vietnam,'' said Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. **********Representative William S. Broomfield, Republican of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ''We're going to have some real problems on future legislation unless there is a clarification on the use of American arms. Israel is going to have a lot of work to do to restore the support they have had. It has been severely affected. For the first time we are getting letters saying, 'Why don't we do something?' '' **********Some members of Congress, including steady backers of Israel, say the mood of displeasure with Israel is already sufficient for a sizable group to endorse a cutoff in shipments of cluster bombs to Israel, because their use is controversial in combat where there are heavy civilian casualties. 'A Vehicle for a Reprimand' **********''If there were a vote on that, it's the kind of thing that could carry,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who has consistently backed Israel. ''It provides a vehicle for a reprimand. That would satisfy those who are critical of Israel without significantly altering our basic relationship.'' **********Others, like Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat and an outspoken supporter of Israel, have privately warned Ambassador Moshe Arens that Israel will face difficulties in sustaining its previously unassailable and largely uncritical support for high levels of economic and military aid. **********No aid program for Israel is due for a Congressional vote until late fall, probably after the November elections. Congressional leaders consider foreign aid generally too unpopular to bring to a vote before the election. The prevailing view is that a vote on aid to Israel toward the end of the year will be affected more by later developments than by the current critical mood. **********''The Israelis have made some serious mistakes as it affects their relations with us and the West,'' said Senator Henry M. Jackson, a Washington Democrat who has been one of Israel's staunchest supporters, ''but the final judgment will only come when one knows what the final results will be in Lebanon.'' **********There are backers of Israel, like Senator Dodd and Representative Jonathan B. Bingham, Democrat of the Bronx, who contend that the current displeasure with Israel amounts more to ''rhetorical criticism'' than any substantive shift of support. **********But Senator Jackson and others, like Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, suggest that deeper damage may have been done. They cite accumulating displeasure in Congress that Prime Minister Begin has undertaken a series of actions that many regard as offensive use of American weapons supplied for defensive purposes, without apparent regard to the effect on American links to the Arab world. They mentioned Israeli air attacks on an Iraqi nuclear reactor and on Palestinian areas around Beirut last year as well as the invasion of Lebanon. **********Before the Israelis moved into Lebanon on June 6, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the Administration's request for $1.7 billion in military aid and $785 million in economic aid for Israel in 1983, and at the urging of Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee increased the economic aid level to $910 million. **********Mr. Cranston's aides estimate that the $125 million aid increase would not pass the committee today. Ambassador Cites Support **********Ambassador Arens said many of Israel's traditional supporters remained unshaken by recent events, citing conversations with such Democratic Senators as Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Gary Hart of Colorado, Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and Carl Levin of Michigan, and Republicans like Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota and Steven D. Symms of Idaho. **********Few of them, however, have spoken out on Israel's behalf, either during floor debate or during the recent confirmation hearings of Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********While careful to reassert American commitments to Israel and its security, Mr. Shultz was unusually outspoken for an unconfirmed appointee in criticizing the Begin Government's policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank and removing elected Arab mayors there and in the Gaza Strip. Moreover, he commented pointedly on the civilian casualties in Lebanon, saying, ''We cannot accept the loss of life brought home to us every day on our television screens.'' **********In the midst of diplomatic negotiations with the Begin Government, the Reagan Administration has kept its frustrations private. Except for a current holdup of a shipment of cluster-type artillery shells for Israel, the Administration is allowing American economic and military aid to Israel to continue. Since the Lebanese hostilities began, however, the White House has delayed formal notification to Congress of a new order of F-16 fighter-bombers, due in 1983. **********Sharp criticism of the Begin Government has become increasingly common in Congress. ''The love affair with Israel from the time of Golda Meir is gone because of Begin,'' said Senator Paul E. Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''How can I be concerned about human rights in El Salvador and the Soviet Union and not speak out on Lebanon?'' **********In the House, Representative Jim Wright, the majority leader, said he had not discerned any deep shift of opinion ''that would shake the longstanding and special relationship with Israel, and I find no sympathy with the Palestine Liberation Organization.'' **********But, he went on, ''many members feel that Begin tends to be hostile, rigid and inflexible, and that makes it more difficult to see a solution to the Palestinian issue.'' Need for Arms Is Questioned **********In the months ahead, Israel could find its military aid challenged because of its prowess in Lebanon. Representative Mickey Leland, a Texas Democrat, said he had come back from Lebanon feeling that Israel's military supremacy was so unchallengeable that future military aid should be subject to ''closer scrutiny'' on the ground that it might not be needed to preserve Israel's military superiority over the Arabs. **********Eight other Representatives, led by Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat of Syrian descent, and Nick J. Rahall, a West Virginia Democrat of Lebanese descent, have introduced a resolution calling for a halt in all American military aid to the Middle East if it is determined that American equipment is being used for aggressive purposes. **********''By killing Lebanese, the Israelis have given other parts of the Middle East a voice,'' said Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland. ''I think when they crossed the Litani River and went beyond the P.L.O. sanctuary in southern Lebanon into Lebanon proper, at that point the Israelis changed something in the atmosphere here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/07/world/few-in-hong-kong-seek-democracy.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1982-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FEW IN HONG KONG SEEK DEMOCRACY", "print_headline": "FEW IN HONG KONG SEEK DEMOCRACY", "body_text": " **********In Hong Kong's colonial system of government, a relative handful of Britons have complete control, even though 98 percent of the city-state's five-million-plus residents are Chinese. **********Yet with the negotiations over Hong Kong's future just under way, begun two weeks ago when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain met in Peking with Chinese leaders, the vast majority of the British crown colony's people want to retain the British administration without any real changes for the foreseeable future, according to public opinion polls. **********Under the present setup, the Governor, Sir Edward Youde, in consultation with the executive and legislative councils, makes all policy decisions. Though there are some Chinese members of the two councils, they are all appointed by the British administrators, not elected by the populace. **********The system of government is, in many ways, as contradictory and anomalous as Hong Kong itself - a colony in an anticolonial era.  For example, when Mrs. Thatcher was in Peking, Hong Kong was engaged in its largest exercise of democratic expression in its history, the election of representatives to so-called city district boards. These boards have been established as a vehicle for gathering views from the people on matters of public concern. Reluctance to Vote **********Despite a big get-out-the-vote effort by the Government, only 12 percent of the two million people eligible to vote bothered to exercise their privilege. **********''The Government is pushing people to the polls,'' acknowledged Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at Hong Kong's Chinese University and a leading critic of the Government. ''It is the people who are reluctant to vote.'' **********There are several reasons for the apparent political apathy in Hong Kong. With more than 40 percent of the population immigrants and the colony's future uncertain, there is a sense of impermanence to Hong Kong that makes people less inclined to be politically active. **********Moreover, even the Government's harshest critics describe British rule as a ''benevolent dictatorship.'' In the mid-1970's, for instance, the Government established statuatory holidays. In 1979 and 1981, rent control legislation was enacted. In both cases, social programs were enacted by government fiat that the labor unions were too weak to push for and the business community resisted, according to political experts. Hands-Off Government **********In addition, Hong Kong is renowned for its brand of hands-off government with low taxes, and public-sector spending and services, while expanding, is kept to a minimum. **********Because of the Government's limited scope, some residents are not particularly anxious to have a voice in shaping its activities. ''The Government does very little for us,'' said Shirley Woo, a 25-year-old office worker, who did not vote in the district board elections.  ''Why should we care about it?'' **********Rising wages and living standards afforded by Hong Kong's rapid economic growth and a policy of giving the Chinese elite appointed positions in Government have also blunted demands for a more democratic system. **********However, the portion of Hong Kong's population that is seeking more direct participation in Government, though still a minority, is growing. About 60 percent of all residents are under 30 years old, and their levels of education and expectations are higher than their parents, many of whom were refugees. Talks on Hong Kong's Future **********One force that should heighten political awareness, analysts say, is the Peking-London negotiations over the future of Hong Kong after 1997, when the lease covering 90 percent of the colony's land runs out. **********China has stated that it will reassert its sovereignty over all of Hong Kong by 1997. Britain says that the 19th-century treaties that created the colony are still valid, though they can be altered. **********For years, it has been understood that the Peking leadership would not permit Hong Kong to become an independent, self-governing state, or ''a third China,'' Taiwan being the second. This has allowed Britain to run Hong Kong without opening the Government up to elected representatives from the local Chinese community. **********Now, one likely compromise in the British-Chinese talks appears to be a long transition period, up to 40 years, during which the British presence is gradually phased out. Presumably, local Chinese would then be phased in. ''It's very clear that there will be a transition period,'' Mr. Cheng said. ''There can be no excuse for keeping local Chinese out anymore.'' System Characterized as Relic **********As a first step, Mr. Cheng thinks that there should be elected representatives on the legislative council within five years.  Many British Government officials here agree. In private conversations, they are among the first to characterize the present system as a relic of a bygone era. But first, they emphasize, an agreement must be worked out with China, preferably within a year to restore business confidence by removing uncertainties about Hong Kong's future. **********So for the time being, the British administration must remain as the reassuring symbol of the ''stability and prosperity'' in Hong Kong that Peking and London agree are key objectives of the current negotiations. **********''This benevolent dictatorship isn't 100 percent what I'd like, maybe not even 80 percent,'' said Ronald Li, chairman of Hong Kong's Far East stock exchange. ''But 60 percent is better than a lot of the alternatives.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/world/3-scale-himalayan-peak.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Scale Himalayan Peak", "print_headline": "3 Scale Himalayan Peak", "body_text": " **********Two Italians and their Sherpa guide reached the top of the world's third-highest peak, the 28,208-foot Kanchenjunga.

New Jersey is struggling to come up with some new sources of tax revenues. Indeed, in cities and states across the country, governments are scraping to find ways of cutting costs and raising revenues to bring their budgets into balance. **********For many investors, this walk along a financial tightrope poses a tricky question. Municipal bonds are still offering tax-exempt yields in the 10 percent range and, now that interest rates have plunged, the rates look particularly attractive. But are they safe? **********In general, municipal bond experts say yes. Cautious investors may want to be more quality-conscious than usual, they advise, and stick only to the highest-rated bonds - those rated AAA. But few, if any, defaults are expected, and specialists predict that virtually all of these bonds will continue to pay interest. **********''This is a unique opportunity to buy municipal bonds, because rates have shot up again because of a lot of technical reasons, including the fact that are so many issuers coming to market now,'' said Robert Dennis, manager of the MFS Managed Municipal Bond Trust, a $150 million mutual fund. ''Things would really have to be pretty catastrophic nationwide for a major state or city to come close to default.'' **********Hyman C. Grossman, a municipals specialist at Standard & Poor's, one of the leading rating agencies, concurred. ''Cities and states, as such, don't go bankrupt, although they can default,'' he said.  ''But I think cities have learned that the penalties of default are quite severe. What I think will happen is that there will be some close calls. By and large the municipalities will pay, but we will be in for a year or two of strain.'' **********Richard J. Franke, president of John Nuveen & Company, a municipal bond firm, also believes the risks to investors are not overwhelming. ''We came through the 1969 recession and the 1974 recession all right, and I don't think this cycle will be any different or any worse,'' he said. ''It is simply a case of municipal bodies coming to grips with what they have to do. There is always a lag -a period when the deficit might grow - because politicians don't want to cut back services and do want to get re-elected. But as their credit ratings are put under pressure, they will do what they have to do.'' **********The bigger risk for investors, experts say, is buying municipal issues whose credit ratings are subsequently lowered. There have been widespread rating reductions among municipals in the past two years, and experts predict there will be many more. In such cases, the municipalities generally keep paying interest, but their lower credit ratings usually translate into lower prices for their bonds in the market. **********''Washington State is a good example,'' said the municipals chief at one major Wall Street firm who asked not to be identified. ''I am convinced Washington will keep paying its debt. But its credit rating has been reduced several times in the past year or so. And, suddenly, the bond you paid $100 for originally may be worth only $92, because of a reduced credit rating.'' **********But even this risk may be worth taking now, municipal specialists say. Most experts are predicting that municipal rates will fall, producing capital gains for municipal bond holders. And such gains could outweigh any losses suffered because a bond has been downgraded. **********Investment experts note that municipal investors who wish to be as cautious as possible have several options.  One option is simply to diversify their municipal holdings.  Following that option might be easiest for an investor with about $100,000 to place in municipal bonds, a sum that could buy a variety of issues. This approach, though, still requires a lot of study or good advice to pick quality issues. **********For investors with less money, however, probably the best approach is to invest in a mutual fund or a unit investment trust. These investments offer the opportunity to share in a diversified pool of municipal bonds, chosen by a someone who follows the municipal markets closely. **********That is not to say, of course, that such funds never hold bonds that run into problems. But even if one or two municipalities in the portfolio were to run into difficulty, they would represent only a fraction of the investor's holdings. **********''Diversification always limits your risk,'' said Alan Lerner, a senior vice president and credit market expert at Bankers Trust Company. ''But whether it limits it enough is another question.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/05/business/peoples-energy-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PEOPLES ENERGY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "PEOPLES ENERGY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/11/business/integrated-energy-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTEGRATED ENERGY INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "INTEGRATED ENERGY INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/business/broadview-financial-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BROADVIEW FINANCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BROADVIEW FINANCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/05/business/canada-reaches-oil-agreements.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Reaches Oil Agreements", "print_headline": "Canada Reaches Oil Agreements", "body_text": " **********The Canadian federal Government concluded oil exploration agreements worth $263 million (in Canadian currency) under which Shell Canada Resources Ltd. would drill six deep-water wells along the Scotian Shelf, Energy Minister Marc Lalonde announced. **********The accord is the first signed under the energy exploration regime agreed on by Nova Scotia province and the federal Government.

Maksymilian Kolbe, who was canonized yesterday by Pope John Paul II, has become an inspiration for the message of hope over despair. **********Father Kolbe's canonization was unusual in that his cause was followed not only by Roman Catholics but also by all those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis. **********Father Kolbe was one of 2,801 priests, nuns and monks to be killed by the Nazis in Poland in World War II. He sacrificed himself at Auschwitz by volunteering to take the place of an inmate who had been chosen as part of a group of 10 to be killed in retaliation for the escape of a prisoner. **********By his sacrifice, Father Kolbe became known as a priest of extraordinary courage and faith. His elevation to sainthood was seen as an important denunciation of the Nazi horrors by the Roman Catholic Church. 2 Departures From Procedure **********The circumstances of Father Kolbe's death were recognized by the church as significant enough that at least two departures were warranted from the normal procedure that confers sainthood. **********One distinction was that the Pope waived the general requirement that verifiable miracles be attributed to the candidate. The Rev.  Ambrogio Sanna, who promoted the cause of Father Kolbe, said the Pope had made an exception on the ground that ''the martyr's life and death were of such evident holiness.'' **********The other distinction was that Pope Paul VI personally conducted the rite of beatification - the conferring of the title ''blessed'' - which is the step preliminary to sainthood, on Oct. 17, 1971. Under regular practice, a cardinal would have conducted the ceremony, but Pope Paul broke with tradition in order to underscore the meaning of the event for the wider world. **********''Millions of beings were sacrificed to the pride of force and madness of racialism,'' Pope Paul said that day. ''But in that darkness there glows the figure of Maksymilian Kolbe. Over that immense antechamber of deaths, there hovers his divine and imperishable word of life: redeeming love.'' 'Brightest and Glittering Figure' **********In the same dedication, Pope Paul called Father Kolbe ''perhaps the brighest and glittering figure to emerge from the darkness and degradation of the Nazi epoch.'' **********He was born in 1894 in a small Polish village.  From early childhood he showed an absorption with spiritual matters. At age 10, he had related to his mother a vision in which the Virgin Mary asked him to select one of two crowns, a white one that stood for purity and a red one that signified martrydom. He reportedly said, ''I choose both.'' By age 13, he had set his sights on the priesthood. **********He was often ill in his early years, but his illnesses appear to have deepened his religious convictions. Though he was confined with tuberculosis for four years, he seems to have spent much of that time cultivating inner spirituality. **********After completing basic schooling in Poland, he left for Rome to study at the Gregorian University, a Jesuit insitution, where he earned doctorates in theology and philosophy. **********Ordained by the Franciscans at age 21, Father Kolbe finished his studies in Rome and within two years undertook an initiative that signaled the direction his life and work would take. **********Turning from scholarly pursuits, he founded, in 1917, the Militia of Mary Immaculate, an evangelistic organization dedicated to converting the world to Roman Catholicism. In this bold act, he showed the penchant for individualism, fearlessness and intense devotion to Mary that would mark his vocation until his death at age 47. 'We Can Convert the Whole World' **********He would tell his brothers in 1938: ''Of ourselves we can do nothing, but with the help of the Immaculate One we can convert the whole world. Yes, I tell you we will cast the world at her feet.'' **********As a young priest fresh from Rome, Father Kolbe returned to Poland to work on his own toward the fulfillment of his personal goals. A key factor in the growth of his mission was his publication of a monthly magazine, Knight of the Immaculate, which eventually reached a circulation in the hundreds of thousands. **********In 1927 he furthered the movement significantly by founding a monastery at Niepokalinow, 25 miles southwest of Warsaw. In the 1930's, the monastery was a bustling community of 700 friars and workers engaged in a variety of enterprises, including medicine, dentistry, printing, broadcasting and farming. In 1939 when Hitler attacked Poland, the monestary became a haven for refugees. Strongly opposed to the Nazis, Father Kolbe was arrested in February 1941 on the suspicion of being an enemy of the Third Reich and was sent to Auschwitz. **********Though ravaged by the war and postwar policies in Poland, the monastery continues its work, a monument to its founder.  Father Kolbe poured his prodigious energies into building the community into a force that would combat what he saw as the enemies of atheism and warfare. In taking on this mission, he relied on a theology that, in certain respects, sounds outmoded to many Roman Catholics influenced by the thinking of the Second Vatican Council.  His view of Mary takes on a particularly strange cast to many modern Catholics. **********Father Kolbe's writings contain an exalted concept of Mary that some critics say has been amended by the theological pronouncement of Vatican II. In particular, emphasis at the Council was placed on Mary's role as an intercessor who is subordinate to the Trinity, though just below Christ in rank within the church. **********Theology aside, the memory of Father Kolbe's many acts of mercy at Auschwitz have soared above all other considerations. Of the 10 prisoners condemned to die by starvation, he was the last to perish, meanwhile caring for the agonies of the others and encouraging them with words of Christian hope. The Nazis, in need of the hut where the prisoners were being kept, had to inject carbolic acid into the priest's arm to complete the reprisal. **********The act of martyrdom became the cornerstone of the heroic virtues that raised him to the attention of the church and the world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/28/business/st-regis-paper-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ST REGIS PAPER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ST REGIS PAPER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/08/business/rpm-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RPM INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "print_headline": "RPM INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/25/world/guerrillas-free-7-hondurans-progress-in-talks-is-reported.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guerrillas Free 7 Hondurans; Progress In Talks Is Reported", "print_headline": "Guerrillas Free 7 Hondurans; Progress In Talks Is Reported", "body_text": " **********Guerrillas freed seven more hostages today, and the Government said it expected the rebels' weeklong occupation of the Chamber of Commerce building to end early Saturday. **********The release of two brothers this afternoon and five other Honduran businessmen late in the evening left 32 people captive, less than a third of the original number. **********''It is most likely that the terrorists will leave the city tomorrow,'' said Amilcar Santamaria, a presidential spokesman.

Net income, meanwhile, jumped 42.1 percent, to $2.7 million, or 85 cents a share, from $1.9 million, or 65 cents a share. Sales for the second fiscal quarter ended Feb. 28, 1982, rose 57 percent, to $9.1 million, from $5.8 million a year earlier, while profits climbed 70 percent, to $952,000, or 29 cents a share, from $559,000, or 18 cents a share. **********Last October, at a time Matrix shares were quoted at $18, F.  Eberstadt & Company recommended the company ''strongly.'' And last March, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith changed its recommendation from ''O.K. to buy'' to ''buy.'' Yesterday, the stock closed on the Amex at 22 3/4, down 3/8. **********In its report, Merrill Lynch said it based its revised opinion on ''continued strong fundamentals.'' It said that for the near term it saw no negative impact on the company's fundamentals because of the economic environment, and it forecast a sharp rise in company profits for the full year. This strong outlook, it added, suggested the company's ''ability to sustain above-average growth during the recession period.'' **********Davis Skaggs & Company, a San Francisco brokerage house, in another favorable recommendation noted that Matrix's sales in the last two and a half years rose at a compound annual rate of 38 percent and were complemented by an earnings growth rate of more than 50 percent a year. It forecast that Matrix's growth rate in the next two years would top 50 percent annually. **********In a current report, Value Line's special situations service, for sophisticated investors, is also recommending it. ''Over all,'' Value Line said, ''we expect Matrix's sales to grow 30 percent to 35 percent annually for the next three to five years, to about $100 million, by 1984 to 1986.'' It said such earnings, should they develop, suggested that the market price for Matrix could rise substantially in the same period. **********The Matrix device has broad applications. Hospitals and clinics use it in diagnostic scanning; Honeywell, to get pictures of new electronic circuits, and the University of Miami weather service, to study hurricanes. **********As explained by Franklin G. Bishop, president of the company, a Matrix machine produces photographs fed from a scanning device to a computer to a television screen, and from the TV screen to film.  Unlike the typical TV screen, however, this screen is exceptionally sharp, with the pictures taken from it just as sharp. **********But, until Polaroid's new 35-millimeter instant slide is available, the process continues to be relatively expensive or timeconsuming. Currently, for example, an 8-inch-by-10-inch Polaroid print can be made almost instantly with the Matrix device but costs $7.50, Mr. Bishop noted. And a user might have to take many photographs, at $7.50 each, before finding one suitable for his needs. **********With the new Polaroid process, however, a roll of 35-millimeter Polaroid film can be shot and processed quickly and cheaply. Once an acceptable slide is found, it can either be projected on a movie screen, used to make color prints (at a cost of roughly $1.50 each for the 5-by-8 size) or to make Xerox color copies, although few such machines are available because the demand has never developed. **********The State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company had owned 7 percent of the company's stock but sold it about two weeks ago at $19 a share, Mr. Bishop said. Kemper Financial Services owns 6 percent of the stock, he noted. Company officers and directors hold 21 percent more, with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop owning 8 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/02/world/russians-skeptical-on-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1982-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RUSSIANS SKEPTICAL ON ARMS TALKS", "print_headline": "RUSSIANS SKEPTICAL ON ARMS TALKS", "body_text": " **********Senator Larry Pressler said today that he found ''a great deal of skepticism'' about the prospects for a new strategic arms agreement when he met with the Soviet official who will head the Soviet delegation to the talks in Geneva. **********The South Dakota Republican, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on arms control, said that the Soviet official, Viktor P. Karpov, and other senior Soviet officials sharply questioned President Reagan's sincerity in agreeing to the new talks that will begin June 29 and in calling for reductions in the two sides' strategic arsenals. In particular, the Senator said, the Soviet officials said that they considered it ''not a very realistic judgment at all'' to expect a new pact before the end of Mr. Reagan's Presidential term in 1985. **********Mr. Pressler, a strong supporter of Mr. Reagan's military policies, said that the Soviet attitude seemed to be captured by a jesting remark made to Mr. Karpov by Viktor G. Komplektov, chief of the Foreign Ministry's American department. The Senator said that after the Soviet officials had waved away his remarks about Mr. Reagan's wanting an early agreement, perhaps in as little as 18 months, Mr.  Komplektov turned to Mr. Karpov and said: ''You've just got a 10-year job.'' **********A skeptical tone also was struck in the first Soviet press commentary on the announcement of a starting date for the Geneva talks. The official press agency Tass, in an article by its military affairs commentator, Vladimir Bogachyov, said that while Mr.  Reagan's agreement to resume negotiations was ''a step in the right direction'' it was to be hoped that it was not solely a gesture to placate public opinion before the President's trip to Western Europe, which begins Wednesday. **********On the positive side, the commentary said that ''one should welcome'' Mr. Reagan's commitment that the United States will not ''undercut'' previous arms agreements with the Soviet Union so long as the Kremlin does the same. **********Senator Pressler said that Georgi A. Arbatov, director of the Institute of the United States and Canada, had used the word ''extremists'' to describe President Reagan's team of arms negotiators, including Edward L.

Shlaudeman, and other embassy officials had met with opposition political leaders in an attempt to ''destabilize'' the military Government led by Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. **********The newspaper accusations cited unidentified sources high in the military Government. Argentine journalists and Western diplomats said the sources for the accusations were leading officers in the junta. **********''The United States Embassy flatly denies any inappropriate conduct,'' the embassy statement said, ''and has no real idea what this is all about.'' **********The accusations raise a potentially dangerous issue when relations between Washington and Buenos Aires are already strained because of United States support for Britain in the Falkland conflict. A number of United States diplomats, businessmen and journalists have received threats, and the embassy has evacuated some dependents. **********In military action, the Argentine high command acknowledged that British warplanes damaged two Argentine transport ships today in an attack in the channel between the two main Falkland islands. It said one of the ships had been set afire but did not mention casualties. Ship Is Believed to Be Lost **********An earler communique said British jets today attacked Darwin, 50 miles west of Stanley, the capital of the Falklands, and Fox Bay, 25 miles to the south. The communique said the attacks were ''without consequences and were repelled by our forces stationed there.'' **********Senior officers also said today that a missing interisland supply ship had probably been sunk, with its more than 30 crewmen lost.  The Argentine officers said the ship, the Isla de los Estados, could have been the one that the British said they blew up Monday night in the Falkland channel. **********Concerning diplomatic efforts to settle the dispute, Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez tonight criticized the delay in mediation at the United Nations while Britain's negotiators conferred back in London. ''What bothers me most,'' he told reporters here, ''is not the question of the recent British attacks but the delay in the negotiations, the refusal to accept a normal and reasonable dialogue, which is due entirely to the intransigent position of Great Britain.'' **********Mr. Costa Mendez, heartened by the European Common Market's delay until Monday of a vote on extending trade sanctions against Argentina, said he hoped that the embargo would not be renewed. He said it would ''help in the peace negotitions'' if the Common Market did not support British ''military action'' by renewing the sanctions. **********The campaign here against the American Embassy is directed only at the embassy, and it may involve divisions within the military on the attitude toward the United States. The navy has been the service most angered at the United States for its support of Britain in the crisis. But some leaders, including President Galtieri, have gone out of their way not to criticize the United States, particularly since the two-day visit last week by a special envoy, Vernon A. Walters. Galtieri Says He Is Saddened **********In a television interview today, General Galtieri said he was greatly saddened by the United States support for Britain. ''I have had the opportunity of being close to and living with the American people, and I know what they feel,'' said the general, who took an advanced engineer officer's course at Fort Belvoir, Va., in 1960. **********La Nacion, a daily close to the Government, reported in a frontpage article today that some senior members of the Government were pressing the junta to file an official protest note with the State Department regarding Ambassador Shlaudeman. **********La Nacion, Clarin and La Prensa, the three largest newspapers in the country, have reported that military leaders complained to Mr.  Walters about Mr. Shlaudeman and other embassy officials during the special envoy's visit here. They said Mr. Walters replied that he would carry the complaints back to Washington. Said to Meet With Peronists **********There have been persistent newspaper reports here for two weeks that Ambassador Shlaudeman had met with opposition Peronist leaders, even though the Peronists are more anti-American and nationalistic over the Falklands than the military. **********Western diplomats here say that since the Falkland crisis began the United States Embassy has cut back on its normal contacts with leaders of different sectors of Argentine society, including opposition political and labor leaders. It cut back even further after the Reagan Administration announced two weeks ago that it was siding with Britain in the conflict. **********Sources close to Mr. Shlaudeman said the Ambassador had not met with any opposition leaders since Argentina seized the Falklands April 2. **********The sources said Mr. Shlaudeman, who was deputy chief of mission in Chile in 1973 when President Salvador Allende Gossens was overthrown in a military coup, has been sensitive to charges that the United States aided that coup. They said he had assiduously sought to avoid even the appearance of any such involvement ever since. **********Mr. Shlaudeman was Ambassador in Peru before coming here in 1980, the year the Peruvian military handed power to a democratic Government. **********One Western diplomat said the accusations against the embassy were part of an attempt by some members of the Government to find ''a scapegoat'' in the Falkland crisis. The country is united behind the militarry in the fight to hold onto the islands, but the rejuvenated political parties have made it clear that they expect to share government power after the crisis ends.

While the dollar is expected to remain strong, the decline is likely to continue well into 1983, according to economists, traders and foreign exchange experts. **********Since early November, the dollar has dropped by more than 12 percent against the Japanese yen, 6 percent against the West German mark and 7 percent against the Swiss franc. Nevertheless, the dollar is still overvalued, analysts say. A year ago, for example, the dollar was trading 11 percent lower against the yen and 8 percent lower against the mark than at Friday's close on New York foreign exchange markets. **********''The dollar is likely to weaken over the next 12 months, but it will still be strong,'' said Lars H. Thunnell, a vice president at the American Express Company. Significance for Exports **********The decline is not steep enough yet to suit American exporters, whose products have grown uncompetitive in world markets. Even if the dollar's drop continues, experts say, it will be another six months at least before the drop could generate a turn in export orders.  Despite the lag, few denied that both the domestic and international economy would profit from a cheaper dollar. **********''At this point everyone is trying to reduce imports simultaneously,'' said Ann Parker Mills, a vice president at the Irving Trust Company. ''A cheaper dollar, particularly against the yen, is very positive in terms of an offset to protectionist pressures.'' **********Two main factors are driving down the value of the dollar, according to currency specialists: rising current-account deficits and a change in Federal Reserve Board policy. **********After posting surpluses during the first and second quarters of the year, the United States' current account balance, which includes trade in goods and services as well as dividend and interest payments, has turned sharply negative. In the third quarter, it fell to a deficit of $4.2 billion. That gap is expected to widen, and some economists say 1983's deficit could easily exceed the record $14.7 billion in 1978. **********Current-account deficits are an important determinant of exchange rate values because they increase the net supply of a currency on the market. When the United States imports more goods and services than it exports, the supply of dollars is increased in foreign exchange markets, suggesting that supply is greater than demand and forcing down the price of the dollar. **********''At this point, the final move by the United States into what could become a record current-account deficit is the key thing determining the value of the dollar,'' said Paul L. Newhart, manager of foreign exchange at the Dupont Company. Shift in Fed Policy **********Most experts acknowledge that America's deteriorating trade position will be an increasingly important factor determining future exchange rate movements. However, many say that a shift in Federal Reserve policy - and the Administration's support of that change - is the main reason for the dollar's current and expected further decline. **********Over the past two years, the Fed's anti-inflation policies have kept interest rates high relative to those elsewhere, pulling large amounts of foreign money into United States capital markets and pushing the value of the dollar ever higher. As long as the Fed was perceived as maintaining its tight money approach, interest rate differentials continued to be the key in determining the value of the dollar. **********Perhaps the best example of the strength of the Fed's credibility occurred in the third quarter, when substantial declines in interest rates failed to prevent the value of the dollar from rising to record levels. Now, however, the focus is beginning to shift. **********''The importance of interest rate differentials began to wane after the Fed would no longer concentrate'' on growth of M-1, a measure of the nation's basic money supply, said Jonathan Francis, director of foreign exchange forecasting services at Wharton Econometrics. ''But it was not until early November that the markets began to believe it, and expectations were changed.'' **********Jonathan Lopatin, a member of Bank of America's financial markets advisory service group in New York, agrees with that view.  ''There has been a tremendous shift in attitudes about the dollar in the last few weeks,'' Mr. Lopatin said. ''Up until then, the monetarism of the Fed was the anchor against which traders turned a blind eye. Now, for the first time in a long, long time, the markets are turning their attention to other variables, like rising current account deficits.'' Indirect Market Intervention **********The reasons for a shift in Fed policy were compelling, said W.H.  Bruce Brittain, a vice president at Salomon Brothers. **********''With the rest of the world waiting for the American economy to recover, the Fed is the only institution capable of doing something about the slowdown in the domestic economy and also reducing the debt burden of the developing countries,'' Mr. Brittain said. ''The only way they can do that is to pump up the liquidity of the American banking system. It is in response to that change that the dollar has weakened since November and is likely to decline further through the first six months of 1983.'' **********An apparent change in attitude on the part of the Reagan Administration about the severe economic problems created by the strong dollar - and the way to solve them - may also be playing a part in the market's shifting psychology, Mr. Francis said. The Administration, which remains committed in a rhetorical sense against intervening in foreign exchange markets, may in practice be doing something else. **********''Monetary officials say their position on intervention in foreign exchange markets remains unchanged,'' Mr. Francis said, ''but the loans extended to Mexico and Brazil during the third quarter represent an indirect form of market intervention, because by extending those loans the authorities are stabilizing the peso and the cruzeiro. The major reason why the dollar is likely to fall next year is that the Administration finally recognizes what its policy of tight money has actually done to the international economy,'' **********With the exception of the French franc and the Italian lira, most experts agree the dollar is likely to weaken generally against other major currencies, and particularly against the yen, which could rise another 10 percent by the end of 1983. Despite the slide, the sharp reduction in the domestic inflation rate and the relative stability of America's political and economic climate make it unlikely the dollar will be oversold next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/24/business/united-canso-oil-gas-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED CANSO OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "UNITED CANSO OIL & GAS LTD reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/13/business/wainoco-oil-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAINOCO OIL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "WAINOCO OIL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/world/statement-made-by-israelis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATEMENT MADE BY ISRAELIS", "print_headline": "STATEMENT MADE BY ISRAELIS", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of a statement made by the Israeli Cabinet today after considering the Lebanon peace plan submitted by the United States: **********The Cabinet discussed the documents dealing with the departure of all the terrorists and the Syrians from Beirut and Lebanon.

Cities Service has opposed the Mesa attempt. **********A Gulf-Cities Service combination would be exceeded in value only by the $7.2 billion purchase of Conoco Inc. by **********A sharp rise in interest rates depressed the prices of stocks and gold. Details in Business Day E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company last summer and the United States Steel Corporation's $6 billion acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company this year. **********It would create the nation's seventh-largest industrial corporation, only slightly smaller in terms of sales than the Ford Motor Company. Gulf is the nation's sixth-largest oil company and the ninth-largest industrial concern; Cities Service is the 20th-largest oil company. **********The acquisition by Gulf, which has unsuccessfully sought to buy other oil companies in the past, would also raise Gulf's ranking in the oil industry to fifth place. The Justice Department said almost immediately that the venture would be reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission for possible antitrust problems. **********It would be the first important test of new Government antitrust guidelines announced Monday by both agencies, but sources close to both companies said that they thought they had a strong case to present. **********As proposed, Gulf will offer shareholders of Cities Service $63 a share for their 80.4 million shares, or about $5.1 billion. About 51 percent of the stock would be purchased for cash and the balance for Gulf Oil securities. Cities Service stock did not trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday because of the pending announcement.  The closing price Wednesday was $37.75. **********Even if Mesa was defeated, however, the company would profit handsomely on the 4.1 million shares of Cities Service that it held before its takeover offer. The holding represents 5 percent of Cities Service stock. Mesa's Yearlong Pursuit **********Mesa's chairman, T. Boone Pickens Jr., who is state campaign chairman for Gov. William P. Clements of Texas and one of the more colorful figures in the oil industry, had been in pursuit of Cities Service for the past year - over the objections of the company. **********By late last month, after it became convinced that Mesa was closing in, Cities Service decided to act first. It offered $17 a share for a 51 percent controlling interest in Mesa and, after attracting 41 percent of Mesa's stock, raised the offer to $21 a share to encourage stockholders not to take the stock back, at a time that it was selling in the open market at more than Cities Service was offering. **********Mesa responded earlier this month with a proposal made only to Cities Service's executives, offering to pay $50 a share for a 51 percent interest. When officials showed no interest, Mesa went directly to Cities Service stockholders. This time Mesa offered only $45 a share and said it could purchase only 15 percent, reserving the right to buy more if it got additional financing. **********Shareholders left no doubt that they were interested in Mesa's $45 offer -with many gambling that Cities Service would invite in another company to stave off Mesa, at a better price. **********By midnight Wednesday, the deadline for Mesa to guarantee that it would accept Cities Service shares, about 34.6 million of the company's 80.4 million shares had been turned in for payment. By early yesterday, an additional 1.2 million shares had arrived. Thus, 44.5 percent of Cities Service's shares were sent in on an offer seeking only 15 percent. **********Terms of Mesa's offer provide that Cities Service stockholders are permitted to take back their shares until June 25, and unless someonetops Gulf's offer, shares sent to Mesa are expected to be transferred to Gulf. Definitive Agreement Signed **********In a brief announcement of the proposed combination, James E. Lee, chairman of Gulf, and Charles J. Waidelich, chairman of Cities Service, said that they had signed a definitive agreement for Gulf to buy Cities Service at $63 a share. **********They said Gulf would buy 51 percent for $63 in cash and the balance for ''fixed-income securities,'' valued at ''no less than $63.'' Cities Service also granted Gulf an option to buy 14.5 million shares of the company, or some 15 percent of the total outstanding if exercised, for $913.5 million in cash. Cities Service gave no guidance on what it might now do about its bid for Mesa, saying only that the offer was progressing and that it would continue to review it. **********Gulf is the first major oil company since Mobil to attempt a takeover of another sizable oil company. Mobil's efforts to acquire Conoco and Marathon were thwarted by antitrust problems. Gulf, which is based in Pittsburgh, has attempted several times to play a role in a number of oil takeoversbut without success. It lost to U.S. Steel, for example, in a bid to buy Marathon. **********Harold H. Hammer, Gulf's chief administrative officer, said that Gulf had studied Cities Service some time ago, that he and Mr. Lee had been telephoning Mr. Waidelich ''almost every day for the last few weeks'' and that ''they kept saying they wanted to stay independent - until yesterday.'' **********He said that Gulf currently had a $3 billion line of credit from a bank group headed by the National Westminster Bank of London and the Bankers Trust Company of New York. **********Asked whether Gulf would face any antitrust problems in buying Cities Service, which is based in Tulsa, Okla.,he said there might be ''a slight market overlap'' in the sale of gasoline. He said Gulf did not regard the problem as critical. **********As to why Gulf wanted Cities Service, he said that its main attractions were its oil and gas reserves and undeveloped acreage.  Cities Service has 287 million barrels of crude reserves plus 2.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Cities Service's oil lands, largely undeveloped, amount to 12.4 million acres. **********Mr. Pickens, Mesa's chairman, said of his fight for Cities Service, ''We threw a party and it was expensive,'' but he added, ''We'll be back.'' **********He declined to say he was capitulating, but said that ''Gulf's making a good buy at $63, if they get it.'' He called the bid ''a pretty strong offer.'' His company's 4.1 million shares of Cities Service, he said, had cost $44 a share, thus giving Mesa a possible pretax profit of nearly $80 million. It began accumulating its stake early last year. **********The remarks seemed to rule out any serious challenge to Gulf's exceptionally favorable offer. At $63, the bid was close to the $78-a-share value of the company set by John S. Herold Inc., oil appraisers, of Greenwich, Conn., if the company was broken up and sold. **********As viewed by oilmen, Cities Service never really wanted to be taken over by any company, not even Gulf, agreeing to the dealonly when it seemed that Mesa might win. It declined to negotiate with Mesa on any terms, apparently because Mesa was determined to take it over even without the company's endorsement and seemed likely to replace Cities Service's top executives with Mesa officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/05/business/business-people-president-is-named-at-steelmet-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1982-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 298, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President Is Named At Steelmet Inc.", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; President Is Named At Steelmet Inc.", "body_text": " **********Albert J.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, is making an official visit to Greece on Friday in an attempt to establish a bridge with Western Europe and to blunt American efforts to isolate him internationally. **********It will be Colonel Qaddafi's first official visit to a country that is a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Common Market. **********For the governing Greek Socialists, the reserved acceptance of Colonel Qaddafi's overtures represents an attempt to win economic advantages and to prove their claim of following a policy independent of the West. **********An official of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's Government stressed that the Libyan leader had asked to be invited to Greece.  The official, who asked that his name not be used, said that Athens had planned to delay the visit as long as possible but that acceptance became much easier after the Libyan leader's official visit to Austria last month. Western diplomatic sources said NATO and the Common Market did not favor the visit, ''because it helps give Qaddafi respectability.'' **********Ex-Regime Delayed Visit **********Former Foreign Minister Constantine Mitsotakis said his conservative Government had also accepted a Qaddafi visit ''in principle'' but had kept it in abeyance. This was in line with the policy of the Common Market, which unlike the United States favors maintaining some contacts with Libya. **********Mr. Mitsotakis said the Socialists ''committed themselves to Libya so much in the past that they now find it impossible to resist Qaddafi's pressure.'' This was a reference to the openly pro-Libyan declarations by the Socialist Party while it was in opposition, which led to several reports that it was being financed by Libya. **********The Government dismisses such allegations, saying the Qaddafi visit should be seen as part of Greece's effort to expand its already close relations with the Arab world, a policy initiated by the former conservative Governments. ''But whereas the last Government wanted only economic relations with the Arab countries, we want closer political ties,'' the Government official said. ''We see ourselves as the bridge between the Arabs and Europe.'' **********Despite the Qaddafi visit - and the lavish welcome recently given Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the granting of full diplomatic status to the P.L.O. -the Government asserts it is being careful not to unnecessarily upset its NATO and Common Market partners. **********''Greece's policies are not really that different from other Western countries,'' the official said, recalling the Common Market's support for the establishment of a Palestinian state.  ''Greece is just playing an avant-garde role with the Arabs, which should not be misinterpreted. We have made it clear from the start that the security and existence of Israel has never been put into question by Greece.'' Difficulties Persist **********The drive to establish closer economic relations between Greece and Libya began with a economic cooperation agreement in 1976. But practical difficulties have persisted, and Athens will no doubt seek to resolve them during Colonel Qaddafi's visit. **********Among the difficulties were the failure of attempts to set up a direct shipping line between the ports of Piraeus and Benghazi and a joint fishing and trading company. Furthermore, Greek fishing trawlers are constantly harassed by the Libyans, and Greek sailors have been jailed for many months after venturing into the 200-mile territorial waters claimed by Libya. **********Of greater concern is that Tripoli has not paid the hundreds of millions of dollars owed to Greek engineering companies that have fulfilled contracts in Libya. The Libyans have offered to pay in oil, an offer Greece rejects because Tripoli is calculating its crude oil at much higher prices than those of the international market. **********Diplomatic sources say Libya is now seeking a package deal, by which Athens would provide agricultural products, pipelines, construction materials and light arms in return for Libyan oil and more engineering contracts. Greece appears unwilling to accept such a deal, since oil supplies are now plentiful. Trade Totals $300 Million **********Despite the difficulties, diplomatic sources say Greece still attaches considerable importance to its economic ties with the volatile Arab nation. Total trade between the two countries last year approached $300 million, and Libya is the second largest Arab importer of Greek goods after Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Greek engineering companies in Libya represent a major investment and source of employment, the sources say, and Prime Minister Papandreou still hopes to convince his guest to make substantial investments in Greece despite Libya's growing economic difficulties. **********Walter Buchholz, of the Arab-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce, acknowledges that the Socialist Government's appeals for financial aid from Libya, Iraq and Saudi Arabia have brought no results so far. As a result, Greece has had to borrow from the West. **********Diplomatic sources see several other political and diplomatic advantages for Athens in Colonel Qaddafi's visit to counterbalance the disadvantages of displeasing the West. The trip will help give Mr. Papandreou's Government a look of support for the third world.  This, in the face of his unwillingness to pull Greece out of NATO and the Common Marekt, helps placate the left wing of his party and the pro-Moscow Greek Communist Party, whose leader made an official visit to Tripoli this month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/business/the-national-bank-of-merrill-lynch.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1982-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE NATIONAL BANK OF MERRILL LYNCH", "print_headline": "THE NATIONAL BANK OF MERRILL LYNCH", "body_text": " **********BOUNTIFUL, Utah, is a tranquil farm community of barely 40,000 people.

Wall Street's biggest stock broker has progressed so far into the business of commercial banking and other financial services that nothing seems likely to stop it. Today, with some $23 billion in its Ready Assets money fund, the nation's biggest, and $13 billion in its more flexible Cash Management Account, Merrill's holdings of deposit-like client funds exceed the domestic deposits of Citibank by $16 billion. And unlike most bank checking accounts, both of Merrill's pay substantial interest. **********In what see med like grudging recognition of this fact, Walter B.  Wriston, board chairman of Citibank, remarked before a Senate banking committee last fall, at a time of higher interest rates, ''The genie will never go back in the bottle.  People know the difference between 17 percent and 5 percent, and so the whole system has to adjust to it.'' **********More to the point Mr. Wriston said, in a somewhat inaccurate remark, Citibank had been at it since 1812 while Merrill had been at it ''almost 24 months.'' In fact, Merrill has been at it since 1975, with its Ready Asset fund. **********It was been a year ago that Donald T. Regan, the man who built the modern Merrill Lynch, left Wall Street to run the Reagan Treasury, leaving the firm with his then little-known heir, Roger E. Birk.  Questions soon arose whether any successor could sustain the competitive verve that characterized the Regan tenure. **********Perhaps it would be too early, after one year in office, to conclude one way or the other whether Mr. Birk has succeeded. But Merrill's relentless pursuit of new products to offer has paid off generously in new sales. Revenues soared nearly 34 percent last year, to $4.04 billion. Thus business grew better than three times the rate of inflation. **********Profits, on the other hand, fared badly. Net earnings rose a mere 1 percent, to $203 million, in effect a decline after accounting for inflation. Merrill, however, can argue that some of its new services made things better than they might have been. Not so long ago, commissions on the sale of stocks and bonds were the bread-and-butter business of Merrill Lynch. Last year, because of the decline in stock market trading, Merrill's commission revenues fell 8.9 percent, to less than $1 billion, the first downturn since 1977. What buoyed Merrill was the same phenomenon that undid so many others - high interest rates. Merrill's high-rate money market funds helped keep profits from falling further, and its interest income, largely from loans to customers to maintain margin accounts, surged 62 percent, to $1.8 billion. Such other new businesses as investment banking and insurance also helped earnings. But real estate has been operating in the red. **********The post-Regan test for Merrill, however, hasn't really begun. For a couple of years, Merrill was largely alone among the big brokers in building a financial services department store. Its success in revealing the vulnerability of banks to such initiatives has since whet the appetites of some formidable challengers - Prudential, American Express and Sears, Roebuck. The Pru bought Bache, American Express landed Shearson and Sears got Dean Witter, all with the idea of going after the same well-heeled client that Merrill discovered. **********What's next on the Merrill menu?  ''Nothing of size,'' Mr. Birk said in an interview. ''We recognize our role as a financial intermediary. Its emphasis, he stressed, would be ''packaging and convenience.'' Its Cash Management Account, he said, was ''nothing more than services done all over the place that we combined.'' **********As for the new packaging he expects his competitors to start, he remarked, ''Making sure that two and two makes five is not an easy thing to do. If it were, we would have had competition before now.'' **********Then, too, once deregulation comes, he said, some of the top 20 banks will move into Merrill domains, building financial supermarkets of their own. Merrill, he said, would now have to work harder but deregulation should create more business for all. **********What about Merrill buying a bank or a savings and loan company?  It's illegal to buy a bank, he said, and while he had been offered a chance to buy thrift institutions ''we haven't had enough interest to respond.'' However, he added, ''We might be interested in providing checking accounts - maybe - we haven't drawn that conclusion.'' And, anyway, he noted, the laws barred that now. Checks that Merrill offers with its money funds, he said, were written on banks, not Merrill Lynch. **********The distinction is important. Unlike a bank, Merrill can't use the money in its money funds. If it could one day, the $36 billion in them might become the basis for one of the biggest lending operations in the world. **********In the meantime, its ties with banks are strong. In the six years ended in 1980, Merrill raised well over $5 billion for them, from helping sell 800,000 shares for BancOklahoma to a $200 million debt issue for Citicorp. **********In a well-worn quotation from the highly quotable Mr. Wriston about his idea of what a bank ought to be, he once said that ''Don Regan runs it and it's called Merrill Lynch.'' **********The Chase Manhattan Bank's president, Thomas G. Labrecque, thought truth serum might get an admission. ''Roger Birk is doing a super job running things now,'' Mr. Labrecque told The Redbank Daily Register of his neighbor on the Jersey shore, ''but they know, and they would admit it under sodium pentathol, that they are doing banking.'' **********In hearings on money funds last fall, Jake Garn, Utah's senior Senator, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and friend of the banking industry, said he had remarked to Mr. Regan sometime earlier that neither he nor anyone else had gotten a mortgage from Merrill Lynch.'' **********Senator Garn said that Mr. Regan replied, ''Not yet.'' **********A SKING Merrill's new chief if the company was going into mortgage lending, Mr. Birk told the Senator, ''It's an area we're studying.'' He said Merrill was already working with thrift institutions throughout the country ''to try and provide mortgage financing of various types'' and that ''sometime in future'' it would give serious consideration to granting primary and secondary mortgages. **********Mr. Birk made good the other day on Mr. Regan's remark. It introduced, in characteristic Merrill Lynch style, a second mortgage that really isn't one from a strictly legal definition but enough of one to give bankers pause about Merrill's further move into consumer lending. **********Under a typical second mortgage, homeowners can borrow funds from the equity in their property but can lose the house to the lender if they default on payments. In hard times the lender could be stuck with homes that might be a millstone. Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, which can't grant loans under banking laws, will instead allow homeowners to tap a portion of the equity in their home, at roughly 18 1/4 percent interest now, but in case of default, homeowners would lose their home to someone other than Merrill Lynch. **********Test marketing now under way in southern California's highly risky housing market provides for Merrill Lynch to package the loan-like instruments into investment-size bundles for sale to pension funds, insurance companies and other big investors. **********Under an employee relocation program with leading corporations, Merrill Lynch buys homes from transferred individuals but collects only a fee for the service. Unlike the typical lender, who might have to take heavy losses in a down market, any profits or losses on the resale of the house goes to the employer. **********In what could yet be a booming new business for Merrill Lynch, it also collects a fee for finding a furniture mover and a real estate broker's commission for helping the employee buy a new home where he's going. **********To help tie the package together, Merrill Lynch has built up a string of 23 real estate firms in 35 major housing markets and 8,000 sales people, making it the largest company-owned residential real estate firm in the country. **********By 1985, according to Dakin B. Ferris, the newly named chairman of Merrill's real estate and insurance group, it hopes to be selling homes in all 50 states, with a sales force of more than 15,000. **********Asked why Merrill Lynch is buying real estate firms at a time few people are buying homes, he quickly responds, ''The only time you can buy them is when the market's terrible. And we wouldn't be buying them if we didn't expect the market to be better over a period of time.'' **********MERRILL LYNCH'S top executives, many of whom come from blue-collar backgrounds and have spent the bulk of their careers with the company, like to think of themselves as ''A Breed Apart.'' So woven is the concept into their own thinking that they found no difficulty transforming the idea into a national advertising slogan. **********Moreover, where Merrill Lynch under Mr. Regan meant unbending oneman rule, Mr. Birk's year-old command seems to be much more relaxed.  At the top sits Mr. Birk, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Company. A billing supervisor's son, he was brought in by Mr. Regan over several top contenders seven years ago while only 44 years old to become president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, its big brokerage arm. **********The following year, at a time Mr. Regan's departure seemed distant, George L. Shinn, then Mr. Birk's superior as president of the parent company, was offered an opportunity to run another big Wall Street house and took it, becoming board chairman of the First Boston Corporation. Mr. Regan soon left no doubt that Mr. Birk would get the top job at Merrill if he ever left it. **********Putting his own stamp on management, Mr. Birk late last month tapped William A. Schreyer, president of the brokerage firm since 1980, to become president of the parent company. Thus, t he backslapping, sales-oriented son of a former Merrill Lynch manager moved into wh at was clearly the No.2 spot. **********Below that, the picture seemed less certain, although there were signs suggesting part of the pecking order.  If those who report to the top man are any guide, and some Merrill watchers contend that they are, below Mr. Schreyer, 54, the list would include Mr. Ferris, at 56 the oldest of the top echelon, and Robert P. Rittereiser, 43, executive vice president of the parent company. Completing the seven-man top command are Daniel P. Tully, 50, and Edmond N. Moriarty, 53, son of a construction superintendent, both presidents of key Merrill Lynch operations, and Charles H. Ross, 44, like Mr. Rittereiser, an executive vice president of the parent company. **********However, with Mr. Birk only 51, the exercise seems academic. Joel Rosenthal, a Merrill watcher for the Wall Street house of Jesup & Lamont, said in a bullish report on the company that only a handful of the top 50 in Merrill Lynch still have the same job they held four years ago.

Clark Jr. has been chief executive of Baker International for 17 years and made millions for himself and the diversified oil service company with his shrewd assessments of trends in global oil pricing. **********Acting on his conviction that Middle East oil prices would soar, Baker International had made its acquisitions and plant expansions before the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979-80 and was ready to capture market shares amid the drilling booms that followed. Its profits have grown 39 percent a year, on average, since 1971, and Baker has become one of the largest companies in oilfield service. **********Mr. Clark, a mechanical engineer, discussed the future of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, oil prices and the oilfield service industry recently here at Baker's headquarters. **********Q. Do you agree that OPEC's days are numbered? A. Not at all. The people who believe OPEC will fall apart are the same shallow thinkers who said the first oil embargo was a hoax. OPEC's future hinges on how demand for energy returns after the recession. They can't cut production enough to sustain current price levels with a permanently reduced world demand. I don't believe that has happened. **********Q. But aren't conservation and the oil glut working against OPEC?  A. Energy consumption is down because of the current mix of production in the gross national product, not because of conservation. Housing, steel, autos, metals - the highest users of energy per unit of G.N.P. - are the most depressed sectors of the economy. Are we going to make a lasting improvement in energy consumption by allowing these basic industries to be permanently flat on their backs? I can't see that. The business recovery will bring these industries back. Rising energy demand will follow. **********Q. When do you expect this to occur? A. Toward the end of this year. **********Q. What are the Saudis up to? A. The Saudis said last year that they would hold at $34 a barrel for 18 to 24 months, or until they became the highest-priced producer in OPEC and the market would no longer buy from them. The Saudis will try to hold that price, with their rather dramatic production cutbacks. **********Q. Is the Saudi warning to oil companies not to stop buying Nigerian oil consistent with that? A. Absolutely. Saudi Arabia intends to be the producer of last resort. As such, they are prepared to control their production rate based on demand. There is a relatively free market out there. If the overall production rate is higher, the Saudis will cut back, leaving other OPEC members free to participate. The Saudi market price will be highest, so all others will be bought first. The average price will be lower than the Saudi price. **********Q. What happens if OPEC does splinter? A. The overhang of Arab reprisals against the Saudis over such a miscalculation is intense.  You're going to see nations starving and revolution. Promises have been made, for instance in Nigeria, that couldn't be kept with oil at $15 a barrel. Iran said it would bomb Saudi oilfields if the price fell to $15 a barrel. **********Q. What has been the impact of the oil glut on your customers? A.  We're seeing some weakness, but nothing inconsistent with our projections. About 95 percent of our business with drillers is in the medium and deep-well area.

Rocke feller squeezed out of his hapless competitors. But big money is stil l being made in the United States, and by and large the new wealth, l ike Rockefeller's fortune, still flows out of the ground. **********Among the new energy entrepreneurs, few have risen as far as fast as Bruce Heafitz, the cheery, red-bearded 41-year-old chairman of Heafitz, Widmann, McMahon & Gardner, a firm t hat finances independentoil and gas operators. **********Only seven years ago, Mr. Heafitz was living in a third-floor walkup at Third Avenue and 35th Street with a pregnant wife and a 3-yearold daughter, his bank account overdrawn and his net worth nil. **********Today, he measures his wealth in the mid-eight figures. He is one of the largest individual clients of the elite old law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, and a benefactor of the Peabody Museum of Harvard, his alma mater. Some time ago, the walk-up was exchanged for the requisite East Side cooperative. **********Takes Buses and Flies Coach **********He still takes buses and flies in economy class, but he also presides over spacious new offices at Park Avenue and 59th Street, decorated in defiant shades of lavender - an individual touch seldom seen in the beigey suites of corporate America. **********''I'm no smarter than other guys,'' said Mr. Heafitz, who still speaks of his success with a mixture of pride and awe. ''The difference is that I'm more willing to take risks.'' **********Mr. Heafitz made his first big leap in 1974, when he left a job in mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch to work as a financial adviser to several small independent oil companies. In return, they were able to send some promising deals his way. **********Using $20,000 borrowed from family and friends, Mr. Heafitz made his first investment in three oil wells, and one of them, in which he had a quarter interest, came in. At then-current prices of $6 a barrel, that meant that the fledgling investor stood to earn about half a million dollars a year, proving that, even before the decade's historic price increases, oil could be a fantastically profitable business. The Well Goes Dry **********The trouble was that the well went dry 10 days later, after Mr.  Heafitz had bought that new co-op, laid out almost $15,000 in completion costs on the well and accumulated almost $50,000 in new debts. **********But several hundred thousand dollars' worth of debt and 26 dry holes later, Mr. Heafitz, a dedicated crapshooter, finally hit it big with some heavy oil in California, purchased in 1975 when it was worth 10 cents a barrel and sold two or three years later when it was valued at $10 a barrel in the ground. **********''I was in the right place at the right time,'' he says now.  To pay the grocer during the lean years - when, a friend says, ''Bruce was making calls out of pay phones on the street'' - Mr.  Heafitz held a succession of jobs with various investment banks and brokerage houses, leaving frequently with little regret on either side. ''Bruce had to go out on his own because he couldn't hold a job anywhere else,'' his partner, Roger M. Widmann, joked over a recent lunch, as Mr. Heafitz beamed agreement. ''I'm not a big company man,'' he admitted. **********By early last year, Mr. Heafitz finally had his own operation in place, set up to invest his, his partners', and institutional money in oil and gas deals. Heafitz Widmann likes to call itself a financial intermediary, rounding up skittish institutional funds for lending to independent oil companies. How Independents Raise Funds **********The independents, who drill 90 percent of the exploratory wells in the nation with only 70 percent of the money spent on exploration, have traditionally obtained operating funds from their own cash flow; from banks, which can only lend on the basis of proven oil reserves; from selling or trading some of those reserves to other oil companies, or from selling limited partnerships in drilling funds to wealthy persons seeking tax shelter. **********In recent years, ever so tentatively, institutional investors have also begun to dip their toes into the oil exploration business. Last year, oil and gas firms are estimated to have raised $30 billion in 1981 for exploration, with roughly $1.4 billion of that from institutions, compared with almost no institutional money only three years ago. **********Mr. Heafitz was one of the first persons in the oil business to persuade risk-adverse institutions such as pension funds to dip their toes into oil, and to finance drilling costs by lending to independents against such assets as unt@ested acreage. **********His timing was not exactly perfect. With energy in plentiful supply, and analysts now predicting a drop in the real price of oil, ''I'm beginni ng to wonder whether I helped give birth to an industry that is alrea dy dying,'' Mr. Heafitz said. Much of Heafitz Widmann's energies last year went into trying to raise $200 million for a limited partn ership called American Oil and Gas Investors, which finally close d last October at $144 million. Discouraging Climate **********De spite the discouraging climate, the firm did manage to obtain commitments from such conservative institutio ns as the Minnesota State Board of Investment, Mutual of New York , New England Mutual, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association an d the pension funds of, among others, I.B.M., Atlantic Richfield, the Bell System Trust, Gulfand Western and Boise Cascade. **********Heafitz Widmann is the managing general partner of American Oil and Gas Investors, and by spring the firm hopes to close a sister fund, Amgo International, with roughly $100 million raised from European institutions. **********''Amgo is our goldfish bowl'', Mr. Heafitz said recently. ''If it does well, we'll do well.'' The principals of Heafitz Widmann polished their skills in attracting institutions into direct oil and gas deals at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, where Mr. Heafitz was working in 1979. In that year, he and Mr. Widmann, his boss and a senior vice president at Donaldson, put together a group of investors for exploration of 2.9 million acres of land in the vast Williston Basin leased by the Standard Oil Company (Indiana). **********Looking for more operating room, Mr. Heafitz left Donaldson after the Williston deal and began to try to attract a group of investors in oil and gas royalties he had purchased on some 16 million acres in the continental United States. Realizing he needed to put together his own team for the effort, he lured Mr. Widmann and Edward T.  Gardner, a stockbroker, away from Donaldson and brought in Michael E. McMahon from Morgan Guaranty. Staff of 22 and 7 Partners **********The new corporation now has a staff of 22 and 7 partners, including Thomas Kellogg, who was involved in petroleum lending for 22 years at Morgan Guaranty. **********The Harp Royalty Trust closed successfully last year at $98 million. Participants in the limited partnership include the pension funds of Owens-Illinois and Commonwealth Edison. The First National Bank in Minneapolis and Citicorp also put in money on behalf of several pension clients. **********In the past year, a number of other money managers and institutions began to try their hand at similar lucrative ventures. Most notably, Henry Schroder Wagg & Company in London placed $100 million, raised from a Who's Who of British pension funds and insurance companies, in direct oil and gas deals in the United States. **********Prudential Insurance announced its intention to place $200 million of its general account money in oil and gas deals over the next few years, with the possibility of developing a separate account for pension clients. Several major banks are now putting pension clients directly into oil and gas, and at least one, Continental Illinois, has even begun to lend to independents on unproven acreage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/10/business/blue-bell-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BLUE BELL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BLUE BELL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/05/business/gold-drops-below-350.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GOLD DROPS BELOW $350", "print_headline": "GOLD DROPS BELOW $350", "body_text": " **********Gold, which has been falling steadily for many weeks, broke through a new barrier yesterday, falling $7.25 an ounce in London, to $346.50. It was the first time in two and a half years that gold has gone below the $350 level. **********Analysts said that gold's price had been driven down, and would probably continue to be driven down, by heavy selling by the Soviet Union, South Africa and several of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries - all seeking foreign currency to pay for imports. The OPEC nations in past years had invested some of their oil revenues in gold. **********''A number of nations are faced with economic difficulties,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a senior metals analyst with Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., the brokerage firm. ''The Russians need hard currency for large imports of grain. In addition, nations that have in the past been selling oil to raise the money they need for imports have been hurt now that oil prices have dropped.'' **********Analysts said that in addition to weak oil prices, high interest rates have been depressing the price of gold because they make it costly to borrow money to purchase gold. **********Gold, which had reached a high point of more than $850 an ounce in London in January 1980 and was at $401 at the start of this year, had not been below $350 an ounce since September 1979, when it went as low as $322.90 an ounce in London. Other Market Reactions **********Gold has lost more than $14 in the past two days.  In Zurich, the metal fell to $348.50 an ounce, down $5 from Wednesday.

In recent weeks, the Russians have arranged credits to purchase grain abroad, underlining the lack of foreign currency available to Moscow for such imports. **********The Russians account for 23 percent of world gold production, second only to South Africa, which accounts for about 50 percent of world production. Miss Raptopoulos noted that in recent months South Africa had also been selling steadily because it needs hard currency to pay for imports. **********In London yesterday it was reported that some heavy sellers in recent days have included Iran, Iraq, Libya and Indonesia, all members of OPEC. **********Who is buying? Several analysts said that Japanese buyers had been stocking gold in anticipation of tax law changes that will require people who own gold to disclose holdings acquired after Jan.1, 1983.  The Japanese reportedly purchased 150 tons in 1981. It was also reported that some foreign central banks might have bought some gold to support the metal's market price. Bargain hunters also have been buying, analysts said. **********James E. Sinclair, general partner of the Sinclair Group Companies, which specialize in foreign exchange and metals, said: ''The great drama of gold is over. Gold will experience another drop in the fall. I still don't recommend purchase of futures contracts but I do recommend that our customers can put one-third of what they intend to commit in gold into the physical gold market at prices between $330 and $360.'' ---- Silver and Dollar Down By The Associated Press **********Silver prices tumbled on international markets yesterday, dropping below $7.50 an ounce. The value of the dollar also fell sharply in moderately heavy trading. **********Trading was described by one London dealer as ''extremely volatile.'' Prices of precious metals are under pressure because of high interest rates, which make bullion purchases more expensive to finance, and declining inflation in the United States. **********The price of silver fell to $7.498 on New York's Comex, down 16.2 cents from Wednesday.

As a result, the balloting in the regional conventions, summoned to prepare for a national party convention in April, had the character of gestures of dissatisfaction with Mr. Schmidt's leadership. **********Vote Against NATO Plan **********The most striking case came at the Lower Bavaria-Upper Palatinate convention, where the group, despite pleas by Peter Glotz, the Social Democratic Party's national manager, recommended that West Germany withdraw from the NATO plan to deploy middle-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe at the end of 1983. The alliance plan, often referred to as the ''two-track decision,'' provides that deployment is to go ahead if there is no favorable outcome in the current Geneva talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. **********The Lower Bavaria-Upper Palatinate group is one of the smaller regional party bodies, but the country's third largest, in the Lower Rhine area, voted in Essen tonight in favor of an immediate moratorium in the stationing of American and Soviet missiles and an ''immediate halt to the preparations for deploying'' American Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in West Germany. **********The Essen convention, which was addressed by Chancellor Schmidt, did not withdraw its support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plan as a whole, but its recommendations disavowed Mr.  Schmidt's stance in two areas. His Government has said that a moratorium would serve only to freeze Soviet superiority in intermediate-range missiles, and that halting preparations to deploy American missiles would remove a stimulus for the Soviet Union to negotiate seriously. West Westphalia Defeats Proposal **********A similar motion was passed by the Palatinate regional party organization at a meeting in Pirmasens.  In Dortmund, where the largest regional body, known as West Westphalia, was meeting, a moratorium proposal was defeated after a long floor fight and at the urging of Willy Brandt, the party chairman. **********But the Dortmund convention, the fourth of the weekend, expressed weakened confidence in the United States' interest in avoiding deployment by tacking an amendment to its security motion, roughly supporting t h e line of Mr. Schmidt, which said it would be invalidated ' 'if the Western side drags out the negotiations and doesnot pursue th em constructively enough.'' **********Support for Mr. Schmidt's program of economic stimulants, aimed at creating jobs and bringing new investment, faced difficulties in the coalition itself. **********Housing Minister Dieter Haack, a Social Democrat, criticized a segment of the program that would loosen rent controls in order to make house and apartment buildings more attractive to investors. The measure is a favorite project of the Free Democrats, and their party spokesmen replied angrily today to Mr. Haack. **********The Free Democratic Party Chairman, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, offered what was taken as a warning that continued bickering could quicly bring down the coalition. **********''Whoever talks the economic program down,'' he said, ''is talking down jobs, and in so doing, is talking apart the coalition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/17/world/invasion-affected-600000-us-says.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1982-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 730, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVASION AFFECTED 600,000, U.S. SAYS", "print_headline": "INVASION AFFECTED 600,000, U.S. SAYS", "body_text": " **********Reports reaching the State Department's Agency for International Development have estimated that as many as 600,000 people have been affected by the Israeli attack against Palestinian strongholds in Lebanon. **********A situation report compiled by the agency said that 350,000 people had been affected in the south by the fighting, although exact numbers of people left homeless are unclear. A.I.D. officials said that many Lebanese are, if not homeless, in need of food, water and medical supplies. **********Damage in Lebanon was listed as ''severe.'' In the Shouf mountain area southeast of Beirut, where there are many Palestinians, a partial estimate of the homeless was placed at 16,000. **********There was no estimate in the report of the total number of dead and wounded as a result of more than a week of fighting. A preliminary figure of wounded in the cities of Sidon, Tyre and Jezzin was listed at 3,400. **********''Priority needs have been identified as medical supplies and personal items such as soap and blankets,'' said the report. ''Food will be needed. Tents may be needed later. Needs have not yet been quantified.''

Beyond this, officials said, the ongoing fighting made it extremely difficult to assess the scale of damage so far to Lebanon. **********It was learned that President Reagan is scheduled to announce shortly the appointment of W. Peter McPherson, the administrator of the Agency for International Development, as coordinator for United States relief in Lebanon. **********Mr. Reagan has announced that the United States Government would provide up to $5 million in immediate medical supplies and food aid and has submitted a request to Congress for an additional $20 million in emergency relief.

Of this, $20,000 was granted to the American University Hospital in Beirut. **********Within Congress there was some confusion about the Administration's $20 million aid request for Lebanon. Rep. Clement J.

Senator Kasten Is Critical **********Similar hearings are scheduled next Monday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, and chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations subcommittee, criticized the Administration and his colleagues for seeking legislation and hearings on aid to Lebanon. **********Mr. Kasten, in a statement, said the Administration's formal request was ''puzzling,'' since the money sought could have been taken immediately from other foreign assistance programs, and then replaced. **********Mr. Kasten urged the Administration and Congress to ''abandon time-consuming efforts at new and additional legislation which is unnecessary.'' 'New Middle East Alignments' **********Meanwhile, Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs panel, and Representative Jack Kemp, Republican of New York, sent a strongly worded letter to President Reagan, urging the Administration to ''take advantage of the new Middle East alignments to press ahead with the Camp David process and to encourage other nations, freer than ever from P.L.O. intimidation, to join in that process.'' **********The two said that the P.L.O. had been ''discredited,'' and that the Administration should ''make it clear to those on the West Bank, to the Jordanians and to other nations with a stake in a peaceful settlement, such as the Saudis, that true moderates should join in the peace process.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/business/about-real-estate-the-market-for-custom-built-homes-on-staten-island.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Oser", "pub_date": "1982-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKET FOR CUSTOM BUILT HOMES ON STATEN ISLAND", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; THE MARKET FOR CUSTOM BUILT HOMES ON STATEN ISLAND", "body_text": " **********At a pace of 100 to 200 houses a year, the production of custombuilt houses is proceeding in far-flung locations in New York City's least-developed borough, Staten Island. **********High mortgage rates and a lack of city sewers in the southern part of the island haved limited tract development for buyers with average incomes. Thus, custom construction has become a relatively strong market. **********In the wooded terrain off Ocean Terrace in the Deere Park section of Todt Hill, close to the College of Staten Island, Aaron Luwisch is developing custom homes on 16 quarter-acre lots. Buyers have been spending $350,000 to $700,000 for houses with upward of 3,500 square feet of space. **********In Eltingville, off Arden Avenue, large custom-built houses have begun to fill entire streets. A sign on a tree reads: ''Ironwood Estates. Will build to suit.'' The builder, Henry Lieberman, has 22 lots on which he builds custom houses, generally under 3,000 square feet, that sell for $200,000 and up. He builds about a dozen a year, he said. **********Along Raritan Bay in the Huguenot section, on land with a spectacular water view toward Sandy Hook, Salvatore Nicolosi and his partners are offering 38 lots for sale for custom development. The site includes the 18-acre Arbutus Lake. Lots are selling for about $10 a square foot, or between $135,000 and $300,000. **********''The most prevalent pattern,'' said Randy Lee, a real estate lawyer, ''is that buyers seek out a builder who has land and make a deal through a broker.'' Development sites are regularly advertised in the daily Staten Island Advance. **********Land prices for custom construction vary greatly. In Annadale, Eltingville and Huguenot, a 100-foot-by-100-foot ''builder ready'' plot - with building plans approved - usually costs $40,000 to $50,000, specialists say. Custom houses on such lots, with the land, sell for $225,000 and up, depending on what the buyer puts into it.  The many elaborate houses recently built indicate that the higher bracket is more common. **********In the exclusive communities of Todt Hill and Emerson Hill, on high land in the center of the island, plots usually run between $100,000 to $155,000. With a fine view, prices are higher. New homes built there start at $400,000, including the land. Recent houses have been built for more than half a million dollars, brokers and lawyers say. **********The new housing on the hills is usually built on ''infill'' lots in communities already mostly developed with expensive houses. On Ocean Terrace on Todt Hill, one vacant parcel of 13,000 square feet is said to have sold for $200,000 a few months ago. The house is under construction. And at 90 Flagg Place in Dongan Hills, a house with 12,000 square feet of living space is being constructed speculatively by a builder named Carmine Lombardi. He is asking $950,000. **********To the south the terrain grows more like southern New Jersey, with sandy soil. It was here, planners feel, that an unusual opportunity for superior subdivision planning was lost 10 years ago when the State Assembly voted down the ''South Richmond plan'' put forward by former Mayor John V. Lindsay. It had passed the Senate with strong support from Senator John J. Marchi of Staten Island. **********The legislation would have established an authority with power to condemn undeveloped land that was mapped for streets during the 1920's. Most of the streets were never built, and ownership of the land is dispersed. These mapped but unbuilt ''paper'' streets tend to freeze subdivision patterns into a rigid grid with excessive pavement. Condemnation would have cleared the way for better planning. **********Yet it is not planning policy but the lack of city sewers in many areas that has dominated the development picture. Arden Avenue in Annadale is the southern boundary of the sewer system, and tract housing stops there abruptly. Since health rules require builders to install septic tanks in unsewered land, much of the new development is on 100-foot-by-100-foot lots, the minimum needed for septic tanks, even though the zoning in most cases permits a higher density. **********Accordingly, the more attractive sites are being developed with houses up to 4,000 square feet on land that was once expected to be utilized for middle-income tract development. Jansen Street, off Arden Avenue, is an example of a street gradually being filled with high-priced customized single-family houses. Another is a development called Woodrow Woods, along Woodrow Road near Rossville Avenue in Huguenot, which Harry Kantor is building. **********Tract development occurs only when the builder has so large a project that he can put in a private sewage treatment plant, or when he can hook into an existing private plant with excess capacity. **********Business and professional people are said to be the main purchasers of the new custom houses. Since the Staten Island Expressway and Verrazano Bridge provide easy access to Brooklyn, the buyers tend to come either from there or from Staten Island."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/world/suharto-due-in-us-today-on-state-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Colin Campbell", "pub_date": "1982-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SUHARTO DUE IN U.S. TODAY ON STATE VISIT", "print_headline": "SUHARTO DUE IN U.S. TODAY ON STATE VISIT", "body_text": " **********Indonesian officials hope that the state visit of President Suharto to the United States, due to begin Sunday, will be able to smooth over some of the tensions that have grown over the last year between Washington and Jakarta. **********Mr. Suharto's stay in Washington, where he will be given a state dinner Tuesday night, will follow a visit to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va.

Indonesia exports about 350,000 barrels of oil a day to the United States and depends heavily on American technology and economic expertise.

The Reagan Administration's first choice, Morton I. Abramowitz, was reportedly rejected by President Suharto, who makes all of his Government's most important decisions. **********The precise grounds for the rejection are still not clear, but the episode left much bitterness in Jakarta and at the State Department. Development Aid at Low Level **********A face-to-face meeting between the two Presidents might enable them to settle on a candidate, officials said.  Indonesian leaders have also felt slighted by relatively low levels of American economic and military assistance. Development and food aid amounted to less than $100 million this year and the ceiling on military credits was $40 million. **********The prevailing argument in Washington has been that Indonesia's oil revenues make it a less than needy candidate for aid. Jakarta has replied that world recession, an oil glut and depressed prices for its tin, rubber, coffee and other exports make Indonesia needier by the day, and could threaten its domestic security. **********The private foreign investment that Indonesia seeks has been disappointing despite the Government's easing of nationalistic tax laws and other legislation. Inquiry on East Timor Urged **********A group of United States members of Congress, anticipating President Suharto's visit, have called for an investigation of reported food shortages and human rights abuses in East Timor, the former Portuguese island colony that Indonesia invaded in December 1975 and later annexed. **********State Department officials, like the Indonesian Government, have asserted that the situation in East Timor has improved greatly in recent years. But the issue could easily arise in talks between President Suharto's delegation and Administration officials. **********Many Western scholars have said in recent years that although the Indonesian economy as a whole has soared under the increasingly autocratic rule of President Suharto, his political support - especially among poor and landless peasants, jobless or underpaid city-dwellers and a growing and often democratically inclined middle class - remains shallow. Several American Government experts on Indonesia have lately expressed the same view.

It failed that last test miserably. **********Yesterday's meeting between Mr. Reagan and Chancellor Schmidt, despite efforts to paper over cracks in the wall, dramatized their differences on how to respond to the crisis - and how to prevent it from wrecking the Western alliance. **********Mr. Reagan, holding the Soviet Union responsible for the military crackdown on the Poles, has imposed sanctions on the Soviet Union.  But Mr. Schmidt, asserting that Moscow was not the prime mover against Poland, wants to take a less aggressive line - one that will permit German trade with the Russians to continue. This dispute long antedates the Polish crisis. At the Ottawa summit conference last July, a principal fight between the American and German leaders was over the export of high technology to the Russians, as well as over the planned Siberian natural gas pipeline to supply West Germany and other European countries. **********Today, the United States appears to be hoping that the Polish upheaval can be exploited to brea k the Soviet grip on Eastern Europe,if this count ry can only make it too costly for the Russians or theirsupporters in the Polish Army to try to break the workers' and the church's resi stance. **********But many European critics contend that policies intended to sustain and worsen chaos in Poland will only make it more rather than less likely that the Russians will tighten their grip on Poland and the other satellite countries, a grip that could be broken only by war.  These critics also contend that efforts to weaken the Polish economy, by withholding food supplies or balance-of-payments support, are likely to be counterproductive in weakening the will of the Polish people to resist. The Polish people are starving, but the army is in no danger of starvation. **********The British newspaper The Guardian warns that the Polish people must not be treated as ''dispensable pawns'' in Western strategy, adding: ''The line between penalizing General Jaruzelski and penalizing ordinary Poles is thin and gray, for however one views it, it is the ordinary Poles who will suffer.'' The same arguments, the newspaper maintains, apply to a deliberate severance of bank aid to Poland, insisting that a nation bankrupt and in default would be a two-edged crisis - and one for Western banking itself. **********But the United States has made clear to the Europeans that it expects support for its economic sanctions, and this week leaders of the Common Market, meeting in Brussels, pledged that they would do nothing to hamper American sanctions against the Soviet Union.  However, they took no initiatives of their own. **********Chancellor Schmidt has stressed his belief that the greater danger to the alliance comes not from political differences over Poland but from the economic slump in the West, with rising unemployment intensifying pressures for protectionism and other beggar-my-neighbor policies. The Germans have long made plain their view that mistaken United States economic policies, resulting in high interest rates, are the source of sluggish growth and rising joblessness throughout the industrial world. **********But the Reagan Administration contends that it is persistent inflation that is responsible for the West's economic troubles, and that its tight-money policies, however painful during the transition, are breaking the back of inflation, bringing down interest rates and setting this country and its neighbors back on course to stable growth. **********While sharing the goal of bringing down inflation - a passion in which the Germans feel they need no instruction - Chancellor Schmidt and his Economics Minister, Count Otto Lambsdorff, insist that the Reagan Administration's approach, by relying so heavily on monetary restraints, is simplistic and brutal, both toward the American labor force and toward the members of the Western political and economic alliance. **********If pursued doggedly, they contend, the Reagan Administration's mixture of monetary, fiscal and military policies will keep the industrial world in a state of high interest rates, stuttering growth and chronic unemployment. This, Mr. Schmidt warned yesterday, might cause a plunge into a worldwide depression. **********Stagnating productivity and climbing unemployment do not stem from inflation alone but from a complex of different factors, whether in the United States and Western Europe or in Poland and other Communist countries. **********A disruption of trade, stemming from the efforts of nations to protect themselves against hig h unemployment and economic disorder, would intensify the danger of a world economi c breakdown."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/31/business/bank-mergers-announced.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Mergers Announced", "print_headline": "Bank Mergers Announced", "body_text": " **********The First City Bancorporation of Texas said yesterday that it had completed its acquisition of the McAllen State Bank of McAllen, Tex., for 2 million common shares.

Its embassy in Washington returned the summons and other official papers to the court on May 16, 1980 - a month after they were served. **********The Chinese Government claims judicial immunity under international law as a sovereign state and said through officials in the United States in a brief note to the court that it did not accept the suit.  Further, the note said, China recognized no liability incurred by ''successive reactionary governments'' of the past and will not pay their debts. **********On the other hand, China is said to have paid claims in recent minor suits involving commercial matters. Some observers believe China may attempt a private settlement with the group involved in the Alabama case to avoid embarrassment over any efforts by the court to seize Chinese property. Some American judgments against other nations have led to seizures of airplanes, ships and their cargoes, real estate and bank accounts. **********The Chinese note to the court said that if the nation's property were seized, it would reserve the right to take corresponding measures. **********W. Eugene Rutledge of Birmingham, Ala., attorney for the plaintiffs, said that if the judgment survived any petition to vacate that China might file, ''We will take every measure we can to collect.'' **********Mr. Rutledge argued that China was buying computers and other equipment in this nation and should, therefore, expect to be held accountable for debts. **********China is one of several nations in default on dollar bonds issued decades ago. They include the Soviet Union, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Bolivia. **********Prof. Hubert Park Beck, professor emeritus of the City University of New York, said the Alabama decision represented a breakthrough.  Mr. Beck, who owns some Hukuang bonds, is an authority on foreign bonds in default, having worked in the field for more than a quarter of a century. He is also chairman of the Russian Dollar Bondholders Committee of the U.S.A. **********He added that he believed the China case set a precedent: It was the first case he knew of in which a foreign nation had been held responsible for defaulted loans offered publicly in the United States. The Alabama case, tried under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, also strengthened a case begun this year against the Soviet Union, he concluded."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/business/mesa-s-credits-total-1-billion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mesa's Credits Total $1 Billion", "print_headline": "Mesa's Credits Total $1 Billion", "body_text": " **********The Mesa Petroleum Company said that it had bank commitments for credits of $1 billion to be used in part for a pending takeover bid for the General American Oil Company of Texas. **********It said up to $400 million, now unsecured, would be used for corporate needs other than to buy securities on credit. **********In addition, it said it would use $325 million, secured by oil and gas properties, to buy securities on credit, including those of General American, and $275 million, secured by the General American shares it holds, to buy only General American shares.

Lerner, one of the greatest economists of this century. **********Professor Lerner, who died three weeks ago in Tallahassee, Fla., at the age of 79, always called the issues as he saw them, whatever special economic or political interests were involved. And he always pursued the broad interests of humanity, seeking to base his advice on scientific fact and logic. **********He did not care whether he was labeled a Socialist or capitalist, and he was actually something of both. He regarded such labels as capitalism and Communism as misleading and, even worse, corrupting of scientific thought on how to help people advance their own welfare freely - and at the same time advance the well-being of the society as a whole. What Mr. Lerner sought to serve was what he called ''everybody's business.'' **********But, with devastating clarity, he saw that people had to have a personal stake in serving other people's interests: He regarded that as the genius of the profit system. He could be excoriating to Marxists who parroted the doctrine that production should be ''for use and not for profit.'' **********He once caricatured the student who ''preaches his parables'' denouncing capitalist waste and folly as one who sips ''his coffee, the radio turned low, comfortably seated near a well-stocked refrigerator in a warm elevator apartment, with hundreds of thousands of items for him to drink or wear or read or play with, waiting to be picked up at nearby stores or to be delivered to him in response to a telephone call.'' **********A passionate lover of freedom, and one who practiced it in his personal and professional life in a time when academic rigidity and snobbery exacted a heavy toll from nonconformists, Mr. Lerner did not believe in the fashionable ideologies celebrating free enterprise and denouncing all uses of government as inevitably an incursion into freedom and a distorting force in advancing social welfare. **********The true heroes of the maximization of freedom, he contended, were not the classical economists who, he said, ''merely discovered the nature of the operations of the price mechanism in harnessing the private interests of producing and providing things that people wanted.'' **********He thought the true heroes were the pre-classical political economists who made it possible for the system to work, going back to ''ancient solons who developed the institution of private property and then corporate property, who established the rule of law that gave security to property and the freedom of individuals to move and to trade.'' **********As one who thoroughly understood the market and the price system, Mr. Lerner criticized the ''stupidities of sentimental Socialists or anticapitalists who had no understanding of the complex and subtle machinery that made modern life possible, and who had eyes only for flaws in the operation of the economy of the present and wished only to contrast with idealized utopias of the future.'' **********He sought to convert Communists and Socialists both in the West and behind the Iron Curtain to an appreciation of the use of markets to make their societies more efficient and free. He sought to prove that Socialism could rely almost entirely on the market mechanism as the greatest promoter of human welfare yet discovered. **********His thinking has had an impact on the efforts of economic reformers in Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland to develop ''market socialism.'' It is conceivable that the new Soviet leader, Yuri V. Andropov, a former Ambassador to Hungary, might yet try to put into effect such market reforms in the Soviet Union. **********But Mr. Lerner was also a reformer of capitalism. An early student and expositor of John Maynard Keynes, he went on to develop his own ideas of ''functional finance'' for solving the problems of depression or inflation - or the two together in what he called, more than a quarter of a century ago, ''inflationary depression,'' which is now known as stagflation. **********He warned that attempts to stop what he called a sellers' inflation, resulting from excess market power of labor, business or cartels, by restrictive fiscal or monetary measures would only bring about a depression. Then attempts to cure this depression by expansionary monetary or fiscal policy would only restore inflation. **********He concluded that the problem of inflationary depression could not be solved just by manipulating monetary and fiscal policy. He tried to solve it by developing a plan for reorienting the tax system so that those who increased their prices or raised wages faster than the rate of productivity growth would find their tax burden increased, thereby giving self-interested people a stake in preventing inflation. **********Once again, Mr. Lerner was trying to combine self-interest and freedom with a social interest. His works - especially his masterpiece, ''The Economics of Control'' - will reward fresh study. **********He did not get any of the glittering prizes. All he got was respect."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/12/business/bunnington-corp-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUNNINGTON CORP reports earnings for Yr to July 31", "print_headline": "BUNNINGTON CORP reports earnings for Yr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/05/business/palm-beach-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PALM BEACH INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "PALM BEACH INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/23/business/advertising-promoting-the-use-of-coal.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Promoting The Use Of Coal", "print_headline": "Advertising; Promoting The Use Of Coal", "body_text": " **********THE American Coal Foundation, created a year ago by both the management and labor of the industry to promote the use of coal, will institute its first $1 million advertising campaign, largely on television, next week. **********The theme is ''Rediscover coal. The modern energy miracle that's old as the hills.'' Although the advertising is consumer-oriented, the target is a very special kind of consumer: the upscale, community leader type.  And, judging by the media selection, the coal people also believe it is a male since the single 30-second spot will be running largely during sports telecasts or cablecasts. **********The spot will run for the first time on Dec. 29 during the showing of the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, on the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, or ESPN, on cable. Yesterday Curt Thomas, senior vice president and general manager of the Pittsburgh office of Marsteller, flew in - video cassette in hand - to preview the commercial. The agency, a subsidiary of Young & Rubicam, had won the account in a full-fledged competition that started out with 50 agencies getting questionnaires and ended with three or four finalists and full-fledged speculative presentations, for which there was no compensation. **********The commercial Mr. Thomas carried so protectively to New York is the finished version of the rough spot that the agency showed to the foundation's operating committee and board to win the account. **********At first glance it appears to be another spot for still another detergent with this huge package dominating the quiet countryside.  Except this time in addition to being printed with ''New miracle energy discovery'' and ''Giant economy size,'' the box is labeled ''Coal.'' - ''Available. Abundant. Affordable. American.'' **********And the announcer's voice intones, ''And now we have ways to keep it clean.'' The agency and the foundation it represents must walk a fine line since under its charter the foundation may not do any grass-roots lobbying. So the advertising is intended, in Mr. Thomas's words, ''to promote the advantages of coal to the American public.'' But it will not be issue oriented. **********So it would seem that television would be the ideal way to go for 30 seconds' worth of mood or image and not too many potentially controversial hard facts - a commercial that will leave a viewer of the ''public activist'' stripe with a positive rather than negative attitude toward the use of coal as an energy source. **********The three-month television effort, which will use up 95 percent of the budget, will run largely on the networks during sports and news programming although additional spots will appear during Sugar Bowl and Gator Bowl coverage on WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh, which is a very important market in coal circles. **********Just as a corporate image campaign has as one of its goals the stimulation of the company's own work force, the foundation wishes to excite its various components - mine operators, the United Mine Workers union, and the various suppliers to the industry. **********Additionally, as Mr. Thomas noted, it is hoped that the commercials will stimulate those industry organizations that may not have contributed to the advertising program to do so. **********The only print advertising in the campaign will be a full-page four-color ad scheduled for next Wednesday in Gannett's USA Today newspaper that has a guaranteed circulation of 200,000 in six markets. On top of that, the agency has also prepared a 60-second radio commercial built around the music track of the television spot and it is being supplied to the foundation membership for local use. **********Asked to comment on the coal industry's communications plans, David Keto of the staff of the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental law firm in New York, said he wanted to make three points: Energy conservation is a cleaner alternative than coal burning. Coal is basically a dirty fuel and the use of coal-burning technology is not always required. And the environmental impact of coal burning cannot always be mitigated through technology. **********A theme line suggestion for both industry and consumer: ''We dig coal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/04/world/lebanese-pipeline-wrecked-by-blast.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANESE PIPELINE WRECKED BY BLAST", "print_headline": "LEBANESE PIPELINE WRECKED BY BLAST", "body_text": " **********The pipeline that carries Iraqi crude oil to the Lebanese Mediterranean coast was blown up by an explosion today. **********The Government-controlled Radio Lebanon reported that the explosion, which it called sabotage, started a huge fire that was raging hours after the blast occurred in the northern district of Akkar at a point three miles south of the Syrian border. **********Mohammed Yusef Beydun, the Lebanese Minister of Petroleum and Industry, said pumping of the oil was discontinued pending repairs on the damaged pipe. **********Fire brigades from Beirut and Syria were enlisted to help put out the blaze, which began when spilled crude burned as a result of the explosion. **********The pumping of Iraqi petroleum to the Lebanese seaport of Tripoli, about 50 miles north of here, was resumed only a week ago after an interruption of six years due to the Lebanese civil strife and later to the Iraqi-Iranian war.

With great hoopla, it made the big move over ''The Hump,'' as its nemesis, Camel, was known, during the 1930's. For people now in their 20's and 30's, this was often the brand their fathers and mothers smoked. Who can forget its sponsorship of ''Your Hit Parade,'' or that catchy string of letters - L.S./M.F.T. ''Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco.'' **********By now, Lucky Strike has sold more than a trillion ''sticks,'' but like an aging movie star whose best roles are only memories, the brand faded from the limelight decades ago. A chart of its market share over the last three decades would show a line heading straight down. Strangled by filter products, the cigarette that in 1931 controlled 39 percent of the market now clings tenuously to a dwindling eight-tenths of 1 percent. **********In the world of consumer marketing, however, it is believed that a good name ought never die, and so the American Tobacco Company, which makes Lucky Strike, is betting what it calls ''big bucks'' that it can bring the magic back with a new low-tar filtered rendition.  Billboards are steadily cropping up across the nation heralding the rebirth: ''Lucky Strikes Again.'' **********A Cautious Introduction **********Lucky, however, has been striking at a cautious pace. The cigarette was first tested in Binghamton, N.Y., and Spokane, Wash., last November. When it recently wended its way to New York and Detroit, its penetration had only reached 40 percent of the country. ''We want to know that what we're doing is working,'' explained Thomas Hays, executive vice president of American Tobacco, which also makes Pall Mall, Carlton and Tareyton brands. **********According to Mr. Hays, the new brand has captured more than half a percent of the market in many cities and a full percent in some.  John Maxwell, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, reckons that viability in the frenzied cigarette industry, congested with some 200 brands, seems to begin at half a percent, which roughly translates into manufacturer revenues of $65 million. **********''It's one of the few new brands that have taken off in a while,'' said John Schiro, division general manager of ARA Services, a Binghampton vendor. ''Lucky has a good name. You ask people what L.S./M.F.T. means and they'll tell you.'' **********Indeed, a key reason why American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands, thinks the new Lucky will be a hit is because the name still rings a lot of bells. The first thing the company did almost two years ago was to determine if people remembered Lucky. To the surprise of the company, a remarkable 98 percent of smokers 35 and older knew the name and an even more amazing 97 percent of the younger set recognized it. The 'Toasted' Cigarette **********Lucky Strike was introduced in 1916, borrowing its name from a tobacco brand first used in 1871. Since the tobacco was refined by a cooking process, sales experts hit upon the idea of touting it as ''It's toasted.'' The notion became a famous Lucky slogan, and billboards boasting a toasting fork dotted the country's highways. **********The new smoke began a meteoric rise. Heavy advertising played a pivotal role. Among the Lucky themes: ''Luckies Use Only Center Leaves -The Center Leaves Give You the Mildest Smoke;'' ''With Men Who Know Tobacco Best, It's Luckies 2 to 1.'' **********To further spread brand awareness, the company turned to such things as a cigarette-rolling exhibition in New York and began in 1930 to sponsor the ''Lucky Strike Radio Show,'' which eventually starred the likes of Frank Sinatra and Phil Harris. Television was its next battleground. It backed ''The Lucky Strike Theater,'' ''Your Hit Parade'' and ''The Jack Benny Show.'' **********Originally, the Lucky Strike package was green, but during World War II the chromium needed for the green coloring became a valued war commodity. So, in 1942, the package became white with a red bull's eye, and the company got enormous mileage out of a ''Lucky Goes to War'' campaign. The L.S./M.F.T. slogan also was introduced at this time. Rise of the Filters **********It was all great while it lasted, but increasingly smokers became dismayed about all that tar the cigarette produced. The death knell for the big brands of the day - Camel and Chesterfield among them - was sounded in the early 1950's with the arrival of filtered cigarettes. **********One statistic succinctly tells the story: In 1953, filters controlled less than 10 percent of the cigarette market. In 1957, they had captured more than half of it. Along with its nonfiltered brethren, Lucky Strike commenced its long downward ride. **********Since the old Lucky Strike has been foundering for nearly three decades, what took American Tobacco so long to whip up a filtered version? Actually, the company made a couple of dismal stabs at it, but committed the mistake of failing to capitalize on the popular name. **********In 1956, it introduced a filtered cigarette called ''Hit Parade.'' It went nowhere, not being helped much by the fact that two years later the television show ''Your Hit Parade'' vanished. ''Hit Parade,'' the cigarette, disappeared in 1962. Then, in 1971, the company tried ''Lucky 10's,'' another flop that was finally scrapped last year. **********A jumble of magazine ads blanket Tom Hays's desk. He wanted to illustrate how the new Lucky Strike was trying to stand alone among its competitors. The cigarette is aimed at 21-to-35-year-old male smokers, so the key brands it has to battle are low-tar filtered versions of Marlboro, Winston and Camel. The Macho Problem **********Lucky tested three ad strategies. One was a nostalgia approach.  Consumers yawned. Then it tried a macho slant. The problem here was its rivals were big on macho. Mr. Hays nodded at a Marlboro ad of a cowboy on a horse romping through Marlboro country and a Winston ad of two construction workers. He pointed to a Camel ad of a man wading through a stream, a grave look on his face. ''How do you out-macho this?'' he asked. ''You'd have to go to outright killers.'' **********So it settled on an upbeat ad depicting a man in the foreground of a recording studio popping a Lucky out of a package, while three musicians drag on their Luckies in the background. **********''Through the scene here, you can see it's time to light up because they've just finished recording a song,'' Mr. Hays said. ''We show the man up front, but he's also a leader since there's a group behind him.'' **********The younger smokers Lucky is chasing often buy their packs out of vending machines, and so American Tobacco is making sure it snuggles in a lot of columns. The way to do that is the standard cigarette strategem of paying inducements. **********Vendors are being offered $4 a year per machine for each column of Lucky Strike filters. Stocking for the first time also gets them a free carton of filters as well as a bonus carton of Pall Mall reds.  Another $2 can be had for applying a sticker onto the machine pointing out Luckies. If a fresh sticker is put on six months later, another $2 arrives. **********To create a fresh wave of excitement, American Tobacco has dispatched fetching young women to dole out hundreds of thousands of samples on street corners, as well as in bars and discotheques. **********How sweet Lucky's comeback is, though, may in the end be determined by the luster of the name. ''Today there's a greater interest in antique cars and early American quilts,'' Mr. Hays remarked. ''So there's more interest in these older brands.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/20/world/north-lebanon-fears-israeli-drive.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1982-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTH LEBANON FEARS ISRAELI DRIVE", "print_headline": "NORTH LEBANON FEARS ISRAELI DRIVE", "body_text": " **********Fears are growing here in northern Lebanon that once the Beirut crisis is over, the Israelis will begin a drive against the Palestinians in the north and in the Bekaa Valley in the east, with the Lebanese again caught in the middle. **********With Israeli armored detachments deployed deep in northern Lebanon, such fears are being expressed by Lebanese officials, local residents, Palestinians and the Greek Orthodox bishop. **********The Israelis are viewed as intent on pushing the Palestinians out of all of Lebanon, even at the risk of clashes with the Syrian Army, which controls the northern and eastern sectors. **********In recent deployments the Israelis moved to the peaks at Aqura, 22 miles south of here, and then reportedly to the Bsharri area, 16 miles southeast of here.

Many people are said to be fleeing because they fear the Israelis will attack. **********Another reason why it is feared this area will come under attack is that it is the center of Lebanese Christian and Moslem groups favorable to Syria and opposed to Israel and to the Lebanese Christian alliance headed by Bashir Gemayel, who is seen here as an Israeli collaborator. Mr. Gemayel is a candidate in the presidential election due to be held in Parliament on Monday. **********There is no strong military force in the area to challenge the Israelis since most of the groups are splintered. Only the Syrians have any significant armed strength, and they are believed eager to avoid a confrontation with the Israelis after the losses the Syrians suffered in June in the Bekaa Valley. North Is Cut Off From Beirut **********The Israelis, by cutting the Beirut-Damascus highway, preventing the main Syrian force in the valley from going to the aid of the besieged Palestinians and Syrians in west Beirut. The Syrians and the Palestinians in the north are also cut off from Beirut, by the Israeli-backed Lebanese Christians. **********Syrian forces entered Lebanon in 1976 under a mandate from the Arab League to put an end to a civil war, and they still control northern Lebanon and the eastern slopes of the central mountain range and the Bekaa Valley. **********Diplomatic quarters say they do not expect a confrontation between the Israelis and the Syrian forces, which are estimated at 60,000, but believe that Israel will demand a Syrian pullout as the main condition for its own withdrawal from Lebanon. **********Syrian forces are spread out all over the Bekaa Valley and eastward from the village of Sofar on the Damascus road and south to the region of the Karaun hills. Estimates of the number of Palestinian guerrillas in the Bekaa Valley have ranged from 2,000 to 15,000. Syria Restraining Palestinians **********Syria has reportedly made it clear that it does not want those guerrillas to strike at Israeli forces from the Syrian-controlled area. At the same time, Syrian officials in Damascus have said privately that they cannot be held responsible for Palestinians throughout northern and eastern Lebanon. **********Lebanese here say they fear that, as in Beirut, they would suffer the most from any Israeli offensive in the north. Unlike Beirut, Tripoli does not seem to be a city prepared for war. There is little armed presence in Tripoli, which last year succeeded in getting the Syrian forces out of the city center. **********Many Lebanese here, among them former President Suleiman Franjieh, believe that the United States has a long-term plan to partition Lebanon into a mini-Christian state, under Israeli protection, and a Moslem state, where some 600,000 Palestinian refugees would be forcibly settled. Franjieh Denounces Israelis **********''Every night I pray that the Israelis will come here, because our mountains are easier to defend than the Bekaa,'' Mr. Franjieh, a 72-year-old Maronite Christian, said in an interview at his mountaintop retreat at Ihdin, 17 miles southeast of here. **********He said he hoped the Israelis would attack Syrian territory ''because it will cost them a lot.'' In such an event, he said, Syria's friendship treaty with the Soviet Union would come into play. **********Mr. Franjieh, who has been talked about as a possible presidential candidate with the support of Moslems and Syrians, declared that he would not agree to enter any election ''under the bayonets of the Israelis.'' **********The Moslem leader in Tripoli, former Prime Minister Rashid Karami, denounced Mr. Gemayel's candidacy and said the Moslems will boycott the election set for Monday. He said he did not believe that the Israelis would attack here because of the negative reaction of world opinion to what he described as ''the barbaric destruction of Beirut.'' Greek Orthodox Fears Clashes **********However, the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Tripoli, Metropolitan Elias Kozban, expressed concern that the Israelis might clash next with the Palestinians and their Lebanese allies here. The Bishop, who is a naturalized American, said the French, American and Italian peace force should be brought to Tripoli as well until the Lebanese Army can protect the area. **********Palestinian representatives also talked about possible Israeli attacks. However, Col. Abu Fawaz, an officer of Al Fatah, the main guerrilla group, said that while the Israelis would probably stage air strikes on Tripoli, he thought ''their tanks won't dare to come.'' **********He said the Palestinians had evidence that the Israelis had moved armored vehicles into positions along the central mountain crest in the region of Aqura. He declined to give any indication as to the number of Palestinian guerrillas in the area but said all organizations were represented and ''nobody is leaving.'' **********The rightist Lebanese Christian radio, Voice of Lebanon, has also reported Israeli tanks and trucks moving into the Aqura mountain area. **********The colonel said Palestinian relations with the local Lebanese were ''good because they realize they are targets like the Palestinians.'' **********However, visitors to Tripoli have found evidence of tension resulting from takeovers by Palestinians of some apartments and stores."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/08/business/getty-note-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Getty Note Offering", "print_headline": "Getty Note Offering", "body_text": " **********The Getty Oil Company said today that it planned a $100 million offering of 14 percent, seven-year notes in Europe.

The court ordered the agency to hold further hearings. **********The 73-megawatt plant, which would be diesel-powered, is in the Mission Hill section of Boston, and the suit that led to the court order was brought by local residents and the neighboring town of Brookline. **********Co-generation plants achieve about 30 percent greater efficiency than conventional power stations by recycling hot exhaust fumes and excess steam to produce more energy. The process requires unusually high combustion temperatures, resulting in increased emissions of some pollutants, depending on the fuel used. **********The prospect of further hearings is sending a ripple throughout the utility industry. ''It should alert other potential co-generator builders that we anticipate problems if they burn diesel fuel in cities,'' said Glenn H. Lovin, chairman of the International Co-Generation Society, a Washington clearing house for energy-saving technology. **********According to Mr. Lovin and other industry analysts, most new cogenerators, except those in isolated industrial areas, now use cleaner fuels, such as natural gas. ''Harvard's problems have become well known,'' he said. **********Harvard has repeatedly considered burning gas instead of oil, which is technologically possible with the diesel engines. But the idea was rejected because the university could not get sufficient guarantees of a steady supply of gas. **********The university began constructing the plant in 1976 to supply heat and chilled water to Harvard Medical School and 13 teaching hospitals. But installation of the diesel generators was delayed by court order for nearly three years, while the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering sought to establish standards for safe levels of nitrogen dioxide emissions, which can cause pulmonary and respiratory illnesses. **********In 1980, the agency resolved the nitrogen dioxide issue by ordering Harvard to curb operations. So far only the chilled water and steam facilities are operating. And legal fees, high interest rates and the cost of continued purchases of power have pushed cost estimates from an original level of $150 million to $260 million. **********In September, the court supported rulings issued by the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering. But to the surprise of both Harvard and state officials, the court said the question of the carcinogenic effect of particulate matter - as distinct from respiratory effects - had been improperly excluded from consideration. **********''It's really not an issue,'' said Robert Scott, the director of Harvard's financial systems. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency ''considered this problem in great detail a few years ago, and chose not to establish a standard,'' he said. ''If Massachusetts decides that these emissions are a risk, there is a serious problem for American cities, for the economy and for the power production industry, because these same materials are in the exhaust of cars, trucks, and buses.'' **********But Daniel G. Partan, a Boston University law professor and chairman of a Brookline committee studying the plant, says Harvard is trying to turn the issue into a broader one to advance its own cause. ''This is a question of the exposure of large numbers of people in the Boston area,'' where diesel emissions are already high, he said.  ''The judgment reached in this case does not translate into a judgment on other diesel engines of a different output in a different location.'' **********One place where those judgments are likely in the next few years is New York, where small diesel co-generators have been suggested to provide power supplies for large buildings. Indeed, since Harvard began its project the Federal Government has created incentives to make co-generation even more attractive. **********But while co-generation may be the wave of the future in cities, diesel co-generators are not. Speaking privately, Harvard officials have been heard recently to speculate whether less efficient engines such as turbines, or alternative fuels such as gas, might save years of regulatory headaches."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/30/business/newhall-land-farming-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEWHALL LAND & FARMING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "print_headline": "NEWHALL LAND & FARMING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/29/business/sullair-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SULLAIR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "SULLAIR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/03/world/vatican-is-frowning-on-test-tube-babies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vatican Is Frowning On Test-Tube Babies", "print_headline": "Vatican Is Frowning On Test-Tube Babies", "body_text": " **********The Vatican radio today condemned the phenomenon of test-tube babies, saying that scientists had ventured into the realm of immorality. **********Reporting on a recent condemnation of the practice by the Roman Catholic bishops of Australia, the radio said: ''From both the moral and social point of view, it is unacceptable that human embryos are taken from their natural place to become frozen or destroyed.'' **********''The desire to have children is deeply human and the efforts to find scientific means to satisfy this desire are admirable,'' the radio said, referring to the decision of the Australian bishops.

Voting Age Lowered **********The relatively strong Communist showing was attributed in part to a certain amount of dissatisfaction among leftists with the Socialist Government, but also in part to the eligibility of half a million new voters following a change in the voting age from 20 to 18. **********It was also clear that in municipalities where Communist and Socialist candidates competed in the runoff, the conservatives generally voted Communist. **********''We're afraid of the Socialists' concentration of power,'' one New Democracy voter explained.  In a statement last night, Prime Minister Papandreou hailed the Socialist victory, calling it ''a strong confirmation of the people's confidence in the work of the Government for change.'' **********On the other hand, Evangelos Averoff-Tossizza, the New Democracy leader, said that a large number of Socialist mayors had been elected with Communist support. He declared it was ''particularly troubling'' to note that the Communists had increased in strength perceptibly under the Socialist Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/01/business/planning-research-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PLANNING RESEARCH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "PLANNING RESEARCH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/01/business/tunisia-struggl-es-to-develop-fishing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 698, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TUNISIA STRUGGL ES TO DEVELOP FISHING", "print_headline": "TUNISIA STRUGGL ES TO DEVELOP FISHING", "body_text": " **********Increased poaching by Italian fishing boats, the authorities here complain, is undermining Tunisia's efforts to develop its fishing industry. **********There have been numerous incidents. In November, a Tunisian coast guard vessel seized a Sicilian boat on charges of illegally fishing in Tunisian territorial waters. The vessel, the 199-ton Maria Bernadette, had been seized earlier in the year on the same charge, and was released only after Italy paid a $100,000 fine. **********Shortly after the second arrest of the Maria Bernadette, Algeria announced that it had seized a Sicilian fishing trawler, the Michele Asaro, because the vessel had been found fishing less than 15 miles from the Algerian port of Bone. Western diplomats in Tunis say that Algeria at one time was holding five Sicilian trawlers, Tunisia at least a dozen and Libya three. **********The Tunisian fishing fleet, based in small ports like Bizerte, Sfax, Mahdia and Sousse, currently takes in close to 100,000 tons of fish annually. The World Bank says that with a more modern fishing fleet, Tunisia could quadruple the catch. Plans for Diversification **********Eager to expand and to diversify into areas such as canning, Tunisia recently signed agreements with several Japanese shipping companies to buy new trawlers. The Japanese Government is also sending fishing technicians and experts to map fertile fishing areas. **********The authorities in this Mediterranean port say that nearly all of the boats they have seized, as well as the vessels captured by Algeria and Libya, were registered in Mazara del Vallo, in southwestern Sicily. **********The seizures have prompted a fresh flurry of diplomatic activity, with Italian officials traveling to Tunis, Tripoli and Algiers to negotiate the release of the vessels. As a result of diplomatic efforts by Italy, Tunisia released 12 Italian boats in June after receiving $700,000 in fines. **********Senior Western diplomats in Tunis say that the fishing war in the Mediterranean dates back two decades. But the situation has worsened in the past two years as catches have become poorer because of spreading pollution, which has forced Sicily's 15,000 trawlers to range farther from their bases. The Mediterranean, according to environmentalists in Tunis and Rome, is becoming less fecund for fishing as enormous amounts of effluence from France, Italy and Greece are discharged into it each day. Territorial Waters Disputed **********The controversy appears to be exacerbated by questions about territorial waters. The generally accepted limit is 200 miles from the shores of a country. Italy has sovereignty over numerous small Mediterranean islands such as Pantelleria, and some Sicilian captains have reportedly argued that the 200-mile limit extends from the shores of these islands. **********Some Western environmentalists and fisheries experts say that o nly sardines can be found near shore in large quantities, while mackerel,tuna and othe r fish must be sought in deeper waters. **********In Bizerte a local fisherman, Moncef Habibe, pointed out to sea, where local boats dotted the horizon. ''Sometimes we see Sicilian boats,'' he said. ''The boats come right up to our boats, and their people even laugh at us and say, 'What can you Tunisians do, eh?' '' **********Tunisia has a shortage of vessels to patrol its waters. The navy has one frigate, four large patrol craft and ten coastal patrol boats, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Restraint in Libyan Waters **********''What is happening is that the Sicilian boats come and grab our fish, thus depriving Tunisian fleets of what should rightfully be their catch,'' said Ahmad Chamkhi, a fishing entrepreneur in Mahdia.  ''Sadly, Tunisia's navy doesn't have enough boats to go about catching these people who intrude on our waters.'' **********The Sicilian crews seldom take such chances in Libyan waters, according to Western diplomats in Tunis.  That is because, as one European envoy put it, the Libyans ''play it rough.'' Libyan gunboats patrol the Mediterranean and Sicilian sailors have reported that Libyan crews fire warning shots frequently at their vessels. Unlike Tunisia and Algeria, which hold the Sicilian boats but generally release their crews, the Libyans usually arrest the Sicilians and put them on trial."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/06/business/advertising-hood-hope-of-tulsa-wins-shakey-s-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hood, Hope of Tulsa Wins Shakey's Account", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Hood, Hope of Tulsa Wins Shakey's Account", "body_text": " **********Hood, Hope & Associates, based in Tulsa, Okla., and the largest ad agency in the state, has been appointed the national agency for Shakey's, the Dallas-based fast-food chain, and will be taking over from Chiat/Day in Los Angeles. **********The agency is elated, according to Mark Owens, public relations director, because it was in competition with seven other agencies that were all from Texas, just like the client, and whipped them all. **********Shakey's, a subsidiary of Hunt International Resources, has 500 restaurants in 50 markets and pizza is the specialty.

Thus, when CBS Inc. announced last week that Peter M. Perez, the respected president of its Steinway & Sons unit, had resigned ''to pursue personal interests,'' the news of the thinly disguised ouster struck like a discordant note. **********''I don't think Peter Perez had an enemy in the musical business,'' said John Browning, a prominent American pianist. ''It looks like a strong-arm type of thing to me.'' **********In a sparsely worded release issued last week, CBS, Steinway's corporate parent since 1972, stated only that Mr. Perez had left to direct his family's business and investment holdings. CBS named as his replacement 40-year-old Lloyd W. Meyer, who most recently had been president of Gulbransen Industries, the organ maker, which is also part of the CBS family. Clarification Refused **********John McLaren, the president of CBS's musical instruments group, would not be pinned down on his reasons for switching presidents, other than to insist that they were sound ones and for the good of Steinway. **********For his part, Mr. Perez said in a recent interview, CBS is being less than truthful. He is not devoting full time to any family business, he contends, because he owns only a few stocks. In any event, he insists, he did not leave of his own accord. Mr. Perez says that Mr. McLaren handed him a letter of resignation to sign and made it clear that the only option available was to be dismissed. **********While that scenario still begs the question of 'Why?', other Steinway sources, who requested anonymity, said that Mr. Perez was given four reasons for being replaced: he did not nurture a good working relationship with the Steinway family, especially Henry Steinway, the piano maker's former chairman who now acts as a consultant; he was a ''publicity hound''; he failed to improve product quality, and he was ''born with a silver spoon in his mouth.'' Consolidation Strategy Cited **********Mr. Perez, however, maintains that other - more significant - factors led to his discharge. He suspects, he said, that his removal is part of a strategy to resuscitate the troubled Gulbransen unit.  Whereas Steinway has been making money, Gulbransen has not been doing well. In order to breathe new life into Gulbransen, Mr. Perez says, CBS intends to combine certain aspects of the two. **********''I think this violates our time-honored mission of directing all our time to building the best piano,'' protested Mr. Perez, a polite, soft-spoken man of 42, in an interview from his home in Connecticut. **********''I think I see CBS trying to capitalize on the Steinway name with this very ill-suited marriage with Gulbransen organs. Yes, they're both keyboard, yes they're in the music business, but they're very dissimilar products. It just doesn't make sense.'' No Link, CBS Says **********Mr. McLaren contends that no marriage between the two units is in the works, although he confirmed that Gulbransen's headquarters in Deerfield, Ill., is scheduled to be closed in favor of unspecified smaller quarters. According to Mr. McLaren, Gulbransen's fortunes have nothing to do with Mr. Perez's departure. **********Mr. Perez, who is away job-hunting this week, said he feared most that the peerless quality of the Steinway pianos might ultimately erode, especially if CBS decides to have Mr. Meyer preside over both companies, a decision it has not yet made. Mr. Perez was known for putting in long days at the Steinway offices and factory in the Long Island City section of Queens. **********Indeed, the quality of Steinways had already come in for some criticism in recent years. Materials do not match past quality. Fewer good technicians are available. Nobody has been saying that anyone else makes a piano better than Steinway, but some have grumbled out loud that Steinways do not seem to be up to snuff anymore. Quality Is Debated **********Periodic debates have also flared over whether the Steinways coming out of the American factory were equal to those emerging from the company's plant in Hamburg, West Germany. **********During Mr. Perez's three-and-a-half-year tenure, though, many in the concert business feel that important strides have been in upgrading the Steinway line. CBS, for its part, has been generous in channeling cash into the concern. **********''I'm just terribly afraid that this decision is one that's leading us down a very slippery path,'' said a Steinway employee who asked not to be identified. **********According to Mr. Perez, Steinway in 1981 had its best year since 1941, garnering more than $7 million in pretax profit on sales of more than $50 million. On the other hand, he says, Gulbransen lost some $5.5 million on $7.5 million in sales. ''That's not too easy a trick,'' he said. CBS would not comment on the results of either company. Chairman Remains Silent **********John Steinway, Steinway's chairman and the great-grandson of the piano maker's founder, chose to remain silent on the management change when reached in London, where he was attending a weekend performance by Vladimir Horowitz. **********A number of Steinway dealers responded with bewilderment and unease to the top-level shift.  ''I think at first we were all ready to cut our wrists and bleed all over the place,'' said Skip Daynes, the head of Daynes Music Company in Salt Lake City, which has been a Steinway dealer for 120 years. ''Peter Perez is one of the best piano men I've ever met.'' **********''I'm shocked to death,'' said Bill Mattlin, the president of Mattlin-Hyde Pianos in Cleveland. ''I thought the world of Peter Perez.'' **********''The product has been better than ever under Peter Perez,'' added another dealer. ''As far as I knew, he was doing a good job.'' Similar dismay was voiced by some Steinway artists.  Mr. McLaren, for his part, said he believes that the tempest will soon subside. He has chatted with the top 25 or 30 Steinway dealers and anticipates no strains in their relationship, he said. ''There's no individual whose presence or absence rocks that relationship,'' he said. **********Amid all this, Mr. Perez says he cares most about the fate of the piano. ''I pray the quality won't decline,'' he said. ''I just see a dilution of effort when you're not thinking every minute of every day of making it a little bit better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/business/aar-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AAR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "AAR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/04/world/wild-camels-found-in-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wild Camels Found in China", "print_headline": "Wild Camels Found in China", "body_text": " **********Wild camels, which are considered on the verge of extinction, have been found in northwest China, the official New China News Agency reported today.

The yellow-bordered magazine with the fancy p hotographs. Maps. Coffee-table books. Television specials on g orillas or gems or some such thing. **********Then ask George E. Moffat, director of advertising for National Geographic magazine. He talks about something quite different. He talks about trouble. **********''We've had one of our roughest years ever,'' said Mr. Moffat. ''If things aren't turned around, you'll talk to someone else if you call here next year.'' At the magazine, which generates more than 60 percent of the society's gross income, advertising revenues fell 30 percent in 1982, to about $22 million. Mr. Moffat said the recession had scared off advertisers. **********And the bad news for the society does not end there: *********** The magazine's circulation dropped in 1982, the first year that had happened since the Depression. Though the decline was comparatively slight, 250,000 out of a total circulation of 10.7 million, it nonetheless worries top brass at the society. *********** Only 84 percent of the society's members renew their memberships these days, down from a renewal rate of more than 90 percent in the 1970's. *********** The society's membership fee, which includes a subscription to the magazine, was recently raised to $15 a year, from $13.50. That marks the third increase in three years, and some staff members expect it might lead to a further drop in renewals. **********Yet with nearly $290 million in assets - including some of the priciest real estate in Washington, its home town - the 94-year-old society remains one of the richest nonprofit groups in the country.  Officials say those assets insure the society's long-term health. **********And whatever the current trouble, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, the society's president, said he remained optimistic. Mr. Grosvenor, 51 years old and the fifth member of his family to lead the society, said that, after a ''very dismal'' period caused by the stagnant economy earlier this year, ''we're doing O.K. now.'' Unless the economy further deteriorates, he said, ''1983 will be a good year for us,'' due largely to major retrenchment. **********In 1981, the society had overall revenues of $272 million.  Membership dues accounted for $134 million. Scientific research grants took $2.5 million. Income of $13 million from the society's investments helped offset a $9 million operating loss on the magazine. The society is in good enough shape that it will pay for its new $30 million Washington headquarters in cash. **********Many financial analysts who follow the publishing ventures of the society said the society's future is secure, as long as it overcomes its current membership and advertising difficulties. Even competitors admit they share the optimistic forecast. **********''Sure, the Geographic may be having problems,'' said Don Moser, editor of Smithsonian magazine, a glossy history-and-science journal published by the Smithsonian Institution (circulation 2 million).  ''But I doubt the problems are very serious. There are a million ways they could cut costs if it were necessary.'' **********To an extent, it already has beennecessary. Mr. Grosvenor said belt-tightening at the society would continue. A hiring freeze was imposed. Accounting procedures were redesigned. To the chagrin of staff members who had grown accustomed to prime rib at 30,000 feet, workers have been barred from first-class air travel. ''Me included,'' said Mr. Grosvenor. By slicing travel costs, the society saved $1 million in 1982. **********But cost-cutting has been coupled with a bid to raise revenues.  The society is hoping, for example, that a new high-demographic edition of the Geographic, will bring in new advertising dollars. **********Set to make its debut next month, the new edition has been informally dubbed Big G. It will carry the same editorial material that appears in the larger-circulation national edition but boast cheaper ad rates and a more selective audience: readers in 36 of the nation's most affluent metropolitan areas. **********The average Big G reader, according to the society, will have a median household income of $30,900, versus $28,800 for the national edition. Financial analysts say that difference can mean a lot to Madison Avenue. **********John S. Reidy, who follows the publishing industry for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said Big G could entice new advertisers, including some who had long wished to reach only the Geographic's wealthier readers. ''I have confidence,'' he said. PERHAPS more important, the new edition might also win back a dvertisers who, because of the recession, were frightened away by t he eyepopping cost of ads appearing in the full run of the m agazine. (National Geographic's drop in advertising revenue this y ear wasn't typical of the industry. According to the Magazine P ublishers Association, major consumer magazines posted a 5 percent a d-revenue rise for the first 11 months of the year over the same p eriod in 1981.) A one-page color ad in the magazine's full run costs$ 117,100, compared with $54,000 in Big G and $33,400 in Smithsonian. T he society is planning to start other editions aimed at special d emographic groups. **********These efforts are directed more to advertisers than readers. After two generations of circulation growth for National Geographic - circulation rose 50 percent in the last decade -the society seems more concerned about having a stable number of readers than in expansion. ''I think there's an ideal circulation for every magazine,'' Mr. Grosvenor said. ''It's entirely possible that at a circulation of between 10 million and 11 million, growth would stop for us.'' He said, however, the society does not intend to watch the numbers fall any further. **********The society is changing in other ways. The magazine's coverage has been broadened and its graphic design brightened. The cover of the October issue, for example, highlighted an article on silicon chips.  Some readers found the story a far cry from the magazine's traditional fare of animal and country profiles. **********The society has begun experimenting with new fund-raising techniques. It has shifted much of its promotional budget for membership from a direct-mail campaign to television commercials.  Television has worked well, the society reports, in finding new subscribers for World, its seven-year-old magazine for children. **********Mr. Grosvenor said the society's future would be largely electronic. Within five years, he said, National Geographic articles and collections of some of the five million photographs in the society's archives could be available on laser disks for use in homes and schools, creating new, potentially large revenues.The society is also looking into television."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/business/montana-dakota-utilities-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONTANA-DAKOTA UTILITIES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "MONTANA-DAKOTA UTILITIES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/29/business/earnings-massey-ferguson-shows-wider-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 417, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MASSEY-FERGUSON SHOWS WIDER LOSS", "print_headline": "EARNINGS; MASSEY-FERGUSON SHOWS WIDER LOSS", "body_text": " **********Massey-Ferguson Ltd., the financially troubled farm-implement maker based in Toronto, reported yesterday that its loss more than tripled in the second fiscal quarter, ended April 30, to $25.7 million, from $8 million a year earlier. **********The loss came on a 23 percent decline in sales, to $558 million, from $720.7 million in the 1981 quarter.

Then buy a new option on the same stock. Anyone who does that believes the shares underlying the call are going to stop going down and rally strongly. **********The customer - or speculator - is using a so-called bull spread. It is designed to reduce risk while offering the hope of above average rates of return. When used in connection with a dying option, it can help an individual reduce or recapture the original cost and even provide a limited profit. **********A call option gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at a preset exercise price. The basic strategy is to exercise the call when the actual price is substantially higher. In this bear market most call options have been unsuccessful. That's because current stock prices are well below most exercise prices. **********Thus, one broker is urging customers to use a spread to recoup.  Look, for example, at the recent action in Bally Manufacturing. The stock has dropped 5 points in the last two months. Those who bought calls on Bally before that drop are threatened with option losses. **********Consider a speculator who bought the Bally November 35 call option. Say that speculator paid $200 - 2 points - in May for each of 10 of those calls, or $2,000. At the time, Bally sold at 32. The option holder clearly expected a rally in Bally. Instead the shares dropped to 27. **********For the speculator to profit, Bally would have to move higher than 37 by the expiration on Nov. 20. That's because the speculator must get back the 2-point cost, only possible at the expiration if the stock is at 37, 2 points above the striking price of 35. There are also transaction costs of about $100. **********Will Bally reach 37-plus by mid-November? It seems unlikely, since that price would represent a gain of more than 37 percent in a short time. **********Should the speculator give up? Some who believe the bear market has far to go would say yes. But not Arthur Kaufman, who urges Shearson/ American Express clients who still like their stocks to ''repair'' failing option positions. **********Mr. Kaufman, who is Shearson's vice president in charge of option marketing, obviously has an ax to grind. He acknowledged that these repairs sometimes cost money, saying: ''The speculator has an opportunity to lower his breakeven point -in this case from 37 to 32. But he limits his up-side potential and pays more commissions.'' **********What the speculator does is sell the 10 calls he or she owns along with 10 identical calls that he or she does not own. The price: about 3/4, or $75, a call. That is, the customer would receive $1,500 for the 20 calls. To avoid being short the second lot he or she uses all $1,500 to buy 10 November calls with an exercise price of 30. Bally is more likely to reach 30 than 35, so these calls cost more - 1 1/2. **********Commission costs would amount to about $200 for the 30 options involved. ''The resulting position is called a bull spread,'' Mr.  Kaufman said. **********The speculator now owns 10 calls with an exercise price of 30 and is short 10 calls at an exercise price of 35. The speculator has not eliminated the 2-point deficit experienced in establishing the original call position. Thus, Bally must reach 32 in order for the speculator to break even. **********That is, if Bally does reach 32 the calls at 30 would be trading at 2, and each of the 10 would be worth $200 - $2,000 for the lot. The calls at 35 the speculator is short would be worthless and there would be no obligation there. In the event of a bull market, the 10 short calls would be covered by the 10 calls the speculator owned. So a vigorous rally in Bally would limit profits on the long calls but the risk on the short calls would be eliminated. **********To wit, let's assume that Bally experiences a major rally, moving substantially higher than 37. The speculator would be asked to deliver 1,000 shares of stock at 35. But the speculator has the right to buy 1,000 shares at 30. There is a difference of 5 points less 2 points - $5,000 less the $2,000 paid for the initial call - $3,000 in profit. **********That would be true whether Bally reached 40 or 50 or really hit the jackpot. Obviously, had Bally reached 50, for example, the unhedged speculator who rode out the storm with the original November 35 calls would have made a killing, specifically 15 points minus the 2 points cost, or $13,000. **********But the unhedged speculator would be more likely to lose the $2,000 original cost and would lose it all if the stock was 35 or less at expiration. **********Mr. Kaufman noted that the risk of establishing the spread is increased by $200 - the additional transaction costs. If Bally closes at any price under $30 all options in this example - both the long and the short expire worthless - and the customer's total costs represent commissions plus the $2,000 paid for the initial 10 call options -''which he would have lost anyway,'' he said. **********''I would emphasize that the objective in using this strategy is to increase the chance of breaking even with the possibility of making a modest profit,'' Mr. Kaufman said. He added that the strategy would, of course, be applicable to losing positions in many other stocks with call options."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/05/business/kearney-national-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-27.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEARNEY-NATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 27", "print_headline": "KEARNEY-NATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 27", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/29/business/mgm-ua-and-warner-ends-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Aljean Harmetz", "pub_date": "1982-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 375, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MGM UA AND WARNER ENDS TALKS", "print_headline": "MGM UA AND WARNER ENDS TALKS", "body_text": " **********Warner Communications said today that it had terminated discussions aimed at acquiring the United Artists music company and Warner Bros. pre-1950 film library from MGM/UA, an unexpected decision that casts a long shadow over MGM/UA's efforts to resolve its financial problems. **********MGM/UA, which carries bank debt totaling $670 million, would have received approximately $95 million from the sale.

By night, after the evening cannon fire, they have been eating and shopping. **********Ramadan is observed by the great majority of Cairo's more than 10 million people, and many of them have been shopping for holiday clothes and presents in addition to food. The shopping has been a bonanza for merchants, though not for those businessmen dependent on imports from Lebanon. **********That trade, said Zohair Hamdan, a Lebanese diplomat here, ''has been completely paralyzed'' by the Beirut crisis. Hasn't Dampened Festivities **********But the repercussions of the crisis have not dampened Cairenes' Ramadan festivities, said Dr. Munir Abdelmagid, a dentist, ''because this feast is part of their religion.'' **********And yet, other Cairenes say, past Ramadans have been affected by Middle East convulsions that were closer at hand. Because of the lunar calendar, the annual Ramadan holy month is celebrated at various times of the year. **********The Ramadan festivities in 1973 were made more joyous, they report, by elation over the Arab-Israeli war in October, which was seen here as a great victory.

The exchange rates that street money-changers give for the Egyptian pound have fluctuated only slightly, if at all, since Israel invaded Lebanon on June 6. **********This spring, however, the rates dipped markedly for a time when Egypt regained the last slice of the Sinai Peninsula from Israel.

Supporting the argument, military analysts said, are the evident dangers to the British task force in continuing the blockade in the face of numerically superior Argentine air power and three unlocated submarines. Also on the side backing a landing, the analysts said, was the relative ease of Friday's commando raid on Pebble Island. **********The alternative to landings by marine commandos and paratroops in battalion strength is a series of hit-and-run raids by commandos against isolated Argentine outposts. These would serve to keep the Argentine garrisons off balance and apprehensive, but they are unlikely to have the military or political impact of the establishment ashore of two or more battalions. **********Say British Would Have Edge **********Major landings would have their own risks. But the military view here is that as long as the landings were made at some distance from the main Argentine garrisons on East Falkland Island at Stanley and Darwin, the British could consolidate their landings and be in a favorable position, backed by Harrier jet fighters and helicopter support, to rebuff Argentine counterattacks. **********Harriers carried out another attack on the Stanley airfield late Saturday. This could have been part of the softening up process preparatory to landings, or it could have been simply another effort to tighten the blockade by hitting the island's only major airfield. **********The British tactical problem is complicated by the presence on the islands of four or five mobile radar systems. Most of these are operating on East Falkland. **********When the task force sailed six weeks ago, the Royal Navy advertised its capacity to jam both radar and communictions between the islands and the mainland. Evidently, it has not been able to halt the radar transmissions. The Argentine teams, constantly on the move, pick up ships of the task force as they approach the islands and transmit the information to air and sea headquarters on the mainland.  Military Urges Landings **********This ability to pinpoint the British ships as they approach the islands is one of the reasons why British military leaders are urging the Government to permit landing operations soon. The military leaders are concerned, an official said, by the prospect that further time will be wasted in what they regard as futile talks at the United Nations. **********Another reason is that the air and sea blockade is not as tight as had been hoped. One object of the Pebble Island operation was to eliminate the airstrip on which light aircraft, based on the mainland, had been landing supplies, which were then ferried to East Falkland or dropped to the garrisons on West Falkland and at Darwin. **********British sources are confident that supply missions of this sort do not lessen the overall impact of the blockade. But they concede that garrisons running short of food and spare parts can be kept going by frequent air drops. **********One of the main distributors of supplies reaching Pebble Island was the Argentine supply ship Isla de los Estados. The British frigate Alacrity apparently sunk her with four rounds from a 4.5-millimeter gun last week. British Gathering Information **********The raid by 50 commandos on Pebble Island and reports from the 100 or more troops on the Special Boat Squadron believed to be operating on East Falkland for the last 10 days have provided the task force with a great deal of information about the size and state of readiness of the Argentine garrisons. **********But the information, although valuable, does not outweigh the difficulties that the British have faced since the outset of the operation. **********Sir Michael Beetham, head of the Royal Air Force, has been apprehensive about Britain's numerical weakness in the air since the Falkland operation began, according to an air force source. **********The 20 or more Harriers available, the source said, are not sufficient to maintain air protection of the fleet and simultaneously support a landing. Landings can be made, military sources are confident, but the troops ashore would then be vulnerable to air attack from the Argentine mainland. **********British planners point out that the most successful Argentine attack - the disabling of the destroyer Sheffield -was carried out by Argentine aircraft flying from mainland bases. **********They balance this with British successes against the Argentine surveillance ship Narval and the bombing of airfields and installations in Stanley and Goose Green. They add that the Super Etendard fighter bombers aboard Argentina's only carrier have played no role in the fighting. Next 5 Days Called Critical **********As far as could be learned from qualified sources, the British Chiefs of Staff have told the Government for the last week that conditions for a landing will be better in the next five days than they are likely to be until winter storms abate. **********The ground has been prepared by the attacks on Stanley, by the accumulation of detailed intelligence about the location, morale and state of armament of the garrison and by the addition of the transport ship Canberra, with about 2,500 troops aboard, to the task force. To allow the Canberra and later the Queen Elizabeth 2, carrying the Fifth Brigade, to loiter off the Falklands in defiance of the threat of Argentine aircraft and submarines is to ''invite trouble,'' a senior naval officer said. **********The view in senior military quarters is that a blockade, no matter how tight, is unlikely to force an Argentine surrender.  Options other than major landings do not commend themselves to the army or the navy. One obvious option is ''littoral warfare,'' enshrined in British military doctrine since the Napoleonic wars. But warfare of this type involving repeated air- or seaborne landings is unlikely to be profitable or even possible as the weather deteriorates. 'Macbeth' Invoked **********Any or all such landings could involve the construction of a makeshift airstrip for use by Harriers and Sea King helicopters.  Despite the obvious dangers involved in a major landing, the Chiefs of Staff, it was learned, favor this as the most effective choice available to them with the present resources and the prevailing weather. **********One planner summed up the situation with a quotation from ''Macbeth'': ''If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/26/business/norcross-struggles-to-survive-its-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 890, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORCROSS STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE ITS DEBT", "print_headline": "NORCROSS STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE ITS DEBT", "body_text": " **********Norcross Greeting Cards has had four owners since its founder, Arthur Norcross, died in 1968. Now the company is close to extinction. **********First, it went to a wildlife foundation, as specified in Mr.  Norcross's will. Then it was sold to William Mannion, a Philadelphia businessman. Later he sold it to the Ziff Corporation, a New York publisher, which picked it up to augment Rust Craft Greeting Cards, a floundering Massachusetts company that Ziff had purchased primarily for its television holdings. **********Finally, the combination of Norcross and Rust Craft was acquired by Windsor Communications Inc., a privately held company. With $23 million in liabilities last August, Windsor entered into Chapter 11 proceedings under the Federal bankruptcy law and has quit producing greeting cards. **********Windsor's debts stem largely from its expensive consolidation of Norcross and Rust Craft in a field that is dominated by two giants.  ''This industry is not 1, 2, 3,'' said J. Kendrick Noble Jr., who follows the industry for Paine, Webber, Mitchell Hutchins. Composition of a Market **********Hallmark and the American Greetings Corporation together account for 75 percent of the $2 billion greeting card market. A third company, Gibson Greeting Cards, has a market share of about 10 percent. Even after Norcross and Rust Craft joined forces, they commanded only 6 or 7 percent of the market, analysts say. **********But Windsor's larger problems, industry experts suggest, probably have had more to do with a doubtful marketing strategy than with any debt financing problems. **********According to Margery Forer, president of the National Association of Greeting Card Publishers, the company's effort to produce and sell both upscale Norcross cards and mass-market Rust Craft cards did not work out. **********''You can't straddle and be successful,'' she said. ''Norcross was always associated with a particular look. After Mr. Norcross died, no one continued that look, and you didn't know what to expect. They never seemed to focus on any other styling or market.'' A Look at Windsor's Costs **********Moreover, according to an industry executive who asked not to be identified, the split marketing strategy created cost problems.  Greeting card producers can cut production costs by maximizing production runs, he said, but Windsor, by maintaining its two distinct lines, was in effect increasing its costs. **********C. Charles Smith, Windsor's chairman, takes issue with that view.  ''The cost of production really had nothing to do with our financial difficulty,'' he said. The company's troubles, he declared, derived mainly from obstacles encountered in financing its debts. **********The debts began piling up about a year ago after Windsor spent $10 million to close Rust Craft's Dedham, Mass., plant, to pay employees incentives to stay on until the closing date and to relocate the operation in West Chester, 25 miles west of Philadelphia. ''I think we did too much too soon,'' a Norcross manager said. **********One of the obstacles Mr. Smith referred to involved a dispute over an audit by Price Waterhouse that led to the accounting firm's refusal to issue financial statements. Fresh Line of Credit Lost **********The dispute apparently centered on a reversal by Price Waterhouse of accounting procedures used in the company audit. The accounting firm would not give details, but the lack of a financial statement resulted in Windsor's losing a fresh line of credit and a lowinterest loan with which it intended to purchase the building that houses its center of operations here. **********Windsor encountered another obstacle when its primary financing source, the A.J. Armstrong Company, was acquired in August 1981 by the Security Pacific Financial Corporation. Nancy V. Alquist, a Windsor lawyer, said, ''The new entity had a change in lending policy that resulted in the loss of a credit line of approximately $13 million.'' **********However, analysts suggest, Security Pacific Financial's cut in financing may also have been due to Windsor's unstable condition.  In August 1982, with its debts mounting, Windsor was asked by its creditors to file for involuntary bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Federal bankruptcy law. Under Chapter 7, a company is liquidated and its assets distributed among the creditors. Reorganization Procedure **********Windsor responded, however, by filing for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11, which allows the company to continue operating either under a court-appointed trustee or with current management.  Windsor is now being managed by Mr. Smith, the chairman and one of the company's four shareholders. **********Windsor stopped producing greeting cards several weeks ago. With its current work force of 75 employees, the company is cutting back its operations and paying off its debts. **********As part of that process, the company recently sold its Canadian affiliate, Rust Craft Ltd., and roughly one-quarter of its American inventory. The sales price exceeded $2.5 million. **********Mr. Smith said Windsor had not yet presented its plan for reorganization to the bankruptcy court. Thus, he explained, he could not be specific as to hopes for the company's future. **********He did say, however, that he would like to see Windsor operate eventually at about one-third its prior revenue base of $80 million.  It could do so, he said, by using existing manufacturing and distributing plants in Joliet, Ill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/18/business/executive-changes-258590.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Burger King Corporation, Miami, has appointed Herb D.

The shares closed the day at 10 1/4 for a twoday gain of 2 1/8. **********Savin, an innovative office copier enterprise, did not identify the other side but disclosed that, among other endeavors, the would-be buyer of its shares was in the office equipment business. Savin added that the negotiated price would probably be in the region of $9 a share. **********Completion of the deal would end Wall Street guessing as to how Savin would exploit its new liquid-process copier. Savin has been building a new plant to market the device in upstate New York and needs additional financial muscle. The company has already spent at least $40 million on the plant and may spend a similar amount in future to complete the manufacturing facility. **********Last May, Savin appeared to have found the answer when it announced a tentative agreement to combine office machine marketing efforts with the Olivetti Group of Italy, but the plan was scrapped. **********Harry Edels on of the First Boston Corporation regards Savin as a particularly attractive property for a multinational. Savin's independent d ealer network has built an impressive army of satisfied customers in the United States in recent years. But technological shortcomings have limited Savin's machines to the lower, somewhat less profitab le end of the market. **********Now Savin's so-called Landa technology may put the company in direct competition with the giants. The Landa approach was developed by an employee of that name at Israeli facilities of Savin. **********On a prototype basis, the Landa machine has produced sharper images than prior liquid-toner machines. The new system suspends the paper above the imaging drum. Unlike older liquid-toner machines, the Landa version does not soak the paper with isobars. **********Since isobars cause air pollution, Savin copier speeds have been limited to 12 to 15 copies a minute. The prototype machine produces 60 copies a minute without isobar problems. If the company can achieve similar results with production models costing $15,000 to $20,000, it could offer stiff competition to equivalent-speed Xerox and Kodak models costing $80,000 to $90,000, Savin says. **********There are a number of ifs in the situation, though. Many wonder whether Savin will prove to be a successful manufacturer, though Stanford J. Garrett, an analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, is impressed with the people the company has hired to run the plant as well as with the highly automated facility. **********The decision to become a manufacturer was forced on Savin under a settlement with its former manufacturer, Ricoh of Japan. Under the terms of that agreement, Ricoh was barred from the United States market for three years. The Landa technology is Savin's answer to Ricoh and other tough competitors from Japan. **********The company has said that the technology can be retrofitted to earlier models of its liquid process copiers. With a $500 million annual market, Savin is perhaps poised for major success. **********Savin's plant is nearly complete, but the company must have additional financing if it is to move into high gear. Savin's $200 million in debt represents a lofty 54 percent of capital, and $80 million is due in five years. Thus, an influx of capital seems essential. **********''This is a classic bet-the-company situation'' Mr. Garrett said in referring to Savin's decision to take on heavy debt and become a manufacturer. He believes that the company has ''oversold'' the Landa process in saying that it is as important to the busines as Xerox's first copier. **********Nevertheless, he is impressed with the retrofitting feature and believes a very large portion of the current customer base will opt for the Landa process. To Mr. Garrett, the key question involves how good the new process is. **********It impressed him in prototype. He said that the dealer organization was happy to stay with Savin but added that alternative technology was available from Japan. The dealers probably will not remain loyal if Savin fails with its new product, he said. **********Mr. Edelson believes that, if Savin is able to produce a machine that meets planned specifications soon, the company could gain significant market share. But if Savin faces delays, Ricoh and othe r Japanese companies could threaten the market Savin already holds. **********Savin continues to sell Ricoh-made machines and after several losing quarters may become profitable again soon. John Westergaard of Equity Research Associates believes Savin will have nominal losses at worst in the quarter ending this month. He is recommending the shares for the long term on a basis that the company could earn $8 to $12 a share in the fiscal year 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/16/business/executive-changes-213690.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** American Airlines announced that R.J.

Harper Jr., an executive vice president who was named in the suit, sold 68,938 shares of his Continental stock between April 22 and April 30 this year at prices between $29.75 and $30 a share. After the sale, Mr. Harper was left with 1,850 shares. **********At the time Mr. Harper sold his shares, there had been no public disclosure that the bank might have large losses. In response to a reporter's question, a bank spokesman said that Mr. Harper sold his stock ''for the sole reason of realigning his personal investment plans.'' **********Other executives named in the suit were Roger E. Anderson, Continental's chairman; John H. Perkins, president; Donald C. Miller, vice chairman, and Gerald K. Bergman, executive vice president in charge of special industries services. **********Ray Groves, chairman of Ernst & Whinney, said he had not known about the suit until he was informed by a reporter. But he said, ''We certainly stand behind our report and audit and will respond in the appropriate fashion in the appropriate court.'' **********Beyond Continental's relationship with the failed Penn Square Bank, the suit also cites the bank's loans to other troubled companies.  They include American Invsco, $250 million; AM International, $12 million; International Harvester, $200 million; Flight Transportation, $6 million; Grupo Alfa of Mexico, $100 million; Turbo Resources, $50 million; Nucorp Energy, $130 million; Balmoral Mines, $30 million, and Wickes Companies, $31 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/30/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1982-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 19, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** James G.

Successful some years ago in getting the age changed to 70 from 65 for most working people, the Florida Democrat now wants to eliminate an age cap completely. **********Vigorous at 81, Representative Pepper (who was a Senator for many years) is widely regarded as a walking advertisement for elimination of any age barrier in employment. **********Dr. Arthur Flemming, president of the National Council on Aging, recently suggested that the Reagan Administration might support a bill eliminating any retirement age if it would not require companies to hire new people over 70. Dr. Flemming expressed optimism about legislative passage this year. **********''I have long advocated making illegal compulsory retirement on basis of age,'' he said. ''It has already been eliminated in the Federal Government. If the law is amended, it would effectively encourage the private sector to utilize this available resource -our older people. It would prevent a great deal of costly mental and physical deterioration. Companies that have regarded older people as an asset have had satisfactory experiences.'' **********As an example, Dr. Flemming mentioned the Travelers Insurance Company, which offers its retired workers part-time employment not only to supplement their pensions but also to alleviate the disorientation of retirement. **********Encouraging people to work longer and encouraging companies to consider keeping them on the job could help the Social Security system, which faces the specter of a swelling outflow of money for pensions without enough payroll deduction money coming in. Members of both parties in Congress have been talking of increasing the age for early retirement and of raising the regular Social Security retirement age above 65. **********Meanwhile, though, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a record number of unemployed older workers. According to figures for this year's second quarter, released Friday, people aged 55 or older who were described as ''unwillingly unemployed'' and were seeking jobs totaled 744,000, up from 500,000 a year earlier. And 334,000 additional people of 55 or older had become discouraged and quit looking for work, the bureau found. **********Partly as a result of the recession, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and various states have been deluged with age discrimination lawsuits. **********There has been a sharp increase since the fiscal year 1979, when 5,374 cases were filed with Federal and state agencies. The total rose to 11,076 the following year and to 15,311 last year. Much of this growth is a result of layoffs in manufacturing industries, hard hit by the economic slump. **********One significant aspect of the outlook for jobless older persons seeking work is the fact that their duration of unemployment is about 20 percent longer than the average for the entire population."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/14/business/article-219690-no-title.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shabecoff", "pub_date": "1982-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 219690 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 219690 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********Despite the global slump in the world oil market, 23 companies today made high bids totaling a near-record $2.1 billion for rights to drill for oil and gas in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska's North Slope. **********The highest bid for an individual tract was $227 million, made by a group consisting of Mobil, Tenneco and British Petroleum and its Sohio affiliate. The actual awarding of the areas is subject to Federal approval of development plans and environmental assessments. **********The tracts offered by the Interior Department cover 1.8 million acres in an area thought to hold one of the richest oil and gas reserves in the country. **********Revenues Could Reach $75 Billion **********The department estimates that the tracts in the Diapir field in Prudhoe Bay contain 2.36 billion barrels of oil that could produce revenues of $75 billion to $80 billion. **********J. Robinson West, Assistant Secratary of the Interior for Policy, Budget and Administration, said this evening: ''We are absolutely delighted. This vindicates our outer continental shelf program. The program is alive and well.'' **********The program speeds the pace of auctions for offshore areas and expands the areas to be made available for oil and gas exploration.  Environmental groups oppose the program because they feel it has been hastily developed and will intrude on ecologically fragile areas. **********As part of the program, bidders are permitted greater flexibility in financing lease purchases in order to attract more companies.  There is also greater flexibility in assessing the environmen- tal impact of exploration and drilling activities.  Interior Secretary James G. Watt had said that if the Beaufort Sea lease sale brought in bids of $1 billion, it would be a success. But industry executives said that Mr. Watt was being very cautious, even given the current slump in the oil business. **********A total of 252 bids were made during the sale, which was held in Anchorage. Bids were made on 125 tracts of the 338 offered. An Interior Department spokesman said the names of the successful bidders would be announced in about two weeks. **********The highest total of bids accepted for a single lease sale was $2.6 billion, for a sale in the Gulf of Mexico in 1980. The previous high in Alaskan waters was $488 million in 1979, also for a sale in the Beaufort Sea. **********Mr. West of the Interior Department said the Beaufort sale would produce $12 billion to $13 billion in royalties for the Treasury and $5 billion in taxes. **********In the auctions, sealed bids are submitted and the Government permits the highest bidder to submit plans for development of the field. If they are satisfactory, the bidder is allowed to begin exploratory drilling. Production requires further approval. **********Mr. West said today's sale was ''fundamental'' to the success of the department's offshore program, which will make a billion acres of the outer continental shelf available over a five-year period. ''It is important to recognize that Alaska is the energy future of this nation,'' he said. **********He also said the Beaufort Sea was particularly attractive to industry because of the proximity of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System terminal at Prudhoe Bay, where reserves of 10 billion barrels of oil have been found. **********The promise of potential oil strikes in this area is regarded as so high that it outweighs concerns over current depressed market conditions. ''A lot of companies have been saving their pennies for this one,'' said Charles D. Matthews, president of the association, whose members provide equipment and technical expertise for the offshore oil industry. Risks Are High, However **********But industry officials also noted the risks. ''These things are always the biggest crap game in town,'' said Frank Rogers, consultant for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry association. **********Mr. Rogers noted that earlier wells sunk closer to the shore in Prudhoe Bay had cost $75 million each. Wells in the new leasing area, he said, could cost $100 million. **********In addition, environmental restrictions will add to the costs. One restriction prohibits drilling during the migratory season of the bowhead whale, which is hunted by Alaskans for subsistence. **********Sarah Chasis, senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Beaufort Sea sale was not a good test of the leasing program because it was conducted under old rules governing financing and environmental assessments. Moreover, she said, the area was particularly attractive to industry, and the bids today did not reflect the appeal of the program as a whole. **********The council is one of the groups opposing Mr. Watt's program on the ground that it does not offer adequate protection to marine environments and coastal economies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/27/world/pope-in-surprise-move-calls-1983-a-holy-year.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE, IN SURPRISE MOVE, CALLS 1983 A HOLY YEAR", "print_headline": "POPE, IN SURPRISE MOVE, CALLS 1983 A HOLY YEAR", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II today declared the year 1983 a Holy Year in commemoration of the 1,950th anniversary of the Year of Redemption - the year Jesus died. **********Closing a four-day meeting of the Sacred College of Cardinals with an address in Latin, the Pope said: ''And now, it is near to my heart to make an announcement to you that will certainly be a cause of grand joy for you and the whole church.'' **********The Pope, recalling that in 1933 Pope Pius XI proclaimed the 1,900th anniversary as a special jubilee year, said there were strong reasons for celebrating 1983 in the same fashion.

MOVES TO KEEP NAMIBIA ON COURSE", "body_text": " **********The State Department renewed efforts over the weekend to prevent a dispute concerning the presence of Cuban soldiers in Angola from endangering negotiations, scheduled to start in New York on Tuesday, that are intended to end the conflict in South-West Africa. **********Robert Cabelly, an assistant to Chester A. Crocker, the Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, arrived in Luanda Saturday for previously unannounced talks with representatives of the South-West Africa People's Organization, the Soviet-armed insurgent group battling South Africa's disputed control of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. **********The discussions followed talks in Washington in June between Mr.  Crocker and South African officials. Western sources said the Luanda talks were designed to prevent a further souring of the atmosphere after public exchanges between South Africa and the insurgents over what is termed ''linkage'' by the United States and South Africa of the Namibian issue with a withdrawal of the 15,000 to 20,000 Cuban soldiers stationed in Angola. **********South Africa Demands Pullout **********In recent weeks, South Africa has asserted that a settlement of the guerrilla war must be accompanied by a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, which provides the insurgents with bases. **********The guerrillas, for their part, have said the New York negotiations are imperiled by South Africa's demands. But the guerrilla spokesman here, Hidipo Hamutenya, has said a delegation will attend. **********The Western sources indicated that the exchanges had made the negotiations more difficult and that part of Mr. Cabelly's mission was to give the guerrillas an assessment of the state of the talks beyond what was termed ''rhetoric'' by both sides. **********The inference was that the United States is trying to convince the protagonists that the recent public statements may be designed to satisfy political constituencies, not to block the negotiations. The United States is the principal member of the so-called Western contact group that has been trying for several years to mediate between the rebels and South Africa over the future of Namibia. Other members of the contact group are Britain, Canada, France and West Germany. 'Other Longstanding Problems' **********A serious complication has arisen from a proposal by the contact group concerning linkage that has reinforced the rebels' suspicion that South Africa plans to use the issue to stall. The proposal, presented to the rebels in June and made available to reporters in Luanda last week, implicitly links a Namibian settlement to ''other longstanding problems'' of the region, a clear reference to the Cubans who are supporting the Luanda Government and to the anti-Government rebels backed by South Africa in southern Angola. **********The carefully worded proposal, part of a longer document, is apparently designed to ease South African fears that the Cuban presence is a threat to Pretoria's own security. It is also apparently intended to fulfill Washington's wider desire to oppose Soviet influence. **********Mr. Cabelly's talks with rebel officials have not been publicly announced here, and Western diplomats have indicated that the United States would prefer a minimum of publicity about the present phase of the ''delicate'' discussions. **********A Western diplomatic source said the visit seemed designed to ''smooth ruffled feathers'' and to discredit a belief among the insurgents that they are being pressed to accept a settlement that will benefit only the South Africans. August Target Date for Accord **********The timetable for the new discussions envisages agreement on a settlement by Aug. 15. The Western strategy, the sources indicated, is to keep up momentum to prevent the guerrillas or South Africa from backing out. **********According to Western and African diplomatic sources, however, the United States insistence on linkage, however diplomatically phrased, has divided the contact group, with Canada, France and West Germany opposing the American position and Britain ambivalent about it. **********Washington also ties the establishment of diplomatic relations with Angola to a Cuban withdrawal, a linkage that Angola rejects, just as it rejects any formal tie between a Namibia settlement and the Cuban presence. **********At the same time, there is an awareness here of potential benefits from normalized relations with the United States. After years of hostility and suspicion about the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in the civil war that surrounded Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. There have also been fears that the United States, which is still regarded here as ''imperialist,'' wants to destabilize the Government in Luanda. **********According to recently published United States statistics, Angola earned $559 million in exports to the United States in 1980 and imported $111 million worth of United States goods, making America its largest trading partner that year. **********The oil industry, mainstay of Angola's broken economy, is dominated by United States oil companies, mainly Gulf and Texaco. U.S. College Stars to Tour **********The Angolan authorities recently gave a fresh signal of interest in normalizing diplomatic ties. In March, at what Angolan sources called ''the highest level,'' the Government gave approval for a United States all-star college basketball team to tour Angola. **********The organizers of the tour - Carmine Calzonetti of St. John's University and Richard Lapchick of the Phelps Stokes Fund in New York - visited Luanda last week to set up the tour by a squad from the Big East Conference. **********In an interview, the two organizers said the State Department had been supportive of the tour, which is due to start July 27, and they compared it to the Ping-Pong diplomacy that preceded the establishment of relations between the United States and China."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/business/advertising-new-shop-seeks-its-own-niche.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 489, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; New Shop Seeks Its Own Niche", "print_headline": "Advertising; New Shop Seeks Its Own Niche", "body_text": " **********TWO former leaders of the Needham, Harper & Steers creative department in New York, Lois Korey and Allen Kay, have opened their own advertising agency with $6 million in billings. **********The proprietors of Korey, Kay & Partners, which has offices in the Empire State Building, last Friday explained what will set their agency apart from the field. **********It is being positioned as a shop for entrepreneurs and an agency that, although a corporation for legal reasons, will conduct itself like a partnership.

Those sales are expected to yield $50 million in the next three months and more cash later, Saxon said. **********The company also said that it was applying to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a 15-day extension for filing its 1981 10-K report so it can obtain waivers of certain provisions from its lenders. **********Saxon has been profitable in the last few years but earnings have been falling. In the first nine months of 1981, Saxon reported revenues of $575 million, up 8.6 percent from the year before.

The index will be released Friday. **********The index is intended to forecast recoveries and recessions, and it is now being awaited by analysts looking for signs of a recovery.  The index declined in August, after rising the previous four months, shaking once again predictions from the Administration and private forecasters about the beginning of a recovery. **********Useful to Reagan **********A rise in the index is likely to be used by President Reagan to push his argument that his economic program is working and has reduced inflation, brought down interest rates and produced a rally in the stock market. But it is unclear whether the President will be able to offset the impact of the deep recession and the 10.1 percent unemployment rate in September. **********While the index of leading indicators rose for September, a companion index, known as the coincident index, will drop again, the officials said. That indicates that much of the economy continued to decline and leaves unclear whether the recovery has begun. The coincident index moves up or down simultaneously with the economy. **********Some economists in the Administration and many private economists now state that the recovery will not begin until the end of the year.  After a meeting with small-business leaders at the White House today, President Reagan said, ''there is some sunshine on the horizon,'' adding that his policies ''can make a drastic reduction in this recession.'' **********Separately, the Labor Department reported that wage settlements for the first nine months of this year were down significantly from the corresponding period of 1981, and were one percentage point below the inflation rate. **********For the year so far, the major collective bargaining agreements in the private sector provided average increases of 3.8 percent in the first year of the contract. Over the life of the contract, the average adjustment is 3.5 percent a year. **********The consumer price index for the first nine months rose 4.8 percent.  The small increases reflect the severe impact of the recession. But more significantly, economists said, the decline is necessary to make progress on inflation more permanent. Wages are a key factor in inflation and are often used to gauge a so-called underlying rate of inflation. **********The low rate reflects many settlements in the first half of the year, especially in the automobile industry, that gave no specified increase over the life of the contract. **********Wage settlements increased in the third quarter, but still averaged only 5.8 percent, down from 9.8 percent for all of last year.  The leading index declined nine-tenths of 1 percent in August, breaking a string of four consecutive increases which the Reagan Administration had been citing as a signal of an approaching recovery. In a news conference at the time the August figure was released, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the leading indicators would rise in September. The five-tenths figure fits in with some private forecasts. Two Areas of Growth **********A rise in the stock market, which has continued in October, and a jump in building permits are the two key positive factors in the index, which has 10 parts, officials said. But the improvements are expected to be offset somewhat by a decline in the average manufacturing workweek. **********While much of the information the index is based on is available, revisions are possible. That is why officials gave a range for the expected increase. **********The coincident index, measuring current economic activity, will fall because of higher unemployment and September's drop in industrial production, officials said. However, because this index is not as broad a measure as gross national product, a decline does not necessarily mean that the entire economy is slumping."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/10/business/advertising-81-magazine-revenues-passed-3-billion-mark.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'81 Magazine Revenues Passed $3 Billion Mark", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; '81 Magazine Revenues Passed $3 Billion Mark", "body_text": " **********According to the Magazine Publishers Association, magazines belonging to the Publishers Information Bureau had an estimated $3.2 billion in revenues last year. **********That was not only an increase of 12.2 percent over the previous year, but it was also the first time the members collectively exceeded the $3 billion mark.

Out on the glittering waters of the Nile, near the first cataract of the great river, only a few graceful feluccas - small, narrow vessels with lateen sails - moved silently through the water with a scattering of tourists aboard. Many more were moored to piers waiting for customers. Normally at this time of year, Aswan is full of tourists taking advantage of the warm weather, the flawless blue skies and the joys of an easygoing oasis filled with water and greenery and with the desert visible in the distance. **********But the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat on Oct. 6 has cut deeply into Egypt's tourist industry, a key f actor in the nation's precarious economy. And Aswan's troubles have been complicated in recent weeks by a series of minor earth tremo rs caused by irruptions in the Red Sea. 'There Is Nothing to Annoy' **********''I hope it will change much very soon,'' said Dr. Mohammed Sabry Zaki, a surgeon who is also Governor of Aswan Province. ''Everything is secure here. There is nothing to annoy a visitor. **********''Our income here is derived mainly from tourism, fishing and the sugar-cane industries,'' Dr. Zaki continued, in an interview in a large office in the center of the sleepy town. **********Fishing on a large scale is new to Aswan and is a result of the huge High Dam, which has controlled the flooding of the Nile and created an enormous lake called Lake Nasser. It is teeming with fish, primarily because very little fishing took place for several years after the completion of the dam. **********In 1980, 31,000 tons of fish were taken from the lake, and that, says Dr. Zaki, is too little. ''We are fishing only 15 percent of the total lake,'' he said, ''near the shores because it's still done by the primitive method - the felucca.'' The feluccas date back to the pharoahs. **********The center of the lake, which is well over 100 yards deep, is unexploited so far, Dr. Zaki said, but a Japanese company that specializes in deep-water fishing is working with local fishermen to reach into those depths and bring back the big ones. **********Have the tremors had an effect on the High Dam? Dr. Zaki was asked. ''Absolutely not,'' he said. ''The engineers inspected and were 100 percent sure that there was not the least damage.'' Meetings Held to Assure People **********After the first tremors struck, town meetings were held to assure people that the dam was not imperiled and to stave off fears of a calamity of almost unimaginable proportions if the great wall holding back the Nile was pierced. **********In several respects the construction of the High Dam rejuvenated Aswan, which in ancient times was a major marketplace for the exchange of products from Africa and the Mediterranean countries. **********New land was irrigated, flooding was controlled, and electricity was generated and fed to villages and towns nearby.  Tourism increased. People were attracted by the dam as well as the ancient and splendid temples of Philae dating from about 400 B.C. to the time of the Romans. **********After the peace treaty was signed between Egypt and Israel, Dr.  Zaki said, ''a lot of Israelis came and started to build a bridge of friendship.'' **********Hotels sprang up, and these days some of the more modest ones are doing better than the plush ones because youthful tourists, especially backpackers, have apparently not been deterred by the assassination to the extent that older travelers have been. Aga Khan Came for the Sands **********One visitor each winter to Aswan was the Aga Khan, who said that neck-high immersions in the dry, soft desert sands eased his rheumatism. When he died in 1959, his wife, the Begum, had a huge mausoleum built for him that stands imposingly in a desert setting just above their residence on the left bank of the Nile. **********Dr. Zaki envisions the construction of a spa in Aswan to help those with rheumatism enjoy the winter sun, the dryness and the unpolluted air. **********Near the Aga Khan's mausoleum, a gang of camel drivers stands waiting for customers to take a ride. A felucca with a few tourists docks near them, and the travelers are besieged and beseeched to ride the lumpy, bad-tempered beasts. **********One of the camels refuses to heed his master and lopes off toward a village nestled in sand dunes. Others shudder and show off their big, bad teeth. ''Fine ride, fine ride,'' a young driver says. **********The camel is ordered to get up from its crouch, and the ungainly creature rises with a snort on lumpy legs. It is the end of another slow day, and the young driver drags his beast homeward. **********''Tomorrow it may be better,'' he says in Arabic, echoing the hopes of others in Aswan who want the hordes of tourists to descend again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/20/world/around-the-world-botha-opens-talks-on-future-of-namibia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Botha Opens Talks On Future of Namibia", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Botha Opens Talks On Future of Namibia", "body_text": " **********West Africa, Nov. 19 (Reuters) - Prime Minister P.W.

Beggars tugged at the jackets of carousers prowling the red-light district off Fuzhou Street and sailors settled quarrels with knives in ''blood alley,'' under the indifferent gaze of hard-eyed young prostitutes. **********Muggings were commonplace. And the practice of bashing a tipsy sailor unconscious and sending him out involuntarily on another ship occurred often enough to spawn the expression ''to be shanghaied.'' **********But Asia's most notorious dens of vice closed down after the Communists took over Shanghai in 1949. Some 30,000 prostitutes were packed off for re-education and several hundred thousand opium addicts were detoxified. The old racecourse was razed to make way for a people's square and park, with only some bleachers left to evoke the thrill of a bet on the right horse. Communist Morality **********Communist morality has turned Shanghai into what may well be the world's most prudish major port of call.  ''If it was paradise, it was only for adventurers,'' said Gu Yiping, director of the Shanghai International Seamen's Club. ''For other people, it was hell. Our Shanghai people suffered a lot.'' **********Mr. Gu is responsible for entertaining sailors when they reach China's biggest port after a long voyage. His club, which was founded in 1950 as the seamen's home, works hard to provide wholesome fun. **********There are cheap tickets to local operas and acrobatic shows. There are volleyball and basketball games. There are tours of local factories and communes. There are trips to the zoo. The club even hosts get-acquainted parties where arriving sailors can get to know other arriving sailors. **********''Recently we sent some chefs to American ships to let them have a taste of Chinese food,'' said Mr. Gu, who explained that it was not easy to ferry Chinese cuisine across the harbor. The chefs, who were used to cooking with gas, were also upset to find the galleys equipped with electric stoves. **********''But we solved this difficulty,'' Mr. Gu reported. ''That was a specific demonstration of our friendship with American friends.'' The seamen's club, which is housed in the elegant old Russian Consulate on the waterfront where the fetid Suzhou Creek pours into the muddy Huangpu River, hardly lacks for business. Visited by 30,550 Seamen in 1981 **********Shanghai now handles 85 million tons of cargo a year. Last year 30,550 seamen from 85 countries sailed in on 1,135 foreign vessels, Mr. Gu said. His club tallied up 90,000 separate visits. It is now expanding by building another 12-story building next door. **********Sometimes the seamen get a bit out of hand. In a brawl last August about 20 sailors demolished the ground-floor bar at the respectable Shanghai Mansions Hotel just down the street from the seamen's club.  One Shanghai resident described it as a ''Hollywood-style punchup'' with policemen being flung through plate-glass windows when they arrived to restore order. **********Municipal authorities reacted by closing down the coffee shops and bars of Shanghai's three major hotels. Now a sailor can get a drink only in the paneled bar of the seamen's club, which opens at 5 P.M.  and closes at 11 P.M. The bar serves ice cream sodas and pineapple ice cream along with alcoholic beverages. **********The bartenders keep a solicitous watch over their charges. ''We are not capitalists,'' Mr. Gu said. ''We don't try to make them drink too much. We want to preserve their health. We want to love and protect them. The majority of seamen understand our rules.'' **********Mr. Gu, who was never a sailor himself, has no nostalgia for the bad old days. Today a seaman rarely gets robbed in Shanghai, he said, while ''it was a common scene before liberation.'' He added, ''I saw such rascals myself.'' The ban on prostitution extends even to casual fraternization between foreign seamen and local women. **********''After liberation the prostitutes were given medical treatment and were taught special skills to make a living, so they could find jobs and get married,'' Mr. Gu recalled. ''Of course most of these people were innocent. There was nothing for them in the countryside so they came to the city, but there was no work for them here.'' Ideological Journals in Library **********If seamen stay ashore too late to get back to their ships they can sleep in one of the club's 40 tidy beds for about $4.50 a night.  Before retiring they can visit the club's reading room, which is stocked with copies of Beijing Review, China Reconstructs, Social Sciences in China, and other publications of an ideologically uplifting nature. **********Mr. Gu led a visitor on a tour of the club's facilities, which include a table-tennis table, three billiard tables, a chess room and two small restaurants. The hall displays photographs from the recent 12th Communist Party congress. There is also a shop selling guitars, stuffed animals and local souvenirs, all at prices that Mr. Gu said were cheaper than in the hotels. **********''We don't intend to make money deliberately,'' he explained. ''We make just enough to support ourselves.'' The employees outnumbered the seamen in the club, but Mr. Gu explained that it would get busier later that evening. Outside the bedrooms a sailor in dungarees slouched in a chair staring glumly into space. In one restaurant a half-dozen other men lingered over their cups of coffee. **********Mr. Gu acknowledged a risk that the seamen might import their own Western decadence into Shanghai. He said that the club ran regular education sessions for its employees to inoculate them against bourgeois contamination. **********''We have an open door policy but we can resist their way of life,'' explained Chao Bufa, an earnest young staff member.  A large display case in the foyer, lit up like a jeweler's window, offered lost items for sailors to claim when they next reached port.  As proof of Shanghai's vaunted new incorruptibility, the display included, along with some umbrellas, sunglasses and dolls, a disposable all point pen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/23/world/trudeau-uses-tv-blitz-to-spell-out-nation-s-plight.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1982-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 770, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRUDEAU USES TV BLITZ TO SPELL OUT NATION'S PLIGHT", "print_headline": "TRUDEAU USES TV BLITZ TO SPELL OUT NATION'S PLIGHT", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau went on national television three times this week to dramatize the depth of his nation's economic problems and to urge Canadians to work together to solve them. **********''In our country, as we face winter, men and women - almost a million and a half of them - are without jobs,'' he said in the third 15-minute prime-time broadcast Thursday night. ''Many more live with the worry that your jobs will be next.'' **********Despite Mr. Trudeau's warning that Canada is ''in trouble,'' he offered no new policy directons, instead urging adherence to the Government's existing voluntary restraint program. In addition, he blamed the worldwide economic downturn for many of Canada's difficulties. **********Reactions to Broadcasts Differ **********Although public opinion polls have not yet been completed, the effect of the broadcasts seemed to be to leave supporters pleased, opponents angered and many others somewhat confused. **********Joe Clark, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, said he did not plan to ''dignify'' the speeches by exercising his legal right to reply on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation channel that broadcast the Prime Minister's speeches. Ed Broadbent, leader of the New Democratic Party, called Mr. Trudeau's telvision blitz ''a farce in three parts.'' **********In the cozy, mainly working-class bar of the slightly seedy Spadina Hotel here, an argument raged among customers about whether they should even to listen to the first speech. ''Do you like him that much?'' the bartender asked. ''I'm not interested in what he's got to say.'' **********When the speech ended, however, a man at the bar said, ''A terrific speech - he sounded like Churchill.'' Trudeau's Popularity Sagging **********The speeches came at a time when Canadian unemployment exceeds 12 percent, inflation is nearly double levels in the United States and industrial production is flagging. They also came when Mr. Trudeau's popularity is sagging, with the most recent Gallup Poll showing only 28 percent of Canadians approving his performance and 61 percent disapproving. **********The Prime Minister's talks appeared designed to instill confidence among Canadians, in the manner of President Roosevelt's fireside chats during the Depression. Although aides confirmed this was the purpose, they sought to minimize this aspect of the talks for fear it would overstate the gravity of Canada's economic difficulties, spurring unnecessary anxiety. **********Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. Trudeau's remarks appeared directed more toward Canadian inflation, which has recently shown signs of abating, than toward unemployment, which is naggingly persistent.  This week the Government announced that Canada's consumer price index dropped to a 10.4 percent annual rate in September, the lowest level in 26 months. That marked the fourth month in a row that the inflation rate declined. Example Set by Government **********Essentially, the Prime Minister argued that cutting the inflation rate would lower costs, allowing companies to make productivity improvements, which would spur growth and eventually jobs. Mr.  Trudeau asked the public to cooperate by voluntarily emulating the Government's own mandatory plan to allow Government workers only 6 percent wage increases this year and 5 percent raises next year. **********As such, Mr. Trudeau ruled out wage and price controls as unduly coercive. ''Controls would declare, with the force of law, that Canadians cannot trust Canadians,'' he said in his second talk. He also rejected large cuts in the national deficit, arguing that spending cuts would be inhumane at a time of soaring unemployment. **********Large-scale budget reductions, he said, ''brutally wring inflation out of the system and in the process impoverish many more Canadians.'' He said this was the course of action that caused ''the Great Depression and 10 lost years.'' CBC Is Criticized **********In addition to the outcry of opposition politicians, the CBC was hit by sharp criticism for broadcasting the talks on three consecutive nights. The network's president, Pierre Juneau, who was appointed by the Prime Minister, called a news conference to defend the network. **********Moreover, a group of about 50 CBC employees signed a petition protesting the network's decision to broadcast the speeches without accompanying commentary by its own reporters, and CBC technicians protested the decision to employ a Toronto advertising agency to tape the shows, rather than CBC employees. **********For some CBC employees, however, the whole affair ended with a laugh. On the CBC's public affairs program ''The Journal'' on Thursday night, a program that is usually devoted to straight news and analysis, an actor poked fun at the Prime Minister's fireside style in a moderately bawdy routine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/19/world/buenos-aires-says-falklands-truce-is-still-uncertain.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1982-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1078, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUENOS AIRES SAYS FALKLANDS' TRUCE IS STILL UNCERTAIN", "print_headline": "BUENOS AIRES SAYS FALKLANDS' TRUCE IS STILL UNCERTAIN", "body_text": " **********Argentina said today that a ''total cessation of hostilities'' with the British would be reached only when Britain withdrew its forces from the Falkland Islands, lifted its blockade of the Argentine coast and ended its economic sanctions. **********Responding to British demands for a formal pledge to end all hostilities, the Government said in a note to the United Nations that all Argentine forces were currently observing a cease-fire. But it said the truce would be ''precarious'' as long as Britain maintained its occupation of the islands, its blockade and its sanctions. **********However, in what Foreign Ministry officials here described as an indication that Argentina would foresake military operations for the immediate future, the note asked for the renewal of United Nations negotiations ''for a definitive solution to the dispute.'' **********No Response From Britain **********There was no immediate response to the Argentine stand by Britain, which had sought through its demands to insure that there would be no further military action by Argentina's planes or ships after the surrender of its ground forces in the Falklands on Monday. **********The British confirmed today that they and the Argentines had reached agreement on the return home of most of the more than 10,000 Argentine prisoners being held in the Falklands. The Argentine Foreign Ministry announced Thursday night that an agreement had been reached and that the operation would begin today, but Britain initially said only that it would consider an Argentine proposal to that effect. Foreign Minister Nicanor Costa Mendez said 4,500 Argentine soldiers captured on the Falklands were en route today to Argentine ports aboard the British ship Canberra, a luxury liner that had been converted by the British task force into a troop ship. The British ferry Norland was said to be carrying 1,000 others. Interim President Sworn In **********British officials still insist that about a thousand selected prisoners, principally officers and commanders, will be held rather than returned with the rest because Argentina has not promised to cease hostilities over the Falklands, which its troops seized April 2. **********Today, the Interior Minister, Maj. Gen. Alfredo St. Jean, was sworn in as interim President of Argentina, replacing Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, who resigned Thursday as a result of the defeat in the war for the Falklands. General Galtieri, as army chief, had also been a member of the ruling three-man junta, and he was replaced in that capacity by Maj. Gen. Cristino Nicolaides. **********The Government crisis, however, remained unsolved; the military was still divided on a permanent President.  The Argentine note was addressed to the President of the United Nations Security Council, and Gustavo Figueroa, the third-ranking official in the Argentine Foreign Ministry, said in an interview that, ''in general terms, this is our answer'' to Britain. He said no other replies were planned. **********Senior Government officials stressed that the note was meant to be conciliatory in calling for the United Nations role and acknowledging that hostilities are in fact over for the time being. The counter demands, one official said, were ''to keep a little door open so that we can maintain some small pressure on the British to give us the islands back.'' **********He said it was impossible for Argentina ''to give in and completely say that all is lost, but in reality there is nothing we can do militarily for the time being.'' He said that if the British ''read bewteen the lines, they will know what we mean.'' **********A Western diplomat close to the issue said there appeared to be little chance that Britain would find the position taken in the Argentine note acceptable. He called the note ''a dodge'' and said the British had no intention of withdrawing their forces from the Falklands. **********In its note today, Argentina called on the Security Council ''to pursue its efforts to obtain from the United Kingdom full compliance'' with Security Council Resolutions 502 and 505. **********The first calls for an end to hostilities and for negotiations, plus the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the islands. The second, calls for Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to help negotiate a solution. Neither resolution, however, says anything about the small British force that was in the Falklands before the Argentines seized the islands, and Britain presumably could argue that neither resolution prohibits the stationing of British forces there. **********Foreign Ministry officials said that they favored a resumption of the Secretary General's mission because, they said, he seemed fair and well versed in the issues. They said Argentina would continue to seek soverignty over the Falklands. **********Senior Argentine military officers said that it was the resignation of President Galtieri that opened the way for the note to the United Nations. General Galtieri, they said, wanted to continue the war but had been opposed by the overwhelming majority of army generals who were involved in the meetings that have been held since Monday to formulate an Argentine response to Britain. **********The note was finally approved this morning by the ruling three-man junta, including General Nicolaides, the officials said. They said that General Galtieri also registered his approval. **********General Nicolaides was formally inducted into the junta in a somber ceremony tonight. This morning he was formally installed as Commander in Chief of the army. Troops En Route to Argentina **********The note to the United Nations said: ''There exists in fact, given the present circumstances, a cessation of hostilities, which Argentina observes, but this cessation will be precarious so long as the British attitude as evidenced by the military occupation, the blockade and the economic aggression subsists. **********''The total cessation of hostilities will be reached only at the moment the United Kingdom agrees to lift the naval and aerial blockade and the economic sanctions referred to before and when it withdraws its military occupation forces from the islands, the naval task force and the nuclear submarines that it has deployed in the waters of the region.'' **********The Almirante Irizar, a converted icebreaker, arrived this morning with about 400 wounded aboard at the southern Argentine port of Comodoro Rivadavia, 1,100 miles south of here. The wounded were taken in ambulances through blocked-off streets to local hospitals.

She speaks so softly that it is often difficult to hear her, but her message rings clear. **********''We demand a little blood,'' she said when asked about real estate deals the pension fund is making in the United States. Along with other institutional investors, the Coal Board fund is one of the forces that have altered the development business in this country over the last few years. **********Developers of office buildings, shopping centers or industrial properties were once independent operators who took all the risks and rewards of building, and they used borrowed money to do it. Not any more. With the demise of the fixed-rate mortgage, lenders insisted on becoming partners with developers. Now lenders want a share of the equity, a larger piece of the profits and ''a little blood,'' as Miss Luscombe says. **********Believing that property investments in the United States offer a better return than real estate in Britain or other European countries, the Coal Board started its drive here in 1979 when it acquired the Continental Illinois Real Estate Investment Trust. The Coal Board formed a subsidiary called Pan American Properties, with headquarters in Manhattan, for its American real estate. Miss Luscombe, who studied at Oxford as a chartered surveyor, became president of Pan American Properties in January 1981. She worked with a major British developer and the Chase Bank in London before joining the Coal Board. **********Pan American's best-known property is Washington's Watergate complex, where the pension fund has a 50 percent interest. But Pan American has larger investments in various shopping centers. **********Although it has acquired nothing in New York City, Pan American now owns, partly or entirely, 39 properties, including office buildings, apartments and industrial buildings, from California to Florida and New Jersey. **********In New Jersey, Pan American has office buildings of about 150,000 square feet in Parsippany, Piscataway and Montvale as well as a 250,000-square-foot industrial building in Moonachie. **********The Coal Board's real estate holdings in England are valued at about $2 billion, Miss Luscombe said, but in England the board has not bought any properties for about three years. Instead the board is developing its own properties and has become one of the country's leading developers. **********The Coal Board has no plans to become a developer in the United States, though. ''It's important you don't run before you can walk,'' Miss Luscombe said. ''It took me about a year just to learn the language here. When someone said a property was a 'good deal for a European,' they meant it was a rip-off.'' **********In addition to making higher profits in the United States, she said, the Coal Board decided it wanted to expand in this country to diversify its portfolio. **********Pan American now limits the size of its investment in any property to $30 million or $40 million. Miss Luscombe does not favor ''glamour cities,'' such as Houston, for investments. **********''We've always said we will not invest in Houston,'' she said.  ''Literally, you can throw - for lack of a better word - a property up in 18 months in Houston. There's a tremendous demand, but supply always goes out to meet it.'' Prime space in Houston, she continued, ''rents for about $23 a square foot, which is not all that different from rents in Cleveland.'' **********Instead Pan American prefers properties in what Miss Luscombe calls ''second-tier cities.'' Some examples are Tampa, Fla.; Winston-Salem, N.C., or Des Moines. She likes state capitals, which ''always have a good underpinning of Federal employees,'' and any city with a university. ''There's often a synergy from unversities because of research,'' she said. **********Miss Luscombe's analysis of the Manhattan office market is a model of caution. She said there ''could be some softening, not so much from new construction but from nonexpansion.'' As leases expire, businesses face a doubling or tripling of rents, she said, ''which may cause a lot of companies to decentralize'' and move part of their operations out of the city. **********The high rents in New York, she predicted, will also force businesses to reduce their space requirements. ''I think you'll see a lot of pushing the desks together,'' she said. ''You see it in London. Here you walk into offices now, and there are acres of room between desks.'' **********In London, she said, top office space rents for about $100 a square foot, although the method of calculation is different from most leases in New York City. Space in London is usually rented on a net lease, meaning the tenant pays separately for all utilities, taxes and maintenance. **********Miss Luscombe noted the growing power of financiers in real estate transactions. ''Developers may in the end become glorified project managers,'' she said. ''There will be a lot more merchant developers - developers who build and sell out. The emphasis has changed. The financiers have the strong hand now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/31/business/steel-output-slips-further.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steel Output Slips Further", "print_headline": "Steel Output Slips Further", "body_text": " **********The depressed steel industry slipped further last week as United States mill operations in the week ended last Saturday sank to 39.9 percent of capacity from the previous week's 40.5 percent, which had been the year's low, according to an industry trade group. **********Total output fell to 1.178 million tons last week, the American Iron and Steel Institute said. **********The capacity utilization figure was the lowest since 1938, when the yearly average was 39.6 percent and no weekly figures were kept. the group said.

Daniel Cooney, executive vice president and portfolio manager of the fund, said that shares meeting these tests have helped the $125 million fund post superior returns over the past five years. **********Net asset value is up 178.7 percent since September 1977. After an 8 1/2 percent initial sales charge, that gain adjusts to 163.5 percent. The latter represents a gain of 21 percent annually and compares with an annual percentage rise of 10 for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Mr. Cooney notes that growth is easier for companies starting at a lower base. That is, a $10 million concern can more readily reach $20 million in sales than a $150 million company can hit $300 million. **********He is quite interested in companies with sales of $10 million - less so in $150 million companies. He weighs selling companies that reach that level, as their greatest growth may be over. **********In explaining his bias against even larger old-line companies, he notes that with age comes bureaucracy - companies move more slowly.  But older companies create opportunities for smaller companies, which often enter niches that the older companies have overlooked. **********Mr. Cooney is especially excited about prospects for his kind of company today because there is much venture capital around and because new niches are being created at a rapid rate in a changing economy. **********Still, he warns that shares of small companies are quite volatile.  Thus, his fund is highly diversified and gaited to the long term. He often holds shares for many years, until a company starts to mature. **********The fund is in many different niches, from retail trade to miscellaneous manufacturing. As might be expected in the computer age, 40 percent of assets are in technology companies. **********Since he seeks high growth - and the higher the growth rate the higher the multiple a company bears - he pays higher price/earnings multiples than those investing in slow growth companies. P/E's of up 15 or more are not uncommon in his portfolio. **********He adds, though, that most holdings were bought at substantially lower P/E's - before the market took off in August. Here are the fund's largest holdings, which he would still buy at today's prices. **********Verbatim, the fund's largest position, is a maker of floppy disks - flexible recording disks. He likes Verbatim because it supplies a product that is going into small-business, personal, and word processing computers - all of which are growing at rates in excess of 25 percent a year. Verbatim earned $1.80 a share in the June 1982 fiscal year. With earnings up 70 percent in the most recent quarter, street sources say that Verbatim may earn $2.50 a share in the fiscal year ending June 1983. The current P/E relative to that estimate is about 14. **********Pic-N-Sav is a California and Arizona specialist in discontinued merchandise. The chain buys close-outs, and in some cases at a fraction of cost, for resale at about 50 percent of the normal retail price. The stores offer clothing, tools, sporting goods and canned goods. The company earned $1.21 a share last year. Street sources expect $1.50 a share in the current year for a P/E of 15 times. **********The Tandon Corporation makes small floppy disk drives and small hard disk drives. Mr. Cooney likes the company for the same reasons as Verbatim. Tandon earned 70 to 75 cents a share in the September year. The company may earn $1.25 a share this fiscal year for a P/E of 18. **********Lawson Products distributes industrial maintenance items such as nuts, bolts and drills. Mr. Cooney expects the company to carve out an ever larger share of this highly fragmented market. Net profit margins after taxes are up to 11 percent. (A 10 percent or better net after tax is regarded as exceptional.) Lawson earned $2.02 a share in 1981 and is expected to earn $2.25 a share in this recession year. In 1983, earnings should reach $2.75 a share, a P/E ratio of 11. **********Food Town Stores is a regional supermarket chain in a strong growth area of North Carolina and is not to be confused with the Food Town chain in the Northeast. It enjoyed an unusually high return on equity - 25 percent - in the calendar year 1981. The average food chain has a return on equity half as large. Food Town earned $2.24 a share in 1981, should do $2.45 a share in 1982 and $3.20 a share in 1983 for a 15 P/E. **********Electro-Biology Inc. offers medical equipment to aid the knitting of slow healing leg and arm bones. The company earned 31 cents a share in the calendar year 1981, should earn 95 cents a share in 1982 and about $2.15 a share in 1983 for a P/E of 17. **********Molex Inc. make terminals and connectors for the electrical and electronics industries. This company is ''highly efficient,'' Mr.  Cooney says, because its after-tax margins exceed 10 percent.

But in the future, the tests themselves might be ''smart'' because they will be taken on computer terminals instead of on paper. **********Such computerized examinations will be able to do things the paper versions cannot. Instead of asking the same questions to each person, the computer will be able to decide on questions as the test is in progress, tailoring the test to each individual. Computerized tests can score themselves instantly. **********At the same time, however, the advent of computerized testing is likely to fuel new controversies about the proper use of such tests as qualification for school or employment. **********The armed forces are working toward converting to computers, starting in 1984, the test that is used to qualify and classify recruits. It will be one of the first uses of a technique known as adaptive testing. **********In such a test, the computer chooses each question from a large bank of items based on how well the person has done on the previous questions, thereby automatically adjusting the difficulty of the test to match the person's ability. The Educational Testing Service, although it is far from switching the Scholastic Aptitude Test to computers, is doing research on computerized tests in general and adaptive ones in particular. **********Adaptive testing promises to make tests shorter and more accurate than existing tests, say proponents like David J. Weiss, a psychology professor at the University of Minnesota. Existing tests always contain a lot of questions that are wasted because they are too hard or too easy. Words such as cat and dog are too simple to distinguish a good 10th-grade speller from a poor one. **********For that reason, test questions are usually geared for a particular level of ability. But that in turn leads to another shortcoming. A 10th-grade spelling test is good at distinguishing between the abilities of average 10th graders but not between two students who are well above average or well below average, Professor Weiss said. **********Adaptive testing can eliminate needless questions and yet measure all ability levels accurately, at least in theory. ''Our goal is to reduce the length of the exam by half,'' said James R. McBride, head of the computer adaptive testing project at the Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego. He said adaptive testing, by varying the questions to each recruit, would also cut down on the cheating. **********Adaptive testing, however, has its drawbacks. It takes large amounts of data to calibrate the difficulty level of each question and complex theory to decide which question should follow which.  Perhaps even more serious is the prospect that someone might challenge such a test in court, contending that it discriminates by not asking everyone the same questions. **********Political and legal concerns over such questions helped scuttle a plan by the Federal Office of Personnel Management to replace the Civil Service examination with an adaptive test and they might also impede the spread of such tests to corporations. **********''If you're not being challenged in court now, why stir up a hornet's nest?'' one Government expert said, summarizing the reaction he received from some companies. **********Even without adaptive testing, computerized tests can do other things that paper tests cannot. They can offer immediate results, which might be important in clinical psychological tests. The computers can test memory, by having something appear on the screen, then disappear, something that is difficult to test with paper. **********The Air Force is experimenting with using video game-like tests to measure hand-eye coordination and flying aptitude. Computers using artificial intelligence will increasingly do some of the diagnosis of psychological or medical tests, a task previously reserved for professionals. **********Several small companies are already coming to market with computerized testing systems. Psych Systems of Baltimore and Compu-Psych Inc. of Liberty, Mo., sell computerized tests systems mainly for use by clinical psychologists. **********The Assessment Systems Corporation of St. Paul is working with Psych Systems to develop an adaptive test for bank clerical employees. Continental Illinois National Bank is considering using the test. Delta Employment Systems of Dallas offers a computer interviewer. Applicants ''are more likely to tell the computer the truth than they are an interviewer,'' said B.J. Whitworth, senior vice president for administrative services for a division of the Hughes Tool Company, which uses the system. **********But test data can be abused. Unlike paper tests, for instance, computerized exams can also keep track of how long it takes to answer each question. Some vendors of new equipment assert that this could be a valuable piece of information - a delay in answering a question could indicate a job applicant might be trying to hide something. **********''The types of things an interviewer perceives from body language, we're able to quantify,'' said Walter J. Rychlewski 3d, president of Compu-Psych. Similarly the Delta computer interviewer alerts the employer to questions that took unusually long to answer. **********''That's a more absurd premise than the lie detector premise,'' said Norma Rollins, head of the privacy project of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which objects to lie detector tests because they can be inaccurate yet are accorded great weight. Computerization, she said, might mean that objectionable tests that should not be used as a basis for employment decisions would become more widespread and might also lend such tests ''an aura of objectivity.'' **********Proponents acknowledge such dangers, but predict that computerization is inevitable ''By the year 2000, paper and pencil tests should not exist anymore, anywhere,'' Professor Weiss predicted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/24/world/british-given-unexpected-bonus-argentines-inactivity-ground-military-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1982-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Analysis", "print_headline": "BRITISH GIVEN AN UNEXPECTED BONUS BY ARGENTINES' INACTIVITY ON GROUND; Military Analysis", "body_text": " **********For the past 48 hours British forces, according to reports from the South Atlantic, have methodically strengthened and expanded their beachhead in the Port San Carlos area while Argentine ground forces, according to British officials, have done little to oppose them. **********The result is that the British tactical position has improved dramatically. According to British estimates, they now have enough troops and weapons ashore to hold their beachhead against the maximum attack that Argentine forces could launch. **********Military analysts, here and at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels, are increasingly convinced that the next British landing will be closer to Stanley, possibly at Rookery Bay some miles to the east of the islands' capital. **********The Argentine command's problems are consequently complex, according to these analysts. A major Argentine attack now on the beachhead would leave beaches at Rookery Bay and elsewhere relatively unprotected. **********The opinion among qualified military and political sources in London is that the British Government, emboldened by the reported success of the landing and the retention of the initiative, now intends to move rapidly to engage the remaining Argentine forces on the islands. Radar on High Ground **********One of the reasons for British confidence is that during the two days of Argentine inactivity on the ground, the British commandos and paratroops in the beachhead have been able to establish their radar on the high ground on both banks of the San Carlos River. This will help the Rapier surface-to-air missile batteries within the British zone to react swiftly to any air attack on the troops. Shortage of Supplies **********British naval sources contend that one of the unrecognized dividends of the British blockade of the islands is that the Argentine forces cannot hope for adequate supply and reinforcement.  The sources conceded that one or two transports might get through to drop supplies to the forces at Stanley, but this would not make up for the ammunition, food and fuel already consumed. **********If, as some neutral observers argue, the next two days are critical, the British believe they are well prepared to meet any belated counterattack. According to reports from the area, the airfield at Port San Carlos has been improved and lengthened to take not only Harriers but helicopters carrying supplies and, if necessary, reinforcements. These shipments will relieve the navy of the risky job of moving close inshore to deliver supplies in landing craft and free those craft for use elsewhere. **********Any British advance from the beachhead, or Argentine counterattack from Stanley, would have to overcome the forbidding terrain. The ground between the two forces is covered with peat bogs cut by streams and lakes. There are no roads that far west on East Falkland Island and any counterattack would have to be delivered largely by marching infantry, under the fire of the 105-millimeter guns and 81-millimeter mortars now deployed in the beachhead. **********The ability of the Argentine personnel carriers to cross the terrain is questionable, according to British military sources.  Neutral intelligence sources say that the garrison at Stanley is equipped with personnel carriers, but there is no verifiable information on the number of these vehicles. Argentine Personnel Carriers **********One type is the Swiss-built Mowag Roland, which carries three or four infantrymen and is armed with 7.62-millimeter machine gun.  Another is the LARC, a version of the American DUKW, a World War II amphibious vehicle with large variable pressure tires. The third is the American LVTP-7, a tracked amphibious vehicle that can carry up to 25 infantrymen and a 20-millimeter cannon and machine gun. **********The British are confident that their Scorpion light tanks, armed with 76-millimeter guns, and the Scimitar armored cars, which have 30-millimeter guns, will be able to handle any armored personnel carriers the Argentines can get through the peat bogs for an attack. **********Both the British armored vehicles might have been designed for exactly this type of terrain. According to one authoritative source they exert less ground pressure than a marching infantryman and can cross bogs impassable to foot soldiers. **********Military analysts here believe that the Argentine force, if it attacks the beachhead, needs support by helicopters and Pucara light attack aircraft. **********At the start of the fighting Argentina had 42 Pucaras. Some have been lost to British Harriers and an undetermined number have been destroyed by bombing. Harriers, hitting the Goose Green airstrip today, reported a number of the light aircraft lying wrecked near the strip. **********Royal Air Force officers argue that no Argentine counterattack has what one called ''the faintest chance of success'' unless it is adequately supported by Mirage and Dagger jet fighters and A-4 attack planes flown from the mainland. Even if these aircraft are deployed, he said, they would have to contend with the winter storm now closing over the Falklands."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/business/anderson-2000-inc-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANDERSON 2000 INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "ANDERSON 2000 INC reports earnings for Yr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/business/jb-s-restaurants-inc-reports-earnings-for-16-wks-to-july-4.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JB'S RESTAURANTS INC reports earnings for 16 wks to July 4", "print_headline": "JB'S RESTAURANTS INC reports earnings for 16 wks to July 4", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/19/business/l-no-headline-110340.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: **********In ''Abandoning Its Original Mandate'' (Dec.5), William Winpisinger wrote that ''the advent of Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan and company has opened the department to severe charges of failing to serve the constituency its charter requires.'' Mr. Winpisinger starts off by declaring that labor leaders feel cut off and alienated from the Labor Department. While I admit that the relationship hasn't been as close as I would like, neither has it been as nonexistent as Mr. Winpisinger makes it out to be. Every day there are meetings between representatives of organized labor and officials at the department. **********I myself have met with leaders of the United Auto Workers, the American Federation of Government Employees, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.  Building Trades Department, the United Paperworkers, the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, the Teamsters and the International Longshoremen's Association, to name only a few. **********Mr. Winpisinger also criticized the selection of Donald Dotson to fill a vacancy on the National Labor Relations Board. According to Mr. Winpisinger, Mr. Dotson, ''served in civilian life as a labor relations lawyer for a string of industrial companies.'' The N.L.R.B. is supposed to be an impartial body. What counts is the ability to render fair and impartial decisions. Is a former union employee any less likely to be impartial than a management employee?  Is fairness the exclusive property of organized labor? **********Mr. Winpisinger saved his harshest criticisms for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. I know that OSHA will write a detailed response to the charges against it, so rather than beat a dead horse, I'll just say that our intent in OSHA is to provide workers with safe and healthy workplaces without crushing employers under a mountain of costs they can't bear. **********What disturbs me most about Mr. Winpisinger's commentary is what he chose not to say.  He didn't say that the Labor Department has increased its efforts to apprehend those who would steal from the Government, from businesses and from American workers. Our efforts have resulted in nearly 200 indictments and 150 convictions for fraud and other crimes. We've also won more than 130 indictments and nearly 100 convictions against racketeers. **********Mr. Winpisinger also didn't talk about legislation which saved the Black Lung Trust Fund. Thanks to this legislation, the fund's $1.5 billion debt will be repaid. **********Mr. Winpisinger conveniently overlooked many other accomplishments, including: the Jobs Training Partnership Act; a 45 percent reduction in the department's FY 1982 budget; elimination of audit backlogs; savings of over $2 billion in regulatory costs; increased emphasis on worker health and safety; hearing conservation programs; rule changes that will allow nearly half a million retirees to work up to 40 hours a month without losing pension benefits.

Since November, the Saudis have cut production by 3 million to 3.5 million barrels daily. **********Output is now at the lowest level in three years. The cuts are seen as a direct response to the current worldwide oversupply of crude oil, variously estimated at between two million and three million barrels a day. Also in reaction to the oversupply, the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) yesterday cut the selling price of oil produced on the Alaskan North Slope by up to $2.27 a 42-gallon barrel, and Exxon confirmed that it had reduced the wholesale price of heating oil, kerosene and diesel fuel by 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon. **********Flurry of Activity **********A sharp decline in the price of oil on the spot, or noncontract, market over the last several weeks has apparently touched off the flurry of activity. Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a trade publication, said that spot prices of oil are now running $3.50 to $5 a barrel below official selling prices. A shipment of Arab light oil, the grade of crude that OPEC uses as a reference for all its pricing decisions, for instance, changed hands yesterday for $29 a barrel, $5 below the list price. **********The response of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was to intensify calls for an emergency meeting to halt the sharp drop in prices. Yesterday, Iraq's oil minister, Tayeh Abdul Karim, told the Iraqi Government press agency that a special OPEC meeting should be held this month to stop the spiraling price decline. **********OPEC's chairman, Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, who has the authority to call a special meeting, recently said that a time and place for a special session were being considered. The next regularly scheduled OPEC meeting is set for Quito, Ecuador, on May 20. **********Oil analysts said the two reasons for today's persistent oil glut are a sharp drop in demand and Saudi Arabia's continuing high level of output. **********Petroleum demand in the non-Communist world has dropped 10 percent over the last two years and is continuing to decline this year.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has maintained a production level that other OPEC members believe is far too high. Analysts in the Arabian Gulf, for instance, calculate that Saudi production would have to fall to 5 million or 5.5 million barrels a day to end the glut. **********The country's production ceiling, however, is 8.5 million barrels, and policy makers have historically preferred to keep output fairly close to the targeted level. In addition, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, says Saudi Arabia needs to produce 6.2 million barrels a day to meet its immense revenue requirments.  However, Sheik Yamani has repeatedly said Saudi production would be allowed to fall to balance the market. 'Less Incentive' **********''The action is the direct result of current market circumstances,'' Gary Ross, research director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said. ''There is just less incentive to lift Saudi crude. **********Sohio said it had lowered the price on Alaskan North Slope oil sold on the Gulf Coast by $2.27 a barrel, to $29.75, and by $1.27 a barrel, to $29.50, for oil sold on the West Coast. The moves affect about 300,000 barrels of daily sales. Exxon and Atlantic Richfield, the other producers of oil on the North Slope, do not disclose prices. **********''This is, in fact, what we feel we have to price our Alaskan North Slope production at to be competitive,'' a Sohio spokesman said.  ''The move was made in response to pressures in the marketplace.'' **********Analysts say a domestic market free of price controls for more than a year has been leading the way in the current push to lower prices.  The Sohio action trails two rounds of reductions in the prices that United States oil companies were willing to pay for domestic crude.  The result, in part, has been drops in the price of heating oil and gasoline of as much as five cents gallon in 1982. **********The Exxon Company USA, the principal domestic subsidiary of the Exxon Corporation, for instance, this week cut its wholesale prices for heating oil, kerosene and diesel fuel by from 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon at various East Coast and Gulf Coast terminals. **********The Saudi moves, as usual, were not announced. The four principal companies that produce Saudi oil - the Aramco partners of Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and Socal - are under strict instructions from the Riyadh Government not to comment on Saudi production. However, they observe that it varies daily because of technical considerations in the oilfields and the schedule of tanker arrivals. Thus, average production for any particular month is not known until the month has ended. **********James Tanner, editor of Petroleum Information International, a trade publication, said that output was believed to have averaged 7.2 million to 7.3 million barrels a day over the last week, sinking as low as 6.8 million barrels on one day. **********How long the current glut, with its downward tug on prices, will last is the question that consumers, oil companies and independent analysts are asking. Oil companies have significantly drawn down their inventories, suggesting resurgence in demand might develop.  Currently, worldwide stocks are approximately 100 million barrels a day greater than normal, compared with 500 million barrels a year ago. **********However, evidence is mounting that, amid high interest rates and ample supplies, companies no longer feel compelled to maintain such high inventory levels. It costs about 75 cents a month to carry a barrel of oil. **********One oil company planner suggested that the amount of oil that companies feel they need to keep on hand may have dropped irreversibly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/26/business/employment-agencies-suffer-as-jobs-they-can-offer-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Dylan Landis", "pub_date": "1982-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES SUFFER AS JOBS THEY CAN OFFER DROP", "print_headline": "EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES SUFFER AS JOBS THEY CAN OFFER DROP", "body_text": " **********Benson Employment Inc., a small New York agency, is having no problem attracting job seekers, unemployment being what it is.  Its problem, with fewer jobs than ever to offer its applicants, is that its commissions are tumbling, its profits are sliding and, in January, it had to let go one of its counselors - one-quarter of its entire staff. **********Similarly, Mahoney Placement Services Inc., one of the largest employment companies in the country, has 25 percent fewer openings to offer its applicants than a year ago, and it, too, is paring its own staff, through attrition. ''Companies aren't hungry to make that hire,'' said Thomas Murphy, Mahoney's vice president. **********Layoffs and Hiring Freezes **********Employment agencies stand to make money every time the corporate revolving door swings, but this year, they say, it is swinging less often because of layoffs and hiring freezes. **********The white-collar unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent of the work force in May and 5 percent in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the highest levels since the record 5.3 percent figure reached in May 1975, the peak of that recession. **********The result has been the retrenching, sometimes the wobbling, and occasionally the collapse of some of the 10,000 to 15,000 employment agencies across the country. Licensed by Cities **********These agencies are closely held; fewer than half join a professional association, and because they are licensed by cities, a look at the industry becomes more of a mosaic than a panorama. But in New York City, the hub of the business, the Department of Consumer Affairs says there are now only 644 licensed employment agencies - down 18.2 percent from the 787 that were licensed in 1980. ''It's definitely off,'' said Karen Black, a department spokesman. **********Another grim sign for the agencies is that help wanted sections in the nation's newspapers are shrinking. The index of these ads, issued by the Conference Board, a business research group, stood at 87 in May, down from 118 in May 1981; its norm, based on a 1965 average, is 100. **********Some agencies also report that more companies are going the do-ityourself route on hiring, particularly for clerical jobs. Some place their own classified ads; a few award bonuses to employees who make successful referrals. **********As a result, many of the agencies are in trouble. ''A lot of little agencies - one- to four-desk operations - have closed,'' said Ira Gottlieb, president of the National Association of Personnel Consultants' New York office. ''About a dozen of our 189 member agencies have closed since January.'' **********The reverse side of the employment business is the agency that deals in temporary jobs. Typically, these agencies thrive on the same conditions that are throttling their permanent-employment counterparts. Hiring a ''temp'' saves an employer a long-term salary commitment and fringe benefits. It is essentially a patch job and, as such, one more lost commission to the permanent-job agency. **********Most of the agencies handling permanent jobs are cautious about releasing information, partly because they are private and partly because the industry is still feeling the effects of investigations that have, in the past, turned up racial discrimination and false advertising. ''People think all employment agencies place phony advertisements,'' complained one agency head. Smaller Agencies Hurting More **********The smaller agencies seem to be hurting more than the larger, more diversified, ones. Benson, for example, advertises ''better'' administrative and secretarial jobs offering higher pay, travel or writing. In May 1981, its best month for revenues since 1964, it had 150 job openings.

Its revenues, which are not disclosed, dropped accordingly, he added. **********''The most qualified people are the last to be laid off,'' he said, ''so those who are looking for jobs are rarely the best.''

Its placement offices are ''not knocking them dead,'' said Mr. Murphy. **********The key to survival seems to be running in place, fast.

High End Being Squeezed **********Even the high end of the business, in which salaries range upward of $50,000 and layoffs are the last to occur, is being squeezed, according to the Association of Executive Search Consultants. **********''Traditionally, senior management is most immune to the negative effects of recession, but this recession is proving to be somewhat different,'' the association's latest survey of its members began.  The survey said that the number of assignments filled by its executive recruiting companies declined by 24 percent in the first half of 1982, compared with last year. **********''Even merger and acquisition specialists found their prospects dimming, with a 55 percent decline in the demand for jobs in the second quarter,'' the report said. **********There are at least 750 recruitment concerns in business across the country. Recruiters, unlike agencies, are paid to conduct a search whether or not they fill a job. Sixty of these companies belong to the association. Of those, ''at least 2 percent, maybe 4 percent, are in trouble,'' its president, John A. Richmond, said. **********As it happens, one sliver of the high-end market is definitely thriving, according to Richard Hill, president of the National Association of Personnel Consultants. ''Bankruptcy lawyers are in high demand,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/08/business/business-people-former-stockholders-of-denney-file-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1982-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 294, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Former Stockholders Of Denney File Suit", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Former Stockholders Of Denney File Suit", "body_text": " **********Frances Denney Inc., an old-line cosmetics and fragrance company founded in 1897, is embroiled in thoroughly modern litigation with its former stockholders, including the former chairman, Armand Deutsch, and the former chief executive, William Fine. **********In 1977, Mr. Fine and a group of investors bought Frances Denney, then a small and unprofitable concern. **********Under Mr. Fine, a former president of Bonwit Teller and publishing director of several Hearst magazines, the company was repositioned to make its skin-care products more appealing to younger women. **********By July 1980, the fast-growing company needed greater financial and research support, Mr. Fine said at the time, and Frances Denney was sold for $5 million - realizing a profit of roughly $1.5 million for the investors - to Delalande S.A., a French pharmaceutical company. **********Now Frances Denney's 22 former shareholders are suing Delalande to collect the third and final payment of $1.3 million that was due on March 1.

Sales fell to $14.7 billion in the latest quarter from $15.7 billion. **********G.M., the country's largest car maker, acknowledged that its first-quarter net income came largely from earnings of $131.2 million at its General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Motors Insurance Company, which finance auto purchases and insure cars. **********The company's operating loss was $7.4 million in the latest quarter on the basis of gains from foreign currency translations and vehicle sales, which declined 13 percent, to 1.47 million, from 1.69 million a year before. American Motors Report **********The quarter's after-tax operating loss narrowed to $2.9 billion after figuring in $78.6 million of other income, such as real estate transactions, an income tax credit of $256.8 million and interest expenses of $330.9 million. **********In a separate report today, the American Motors Corporation announced a loss of $51 million for the first quarter, narrowed slightly from a loss of $52.7 milllion a year before. These were the auto industry's first two reports for the quarter ended March 31. **********Executives of General Motors attributed the company's operating loss and the reduced profit for the quarter to ''the prolonged recession and resulting slump in vehicle sales.'' But Roger B. Smith, chairman, and F. James McDonald, president, said in a joint statement that their outlook for the rest of the year was optimistic. ''The impact of the recession will undoubtedly continue to be felt in second-quarter results,'' their statement said, ''but the recession appears to have about run its course.'' Continuation of a Trend **********The first-quarter earnings continued last year's trend. Although G.M. was the only domestic car company to report a 1981 profit, it acknowledged that its earnings of $333 million last year were a result of the performance of its finance and insurance subsidiaries rather than of auto production. **********Analysts said that the latest report, nonethless, showed improvements in General Motors' efforts to cut costs.  ''With a 22 percent decline in unit volume in North America, just staying in the black is testimony to their cost cutting,'' said David Healy, an industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert.  Nevertheless, Mr. Healy observed that ''in a sense they earned their profit in the accounting department, not the car department.'' **********''The results were very poor but satisfactory under the circumstances,'' said Arvid Jouppi, a Detroit-based analyst with Collin, Hochstin & Company. Mr. Jouppi said General Motors would not regain solid profitability until car buyers return to auto showrooms in sufficient numbers for the company to run its plants at high volume. **********G.M.'s net income in the fourth quarter of 1981 was $97 million, or 31 cents a share, which was up from $62 million, or 21 cents a share, a year before. **********Analysts expect G.M. to be more profitable this year than in 1981, with the amount depending on the timing and vigor of the nation's economic recovery. Mr. Healy said he anticipated earnings of as much as $4 a share - about $1.2 billion - while Mr. Jouppi said his projection was between $600 million and $900 million. **********G.M. said it sold 906,000 cars, trucks and buses in North America during the first quarter, down from 1,162,000 in the comparable 1981 period. However, its overseas production rose to 418,000 vehicles from 341,000. Overall vehicle sales totaled 1,470,000, down from 1,690,000.

Haig Jr. was reported by a ides today to be seriously considering whether to name a high-level negotiator to the drawn-out Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on Palestinian self-rule. The aides said that Mr. Haig spent consider able time during the last five days while he was in California stu dying Middle East problems, and in particular the pros and cons of appointing a specialMiddle East envoy in order to dramatize the R eagan Administration's commitment to gaining an agreement by the end of April. One key StateDepartment official said, however, that Mr. H aig seems unconvinced, despite recommendations from within the Admin istration and from outside experts, that the time is right to ta ke that action. Talks With Envoys This Week **********State Department officials said the decision on whether to name a special envoy will be one of the matters that Mr. Haig intends to raise with the American ambassadors to Egypt and Israel, who have been recalled to Washington for a wide-ranging discussion of Middle East diplomatic issues, including ways of giving some new impetus to the Palestinian autonomy negotiations. **********Alfred L. Atherton Jr., the Ambassador to Egypt, and Samuel W.  Lewis, the Ambassador to Israel, were due in Washington for talks early this week. Mr. Haig himself is planning to visit Cairo and Jerusalem later this month after attending a special foreign ministers meeting in Brussels of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that is to discuss coordinating steps on the Polish crisis. That NATO meeting will be held either Jan. 11 or 15, the officials said. **********According to various State Department officials, as well as others with close contacts within the Administration, the chief candidate for the role of special negotiator is Brent L. Scowcroft, a retired Air Force general, who served as President Ford's national security adviser. **********After the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in Washington in March 1979, President Carter named special envoys to take over the responsibility for representing the United States in the negotiations on Palestinian self-rule, which, like the peace treaty, was agreed to in outline form at the Camp David talks in September 1978 by Mr. Carter, President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel. **********The first special envoy was Robert S. Strauss. After he resigned to head Mr. Carter's re-election campaign, Sol M. Linowitz took over and, according to Mr. Linowitz, concluded about 80 percent of the projected accord by the time he resigned after President Reagan was inaugurated. Mr. Haig has resisted the naming of a successor to Mr.  Linowitz until now, giving as the reason that the time was not right and that until the Egyptians and Israelis had made further progress, it was better to avoid creating undue expectations by naming a special envoy. Envoy Would Report to Haig **********Officials said that if Mr. Scowcroft or someone else is named as a high-level envoy, he would report to Mr. Haig and not directly to Mr. Reagan, thereby easing Mr. Haig's concerns that the State Department retain control of the negotiations. **********Both Mr. Begin and Hosni Mubarak, who succeeded Mr. Sadat as President of Egypt, have urged the United States to take a more active role in the autonomy talks. Mr. Begin and some of his top aides, including Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, have accused Washington of showing increasingly less support for the Camp David process and have cited the lack of a special negotiator to back up their claim. **********Mr. Reagan and Mr. Haig have publicly supported the continuing negotiations on Palestinian self-rule and have committed the Administration to carrying out the Camp David accords. **********The autonomy talks have made little apparent progress since they resumed last fall after a delay of many months because of elections in the United States and in Israel. Mr. Haig, to the surprise of some of his aides, has insisted that, to the contrary, the talks have brought significant results. ''We've made more progress in 11 months than the previous administration made in 3 years on the subject of autonomy,'' he said in a recent interview with Hearst newspapers. Withdrawal From Sinai **********Under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, Israel is to return to Egypt by April 25 the remaining part of Sinai that it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war. Israel has already returned more than two-thirds of Sinai. In return, Egypt agreed to full diplomatic relations with Israel and to a number of cooperative ventures. **********In the minds of all parties, the April 25 date has taken on signficance because if there is no accord on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by then, it will appear to other Arabs as if E gypt s igned the Camp David accords solely to get back its own territory. **********Egyptians say they want an autonomy accord by April 25 to demonstrate that they were sincere in their support for Palestinian rights in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis say an agreement would be useful to keep Egypt fr om renouncing the peac e treaty once it retrieved its captured lands. **********The United States has said that if a Palestinian accord is reached by April 25, this would make it easier to involve Jordan and other nations, such as Saudi Arabia, in the next stage of peace efforts and would allow a reconciliation of Egypt with the rest of the Arab world. Relations With Israel Cited **********Until now, the Administration has been represented at the Palestinian talks by Mr. Atherton and Mr. Lewis, joined by specialists from Washington. **********Mr. Haig was reported by aides to want to discuss, particularly with Mr. Lewis, ways to restore to normal relations with Israel and to avoid the public clashes of recent months. The latest, over Israel's sudden decision in effect to annex the Golan Heights, so upset the Administration that it indefinitely suspended further discussion of carrying out a strategic cooperation agreement with Israel that had been signed only two weeks earlier. **********That, in turn, led to Mr. Begin's public attack on the Administration and his statement that he regarded the suspension as tantamount to a cancellation. Since then, both sides have said that the accord legally still exists, but there has been no move to carry out any of the joint activities called for in the document. **********The Administration, which voted for a United Nations Security Council measure condemning the annexation, now must decide what to do on Tuesday when the Council meets to discuss a Syrian call for sanctions against Israel. The Administration has said it is unlikely to support sanctions as such."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/09/business/chemical-to-offer-banking-at-home.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 727, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHEMICAL TO OFFER BANKING AT HOME", "print_headline": "CHEMICAL TO OFFER BANKING AT HOME", "body_text": " **********Chemical Bank, in one of the first announcements of its kind, said yesterday that it would introduce a service that would allow its customers in the New York area to bank at home using personal computers. **********Such home electronic banking has been the subject of numerous market tests, but Chemical, the nation's sixth-largest bank, would be the first of the nation's largest banks to offer such a service commercially. **********Customers using the system would be able to do such things as keep track of their checking accounts and home budget, transfer money from one account to another and pay bills electronically by typing commands on the computer keyboard. **********Mark Plakias, research director for Link Resources Corporation, a New York market research firm, said that as home banking, shopping and other electronic services achieved commercial status, other companies were likely to follow Chemical. Its move ''indicates the consumer is much more ready to use this kind of a product than most people imagine,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, Chemical's move is something of a gamble because it is not certain that the public is ready and because electronic home banking cannot be used for two things consumers normally do at banks - make deposits and obtain cash. **********''The market doesn't exist for this,'' said William B. Cornfield, director of home information services for Chemical. ''It has to be created.'' **********The service, known as Pronto, has been tested on about 200 households since November. Chemical will start offering the commercial service before the end of the year, initially to between 2,000 and 3,000 of its checking account customers, the bank said. **********Users would need an Atari home computer, a television set for a viewing screen, a cartridge similar to a video game cartridge containing the banking program and a device called a modem, which connects the home computer over the telephone line to the bank's computer. Chemical officials said the computer, modem and cartridge could be purchased for less than $500. Monthly Fee of $8-$10 **********In addition to the initial equipment costs, customers will be charged a monthly fee of $8 to $10 and will have to pay local telephone charges. **********John A. Farnsworth, senior vice president, said the system would eventually work with other home computers and terminals. The company is also offering to license its system to other banks. **********He also said that Chemical, possibly in partnership with other companies, planned to offer electronic services beyond banking. They include the ability to order merchandise electronically, to retrieve stock quotes and evaluate portfolios, to read news reports, to check concert schedules and order tickets, and possibly even to buy and sell stocks. **********Mr. Farnsworth said about 250 companies - including major retailers, oil companies, credit card companies, and utilities - had agreed to accept electronic bill payments through Chemical's new service. Instead of writing a check and mailing it, consumers would type the proper commands and money would be transferred from their accounts to the billing company's account, saving both the bank and the consumer the cost of mailing and processing checks. **********It is uncertain how Chemical will fare in its venture. For one thing, Chemical has not fully developed its plans for marketing the system. There could also be regulatory limits on what services a bank could offer and whether they could offer banking across state lines, though Mr. Farnsworth said those did not appear to be a problem. **********Mr. Plakias of Link Resources said a more important question for Chemical and for electronic banking in general was whether smaller banks will agree to license the system for their own use. Other Banks Interested **********Two other major New York banks, Citibank and Chase Manhattan, have also been experimenting with home banking using computers, but they have not yet decided whether to offer them to the general public. **********The first commercial system was introduced by United American Bank in Knoxville, Tenn., in October 1980; it has about 400 users. The system, licensed from Financial Interstate Service Corporation, is not fully automatic, in that when a customer types in commands for a bill to be paid, the bank then must issue a check to the company.

She was a planner who helped the town of Greenwich, Conn., establish its zoning a decade ago, and before that she had worked as a regional planner in southwestern Connecticut. **********The shift began in 1975, when she bought waterfront land abutting a boat yard in Mamaroneck, where she and her husband live. It was six years before the town finally approved a plan for 13 town houses.  Mrs. Millstein has started to develop them under the name Indian Cove. In the meantime she has also built and sold a town-house condominium project called Pine Ridge in Larchmont. **********The Long Island Sound shoreline of Westchester County is not hospitable terrain for new development. Exclusive older communities of large detached houses in the metropolitan area typically resist ''infill'' housing on relatively small sites, unless the new house is large and detached itself. But Mrs. Millstein's persistence eventually was rewarded. ''I just kept plowing ahead,'' she said. **********Speculatively built single-family houses on individual lots in communities with high land costs are an anachronism in the 1980's.  Not only is it prohibitively expensive for most buyers; it is also inconsistent with what most buyers want. **********What does make sense to builders and planners is the town house. By grouping several houses within a single structure, costs are significantly reduced. Yet the overall density of the development is not significantly changed. The additional land is used for open space, community facilities or landscaping. **********All these principles have been brought into play by Mrs. Millstein, whose development company is called DGM Partners. Arthur J. Wexler is the architect, and a partner in building Indian Cove. **********The 13 town houses will be in four buildings, each with a New England seaside look appropriate to the setting. It is a 3.6-acre site in the boatyard and club area off Rushmore Avenue. The total density is about six to the acre. **********These are to be houses with gray-stained cedar facades and asphalt shingle roofs and 2,200 to 2,300 square feet of space, with three or four bedrooms. There will be an outdoor swimming pool, a private dock area for the buyers' boats, and extensive landscaping. They are offered at prices ranging from $267,500 to $345,250. Site work is in progress and the first delivery of homes to buyers is expected in the spring. **********In Larchmont Mrs. Millstein developed 40 two-bedroom town houses, each with a garage, on a 6.5-acre site off the Post Road (Route 1) once occupied by a nursery. A previous owner had cleared the land to develop it as a tennis center. But townspeople wanted housing.  Knowing of Mrs. Millstein's efforts in Mamaroneck they encouraged her to buy the property. **********These 1,600- to 1,800-square-foot two-bedroom houses came on the market in 1978 at prices of $85,000 to $100,000. Landscaping and other site work shield the houses from the main road, and a narrow 20-foot road twists through the development. In a few years the trees will provide complete privacy. **********Within six months the houses were selling for $150,000 to $160,000, Mrs. Millstein said, as buyers added skylights, fireplaces in bedrooms, front or rear sun rooms, larger living rooms and more. At Indian Cove, the buildings will provide even more flexibility, she said. **********The buyers at Pine Ridge consisted mainly of older people selling houses and, to some extent, divorced families. Perhaps 10 to 15 percent of the market for new housing in the metropolitan area consists of recently divorced people, builders say. **********As Mrs. Millstein sees it, much of the current zoning in Westchester is outdated. It was created at a time when new housing was being built for ''mom and dad, two or three kids and a dog.'' But these days most people seeking new housing are in smaller households. **********Instead of basing zoning restrictions on dwelling units per acre, it might be more appropriate to set limits based on the number of people, Mrs. Millstein said. Builders could then produce more but smaller units without affecting population density since family sizes are smaller. **********Mrs. Millstein has plans for housing in northern New Rochelle. She owns four acres of land off Pine Brook Boulevard and intends to build 18 condominiums as detached houses. The open space will be owned and operated jointly by the condominium buyers. **********''No yards, no play areas,'' she said. ''It's geared to fewer kids. God knows, in the suburbs there are enough four-bedroom houses. But there aren't enough two-bedroom units with studies instead of playrooms. We need housing to accommodate smaller families.'' **********Mrs. Millstein is a native of Rye, N.Y. She majored in economics at New York University, graduating in 1949. She returned to Columbia University 11 years later to study architecture, but switched to planning. She and her husband, a lawyer, have two adult sons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/25/business/fleetwood-enterprises-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-24.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLEETWOOD ENTERPRISES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 24", "print_headline": "FLEETWOOD ENTERPRISES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 24", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/07/world/havana-exploits-falkland-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1982-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAVANA EXPLOITS FALKLAND DISPUTE", "print_headline": "HAVANA EXPLOITS FALKLAND DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Heartened by evidence that the Falkland conflict has already damaged Washington's relations with Latin America, Cuba is now trying to use the crisis to end its political isolation from much of the region. **********In the last two months, Havana has emerged as one of the strongest supporters of Argentina, with which it had tense relations before the dispute.

Few Friends in the Region **********Regional analysts recalled that, having re-established ties with much of Latin America in the mid-1970's, Cuba's relations with numerous countries, notably Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia and Costa Rica, had again deteriorated over the last two years. **********With the Reagan Administration campaigning strongly against supposed Cuban involvement with Central America's revolutionary movements, much of Latin America also seemed happy to push Havana back into the cold. Only Mexico, Nicaragua, Grenada and, occasionally, Panama were willing to be counted among Cuba's friends in the region. **********But, seeing Latin America's anger and frustration over the Falklands directed even more against the United States than Britain, Cuba has now jumped at the opportunity to pull closer to the rest of Latin America, starting with such countries as Peru and Venezuela that have adopted similarly strong positions in the crisis. **********''Nothing dramatic has happened yet,'' a Cuban official conceded.  ''In both cases, our relations are still at the level of charge d'affaires rather than ambassadors. But this whole business is going to have very profound consequences.'' Cubans Note Positive Results **********Given Argentina's recent record of repression against suspected leftist militants, some Cuban officials conceded a certain embarrassment in finding themselves now supporting the Buenos Aires junta, although they fell back on the argument that the Falklands is a cause supported by the entire Argentine people. **********But they also quickly pointed out that the crisis had also brought them positive results, specifically the withdrawal of Argentine military advisers from El Salvador and Guatemala, where they were providing counterinsurgency training to local armies, and from Honduras, where they were helping armed bands of anti-Sandinist Nicaraguan exiles. **********''This alone is a considerable achievement,'' an official argued.  ''The United States had clear plans for Argentina to form a force capable of invading Nicaragua and this won't happen now.'' **********In the name of trying to isolate Washington, Nicaragua has also followed Cuba's lead in supporting Argentina over the Falklands, pardoning Buenos Aires overnight for its earlier efforts to disrupt the Sandinist regime. Nicaragua's Foreign Minister, Miguel d'Escoto, told last week's conference that ''the anti-imperialist sentiments of Latin America have reached levels never previously achieved'' as a result of the South Atlantic conflict. One day earlier, Argentina offered 7,000 tons of wheat to help Nicaragua overcome food shortages caused by serious flooding last month. **********As a result of the Falkland crisis, some countries have revived the idea of replacing the Organization of American States with a new regional organization that would exclude the United States.  Argentina's Foreign Minister, Nicanor Costa Mendez, who last week described Cuba as ''the pride of the Caribbean'' to astonished delegates, has even suggested that Cuba be welcomed back into the Latin American community, although President Castro himself said it was ''a little premature'' for Havana to return to the O.A.S."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/29/business/consumers-power-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMERS POWER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CONSUMERS POWER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/business/business-and-the-law-bankruptcies-chaos-prevails.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1982-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and the Law; Bankruptcies: Chaos Prevails", "print_headline": "Business and the Law; Bankruptcies: Chaos Prevails", "body_text": " **********THE Supreme Court's June 28 decision that the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 gave bankruptcy judges more power than was constitutionally permissible has left debtors and creditors, and their lawyers, confused about how to handle pending cases - and even more uncertain about the future of the bankruptcy system. **********The Marathon Pipe Line ruling gives Congress until Oct. 4 to devise a constitutional system, either by giving bankruptcy judges the same legal status as Federal district judges, or by shifting some of the work they now do into other courts. **********The timing could hardly be worse. Both the bankruptcy system and Congress are already under tremendous pressure: the system, to keep up with the rising tide of business and consumer bankruptcies, and Congress, to get through a crowded legislative agenda in time for a late August recess. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy system is in chaos. **********''There's a lot of uncertainty right now,'' said Ronald Orr, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer. ''No one knows what they can and can't do, and we're not going to know until Oct. 4. It's about as messy as it could be.'' **********Many lawyers are considering turning to the Federal district courts until the question of the bankruptcy courts' jurisdiction is resolved, especially for the ancillary third-party claims that arise in the course of a large business bankruptcy or reorganization. **********Some are even talking about filing bankruptcy petitions in a Federal district court, on the theory that there can always be a transfer to a bankruptcy court if necessary. Others say it is not clear that the district courts have the power to hear bankruptcy cases: if the bankruptcy system is not amended by the Oct. 4 deadline, they add, it may become impossible to declare bankruptcy. **********Although the Supreme Court has been known to extend its deadlines, an extension in this case would put the bankruptcy question before a lame-duck Congress at best, or a whole new Congress, at worst. **********The fallout from the Supreme Court decision is already affecting pending cases. Many lawyers are trying to protect their claims by asking the bankruptcy judge not to take any action until a new system is in place. **********''The prospect for large companies and creditors to get quick relief is bleak and very messy,'' said Kenneth Klee, another Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer. **********That may be true well beyond Oct. 4. Bankruptcy reform is such a controversial issue that many experts think Congress will be unable to meet the deadline. **********In some ways, the decision is a vindication for the House of Representatives, which originally wanted to give bankruptcy judges the same status and lifetime tenure that Federal district judges received under Article III of the Constitution, thereby avoiding the constitutional problem. In April, Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation to convert bankruptcy judges into Article III judges. Even if that bill passes, though, the President must appoint the bankruptcy judges, and the Senate must confirm them, a process most experts expect will take several months. **********Most bankruptcy lawyers are rooting for the Article III approach, which would allow bankruptcy judges to retain the broad powers the 1978 law gave them. Going back to the old system, under which a bankruptcy court handled a bankruptcy and a district court or a state court handled third-party ancillary suits, would be a tremendous waste of time and money, they say. **********The Senate, however, has never liked the Article III approach.  Senator Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and others insisted on the arrangment embodied in the 1978 law and, at least so far, have given no signs of changing their minds. **********Even if the two houses of Congress reach a quick agreement on the question of the status of bankruptcy judges, another more troublesome political problem remains. For some time, Congress has been faced with intense lobbying pressures from those who want to make the bankruptcy laws more favorable to creditors. Congress Watch, a Ralph Nader group, says that banks, finance companies and others who are pushing the changes have contributed nearly $1 million to Congressional campaign coffers - most of it to members who support reform legislation. **********In fact, bankruptcy reform is one of the most controversial issues on Capitol Hill. And now that the Supreme Court has forced Congress to take action on the judges' jurisdiction, it is unlikely that the legislators will be able to avoid the policy questions. **********''There's no doubt in my mind that there will be a debate on the substantive issues,'' said a member of Senator Bob Dole's staff. Mr.  Dole, the Kansas Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, wants to make it harder for consumers to liquidate personal debt, a reform that is strongly supported by lenders and just as strongly opposed by consumer advocates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/03/business/smd-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SMD INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 2", "print_headline": "SMD INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/business/minnetonka-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-25.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MINNETONKA INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 25", "print_headline": "MINNETONKA INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 25", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/22/business/color-tile-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLOR TILE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "COLOR TILE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/world/regime-in-poland-ousts-90-officials-in-the-provinces.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1982-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REGIME IN POLAND OUSTS 90 OFFICIALS IN THE PROVINCES", "print_headline": "REGIME IN POLAND OUSTS 90 OFFICIALS IN THE PROVINCES", "body_text": " **********Poland's military regime has removed 90 provincial and city officials, according to a senior staff member of the country's ruling military council. **********Col. Zdzislaw Malina, deputy head of the council's Secretariat, was quoted by the Warsaw radio today as saying that the ousted officials included those who ''under normal conditions worked efficiently'' but who ''unfortunately did not cope with the new tasks resulting from the specific nature of martial law.'' **********The radio also broadcast an attack against student activists and disclosed that the suspended students' union had been involved in ''various actions'' to protest martial law. '200,000 Social Parasites' **********The broadcast, quoting the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu, said many students were among ''200,000 social parasites'' refusing to work. Last week, in announcing compulsory labor for all men between the ages of 18 and 45, the military Government exempted students. **********The Government had announced plans to reopen universities next week, but the broadcast today indicated that the authorities might be afraid the students would not return to classes. **********This evening the Polish television announced that jail sentences averaging five to six years had been given to five workers charged with leading a strike that ended last week at the Katowice steel mill. The workers were accused of ''causing considerable losses to the national economy.'' Provincial Military Committees **********The radio quoted Colonel Malina as saying that 9 of the 90 officials removed in 34 of Poland's 49 provinces were provincial governors, deputy governors or mayors; the other 81 were chief administrative officers. **********Colonel Malina, who reportedly made his remarks in an interview with Trybuna Ludu, said provincial military committees had been running the provinces since the imposition of martial law on Dec. 13. **********The provincial committees, Colonel Malina said, have strengthened the principle of one-man leadership as well as the duties of local officials and industrial heads. **********In 1973, the Communist Party, known as the Polish United Workers' Party, tightened its control at the provincial level by making the provincial party secretaries the heads of state presidiums. **********Colonel Malina said in the interview that the provincial committees were concentrating their efforts on ''insuring security'' and ''maintaining work discipline.'' **********According to the Warsaw radio, industrial work has been interrupted by a shortage of energy and raw materials. The Government, the broadcast said, will guarantee pay for employees who lose work time because of what the radio described as ''standstills in various enterprises and works.'' **********''In accordance with the labor code,'' the broadcast said, ''employees are entitled to remuneration according to their grades for the duration of a standstill.'' **********Last week, the Government announced that it was establishing a new set of guidelines to guarantee energy and raw material for factories, although at increased costs. In that announcement, the Government said it had expanded its list of essential industries to include some food-processing plants. **********The Warsaw radio said that in Szczecin, where the curfew was reduced by two hours today, two executives with the state-run transport company had been expelled from the Communist Party and were in danger of dismissal because of their involvement in ''strikes and protests.'' **********The Polish military Government, judged by its radio and television statements, is waging a campaign to convince Poles that the Soviet Union is their closest friend. Daily reports are made on the arrival of Soviet food, raw materials and other supplies needed to aid Poland's severely damaged economy. **********The theme is also prominent in Soviet reports from Warsaw and in Soviet press and broadcasting comments on the P olish situation.  Today, the Soviet press agency Tass quoted Tr ybuna Ludu in a lengthy account of the New Year's Eve message by the Polish President, Henryk Jablonski. The report was at almost to tal variance with those based on the same message monitored in the We st. In the Tass version, the emphasis was on the necessity of martial law and on Po land's place in the ''socialist community.'' Gone were Mr. Jablonski 's references to Polish patriotism, ''national accord'' and ''sociali st renewal.'' **********''There cannot be any return to the situation from before Dec.  13,'' the Tass version of Mr. Jablonski's speech said.  As monitored in the West, Mr. Jablonski said that over the last year Poles had introduced ''actions aimed at creating political, legal and personal guarantees for preventing a repition of the evil and distortions which existed before August 1980.''

Block announced today. **********The acceptance was delivered in writing today to the American Embassy in Moscow, Mr. Block said. He added in a statement that ''the willingness of the Soviet Union to accept this extension is proof that the Soviets believe the President's pledge that the United States will again be a reliable supplier.'' **********That statement was in contrast to the acrimony that has surrounded President Reagan's ban on the use of American-made or Americanlicensed equipment for the construction of a 3,700-mile pipeline to bring natural gas from Siberia to the Soviet Union. **********Second Yearly Extension **********The new grain agreement was the second yearly extension of a fiveyear accord that has regulated Soviet purchases of American grain since 1976 and has assured American farmers of a Soviet market for some of their grain. **********The agreement says that the Soviet Union must purchase at least 6 million metric tons of American corn and wheat a year and can purchase a maximum of 8 million tons. For any larger purchases there must be prior government-to-government approval. In the current year, the United States has offered the Russians an additional 15 million tons above the 8 million. 14 Million Tons Bought **********The Russians have actually purchased a total of 14 million tons in the current agreement year. But a White House fact sheet distributed today projected that the Russians would actually buy a record 17.8 million tons,topping their previous record of 15.3 million tons set in 1979. **********Under heavy pressure from farm states that are facing record harvests, huge unsold grain surpluses and weakening farm prices, President Reagan offered July 30 to extend the accord passed the Sept. 30 expiration. But he did not attempt to increase the minimum purchases required of the Russians, as American farmers have wanted to do. **********There had been speculation in Moscow and the grain trade that the Soviet Union might reject the offer to extend the grain agreement because of the Reagan Administration's embargo on the sale of pipeline equipment. **********There had also been speculation that Moscow would decide to meet its foreign grain needs with purchases from other countries - chiefly Australia, Argentina and Canada - as it had done after President Carter curtailed grain shipments to the Soviet Union in retaliation for the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in January 1980. **********While the United States has been reporting record grain crops this summer, the Soviet Union has faced its fourth dismal harvest in a row, necessitating large purchases abroad. **********Mr. Block said that the grain agreement extension ''will allow American farmers to continue rebuilding this important market which was thrown away to our competitors during the partial embargo.'' He stressed that he would be contacting Soviet officials immeditely to set a date for discussing additional sales beyond the minimums. **********American farm officials said that, if the Russians had felt the United States would not be a reliable supplier of grain in the future, they would have pressed for an agreement of longer than one year. **********But one Russian official said earlier this week, at a meeting of soybean industry officials in Pebble Beach, Calif., that the American reputation as a reliable supplier had already been hurt. **********Boris Antoniuk, the project manager of the United States-Soviet Trade and Economic Council, said that Moscow would buy from the United States only as a last resort when supplies were unavailable from other countries. **********American reliability as a supplier of manufactured goods and technology has also been hurt, according to Western European leaders and many business leaders in the United States, by the embargo on pipeline equipment, first imposed last December and expanded in June. **********The Administration's insistence on permitting grain sales to the Soviet Union while embargoing turbines and other goods for the pipeline has been strongly attacked by European officials who see the policy as inconsistent, hypocritical and harmful to European and trans-Atlantic interests. Soviet Role in Poland Cited **********President Reagan imposed the pipeline embargo in retaliation for what he has called the Soviet role in repression in Poland. Although the Europeans say they need the line to diversify energy supplies, the Administration argues that the line will strengthen the Soviet Union economically by giving it an additional $10 billion a year of hard-currency earnings.

Epcot is Disney's biggest addition since Walt Disney World opened 11 years ago. **********Dependence on New Ventures **********Renewed growth by Disney depends on the success of the new ventures, but it may take a year or more before the company's prospects become clear. Nevertheless, some analysts are pleased with what they regard as Disney's direction. **********''After stagnating for five years, the company is in the process of becoming a major factor in entertainment again,'' said Alan Kassan, a vice president of the First Manhattan Company. **********For the nine months through June 30, Disney's profits fell 14 percent, to $72 million, or $2.17 a share, from $83.8 million, or $2.57 a share, in the similar period a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $735.2 million. **********Disney is expected to finish its 1982 fiscal year, which ended today, with about $3.15 in earnings per share, versus $3.72 last year. The range of Wall Street forecasts for 1983 is between $4.25 and $5. **********The jump is expected to come partly from a rebound in attendance generated by the Epcot opening, plus the opening of a new Disneyland in Tokyo. Disney has no equity in the $450 million Tokyo project, the first of its kind outside the United States, but will be paid a licensing fee of 7.5 percent of the park's revenues. **********Attendance this year at Disney World, the country's most popular vacation resort, was down by 5 percent through June, and was not expected to equal last year's total of about 12 million when the count for the 1982 fiscal year stopped on Thursday. Its West Coast counterpart, the 27-year-old Disneyland, in Anaheim, Calif., south of Los Angeles, has been running about 7 percent below the 1981 pace through the summer. **********E. Cardon Walker, Disney's chairman and chief executive, said he expects Epcot to bring an additional 8 million people a year through Disney World's turnstiles, raising the total there to more than 20 million. Lagging Movie Division **********Although the drop in attendance is a nagging problem, Disney's movie business has been a calamity. Pretax profits in films fell 29 percent through the first three quarters on a 7 percent increase in revenue. **********''Families don't go to the movies like they used to, and we just haven't done well,'' Mr. Walker conceded. ''But we're not going to quit trying.'' **********A recent attempt, ''Tron,'' the story of a man trapped inside a video game and condemned to play until death, did lure some teen-age moviegoers. Its computer-generated images stirred a spate of publicity last spring, but the film drew mixed critical reviews and was a box-office disappointment. Still, the film, which cost $21 million, or more than double the average production cost in Hollywood, is expected to make some money by the time its foreign run is completed. **********More important, many considered the new elements in ''Tron'' as evidence that Disney executives have begun to shed their rigid loyalty to Walt Disney's concepts of how to run the business. Mr.  Disney died in 1966. Disney's top management has long been branded by industry analysts as insular and overly conservative. Walker Retirement Indicated **********Mr. Walker, 67 years old, has been chief executive since 1971 and chairman since 1980. He has indicated that he will retire next spring after the opening of the Tokyo Disneyland, and the start of the Disney Channel on pay television. **********Analysts expect that Ronald W. Miller, 49, president and heirapparent, is not likely to quickly change the company's direction. Nevertheless, it was Mr. Miller who opened Disney studios to outside talent and some analysts said he is more willing to consider new approaches. **********He said in an interview that the futuristic setting of the vast Epcot Center ''will be a platform'' for hundreds of hours of Disney programming, mainly for the Disney Channel, but also for Disney's weekly program on the CBS television network. **********''I think the Disney Channel could be the most rewarding project we have going,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Most of our new programming will be coming out of here and Walt Disney World. If that catches on, a lot of families will be signing up.'' Westinghouse Quits Project **********Cable operators are reportedly eager to add the Disney Channel to their offerings when it begins next April. But the Westinghouse Corporation, which was to have been an equal partner, abandoned the effort earlier this month in a programming dispute. **********Analysts are divided about the channel's prospects. Skeptics doubt that enough families will pay the monthly $10 fee to receive it. ''I think it will be a fiasco,'' said Arthur E. Rockwell, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Company, in Los Angeles. **********Still, Disney expects to draw two million subscribers by next spring. ''It's a good concept,'' said Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch, ''and it should be a nice contributor to earnings in six to eight years.'' **********Epcot, on the other hand, is expected to enhance Disney's profitability almost immediately. The company's $600 million initial investment in the project, in real terms, is less than half the $700 million it took to open Disney World in 1971. **********In addition to the $600 million of its own money, Disney received another $300 million from sponsors such as the Exxon Corporation, the General Motors Corporation, the Eastman Kodak Company and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********At today's closing price of $57.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, a gain of 50 cents, Disney's market value is about $2 billion. At that price, Mr. Kassan argues, Disney is undervalued. **********''Disney remains a totally unique franchise with very significant asset values,'' he said.

I.B.M.'s decision ended brief speculation that he might be passed over in favor of someone deemed more likely to help the giant, but troubled, company improve its less-than-customary performance. In the end, it seemed, loyalty, a plan of succession and his role as a sort of alter ego won out. **********Yesterday the Justice Department wearily dropped its 13-year-old antitrust suit against I.B.M., and Mr. Opel, as the company's top officer, again appeared to be a victor against great odds. Two and a half years ago his triumph was over unfounded rumor. This time it was over ''big government.'' **********The 57-year-old Mr. Opel has long trod a trail blazed by Frank T.  Cary, I.B.M.'s tight-lipped, tough-minded, former chief executive officer. It was Mr. Cary who held out against legions of Government lawyers, countless court hearings, mountains of written testimony and, some say, intrigue from competitors eager to help the Government's efforts against I.B.M. A Time for Accolades **********But if steadfast support and professional and personal loyalty mean anything, the Kansas-born Mr. Opel - an I.B.M. man since 1949, when he joined the company as a salesman - would appear to deserve the accolades he received yesterday at corporate headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. **********Mr. Opel was a member of the giant computer manufacturer's ruling council for a decade prior to his appointment as C.E.O. In all, he was at Mr. Cary's right hand for about 20 years. Mr. Opel is described by close associates as thoughtful, soft-spoken and, according to one of them, ''not too dramatically different in behavior from Frank Cary.'' Mr. Opel's steady advancement through the years is evidence of his sponsor's unflagging support through some difficult times, such as when I.B.M.'s conservatism allowed upstart competitors to carve out market niches for themselves. **********After joining I.B.M. as a salesman at Jefferson City, Mo., Mr.  Opel traveled a wide circle from the Ozarks to the Iowa border. He served 10 years in the field, creating a record that attracted the attention of Thomas J. Watson Jr., the head of the company, who made Mr. Opel his executive assistant and two years later a corporate vice president. Ascending the Ladder **********In 1968, somewhat less than 20 years after he joined the company, Mr. Opel was appointed senior vice president and chairman of the executive committee. He had entered the inner circle of I.B.M.'s elite. **********Still more recognition and responsibility lay ahead. In 1972 he was named head of the data processing division, representing the company's main marketing activity. By then, rival executives either had come under his wing or had been outpaced, and in 1974 it seemed only natural when he was named president at age 49. For some time Mr. Opel and Mr. Cary, beh ind their executive desks, had been physically separated by only a tiny anteroom. Mr. Opel's next move, to chief executive off icer, was just as natural six years later when Mr. Cary stepped down at age 60 in line with I.B.M.'s policy. **********Mr. Opel's wife is the former Julia Carole Stout, and they have two sons and three daughters. His outside interests include opera, fishing and ornithology. **********Last October I.B.M. moved to simplify its product-group marketing approach in favor of allowing single sales represenatives to sell a wide rantge of I.B.M. products. Outlining I.B.M.'s Aims **********Analysts considered this an effort to compete more effectively in the proliferating field of personal computers. But Mr. Opel declared in a statement that ''this new marketing structure will simplify the distribution of our products and better serve our customers' needs.'' These twin objectives could easily have been lifted out of a business management textbook. **********Like Mr. Cary, Mr. Opel holds a Master of Business Administration degree. Mr. Opel's is from the University of Chicago; Mr. Cary's is from Stanford University. Members of I.B.M.'s top brass, perhaps savoring yesterday's glowingvi ctory, seemed slow to leave for home late in the day. But efforts to reach Mr. Opel for comment proved unsuccessful. A corporate sp okesman explained that ''Mr. Opel is involved in meetings at Ar monk.'' **********What would prompt meetings so soon after yesterday's bombshell in Washington? Surely not another antitrust suit? The I.B.M. spokesman laughed. ''Not for another 13 years, at least,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/business/louisiana-pacific-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOUISIANA-PACIFIC CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "LOUISIANA-PACIFIC CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/18/business/officials-seize-videotapes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Officials Seize Videotapes", "print_headline": "Officials Seize Videotapes", "body_text": " **********Movie makers have stepped up their war against pirated home videotapes, according to the industry's chief investigator. **********Armed with writs of seizure, Federal marshals entered stores in four cities of Illinois and California on Tuesday. **********They confiscated copies of such movies as ''Superman,'' ''Sharkey's Machine'' and ''Rollover,'' said Ewing Layhew, executive director of the Film Security Office of the Motion Picture Producers Association. **********Just before the raids, four civil lawsuits charging piracy were filed in Chicago and suburban Tinley Park as well as in Temecula and Vista, Calif., Mr. Layhew said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.

Heller International Corporation, the Chicago c ommercial finance and bank holding company, said today that it will take a one-time, pretax, $79 million write-off for 1981 as a result o f ''irregularities'' discovered in its Phoenix office.  The write-off will cut Heller's 1981 net income 46.5 percent, to $23 million, from $43 million in 1980, the company said. **********The ''irregularities'' occurred in offices of Walter E. Heller Western Inc., a domestic finance unit. The company said in Chicago that ''Heller's internal control procedures uncovered an intricate series of diversions of funds which amount to a loss of about $19 million.'' **********''We're more disappointed than embarrassed,'' said Robert L.  Meyers, Heller treasurer. ''But, when a senior executive decides he wants to do something tricky, it's very difficult to stop him. He let us down.'' **********Lawsuits have been filed seeking recovery of the funds, the company said, but it was decided to take the write-off because the irregularities may mean an ''entire loss exposure.'' The parent company said that the manager of the Phoenix office and several other employees had been dismissed. **********Heller officials would not give details of the irregularities, nor would they identify any of the dismissed employees. Audits Performed **********In 1981, concerned Heller officials asked that an internal audit be performed on the records of the Phoenix br anch, but the report failed to show anything. Still not satisfied, Heller then sent an independent auditor to check the Phoenix bran ch's books in October.  That investigation uncovered the irregulariti es. **********Heller also filed a claim with the Fidelity Insurance Company to recover $10 million of the loss.  ''Who knows when we'll get it,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''It may be a year, or four or five years before we get it back.'' Nonetheless, the company has also ''learned a very valuable lesson,'' Mr. Meyers added. ''Our regular internal procedures work, but it didn't uncover it fast enough. We'll tighten up our procedures to make them work faster.'' Absorbing the Loss **********Thomas G. Rosencrants, an analyst with William Blair & Company, the Chicago brokerage firm, said, ''Heller won't go out of business because of the theft, but it does say something negative about their financial controls.'' **********To soften the blow, Heller has added the $19 million to the $59 million in problem loans it was prepared to write off against its earnings for 1981. **********Heller is a 62-year-old finance and bank holding company, whose primary customers tend to be small businesses that are unable to meet the strict loan requirements of large banks. Because these assetbased loans have greater risk, Heller tends to charge a higher interest rate. **********With the write-off, Heller earned $23 million on revenues of $900 million in 1981, down from $43 million on revenues of $660 million in 1980. **********According to the company, its net earnings would have totaled $45 million without the write-off, but instead amounted to only $23 million. **********''We elected to take the write-off now,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''Now it won't have an impact on earnings. We expect next year to turn out much better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/13/business/trust-co-of-georgia-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRUST CO OF GEORGIA reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TRUST CO OF GEORGIA reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/07/world/iranian-officers-seeking-revenge-talk-of-pursuing-army-into-iraq.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRANIAN OFFICERS, SEEKING REVENGE, TALK OF PURSUING ARMY INTO IRAQ", "print_headline": "IRANIAN OFFICERS, SEEKING REVENGE, TALK OF PURSUING ARMY INTO IRAQ", "body_text": " **********With most Iraqi forces having been driven back across the border this week, some Iranian officers said today they were eager to press on into Iraq, just a mile west of this devastated village. **********''Eventually, we must have our revenge,'' one field commander said.  But the officers apparently have not been given permission to do so by the Government, even though Iran says its offensive has eliminated all but a few Iraqi enclaves on Iranian soil. The Iranian troops are dug in on and behind the high ground here, awaiting counterattacks and conducting reconnaissance patrols. **********Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his disciples seem disinclined to attempt a repetition of last summer's unsuccessful thrust toward Basra. The next step may well be an attempt to liberate the Iraqiheld areas near Khurramshahr and Fekkeh, south of here, and near Naft-i-Shah, far to the north. Clouds of Dust **********The Iranian buildup in this area is impressive. Tanks, tank transporters, trucks, jeeps, bulldozers and helicopters shuttle back and forth, sending clouds of dust into the air above the hills, the plain and the picturesque buttes and valleys carved by the Meimeh and Douvrij Rivers. **********The Iranians say they have cleared 210 square miles of Iraqi troops, advancing for about 6 miles along a 35-mile front leading southeast from the town of Dehloran. They also say they have captured intact 45 tanks or armored cars, including several Brazilian-made Cascavel vehicles. These carry a big gun and can make 75 miles an hour. **********A new battalion of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, which gets all Iraqi booty, is to be formed to use the captured armor. The guards appear proficient in handling vehicles of all sorts, despite their sketchy training, but are not involved with planes or helicopters. Fatigues and Tennis Shoes **********The guards corps is now said to number up to 150,000 men, most of them in their 20's. They wear rumpled, often mismatched fatigues and tennis shoes, and many of them tie red scarves bearing Islamic slogans around their heads. Most have had only three months' training. But they are fiercely nationalistic and idealistic and seemingly fearless. They are integrated with regular army units during combat, but the partnership seems unequal. **********At a briefing Friday, for example, a guard in his early 20's did the talking; a regular captain simply muttered at the conclusion that he had nothing to add. A guard said that ''the army's superior technical skills and our powerful faith makes us strong,'' but some regular officers, crisp in their American-style uniforms, and with 15 or 20 years' service, found it hard to disguise their displeasure at being obliged to negotiate every decision with youngsters. **********The guards are an unsmiling lot, given to chanting at any opportunity. They wear no insignia of rank and never salute, and they talk frequently of their willingness to be ''martyrs.'' On their left breast pockets, they wear a blue and gold patch that shows a globe, an arm and an AK-47 assault rifle - a symbol, one 23-year-old explained, of their eagerness to fight overseas ''for the oppressed of the world.'' He mentioned El Salvador as the kind of place where he would like to fight. **********Riding motorcycles, the guards take on tanks with RPG-7 anti-tank rockets. They also attack boldly across mine fields, as do members of the Basij, a paramilitary organization made up mostly of teen-agers.  A fuzzy-cheeked 15-year-old told reporters at Ein-i-Khosh that his parents ''believe that I was a gift from God, so if I'm killed I'd be a gift to God.'' **********The most important Iranian accomplishment in this week's military campaign, it appeared, was freeing the region east of the offensive from the threat of artillery attack. Much of the area had been liberated in March, but, with their guns emplaced on the heights, the Iraqis had been able to shell towns and highways at will. **********Iranian commanders asserted, and Iraqi prisoners-of-war confirmed, that the fighting took place entirely on Iranian soil, despite the contentions of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that his troops had pulled out of Iran. Burned hulks of Iraqi T-55 tanks, built in the Soviet Union, litter the harsh, arid flatlands near the Iraqi border not far from here. **********The equivalent of three Iranian brigades, more than 10,000 men, were involved in the offensive, which began Monday night. Iranian losses were described as ''lighter than expected'' and the Iranians said they downed 10 Iraqi planes, killed or wounded more than 3,500 Iraqi troops and taken almost 1,750 prisoners. **********The prisoners were assembled today on a gravel parade ground at the big Vahdati air base at Dizful, about 65 miles east of here, for interviews by correspondents. One prisoner, a lieutenant colonel who commanded a battalion, said his men had been surrounded in the rain and in the dark and overwhelmed. He said the Iranian attack had been ''massive, well-organized and precise.'' **********His unit had been sent into Iran to hold the Bayat oilfield, the Iranian part of which lies around Hill 400 near this village. It has a capacity of 25,000 barrels a day. They built reinforced bunkers, laid mines and unrolled yards of concertina barbed wire, the colonel added, but were unable to resist a combined attack by Revolutionary Guards infantry and armor. An Air Base With Familiar Signs **********Despite reports in the West that the Iranian Air Force was all but grounded because of a lack of spare parts, American-built F-5's fly regular sorties from Dizful. **********The air base bears all the hallmarks of its former United States advisers: a huge sign, in English, proclaiming it ''the home of the fighters''; officers who speak in American military slang, calling kilometers ''clicks''; and fancy guest quarters, jocularly known as ''the White House,'' with tiled bathrooms containing sunken tubs.  Visiting correspondents, heckled at every stop with chants of ''Death to America,'' slept there Friday night under United States Army Medical Corps blankets. **********With its neat rows of officers' quarters, its palm trees, its November sunshine and its gas stations labeled POL, for Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants, the base might be in Texas or California. Only the insignia on the C-130's, the F-5's and the Chinook and Huey helicopters are different. **********Many villages have been destroyed. Musian, which has a population of 5,000 before the start of the 25-month Iran-Iraq war, now has a population of zero. Only three or four houses have been left with as much as one wall standing. Utility poles lie on the ground with their lines stretched across the desolate streets. A few battered oil drums mark what was once the main intersection. Outside the village, scraggly cows wander aimlessly. **********The region's economy formerly depended on dairy herds and fruit trees grown with the help of irrigation. Both activities have been ruined, and the pipeline leading from the Bayat field has been severed in several places. There is no sign of nonmilitary activity for mile after forlorn mile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/mosinee-paper-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOSINEE PAPER CORP reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "MOSINEE PAPER CORP reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/world/israel-reports-knocking-out-another-syrian-missile-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 642, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL REPORTS KNOCKING OUT ANOTHER SYRIAN MISSILE UNIT", "print_headline": "ISRAEL REPORTS KNOCKING OUT ANOTHER SYRIAN MISSILE UNIT", "body_text": " **********Israeli warplanes destroyed another Syrian ground-to-air mobile missile launcher today in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, the military command here reported. **********The command also disclosed that three Israeli soldiers were killed in what it described as a guerrilla ambush in the same region on Friday. **********A Government source said today after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem that Israel would not tolerate a war of attrition with Syrian and Palestinian forces in Lebanon.

Citibank protects itself by holding the customer's other accounts as collateral until the deposited checks clear. **********There would be no problem as long as all checks deposited eventually cleared satisfactorily.

Argentine officials said the brigadier is one of a half-dozen officials in the second tier of authority, just below the ruling three-man junta. **********Asked about the meeting last week, Mrs. Kirkpatrick said the two largely discussed what the United Nations might do to end the crisis. She said that the brigadier was one of 15 or 20 Latin American officials with whom she met. **********''I've spoken a great deal of Spanish in the past week,'' she said. ''I've done a lot of listening and reporting to the State Department.'' U.S.-Latin Ties at Issue **********Mrs. Kirkpatrick is known to favor a more neutral stance between Britain and Argentina to arrest the deterioriating relations between the United States and the southern hemisphere. She is the author of a book on the Argentina of Juan Domingo Peron and is a specialist in Latin American politics. **********Newsweek magazine, first to disclose the quarrel, said that Mr.  Haig and Mrs. Kirkpatrick traded angry words for 45 minutes. Mr. Haig was said to have accused Mrs. Kirkpatrick of interfering with his handling of foreign affairs and to have said her links to Latin Americans clouded her view of the Falklands. **********Mrs. Kirkpatrick reportedly retorted that Mr. Haig was surrounded by pro-British aides and could not understand Latin American feelings. **********The United Nations delegate said today: ''There has been a big debate in our Government. This is an agonizing issue. There are powerful arguments for remaining neutral and for tilting to Britain.  I have leaned to the neutral side.'' **********She added, ''There aren't very many people in our Government who take an interest in Latin America.'' The State Department would not comment on the exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/19/business/bank-south-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK SOUTH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BANK SOUTH CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/22/business/tylenol-reappearing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tylenol Reappearing", "print_headline": "Tylenol Reappearing", "body_text": " **********Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules will be back on some store shelves by the end of the week in tamperresistant packaging, and Johnson & Johnson is hoping to lure back customers with 80 million coupons worth $2.50 each.

Mr. Blackshear and his deputies, who organize creditors' committees to oversee corporate reorganizations, gave the attorneys two more weeks to decide if they wanted to form such a group for Lombard-Wall. Filing Made Aug. 12 **********Lombard-Wall and its subsidiary, Lombard-Wall Money Markets, filed for protection from creditors Aug. 12 under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act after the Bankers Trust Company expressed concern about the companies' financial condition and stopped clearing their transactions. **********In its initial court filing, Lombard-Wall said its 10 largest unsecured creditors held unsecured debts of $177.2 million. The Dormitory Authority, which raises money in the tax-free bond market for public and private institutions in the state, was listed as the largest unsecured creditor, with $52 million in unsecured debt and an additional $250 million of secured debt. **********On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service suspended its ratings on issues sold in recent years by the authority for six New York hospitals. The authority had invested with Lombard-Wall the hospitals' funds that were not immediately needed for construction. **********Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it decided against changing any ratings after discussing the situation with Lombard-Wall and reviewing the progress it had made in liquidating securities. **********Much of Lombard-Wall's business was in repurchase agreements, in which the company borrowed money and put up securities as collateral. Lombard-Wall was also involved in reverse repurchase agreements, in which it lent money and held securities as collateral. **********The idea was to profit by lending out funds or securities at a higher interest rate than they were borrowed. Falling Rates Brighten Picture **********Several of the more than 50 lawyers at yesterday's meeting said they were uncertain just how much of the creditors' debt was unsecured. One reason was that falling interest rates had increased the value of securities being held as collateral. **********Many of the attorneys also indicated that they were trying to negotiate a settlement with Lombard-Wall. The firm obtained a temporary restraining order last week, forbidding creditors from selling collateral. However, it has reached agreements with several of the largest creditors, allowing them to sell securities, recoup their money and turn over a profit to Lombard-Wall. **********Yesterday, Federal Bankruptcy Judge Edward J. Ryan signed three more agreements, permitting the Bucks County Bank and Trust Company, of Quakertown, Pa., to recover $10.1 million invested for the Bucks County Industrial Development Authority; Ashland Oil Inc., of Ashland, Ky., to recover $7.2 million, and the Merchants National Bank, of Topeka, Kan., to recover $876,000. **********Judge Ryan is scheduled to hold a hearing Monday morning on whether other firms acted improperly by selling securities they were holding as collateral. At issue is whether Lombard or the firm from which it borrowed money owned the securities. **********In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that Edward J. Geng, senior vice president of the Baer American Banking Corporation, was named to the newly created post of senior vice president in charge of government securities surveillance. The Fed set up an informal surveillance unit after the failure in May of Drysdale Government Securities.

There is a rule of thumb in the auto industry that a 10 percent increase in aerodynamic efficiency yields a 3 to 4 percent increase in overall fuel economy. **********Such an improvement is all the more attractive since it is essentially free, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to produce more efficient engines or lighter structures. ''A car's got to have that sheet metal, so I can make a signifigant contribution if I can find a way to bend it more efficiently,'' says Jack Telnack, the chief design executive for the Ford Motor Company's North American operations. **********This emphasis on slippery shapes is changing the way new cars are designed. Engineers in Detroit who once demanded ever more powerful engines and stylists whose favorite color was chrome now spend hours huddled at wind tunnels, seeking the sleekest shape and surface. Drag coefficients have replaced horsepower ratings -and, to some extent, even mileage ratings - as symbols of technological achievement. **********Drag coefficients are determined in a wind tunnel. Each wheel of a car sits on a sensitive scale that measures the change in forces as wind speed increases. The coefficient is the force divided by the frontal area of the car and adjusted for the density and velocity of the air. **********The drag coefficient is expressed as a decimal, with 1 defined as a flat plate facing the air stream. In the cheap energy era of the 1960's and early 1970's, most American cars had drag coefficients in the range from high 0.5 to low 0.6. Today's cars average about 0.45, according to design engineers at the General Motors Corporation. Some new models, including G.M.'s new Pontiac Firebird, are in the low 0.3 area. A few experimental models have gotten down to 0.22. **********When G.M. engineers placed a sleek experimental fiberglass body on one of its ''X'' cars, the drag coefficient dropped from 0.45 for the production model to 0.285, and highway mileage increased by 15 miles a gallon. **********The basic idea of aerodynamic automobile design is to make the air flow as smoothly as possible along the surface of the car without touching off drag-inducing turbulence. As a result, the wedge shape - characterized by a low, sloping front hood and a high, bluff rear end - is becoming more common. Although old-time ''streamlining'' usually included a tapered back, designers say it is better to make a clean break with the air. Engineers say they expect more fastback designs, replacing the traditional ''three-box'' layout of distinct hood, roof and rear deck. **********Other modifications for new car models include flush side molding, window glass bonded to the body, and wheels and wheel covers in line with the side of the body to minimize turbulence. **********In fact, the quest for a smooth airflow may bring back fender skirts, a style feature of the 1950's. An innovation will be found on the redesigned 1983 Ford Thunderbird, which will have the traditional drip rails along the roof line concealed by extending the doors into the roof. **********Air management under the car is getting attention too. Some designs now include an air dam to divert most of the air stream away from engine and suspension components, while others are exploring partly or completely enclosed undersides. **********Aerodynamic automobile design remains something of a black art for various reasons. Since air is invisible, for instance, it is hard for engineers to determine exactly how it is flowing over their models.  And computer-aided design, which has revolutionized the planning of many other automobile components, has not yet been able to deal with the complex movement of air over a car. **********''In some ways it's easier to do an airplane,'' said Charles H.  Torner, an executive engineer at G.M.'s Technical Center in Warren, Mich. ''Aircraft shapes tend to be simpler, and you have a free flow of air on all sides. A car has fenders, bumpers, headlights and other protrusions as well as the interaction with the road surface.'' **********To make things harder, designers cannot be sure the results they get with the one-third-size models used in wind tunnel tests will be reproduced in full-size cars. For this reason, G.M. recently spent $25 million to build a wind tunnel at its Technical Center to conduct full-size testing. **********In the 1930's the Chrysler Corporation introduced its ''Airflow'' models. They were hailed as a technical success, but they looked too different from other cars to become popular and were dropped after a few years. Citroen has been making aerodynamically efficient cars for decades, but they have not been a big sales success outside France. **********Now, however, designers are counting on higher mileage to overcome consumers' resistance to radical-looking automobiles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/25/business/advertising-addenda.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Addenda", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Addenda", "body_text": " *********** Needham & Grohmann Inc. has opened a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office called Needham & Grohmann/Southern division. *********** G.M.

America's economic problems were the dominant issue - the only issue - in the landslide Presidential victory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The economy was in collapse and F.D.R. had pledged to create jobs for the nation's 12 million unemployed - while somehow managing to balance the Federal budget. Little did he know then that eventually he would embrace the radical ideas of a Briton named John Maynard Keynes, who advocated huge deficit spending to bring the United States out of its depression. **********Now it is election day, 1982. The shattered economy is once again the dominant issue of a national political campaign. Unemployment is at 10.1 percent, not the 24 percent of Roosevelt's era - thanks in large part to the adoption since then of Keynesian policies to cushion an economic decline. Still, hopes for recovery keep moving further into the future, notwithstanding the President's insistence on the campaign trail this fall that his policies will soon restore the economy to buoyant, noninflationary growth. **********There are some who share this belief, who think the economy's vitality can be restored by shrinking the relative size of Government and lowering tax rates. And there are others who, doubting this, still think that Keynesian policies remain the basic solution to the nation's economic problems, with some minor modifications to avoid a revival of inflation. **********But there is a third, emergent group of analysts - at the frontiers of economic thinking - that believes neither Lord Keynes nor President Reagan has provided the answers to the stagnation that has plagued the American economy for a decade or so. This group has no grand theory and no grand theorist to lead it - at least not yet.  It's an odd assortment of bankers, businessmen and politicians, of Nobel-prize winning economists and those of less distinction. They share a conviction that President Reagan or a president after him will need to do what F.D.R. did a half century ago: develop a new set of policies to meet a new economic crisis, one of stagnation and potentially explosive inflation rather than spiraling depression. **********EVEN so distinquished a Keynesian as Paul A. Samuelson fears that traditional policies will no longer be enough. They may spur the United States economy out of recession, said the Nobel Laureate, but they will not propel it very far along the elusive path of healthy growth. **********''If the world did what it ought to do and engineered a real recovery, the structural problems would still remain,'' said Professor Samuelson, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''They would not just go away. If we go on with business as usual, what we will have is more of the stop-and-go driving, more stagnation.'' **********To such thinkers the perils of Pittsburgh and Detroit, the ascendancy of Japan and Germany and the paltry growth of productivity in the United States during recent years, are a telling history.  Though their views may differ in detail, these analysts see recent history as proof that many of America's economic policies and institutions - its free-wheeling labor settlements, its catagorical income support programs, its jumble of policies affecting business and industry - are outmoded. These so-called ''structuralists'' think such problems threaten the very heart of the American economic system and the growing affluence that so many Americans have come to regard as their birthright. **********''The problem now is that we have structural impediments in the economy that make any macroeconomic policy insufficient,'' said Robert Reich, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  ''When you have only 69 percent of capacity being used, 10 percent unemployment, a crumbling infrastructure, a labor force becoming steadily demoralized, to me these are not signs of an economy that is adjusting.'' **********For Mr. Reich, what's needed is a more coherent Government approach to industry. For others, like Bennett Harrison of M.I.T and Barry Bluestone of Boston College, the fundamental need is for changes in the adversarial relations of business and labor. To Felix Rohatyn, a partner at the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres & Company, a new financing mechanism to help direct money to select industries is critical. And still others, like Mr. Samuelson, worry about excessive wages in some basic industries, but see no easy way to bring them in line. **********''I don't have a nice program that is so obviously correct that it is bound to command approval,'' Mr. Samuelson said.  The structuralists offer no simple, singular explanation for the slowing of productivity and growth - but, again, their focus is generally on programs and institutions. Mr. Samuelson thinks a key factor is the demise of the work ethic, a deterioration fostered by affluence and by a host of well-meaning, but excessive income support programs. He and others also brood about the tendency of wages in this country to go up, but not down, ultimately pricing American labor - and its products - out of many highly competitive international markets. **********IN interviews and in their new book, ''The Deindustrialization of America,'' Mr. Bluestone and Mr. Harrison describe the problem as a breakdown of communications between labor and management compounded by the mobility of capital that has led to what they call corporate disinvestment in the United States. American corporations, they note, have found it easier to flee the United States for lower-wage countries, rather than develop new products and processes to provide profitable work for American workers. Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith agrees, blaming the problem on the ''sclerosis'' of corporate management. **********And Robert Zevin, a senior vice president and economist with the United States Trust Company in Boston, points to a kind of technological turning point the United States reached in the mid-1960's. ''Up until then, every new plant was bigger, more fuel efficient, more labor efficient, and real prices and unit prices went down,'' he says. This, combined with the inflationary bias of Keynesian policies, Mr. Zevin says, has hurt.'' **********At this stage, the structuralists' solutions to the nation's problems are diverse - and murky. In part, this may be inevitable because the problems that concern them are basically institutional and as such are not matters that modern economists, skilled in data handling and computer analysis, handle most readily. Mr. Reich, a lawyer and political scientist himself, puts it this way: ''Macroeconomists are not interested in or knowledgable about institutions since they haven't studied them. Their reference is economic aggregates. What we're talking about is a new discipline that is not antithetical to economics, but that looks at different issues.'' **********Mr. Reich, who has emerged as a popular adviser this year to socalled neo-liberal Democratic politicians, thinks the United States must make existing institutions, including labor unions and businesses, more amenable to change. Organized labor,'' he thinks, ''could be a terrific vehicle for change if it embraced training, relocation and other programs that could foster change.'' **********Another critical component of the Reich strategy calls for an overhaul of Government policies to encourage business modernization, rather than inhibit it. He notes that Government policies such as antitrust rules, tariffs, quotas, loan guarantees and price supports already shape how business operates, but without any coherent theme. **********Mr. Harrison and his research partner Mr. Bluestone are even less specific about an agenda, although their main concern is that labor not be decimated in the process. Mr. Harrison notes that for decades, there has been a ''social contract'' between business and labor: ''Labor would come to the bargaining table every two to three years to get new wages that would reflect gains in productivity and inflation. Business agreed to share because it bought them industrial peace.'' **********But, as he notes, ''that system - the industrial relations of a growth era -is clearly breaking down in this new era of shrinkage.'' For this reason, these analysts endorse some form of industrial planning. ''It may be true that an incredible recession will force real wages down to the point where it will be profitable to hire workers again,'' Mr. Bluestone said. ''But in the meantime, the costs of that are immense. The whole idea behind industrial planning is that you can shorten the time periods so that the economy moves more quickly and more directly and with less cost.'' **********SOME skeptics question whether any form of Government planning can work as well as the free market. Planning advocates, however, generally point to Japan and Germany as examples where a loose form of Government intervention appears to have benefited industry and the country as a whole. As Mr. Bluestone notes: ''We and most people in Europe believe it is possible to have an industrial policy with an ingredient of forward planning that does work.'' **********Even on Wall Street, the alleged heart of the capitalism, Mr.  Rohatyn sees a role for more direction from the top - at least for a while. ''The Government has to lean against the wind to keep imbalances from getting out of hand,'' he says. ''These may be regional differentials, social inequities, racial inequities, or budgetary problems, but the market is not necessarily a balancing force. It may be destabilizing,'' he says, echoing Lord Keynes' rationale for deficit spending enunciated decades ago. ''This does@n't mean I am for a planned economy,'' he adds. ''But in certain areas, at certain times, it is necessary for the Government to intervene.'' **********Recalling his experience during the New York City financial crisis in the mid-1970's, and the problems in dealing with the various factions - labor, business, government, the public -Mr. Rohatyn also points out the need for some kind of mechanism that will permit various groups to make unpalatable decisions, such as postponing pay increases or cutting services. **********''We're like a ship that has accumulated barnacles for the last 25 years,'' Mr. Rohatyn comments. ''Management has not been alert.  Labor is asking too much. Now we have to pay for it by restructuring, or rolling back. And it is very difficult to roll back gains in a democracy without setting up some kind of bargaining structure.'' **********Thinking along these structuralist lines is, of course, still resisted by many. Francis M. Bator, a professor of political economy at Harvard University, argues that an overvalued dollar is the main problem behind America's problems in foreign markets. He also thinks that traditional Keynesian stimulus would go far to help boost the economy's prospects. ''A lot of the secular problems people are talking about are really just symptoms of very deep business cycle problems,'' he says. '' If we fixed macroeconomics properly all these structural problems would drop down to third order of magnitude problems.'' **********As for the White House, it is still betting that an imminent recovery will put enormous structural problems to rest. The Administration's bow to structuralism is embedded in the ''supplyside'' tax cut of 1981 and in its continuing effort to reduce regulation and enhance the power of the market wherever possible. **********To the true structuralists, however, this optimism is reminiscent of the early days of the Roosevelt era, when atavistic policies proved no match for the problems of the day. It took F.D.R. years to abandon his budget balancing rhetoric and to adopt wholeheartedly the ideas of Lord Keynes. Even then, it was the rise of Hitler, not purely economic insight. that finally led the country back to full employment and growth. THE EVOLUTION OF F.D.R.'S ECONOMICS **********The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands, bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another.  But above all, try something.  May 22, 1932 **********Government, like any family, can for a year spend a little more than it earns. But you and I know that a continuance of that habit means the poorhouse.

We believe, however, that steps like these which we have taken and are taking will at least greatly cushion depression - will prevent the up-curve from rushing to a violent, mad peak of false prosperity and prevent another violent, mad descent into another sink of suffering and disillusionment like the one from which for the last three-and-ahalf years we have been surely emerging. April 13, 1936 **********To balance our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a crime against the American people.

This simply is not true. **********Keene Corporation and some other companies never mined or manufactured asbestos - as the Manville Corporation did and still does - but purchased it from mining companies as well as from the United States Government. **********Keene Corporation was formed in 1967, and in 1968 purchased the stock of Baldwin-Erhet-Hill, a small fabricator of thermal insulation products, some of which contained small amounts of asbestos. Had Keene been aware of an asbestos hazard, it never would have purchased Baldwin. When reports of a hazard to insulation workers were confirmed, Baldwin labeled its asbestos-containing products as potentially harmful and at the same time started to remove the fiber from these products. By the end of 1972, less than four years after the acquisition, the use of asbestos was discontinued. Despite its limited involvement through Baldwin, Keene has faced more than 14,000 legal suits, the cost of which far exceeds the profits earned by or the price Keene paid for the company. **********Keene was drawn into these asbestos cases because asbestos supplied by others was used in Baldwin's thermal insulation products. Those suppliers were substantially larger than Baldwin and had research departments, medical staffs and superior knowledge concerning asbestos and its hazards. How could Baldwin be drawn into the asbestos cases? In an attempt to cut its own losses, Manville brought Keene and other customers into the initial cases, knowing that all of the companies in the chain of distribution jointly could be held legally liable regardless of fault. **********And what about the Government's responsibility? While some tend to underplay it, the role of the United States Government in this mess simply cannot be ignored. The United States Government established military specifications requiring the use of asbestos, established ''safe level'' workplace standards for Government-owned and contract shipyards and then failed to enforce these standards, stockpiled and sold raw asbestos to the ''asbestos industry'' and in 1945 issued a Public Health Service report which erroneously concluded that insulation workers were not at risk. Almost half of the cases against Keene have been brought by former employees of Government-owned or controlled shipyards. **********Moreover, it appears that the United States Government is reaping positive financial rewards from this litigation. Federal Government employees receive compensation through the Federal Employees Compensation Act (F.E.C.A). If a former Government employee sues Keene and recovers, a part of the recovery is then ''recouped'' by the Government to make up for the F.E.C.A. payments made to the employee. **********Keene is in the unique position of being the only company which fought for and obtained real insurance coverage. After a four-year legal battle that went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, Keene gained a Federal court decision requiring its primary insurance carriers to pay for essentially all of Keene's asbestos litigation expenses up to the limits of the policies. **********However, the magnitude of the asbestos situation indicates that the nation faces a major societal problem that cannot be solved in the courts - a problem that compensates lawyers handsomely and shortchanges those who are truly injured. Experience indicates that of every dollar spent on asbestos litigation, about 70 cents goes to lawyers, 15 cents to insurance companies and only 15 cents to those claiming an injury. **********Even though Keene is in the position of having significant insurance coverage, other companies - no matter what type of product they produce -may not find such protection in the future. Companies in almost any industry could face a crushing array of product liability claims that will have to be handled through a system of compensation in which everyone but lawyers is a loser. **********The pertinent question is how to compensate injured workers. Keene has and will continue to ask Congress, the ''asbestos industry,'' the insurance industry and others to work towards a solution to that question. **********Bankruptcies and lawsuits are not the answer.

The study was the 10th annual survey on executive compensation conducted for the Financial Executives Institute by Arthur Young & Company. It was based on an analysis of pay of executives in more than 1,600 companies in 27 industries and in all seven regions of the United States. **********The highest-paid executives last year were those in the chemical industry, earning an average total compensation of about $190,319.

By the mid-1970's, in the hope the cells would gain an important role in generating electricity for homes and businesses, the utility industry had invested $150 million to design and test 65 of the devices at apartment buildings, offices and factories. **********Despite that investment, fuel cells are far from widespread. But many utility executives remain convinced that the devices can lessen their dependence on huge, centrally situated power plants. That potential will be tested at 50 sites across the country during the next 18 months. **********One of these sites is Manhattan, where the Consolidated Edison Company will begin using a relatively large, fuel-cell power plant next to its East River generating station. The utility said it expected the plant, which is designed to generate 4.8 megawatts of power, or enough electricity for 2,000 customers, to be switched on in early 1982 after three years of construction, long delays and an investment of $80 million. **********In addition, 49 smaller devices will be used to provide electricity to residential buildings, restaurants, banks and small factories in more than two dozen states. One these sites is Vernon, Conn., where a 40-kilowatt cell housed in a nine-foot-long green cabinet will be switched on today at the Southern New England Telephone Company's Rockville Central office building. **********The cell in Vernon is designed to provide power for the telephone company's electric switching equipment. The device ''looks like an elegant Dumpster,'' said Emmanuel Ford, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, which is in charge of the project. He added that it ''promises to be very, very efficient.'' **********A fuel cell resembles a large battery that can be constantly recharged. A component of the device converts a conventional fuel, most commonly natural gas, into hydrogen. The hydrogen is used to bathe one of the electrodes in the cell, which in turn shoots a current of electrons to another electrode, generating power. Thus, a cell does not use internal combustion, and does not emit pollutants.  Nor does it have moving parts, so it is quiet. **********More important, engineers believe that the cells being demonstrated will prove far more fuel-efficient than conventional power plants. In addition to electricity, the chemical reaction that takes place produces heat and water. With cells adjacent to buildings, the heat can supplement or replace conventional heating systems. In Vernon, for example, Mr. Ford said the fuel cell might satisfy most of the heating requirements of the office building. **********The smaller cells now entering tests, which are made by the United Technologies Corporation, all provide 40 kilowatts of power. The cells tested in the mid-1970's generated about one-third of this, and did not have the heat recovery capacity of the new devices. **********The earlier equipment ''was of symbolic value, but didn't have the features needed for commercial applications,'' said William Podolny, vice president and general manager for fuel cell operations at United Technologies. The newer devices ''move very close to what is required'' for commercial use, he said, adding that if the tests were successful, marketing the cells for commercial power generation could begin by 1987. **********Development and testing of the cells would not be possible without huge investments by the Government and the utilities. The current program, for example, is being paid for by the Gas Research Institute, which is a trade organization for the natural gas industry, and by the Department of Energy and a group of 23 utilities. **********Critics of the program assert that the plentiful supplies of oil, which are expected to last for at least five years, make alternative fuels far less important than they were thought to be in the 1970's.  Even if the cells prove more efficient than conventional power plants, they maintain, utilities are not likely to invest heavily in radically different systems of power generation unless they are forced to by energy shortages. **********Continuing research and development, moreover, may be handicapped by lower levels of Federal funding for alternative-fuel projects.  The Department of Energy has spent more than $30 million in each of the past two years on fuel-cell projects, but the Reagan Administration has recommended that funds for the current fiscal year be cut to below $10 million. **********The utiltities industry, however, ''sees promising potential that fuel cells will relieve some of the pressure'' to build conventional coal or nuclear plants, said Lelan F. Sillin, Jr., chairman of Northeast Utilities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/business/kelly-services-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KELLY SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "KELLY SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/world/hazards-of-salvador-s-power-struggle-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 954, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "HAZARDS OF SALVADOR'S POWER STRUGGLE; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********What appears to be a struggle for political power in El Salvador between the center, represented by the Christian Democrats, and the right, represented by four conservative political parties, is something both far more complicated and possibly far more dangerous. **********There are at least five, and possibly six, major forces influencing the negotiations over who will lead the country's efforts to pull itself out of civil war and into some semblance of economic recovery. **********They are the Christian Democrats; their rightist opponents, who may make up two factions rather than a solid front; the Salvadoran armed forces; the leftist rebels, and the United States. Centrists' Situation Tenuous **********In a nation where fradulent elections, personal deal-making and military coups have been the traditional means of installing and removing governments, nearly every action involving democratic principles and political compromise is an experiment. **********The Christian Democrats are in a tenuous situation. Although they won a plurality of the popular vote cast in last month's elections for a Constituent Assembly and 24 of the 60 seats, they have been forced into a minority role by a coalition of the right. **********This has caused deep consternation not only among officials of the United States, but also in the Salvadoran military.  Reagan Administration officials, realizing the lack of support in Congress and among the American people for a military solution to El Salvador's leftist insurgency, had accepted the idea that a redistribution of wealth is critical in gaining the Salvadoran people's backing in the struggle against the left. Rightists Disturb the U.S. **********They were therefore distressed when the Christian Democrats, the party most likely to continue that type of change, failed to garner a majority in last month's voting for the Constituent Assembly, which will elect a President and schedule election. **********And they were even more disturbed by the coalition among the rightwing parties, some of whose candidates ran on a platform of dismantling the changes already enacted and others of whom have been closely tied to the random violence and killings that are euphemistically referred to as human rights violations. **********A Government controlled by these factions, Administration officials fear, would be unable to retain the Congressional support necessary to obtain further military and economic aid, giving the leftist rebels an additional advantage. **********That message has been impressed repeatedly on the politicians and the military since the elections, but the military - which was unencumbered by direct involvement in the immediate battle for political power - grasped it more quickly. **********When the military realized last week that the politicians' power struggle could undercut its own interests, it stepped in, virtually ordering the politicians - particularly those on the right - to come to terms on a moderate President to give the Government at least an appearance of balance. It was, said a leading rightist politician, ''an elegant coup.'' **********For while the military is conservative, the rightists of the Nationalist Republican Alliance headed by Roberto d'Aubusson's are decidedly more so, and there is considerable personal animosity between officials of the two sides. There is, as well, a constituency of junior military officers with relatively progressive views, and military leaders know they must satisfy them as well. **********No one is saying publicly what will happen if the military does not get what it wants, or if the power of a moderate President, if one is indeed elected, is undercut by the the rightists in the Constituent Assembly. In putting together the Assembly's charter last night, the rightists showed some restraint in assigning themselves power, but not nearly as much as the Christian Democrats had wanted. **********There have been many rumors of a possible military coup in recent days, leading the politicians to be extremely cautious in their public reactions. **********Among them, Mr. d'Aubuisson, who has been chosen head of the Assembly, has been the least guarded, at least toward the military.  For the moment, it appears he is betting that the United States has too much invested in its promotion of democracy here to allow it to be shattered by a military coup. His blistering attack Monday on Jaime Abdul Gutierrez, a top military leader and member of the ruling junta, for exerting pressure on the parties' presidential deliberations was an indication of that. **********At the same time, Mr. d'Aubuisson has been extremely careful of late in his statements about the United States. But several officials - Salvadoran and foreign - believe the rightist leader's response may have had a substantial element of ''shoot the messenger'' and was as much a condemnation of American intervention as of military pressure. **********One clue to El Salvador's future will come with the selection of a President. The United States, as well as the military, are hoping that the rightist coalition will split, at least on this issue, and that the conservative National Conciliation Party - which worked with the military in its two decades of power -will join the Christian Democrats in selecting a moderate for the post. **********A remaining mystery, however, is the power of the left. The guerrillas have recently been conducting only sporadic battles in the countryside and have been relatively inactive in San Salvador, but that could change quickly and dramatically. Rebel radio stations have been telling the public to prepare for a major offensive beginning this weekend. And Christian Democratic leaders are warning that if they are excluded from the legitimate centers of democratic power, support of the left by the political center could substantially increase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/24/business/burlington-s-bid-called-inadequate-by-el-paso-s-board.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1982-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BURLINGTON'S BID CALLED INADEQUATE BY EL PASO'S BOARD", "print_headline": "BURLINGTON'S BID CALLED INADEQUATE BY EL PASO'S BOARD", "body_text": " **********The El Paso Company said yesterday that its board of directors had found the $24-a-share offer by Burlington Northern Inc. for just over half of the energy company to be inadequate and not in the best interest of its shareholders. **********At its meeting yesterday the nine-member board also voted unanimously to provide an incentive for its 98,000 shareholders to hold on to their shares, authorizing a dividend of one share of a new series of 8 percent cumulative convertible stock for every 20 shares of outstanding common stock. **********The company said that the preferred stock would have a stated value of $25 a share and that each share would be immediately convertible on a share-for-share basis into El Paso common stock.

No campaign would be considered complete without a candidate or his aides standing on a car top after mass and roaring the benefits of the party at a readymade audience. **********A few of the leaflet-carriers on this night had been up before dawn, and this was the sixth mass of the day they had worked. Besides being chilled to the bone, they were weary, maybe a little cross, and like everyone else in Ireland they were less than certain about how Wednesday's national election was going to turn out. Election 'Too Close to Call' **********''Too close to call,'' said the man from Fianna Fail, the party of Prime Minister Charles J.  Haughey.  ''Aye,'' said a worker hunched in a blue wool overcoat and clutching a sheaf of papers that trumpeted the greater glory of the Fine Gael party and its leader, Dr. Garret FitzGerald. ''This one's going right down to the tape.'' **********It was a fleeting moment of rare agreement between two old political camps that have held fierce allegiances that can be traced to the Easter Rising in 1916. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are nearly indistinguishable in philosophy - in any other northern European nation they would be considered Christian Democrats - but loyalties have been passed inside families from generation to generation like fine Waterford crystal and far more durable. But on this night there seemed to be no pleasure in it. **********Most of Ireland seems thankful that the third national election campaign in 18 months is coming to a close. Mr. Haughey, whose Government collapsed three weeks ago when it failed to win a confidence vote, has squared off against Dr. FitzGerald for the third time since June of 198l. Mr. Haughey lost that first match but came back to win last February. The Irish public, which is reputed never to get its fill of politics, seems ready now to swear off the binge. Greater Instability Feared **********There are fears, however, that a crumbling economy, high unemployment and no prospects of relief can lead to even greater political and social instability. Contributing to this anxiety is recognition that the Irish political system, so encrusted with tradition and personalities, has failed in a year and a half of revolving-door governments to produce new faces or new solutions. **********''Up until recently the perception was that domestic governments could do a lot to control their economies,'' said Michael Gallagher, professor of political science at Trinity College in Dublin. ''In Ireland governments have learned that employment is outside the scope of Irish governments.'' For the first time in anyone's memory, he noted, no major party candidate is making promises about good times being around the corner. Instead, they are preaching austerity and cutbacks. **********However, many voters do not expect the new realism to daunt the ways in which Irish politicians have used party loyalty and tradition as substitutes for new directions and bold thoughts. This attitude seemed summed up in the quick moves of Aoibheann O'Keeffe when she was one of the first to leave Our Lady of Refuge at the conclusion of the service. **********''That's the message from your Fianna Fail candidates,'' said a campaign worker, pushing the literature at her like playing cards fanned out in his hand. **********Mrs. O'Keeffe dodged his offer with flashing eyes.  ''And what is the message?'' she inquired sharply, her head angled with suspicion.  ''Charlie Haughey will keep the country moving,'' the man said, his confidence slipping under her glare.  ''Oh, backwards is it?'' Mrs. O'Keeffe rejoined, pushing past the man, who turned to search for more receptive faces in the crowd.  What both parties fear is that neither will be able to gain a majority of seats in the election. This would set up another round of negotiations in the Parliment for either Mr. Haughey or Dr.  FitzGerald to form a coalition with one of the minority left-wing parties. But it was exactly this kind of unstable coalition that led to the collapse of the last two governments as the leftists refused to support austerity programs. **********Another impotent Parliament could force yet another election next year, a prospect so depressing to the Irish that it brings fury into the voice and eyes of voters like Mrs. O'Keeffe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/23/business/patents-new-tube-brightens-tv-colors.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1982-01-23", "snippet": "WASHINGTON A TELEVISION picture tube invented by scientists at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J., is expected to display much brighter colors and requi re less electric power.\n\nPatent 4,311,944 was granted this week for the improved cathode ray ...", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;\nNew Tube Brightens TV Colors", "print_headline": "Patents;\nNew Tube Brightens TV Colors", "body_text": " **********WASHINGTON A TELEVISION picture tube invented by scientists at RCA Laboratories in Princeton, N.J., is expected to display much brighter colors and requi re less electric power. **********Patent 4,311,944 was granted this week for the improved cathode ray tube to Stanley Bloom, a member of the technical staff, and Carmen A.

On Friday Mr.  Tanaka told a group of his supporters at the hot springs resort of Hakone in the mountains southwest of here that he endorsed Mr. Suzuki for another two-year term as the head of the party. **********Mr. Suzuki has served ''most faithfully and successfully'' as Prime Minister since 1980, Mr. Tanaka said.  The president of the governing party is almost automatically the head of the Government because the Liberal Democratic Party has majorities in both houses of Parliament and therefore can name its own candidate without consulting the weak opposition groups. A decision by the party to give Mr. Suzuki another term as its president would mean that he would continue to serve as head of government, with no further action in Parliament required. **********Nihon Keizai, a financial newspaper regarded as well informed on conservative politics, said that the party's plans called for a vote about Oct. 20 by the 421 Liberal Democratic members of the two houses of Parliament. **********The paper envisages a scenario under which Mr. Tanaka puts the decision before the party in an ebullient power play.  ''The Suzuki and Tanaka factions are thinking of recommending Prime Minister Suzuki not just by 50 people, as prescribed in the party rules, but by more than 200 people at one stroke, when Suzuki registers his candidacy on Oct. 16,'' the paper said. **********The forecast illustrates the power in Mr. Tanaka's hands, despite the fact that he is facing criminal charges of having taken $2 million in bribes when he was Prime Minister in the early 1970's to influence Japanese airlines to buy Lockheed aircraft. A judgment in his case is expected late next year. **********Mr. Tanaka resigned from the Liberal Democratic Party when the charges were brought and now sits in the lower house as an independent. His strength rests on the 109 members of Parliament who acknowledge that they are his supporters. With these and Mr.  Suzuki's group, Mr. Tanaka has a ''battle corps,'' as the press calls it, of some 195 Members of Parliament, and he claims to control in secret at least 20 more members of some other intraparty groups. **********Control of Parliament itself is not at issue. The Liberal Democrats, with a major victory in the elections for both houses of Parliament in 1980 - the first time that elections for both houses had been held on the same day - has unexpectedly recovered its absolute majorities. It now has 287 members in the 511-seat lower house and 134 in the 252-member upper house. **********Mr. Tanaka, the strategist of this victory, is considering another double election next year, he said at Hakone this week. The election success of 1980 was important, officials here feel, because it paved the way for a sharp turn toward the right in Japanese politics. This could be reinforced if elections were held next year, because the opposition groups, especially the largest one, the Socialist Party, suffer from low morale, members said. **********''The public has given up on us,'' a leading Socialist legislator said recently. ''We just have to self-criticize.'' The opposition parties have notably failed to make an issue of the dominant role played in the governing party by Mr. Tanaka, a man facing serious criminal charges. Mr. Suzuki, a compromise candidate when he came to power, promised at that time to clean up politics but has failed to do so - to many officials, he seems putty in Mr.  Tanaka's hands - and yet he has also escaped serious criticism by the opposition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/02/world/around-the-world-a-soviet-activist-pleads-not-guilty.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Soviet Activist Pleads Not Guilty", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; A Soviet Activist Pleads Not Guilty", "body_text": " **********Ivan Kovalyov, on trial for his human rights activities, pleaded not guilty today to charges of agitating against the Soviet state, dissident sources said.

This is about 11 percent more than in the 1982 budget. **********On Tuesday Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang disclosed a belated five-year plan that incorporates a total budget deficit of 14.5 billion yuan, or $7.3 billion, from 1981 to 1985. Mr. Zhao said an effort would be made to keep the deficit below 3 billion yuan, or $1.5 billion, for the remaining years of the plan. Steady Upturn Predicted **********The deficit arose partly because of the retrenchment of the Chinese economy starting in 1979, when the leadership cut back its ambitious modernization program. It also reoriented production away from traditional heavy industry and toward light industry and consumer goods production. **********Today Mr. Wang said the decline in revenue was coming to a halt and a steady upturn would start next year.  Although this was evidence of improvement, Mr. Wang told China's nominal Parliament, ''the growth of revenues still cannot keep pace with the needs of economic and social development.'' **********''It is imperative to work doubly hard to keep a constant balance between revenue and expenditure and further improve the state financial situation,'' he said. **********The biggest drain on the Chinese budget has been the large array of subsidies for food, rent and other consumer needs, which now account for 30 percent of the Government's expenditures. The Chinese press has reported that these subsidies cost the state nearly 32 billion yuan, or $16 billion, last year. **********The New China News Agency, in circulating excerpts of Mr. Wang's report today, did not say whether he brought up the subsidies problem. Last week, in an article in the People's Daily, Mr. Wang said that the subsidies should be reduced gradually to 20 percent of total state expenditure. **********In his speech Tuesday, Prime Minister Zhao said that prices would be kept ''largely stable,'' suggesting that there were no immediate plans to overhaul the expensive subsidy program. **********Instead, the Government plans to raise additional revenue by collecting more taxes and imposing tougher controls on capital investment. A Change in the Tax System **********Today the New China News Agency reported on a further portion of Mr. Zhao's report, in which he said that the state would replace the customary delivery of profits from state-owned enterprises with tax payments to raise more revenue. The tax system would be changed to make this possible. **********Last summer the People's Daily disclosed that tax evasion was serious in China, with investigators uncovering violations that totaled 1.3 billion yuan, or $650 million, and 40,000 enterprises that paid no taxes at all. **********The New China News Agency also quoted Mr. Zhao as saying on Tuesday that China would strictly supervise the total volume of its investment to make sure there was enough money for energy, transport and the technical transformation of existing industries, three critical areas in China's industrialization drive. **********Mr. Zhao said that under new regulations all investments in fixed assets must now be incorporated into the state plan and that construction projects must comply with guidelines determining their scope beforehand. **********The Prime Minister was quoted as saying that since 1949 ''China has suffered several major setbacks in economic construction, all of which, apart from political reasons, could be attributed economically to the blind extension of capital construction.'' **********Mr. Zhou said that ''China cannot afford to, and must not, make such a mistake again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/17/business/diamond-plans-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Diamond Plans Sale", "print_headline": "Diamond Plans Sale", "body_text": " **********The Diamond International Corporation said it had agreed in principle to sell the assets of its packaging division, container division, paperboard division and graphic arts division to a subsidiary of the Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland, which is to enter into a joint venture with Clarke Enterprises of Chicago to make the purchase.

The negative side to all this, in Mr. Mitterrand's view, is that unmanaged technological development can also create destructive competition among the seven partners at Versailles. **********High technology defies precise definition, but its impact is undeniable. In mature industries, companies with access to high technology manufacturing devices, such as computerized machine tools and industrial robots, frequently prosper by producing higher quality products more efficiently while competitors with similar or even lower labor costs whither. **********More importantly, in terms of providing new jobs and long-term prosperity, new industries are spawned when technological advances are designed into marketable consumer and industrial products. 'Innovate or Evaporate' **********The situation has been summed up by American businessmen in the pithy motto, ''Innovate or evaporate.'' Mr. Mitterrand's proposal for increased government-sponsored research and a division of areas of concentration among the industrial nations elicited from President Reagan the contrary view that new technology development is best left to private enterprise.  However, many technology development experts, both within and outside of industry, think that the proponents of pure free enterprise will find themselves in an increasingly uncomfortable competitive position. **********''Technology nationalism is spreading,'' said William Summers, president of Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc.'s Technology Management Group at the Bethesda, Md., office of the international consulting firm. It shows up in a variety of subsidies, incentives and trade barriers that governments erect to stimulate new high technology industries. These policies are also used defensively to protect older industrial sectors that are strategically important or have failed to innovate fast enough to stand up to foreign competition. **********France and Japan are the two Versailles participants most committed to nationally planned technology development, and both have successes to show for it that have encouraged nations like Britain, West Germany, Italy and Canada to take tentative steps toward national technology planning. French Government's Role Cited **********Partly through control of nationalized companies and partly through incentives and subsidies, the French Government has played midwife to notable French advances in telecommunications, aerospace (despite the commercial failure of the supersonic Concorde) and rail transit. It has also become a world leader in nuclear technology. **********Japan has become known as Japan Inc. for its Government's success in organizing cooperative efforts among Japanese companies to meet nationally defined objectives for its key export industries. Most of these efforts have been directed toward refinement and practical application of basic electronics and manufacturing innovations made in the United States and Europe. **********In recent years, however, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry has underwritten programs aimed at producing significant home-grown innovations in basic technologies likely to have a major commercial impact in the future, such as biotechnology and photovoltaics. In addition to directing attention to key technologies, the Trade Ministry has focused Japanese research and development on promising materials, such as high performance ceramics. **********By contrast, the United States and, to a lesser extent, Britain, are regarded as the nations at Versailles most committed to private entrepeneurial selection of which technologies to develop. In both nations, the private approach is nurtured by government policies and the financial markets, which can quickly generate vast sums of venture capital for new concepts that excite investors. 'Energy' of Free Enterprise **********''It may be wasteful and it diffuses ability because people jump from one company to another, but it creates more energy,'' said Martin L. Ernst, senior vice president at Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. **********Many analysts caution that both the superficial similarities and differences in national technology policies can be misleading. For instance, while the central government plays a major role in setting technology priorities in both France and Japan, the Japanese system involves much more input from businessmen and brutal domestic competition. The result is that Japan is considered less likely to become bogged down in commercially impractical technology commitments than France. **********Nor is the United States so committed to the free enterprise approach as the Reagan Administration often professes. European analysts such as Juan Rada at the International Management Institute in Geneva note that the American Government exercises a major influence over technology development through its military spending. **********The high military-related component of American technology interests has helped create the nation's lead in crucial areas such as electronics, aerospace and materials science. But it is a mixed blessing, directing Government support and research talent away from areas with limited military applications, such as biotechnology. **********Moreover, according to Mr. Summers of Booz, Allen, America's competitive position is hurt by reliance on military-oriented companies and Government agencies to recognize the spinoff potential of their technologies. ''The big defense companies don't understand the needs of the industrial, commercial and consumer-oriented companies. It's an entirely different culture.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/business/sargent-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SARGENT INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "SARGENT INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/29/business/burlington-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 2", "print_headline": "BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/business/business-and-the-law-class-actions-a-new-phase.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1982-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 804, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and the Law; Class Actions: A New Phase", "print_headline": "Business and the Law; Class Actions: A New Phase", "body_text": " **********THE practice of law has its fashions. And since 1966, when new Federal rules of civil procedure were adopted, class action suits have been the rage. But fashions change, and if three recent cases are any indication, many judges are now reluctant to widen the scope of class actions any further. **********''I think we are entering a new phase,'' said Peter Gruenberger, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a New York law firm. ''Courts are beginning to look much more closely at the total impact of a class action.'' In recent months, he added, in cases involving an intrauterine device, Firestone tires and the collapse of an overhead walkway at the Kansas City Hyatt, ''judges have refused to certify classes I believe they would have allowed a few years ago.'' **********Originally, class actions were seen as a way to save judicial time and energy. Instead of each victim of a widespread fraud or disaster bringing a separate lawsuit, Rule 23 permitted all the victims to gather into one class to try their claims in one large legal action.  This saved the defendant from being dragged into courts all over the country and forced to defend the same question over and over, and helped the victims by eliminating the danger that the first one to get into court and win a judgment would use up all the defendant's resources. Class actions also made it possible for new kinds of victims, especially those whose individual damages do not amount to much, to take legal action. **********''When Rule 23 was drafted, I don't think anyone had a clear idea of its potential,'' said Judge Jack Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn. ''In price-fixing cases, mass disasters, prison cases, shareholder derivative suits and product liability suits, there may be no way to handle the problem effectively on an individual basis. Multinational corporations have effects on people who can't fight back unless they band together.'' **********Business has always disliked the class action system, perceiving, correctly, that it leads to more claims. But judges, particularly in the years of social change that followed the adoption of Rule 23, rapidly granted class treatment to everything from civil rights grievances to consumer claims. The rate of expansion dropped somewhat after a Supreme Court decision making class actions more costly to bring, but picked up again in recent years. Now, many judges have become reluctant to sanction further extension of class actions. **********''Judges are beginning to ask themselves whether the defendant's business can withstand a huge judgment, and whether the court can withstand the challenge of unraveling the laws of 50 states,'' Mr.  Gruenberger said. **********A good example of the tighter attitude toward such suits is provided by a decision earlier this year in which a judge refused to treat several claimants against the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company as representatives of a larger class. The case involved steel-belted radials that had been voluntarily recalled by Firestone following a 1978 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report of safety problems. **********Many tire owners who were injured by the radials had sued and won.  But the lawyers in the recent case wanted to create a class of nearly 14 million tire owners, none of whom had suffered any injury, but who merely claimed ''economic'' damages for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability on the tires. Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. of the Federal District Court in Manhattan refused. **********In the Hyatt situation, many of the victims of the skywalk collapse had already filed claims in a state court before the Federal class action was certified. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit refused to uphold the Federal class created by the lower court on the ground that it would interfere with pending state claims. **********In last month's Dalkon Shield case, too, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit would not uphold a nationwide class of women who claimed they were injured by the intrauterine device.  Since the women came from many different states with different legal standards, the court ruled, it would be difficult to decide whether this class was entitled to punitive damages from the manufacturer, the A.H. Robins Company. **********The appeals court also took apart a second class the lower court had certified - a class of California women who would jointly try the issue of Robins's liability - on the ground that the circumstances of each individual woman's injury could vary dramatically. **********''If there's any lesson to the three cases, it's that the expansion of class actions has probably leveled off,'' said Arthur Miller, a Harvard law professor and class action expert who was active in the Hyatt case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/business/metropolitan-life-purchase.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Metropolitan Life Purchase", "print_headline": "Metropolitan Life Purchase", "body_text": " **********The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said it had agreed to buy State Street Research and Management Company, a closely held investment management concern in Boston.

He said the corporation would try to sell four Government-owned corporations and its equity in a fifth to private businesses. **********In most of the cases, the Government had invested at a time when the companies were in difficulty and the Government wanted to preserve the jobs they represented. **********''This reorganization of Government assets is designed to enhance the commercial management of publicly owned assets and to facilitate privatization,'' declared Senator Austin. Jean Charpentier, chief spokesman for the Ministry of External affairs, called the move the first step toward ''a more businesslike administration'' of Government-owned companies.

The disclosure, which amounted to the imposition of a blockade, curtailed the time available for efforts to find a peaceful solution. **********(Argentina announced early Thursday that it had created a 200-mile defense zone off its shores and around the Falkland Islands in response to the British threat. Earlier, the Argentines extended their civil rule over the islands in a ceremony at Stanley, the capital, in which Gen. Mario Benjamin Menendez was inducted as governor of the Falkland, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands.  Page A12.) **********Submarine Reported in Area **********The British submarine Superb, a nuclear vessel of the hunter-killer type, was reported by military sources to have arrived off the Falklands, and several of her sister ships are believed to be on the way. **********Britain's policy, Mr. Nott told the Commons, ''will be meant to deny to Argentine forces on the Falklands the means to reinforce and resupply from the mainland.'' The minister said Argentine vessels entering the area, which he called a maritime exclusion zone, ''will be treated as hostile and are liable to be attacked by British forces.'' **********According to United States officials, the British Government is putting pressure on Washington to provide London with military intelligence and other support for the British flotilla that is heading for the Falklands, and Washington is concerned about the possible effects of its decision. (Page A10.) No Specific Action Mentioned **********Mr. Nott, in his speech to the Commons, left open the question of what action would be taken against vessels already inside the prohibited area. A large number of Argentine ships are thought to be lying in the harbor at Stanley, the main settlement of the islands, or just off the coast. **********Britain's new Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym, opened the debate in the House by declaring that Britain intended to force the Argentines out of the Falklands as soon as possible. ''We would much prefer a peaceful settlement,'' Mr. Pym said. ''We will do all we can to get one. But, if our efforts fail, the Argentine regime will know what to expect. Britain does not appease dictators.'' **********Making his first speech as Foreign Secretary in an atmosphere of crisis, Mr. Pym used unusually harsh language to describe the takeover. Bending over his text and speaking with earnest deliberation, he said that the islanders ''have become the victims of the unprincipled opportunism of a morally bankrupt regime.'' **********The members' benches were jammed as Mr. Pym, who was appointed Foreign Secretary following the resignation of Lord Carrington Monday, began his address. **********He made no mention of President Reagan's decision to send Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to Britain and Argentina this week on a peace-making trip. The Foreign Office said later that the Government ''warmly welcomes'' the decision and the opportunity to talk about ways in which the United States ''might most effectively support our efforts to secure Argentine withdrawal.'' **********That was an indirect way of making clear Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determination not to negotiate with Argentina, either directly or through third parties, until it pulls its troops out - a position confirmed at a meeting of the Cabinet this morning. Despite a hint from the Argentine Interior Minister, Gen. Alfredo St. Jean, that a withdrawal might under some circumstances be discussed, the Cabinet remained deeply gloomy about prospects of a settlement. Warships Heading for Islands **********Meanwhile, the British battle fleet sailed on toward the Falklands, where it is expected to arrive about April 23 after a voyage of almost 8,000 miles. Some reports said today that it would contain fewer than the 36 ships originally planned - perhaps as few as 20 - because of the need to keep ships in reserve in case the Government decides upon a blockade as the best means of regaining the islands. **********A key feature of the debate was an unsuccessful attempt by James Callaghan, Mrs. Thatcher's Labor Party predecessor, to pin her down as to precisely what Britain hoped to achieve if it succeeded in forcing the Argentine occupying force off the islands. **********In his speech, Mr. Pym said the Government intended to return them to British ''administration'' - the same phrase used by Mrs. Thatcher in the Commons on Saturday. But on Monday night, the Prime Minister promised to restore British ''sovereignty'' in the Falklands. Which word, Mr. Callaghan asked, was the right one? **********As he spoke, Mrs. Thatcher silently mouthed the word ''sovereignty.'' But when she rose to reply to him, she answered less directly, arguing that she believed that British sovereignty remained in force. **********The question arose because many Members of Parliament believe the Government might be hoping to work out a deal, similar to one that fell through in 1981, under which Britain would yield sovereignty in return for a lease of perhaps 25 years that would permit the continuation of British administration. Callaghan Charges 'Blunder' **********Mr. Callaghan, a former petty officer in the Royal Navy, accused the Prime Minister of ''a gross blunder'' in failing to take preventive action before the Argentine attack in the Falklands. As long ago as March 3, he recalled, Richard Luce, a junior Foreign Office minister who resigned along with Lord Carrington on Monday, had expressed ''deep anxiety'' about the situation developing in the South Atlantic. **********Both he and Denis Healey, the Labor spokesman on foreign policy, pledged support for the decision to dispatch the flotilla to the Falklands. But Mr. Healey said the opposition was offering ''no blank check'' in a situation that he said was full of ''appalling difficulties.'' The situation, he said, had been created by Government negligence in ''one of the most disgraceful episodes in British history.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/02/business/phillips-petroleum.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phillips Petroleum", "print_headline": "Phillips Petroleum", "body_text": " **********The Phillips Petroleum Company announced the sale of its Phillips Products Company subsidiary to Duraco Products Inc., a new company controlled principally by Phillips Products employees. **********Specific terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Cecil, a spokesman for Mesa, declined comment on the move, but sources said they suspected that Mesa, together with partners, had been on the verge of making a bid for Cities Service involving an estimated $1.8 billion in cash. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, where its shares did not begin trading until 45 minutes before the close, Cities Service advanced $1.50, to $37, in heavy volume. Mesa, halted at 1:21 P.M., ended the session at $16.75, up 75 cents, and 25 cents less than the Cities Service offer. Bid Viewed as Warning **********Some professionals regarded the offer for Mesa as low and meant more as a warning not to move against Cities Service. Last year, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company headed a group that granted Cities Service a $3.5 billion line of credit, a war chest now at $500 million but restorable. **********Commenting on the bid, Guy P. Wyser-Pratte, executive vice president of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., said, ''If Texaco comes into this, Cities Service will have to put away its pop gun.  Texaco would be like the U.S. cavalry coming to Mesa's rescue.'' **********T. Boone Pickens, chairman of Mesa, and John K. McKinley, chairman of Texaco, are friends. Analysts argued, however, that Texaco might not want to run the risk that the Mobil Corporation did when it was rebuffed on antitrust grounds in its bids for Conoco and Marathon. **********Wall Street sources said they had heard Mesa was preparing an offer for 51 percent of Cities Service at around $45 a share. Cities Service's pre-emptive move could change that, however. Mesa owns 4.1 million shares of Cities Service, or 5.2 percent. It is suing Cities Service on charges that it interfered with Mesa's earlier efforts to increase its stake. At that time, Mesa's partners were understood to be Louisiana Land and Freeport-McMoran. They withdrew when Cities Service threatened to take them over. **********Moreover, mindful that Federal Judge John J. Manos of Ohio twice refused to give Mobil clearance to buy Marathon, even when Amerada Hess agreed to buy Marathon's refining and marketing operations, these sources said that Mesa was understood to have lined up partners, possibly to buy pieces of Cities Service and thus avoid an antitrust challenge. **********These sources said the Southland Corporation of Dallas, which has some 7,000 7-Eleven stores, might join the group to get Cities Service's gas stations. The Damson Oil Corporation of New York was said to be interested in Cities Service's oil refineries but is now understood to be out of the group. The Madison Fund of New York is thought to be another potential partner. **********As envisioned by some Wall Street analysts, Mesa was expected to turn to Continental Illinois of Chicago and the Bank of Montreal to arrange part of the financing. The rest was expected to come from the partners, who supposedly would buy preferred stock in Mesa that would later be exchanged for Cities Service assets. **********Cities Service said its Wall Street advisers would be the First Boston Corporation and Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb.

He also replaced his aide, Kwon Jung Dahl, as secretary general of the ruling Democratic Justice Party with another former army officer, Kwon Ik Hyun, in another move to quell criticism of corruption in government. **********The resignations over a multimillion-dollar scandal in the money market, and the first calls on Mr. Chun to quit in his two years in power, have presented him with his gravest crisis.

His policies have failed.'' **********Mr. Chun is not expected to leave office, but the scandal appears to have damaged his reputation. For one thing, relatives of his wife, Lee Sun Ja, are involved. In addition, Mr. Kwon, who ran the ruling party for Mr. Chun, was friendly with some of those arrested in the scandal, according to prosecutors. **********Prosecutors, meanwhile, have presented a report on the financial scandal in the money market here that led to the arrests of two former bank presidents, a former deputy head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and his wife, an uncle of Mr. Chun and at least 14 other influential people. **********The report said Chang Yong Ja, a moneylender depicted as the key figure in the scandal, loaned $79 million in cash to six industrial companies in return for $361 million in bank-guaranteed promissory notes. She then sold more than half of the notes for cash in a 13-month period ending last April. **********The unorthodox transactions led to the bankruptcy of the Illshin Steel Company and several other medium-sized companies whose notes were sold by Mrs. Chang. In an effort to shore up the battered financial market here, the Government has injected large sums into the economy through banks. **********''The whole thing is acutely embarrassing,'' a Government official said.  There were three immediate reasons for the Government's embarrassment.  The scandal suggested that legal controls over the money market - the money market plays a central role in finance here because banks do not lend to anyone other than big customers - are defective and that the presidents of two banks helping Mrs. Chang with the guarantees were influenced by powerful people behind the scenes. **********Among those arrested were Mr. Chun's uncle by marriage, Lee Kyu Gwang, a retired general who headed a mining company. Mr. Lee, it emerged, is a brother in law of Mrs. Chang. **********Many Koreans say they feel that the revelations to date are only the tip of an iceberg of corruption in high places.  The scandal appears to strike at the policies dearest to Mr. Chun.  After he came to power as head of an army junta in May 1980, he announced what he called a ''purification campaign'' to ''root out'' corruption in government. **********Recently, aides said, Mr. Chun's goal has been to revive the flagging economy. In an effort to establish his rule, he tried to expand the once dynamic economy and cut inflation. But now, with the Government pumping funds into the economy to shore up the money market, efforts to control inflation are expected to go by the board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/29/business/washington-watch-a-six-month-capital-gain.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Cowan", "pub_date": "1982-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 963, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch; A Six-Month Capital Gain?", "print_headline": "Washington Watch; A Six-Month Capital Gain?", "body_text": " **********IF a couple of other tax matters can be resolved, Congress just might, in the special session that opens today, shorten the holding period for long-term capital gains to six months. Profits on an asset are now taxed as long-term capital gains only if it has been held for a year. **********The man who killed a six-month provision in a House-Senate conference in August, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is reported to be willing now to go along. One such report comes from Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association, with a membership including the big brokerage houses. Mr. O'Brien went to see the Chicago Democrat twice. He said he received ''some assurances'' after the conference and got ''strong encouragement'' in October. **********A second such impression is reported by a Senate aide who understands Mr. Rostenkowski gave an assurance to Bob Dole, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, during the conference. The Kansas Republican has been sponsoring a six-month provision since June. **********Mr. Rostenkowski does not say yes or no. He said that, if the Senate were to pass such legislation, ''I would be concerned with the vehicle.'' Translation: What other tax provisions are part of the bill? He also said he would be unwilling to go to conference, and to avoid one under House rules the Senate-passed bill would have to be adopted on the floor without objection - meaning a single member could block passage. **********To soften the opposition of House liberals, Mr. Dole had the Finance Committee attach the six-month bill to a House-passed measure that would relieve three California utilities of roughly $2 billion of contested tax liabilities. Then, as a courtesy, he let a Finance Committee Democrat, Max Baucus of Montana, attach a bill to let artists take deductions for works of their own that they donate to tax-exempt institutions, such as libraries. **********Many tax experts see the Baucus bill as opening the way to abuses, including reductions of taxable income from nonartistic endeavor.  Senator Dole dislikes the Baucus bill and will not oppose a floor attempt to kill it. Should that fail, his staff is preparing a series of crippling amendments. Mr. Dole also wants to make changes in the utilities bill. If all of this comes off smoothly, investors may get a Christmas present of a six-month holding period. Bankruptcy Courts **********Unless Congress reconstitutes the Federal bankruptcy courts by Dec. 24, they will grind to a halt, say aides to Representative Peter W.  Rodino Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Not so, say aides to Bob Dole, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the courts. The Dole aides contend that, under interim rules laid down by the Judicial Conference, a part of the courts system, bankruptcy proceedings will continue under the supervision of Federal district courts. **********Behind this disagreement, which may be more apparent than real, there simmers a power struggle between Mr. Rodino and Mr. Dole. They agree that, under a 1982 Supreme Court decision, Congress must pass legislation to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts. The Supreme Court's stay of its own order invalidating the present courts expires Dec. 24. Mr. Rodino wants a bill already approved by his committee passed during the special session of Congress. **********Senator Dole wants Congress to include provisions that tighten up the consumer credit provisions of the 1978 bankruptcy act. He believes they are too liberal and have been abused by individuals who run up big installment debts. Mr. Rodino does not like the Dole amendments. **********The Rodino bill would authorize the President to appoint 224 bankruptcy judges. Like other Federal judges, they would serve ''during good behavior,'' in the words of Article III of the Constitution, not for a fixed term as provided by 1978 legislation.  They would be paid $65,000 - more than the $58,500 they get now and less than the $70,300 paid to Federal district judges. **********House passage of the Rodino bill is likely. Whether the Senate will act depends on the priorities of the Senate leadership. If the Senate acts, a House-Senate conference would be inevitable. Showdown on Trucking **********Transportation lobbyists say the big trucking companies may be on an ill-fated ''Poli gambit'' in their confrontation with Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis. **********For those who may have forgotten, Robert Poli was the air traffic controllers' union president who in 1981 threatened to strike and drive the airlines out of business if Secretary Lewis did not grant the union's demands on work conditions. Mr. Poli wound up with no union, and the airlines are still flying. **********Lately Secretary Lewis, as part of his attempt to forge a working coalition, told the American Trucking Associations Inc. that, if they accepted higher operating fees as part of the Administration's highway-repair program, he would urge Congress to enact larger truck lengths and weights uniformly across the country. Mr. Lewis's analysts argued that the increased payload on longer trucks would pay the higher taxes. The added tax bite would be substantial, an increase from $1,800 a year for a truck carrying a 70,000-pound cargo to $5,000. **********Edward V. Kiley, senior vice president of the A.T.A., said ''no deal'' last week. Mr. Lewis replied in so many words: Very well, we will limit user-fee increases on trucks, but you, the A.T.A., are on your own with Congress in your campaign for uniform truck lengths and weights. The upshot could be that Mr. Lewis gets an increase in truck taxes - albeit less than he had anticipated - with the truckers getting next to nothing in return."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/11/business/adac-laboratories-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADAC LABORATORIES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "ADAC LABORATORIES reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/finnigan-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINNIGAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FINNIGAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/04/business/tax-bill-moves-into-conference.html": {"writer_name": "Karen Arenson", "pub_date": "1982-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 750, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAX BILL MOVES INTO CONFERENCE", "print_headline": "TAX BILL MOVES INTO CONFERENCE", "body_text": " **********A conference committee today began deliberations on a tax bill aimed at raising $21 billion in tax revenues in the coming fiscal year and $98 billion over the next three years amid indications that both parties see a need for a strong campaign by President Reagan if the bill is to become law. **********''The margin of victory will be determined by the amount of participation from the executive branch,'' said Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

He also said that it raised revenues ''in the most equitable and reasonable way possible.'' Business Share Biggest **********Indeed, the greatest portion of the new tax revenues that would be raised by the Senate bill would come from business. According to a report prepared for the conference committee by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, business tax provisions would account for $40 billion of the $99 billion of proposed new revenues. Many of these provisions would sharply restrict some of the business tax cuts enacted only last year. **********Individual income tax provisions, on the other hand, would provide only about $6 billion in new tax revenues, under the Senate bill.  Other categories that would provide further tax increases include excise taxes, pension, life insurance and employment taxes. **********During the first day of discussion, held in a meeting room filled to overflowing, the conference committee moved slowly through a listing of the various tax increase provisions. **********The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has produced two documents outlining the provisions offered for consideration, a 161-page blue-covered book with tax measures, and a 109-page white-covered book on spending proposals. **********While no votes were taken, some of the discussion seemed to indicate that certain items were likely to be contested or changed.  These included proposed limits on medical deductions, on taxdeferrals under multiyear contracts and on accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credits. **********Today's session was the first chance the Representatives on the committee had to discuss the various measures and to voice objections and suggestions. Even Senate discussion of the measures had been quite brief, since much of the bill was hammered out in a lengthy one-day session of only Republican committee members. Medical Cost Proposal Assailed **********One provision that drew fire was a proposal to require that medical costs that could be deducted must exceed 7 percent of taxable income, rather than the 3 percent floor that exists now. Representative Sam Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, called the moved ''a very cruel tax on old people.'' **********But Congressional tax experts observed that the deduction tended to be used most by middle-income and upper-income people, who itemize deductions, and that the expenses being deducted were often for such items as psychiatric care or orthodontic work, which were least likely to be covered by a health insurance plan. **********Another criticism leveled at the Senate bill was that certain provisions would limit the ability of American companies to compete internationally. And some conference members questioned the provisions limiting safe harbor leasing and accelerated depreciation. **********The committee will continue its meeting tomorrow morning, with more discussions of the revenue-raising proposals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/business/north-sea-oil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "North Sea Oil", "print_headline": "North Sea Oil", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. said that 1982 oil production from the Tartan Field in the British North Sea would be lower than it had anticipated.

New Market Favorites **********Until a year ago, the stock market's three favorite sectors were energy, technology and precious-metals - all sought after as inflation hedges.

Instead of inflation stocks, many analysts have sung the praises of electric utilities, food issues and other traditionally ''defensive'' groups. **********During this emergence of new market favorites, gold-mining stocks have plunged, along with energy and technology issues.

Kaunda of Zambia and South Africa's Prime Minister, P .W. Botha, representatives of southern Africa's opposed racial and political forces. **********Mr. Kaunda met Mr. Botha on the border between South Africa and Botswana on April 30, and the encounter, not previously discussed with the Zambian leader's so-called front-line colleagues, elicited harsh criticism from his peers. **********The front-line group, made up of Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, is, by tradition, black-ruled Africa's main pressure group in any negotiations concerning the advent of majority rule in southern Africa. **********The outcry against Mr. Kaunda from some in the front-line group recalled earlier opposition to his diplomacy during the seven years of conflict that transformed white-ruled Rhodesia into independent Zimbabwe. During that period, Mr. Kaunda met with Ian D. Smith, then Prime Minister of Rhodesia, and John Vorster, then Prime Minister of South Africa, in a mediation effort that brought cries of ''sellout'' from his peers. **********A Different View in Lusaka **********Yet the view from Lusaka, then as now, is different, suffused with President Kaunda's vision of himself as an elder statesman, uniquely qualified for the grand gesture that, perhaps, will bring peace or, perhaps, will regenerate his image as a historic peacemaker on the interational scene at a time of domestic difficulties and decreased regional influence. **********According to Zambian and Western sources, Mr. Kaunda carried with him several signals for Mr. Botha. One, as subsequently publicized, was the message that South African whites must talk to the ''true'' leaders of the country's black majority, such as Nelson Mandela, whose release from imprisonment Mr. Kaunda reportedly sought. The alternative, in the Zambian view, is a revolution. **********Mr. Botha, according to a Zambian source, replied that he would discuss the matter with his colleagues, causing some small sense of encouragement among Zambian officials. Another strand of what has been termed in Lusaka ''the gospel according to Kaunda'' was, according to Zambian and Western sources, an assurance to Mr. Botha that South Africa need not fear for its security if South-West Africa becomes independent of Pretoria's rule under a Government run by the South-West Africa People's Organization. Guerrilla War in Namibia **********The insurgents are fighting a guerrilla campaign against South African dominance in South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, and are armed and otherwise supported by the Soviet Union and its allies. In the Zambian view, however, the guerrillas are not ''puppets of Moscow,'' as South Africa sees them, but nationalists who, in the event they assumed power, would not allow their territory to be used as an operational base by the Soviet-supported guerrillas of the African National Congress, which opposes white rule in South Africa. **********A prominent Zambian, in tune with official thinking, compared the Namibian nationalists to Zimbabwe's guerrilla fighters who, he said, had, at the insistence of the front-line countries, refrained from offering bases on Zimbabwean territory to the African National Congress after Zimbabwe's independence two years ago. **********''We did not allow it in Zimbabwe, we would not allow it in Namibia,'' the Zambian figure said, requesting anonymity. On the broad scale, Mr. Kaunda's message seems, in part, to have been to present a muted version of Soviet influence among the Namibian insurgents and in his own country. **********Such was Lusaka's concern to play down Moscow's role that, according to an authoritative Zambian source, the Government and the officially guided press here accorded low prominence to a visit by a ranking Soviet delegation shortly before the Botha-Kaunda meeting.  ''You do not commit adultery with one while you are wooing another,'' a Zambian official said, referring to Lusaka's desire to reduce the appearance of Soviet influence because of Pretoria's extreme aversion to Moscow and its policies. Outcome of Talks Unclear **********The outcome of the talks, however, has thus far been unclear. A consensus among Zambians and Westerners here is that Mr. Kaunda would not have taken the political risk of meeting Mr. Botha without guaranteees that his efforts would be rewarded. But, on the Namibian issue, Mr. Kaunda's assurances about the guerrillas seem to have been partly contradicted by the insurgents themselves. **********The guerrilla group rejected the latest Western proposals for a settlement a day after Mr. Kaunda met Mr. Botha, and Reagan Administration officials said they believed that the Soviet Union had already made clear to the guerrillas that Moscow's support would not waver if the insurgents chose to dismiss the Western plan. 'The Devil Himself' **********Yet there is an almost desperate sense of hope in Lusaka that Mr.  Kaunda will be vindicated in meeting a man who is sometimes called by Zambians ''the devil himself.'' **********Zambians almost seem to be scouring the horizon for an omen from Pretoria, as evidenced by an editorial Tuesday in The Times of Zambia, a newspaper that sees its role as an interpreter of official policy to its readers and as a conveyor of popular sentiment to the Government. The column reflected on remarks by Mr. Botha last weekend in which he urged South Africans to ''make peace with neighboring African states.'' **********The editorial was clearly intended, in part, as a signal to Pretoria. It congratulated Mr. Botha and encouraged him to continue in like vein. ''The so-called gospel according to Kaunda is seemingly paying dividends,'' the article rejoiced, while cautioning Mr. Botha to avoid playing for time and to call off his military strikes into Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor. **********The comment was evidence of a profound desire by Zambians to see some recompense for Mr. Kaunda's extension of the olive branch after years of making sacrifices on behalf of others in southern Africa's liberation wars. Hope Seems Forlorn **********''Botha must give something now,'' a Zambian who works outside his own country said. ''You've no idea how isolated we Zambians have become among other Africans after the meeting with Botha.'' In immediate terms, the hopes seem forlorn.

Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, the men who led the guerrilla war to independence in 1980.

It was selling the 45,000 billboards owned by its Foster & Kleiser division for almost $500 million to a limited partnership.  But the transaction included a somewhat unusual clause that provided for the possibility that Metromedia might buy back the billboards in five years - if both the buyers and sellers agreed. **********In this era of corporate deal-making, when companies buy and sell businesses like so many properties on a Monopoly board, analysts were not bothered by Metromedia's trying to keep one foot in an old business at the same time it headed into newer ventures. They applauded the move because it helped the company financially, providing new cash to help finance its move into other, highertechnology businesses. **********But they also liked the idea that Metromedia might some day reacquire the billboards. For while outdoor advertising is a prosaic business, it also generates a lot of cash. Last year, Foster & Kleiser, the largest outdoor advertising unit in the United States, brought in $121 million of the company's $462 million in revenues and $40 million of its $123 million in income from continuing operations. **********''A lot of companies don't want to give up their good old businesses as they move into new businesses,'' said Fred Anschel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. ''And outdoor advertising has grown very steadily, at 10, 12, 15 percent a year. Why not try to get it back? It's a good business.'' **********The market also seemed to react favorably to the completion of the transaction. Last Thursday, as the Dow Jones industrial average moved up 10 points, Metromedia's stock, the highest-priced on the New York Stock Exchange, spurted to a high of $302 a share. Yesterday, however, it slipped back, to 294 1/2, down 7 1/2, while the Dow climbed 25.48 points. **********Metromedia has had an active year in restructuring itself. Besides the recent sale of the billboards, it acquired several radio paging busi-nesses and several new radio and television stations, and sold off some others. **********It has also applied to the Federal Communications Commission for permission to establish cellular mobile, or wireless, telephone systems in at least nine large cities, including New York, Chicago, Miami, Boston and Washington, and is expected to apply for a number of smaller markets as well. Most analysts look for cellular radio to be a particularly lucrative business - even better than billboards - and to start returning substantial profits quickly. **********''I've seen projections that there should be reportable earnings in about a year, and the margins being talked about are extraordinary,'' said Dennis H. Liebowitz, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He said estimates of profit margins were in the 60 percent range. **********But as Metromedia pursued these new ventures, it was accumulating a substantial debt load. The company has long been known for its deft use of leverage. But at some point this year it became clear that further expansion would probably require some kind of financial restructuring. **********The limited partnership ''deal has very distinct advantages for Metromedia,'' said David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim & Company.  ''It cleans up their balance sheet and allows them to make more acquisitions,'' he added. ''It gives them a great deal more flexibility.'' **********The transaction itself took eight months to piece together. The main architect was Lee J. Seidler, a general partner at Bear, Stearns & Company and a professor of accounting at New York University. **********Investors put up $150,000 in cash for each of 534 units, for a total of $80 million in equity. A $350 million 10-year loan was obtained from a consortium of six banks, led by Citibank. Metromedia provided $70 million of financing in the form of a five-year, zerocoupon note. **********What impressed many observers was the recognition that the billboards could be treated as real estate, which allows investors to take tax deductions not only for the equity they put up, but also for the money they borrow. **********''For investors, it is an opportunity for a multiple write-off,'' said Herman M. Schneider, a tax partner at Coopers & Lybrand. ''I think it is a fantastic deal for both parties, a no-lose proposition.'' **********The transaction has come in for some criticism, too. In a recent article in Barron's about it, for example, Abraham J. Briloff, a professor of accounting at the Baruch College of the City of New York, contended that its ''inspired'' use of some old tax rules was resulting in the deal's being ''bankrolled by the public, via the United States Treasury.'' **********But Mr. Seidler and other tax experts defend it as a valid use of existing laws. Mr. Seidler, for example, notes that Metromedia will pay taxes on the proceeds from the sale. ''It is a real sale,'' he said, adding, ''We haven't guaranteed Metromedia will get the billboards back, but we wanted to give them a crack at it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/business/chubb-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHUBB CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CHUBB CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/business/dean-foods-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEAN FOODS CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "DEAN FOODS CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/business/standard-logic-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STANDARD LOGIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "STANDARD LOGIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/world/seoul-opposition-leader-asks-end-of-ban-on-580-politicians.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Stokes", "pub_date": "1982-12-29", "snippet": "A prominent opposition leader has urged that the South Korean Government lift a ban on some 580 politicians at once to restore ''elementary freedoms and democracy to the people of South Korea.''\n\nThe head of the banned New Democratic Party, Kim Yo...", "word_count": 628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEOUL OPPOSITION LEADER ASKS END OF BAN ON 580 POLITICIANS", "print_headline": "SEOUL OPPOSITION LEADER ASKS END OF BAN ON 580 POLITICIANS", "body_text": " **********A prominent opposition leader has urged that the South Korean Government lift a ban on some 580 politicians at once to restore ''elementary freedoms and democracy to the people of South Korea.'' **********The head of the banned New Democratic Party, Kim Young Sam, who was reached by telephone at his home where he has been under house arrest for the last seven months, also urged that President Chun Doo Hwan restore freedom of the press. **********''That is fundamental,'' he said.

It is an essential of any democracy.'' **********Mr. Kim's comments came a day after the release from prison of Kim Dae Jung, his sometime ally and sometime rival in politics.  After the murder of President Park Chung Hee in October 1979 the two Kims were seen as possible successors. Kim Young Sam was widely viewed as being in the strongest position to gain the presidency, with Kim Dae Jung as his closest rival. **********No election was held. When Mr. Chun, then an army general, seized power in May 1980, he had Kim Dae Jung arrested and prosecuted on sedition charges and had Kim Young Sam confined to his home.  President Chun later banned the existing political parties and disqualified some 580 politicians and National Assembly members from public life until 1988, when his seven-year term is to end. **********Kim Young Sam was released from house arrest after a year and then confined to his home again seven months ago.  South Korean officials said recently that they might allow the 580 banned politicians to return to public life but President Chun is believed to have ruled out concessions to the two Kims. **********''It's now more than a decade since we had free elections under a passable charter,'' an aide to Mr. Kim said. ''We should not let year-end euphoria over Kim Dae Jung's welcome release obscure elementary difficulties here.'' **********Mr. Kim said that without democracy South Korea would not be able to compete with and prevail over the Communist regime in North Korea in the long run. He asserted that without free elections and a press free from Government control there could be ''no democracy nor a resemblance of a free society.''House Arrest Never Reported **********''Take the fact that it has never been reported in the Korean press that I am under house arrest,'' he said. ''What kind of liberty do the media actually enjoy?'' **********''The newspapers in Seoul are packed with distortions day by day,'' he said, ''and the trouble is that when rumors take hold, no one knows what to believe.'' **********The banned politician lives in a two-story home on a hill in Seoul. The modern house is on a narrow road that has been sealed off by the Agency for National Security Planning and by the police. No one is allowed to enter or leave Mr. Kim's home apart from his wife and one or two members of the domestic staff. **********''Looking out of my window now there are 40 men out there,'' Mr.  Kim said. ''Forty men or more, sometimes with their big buses, blocking the road.'' **********Mr. Kim said in an earlier phone call to Tokyo this month that his wife was allowed to shop but was constantly watched and made to feel uncomfortable. None of his party members is allowed to visit, he said. **********''No one has ever explained to me what this house arrest is about, what its aim is nor the reason for it,'' he said.

Until now, Israel has strenuously opposed any such move, and it was unclear tonight whether it would accept the United Nations observers. But since the United States joined the other 14 Council members in voting for the resolution, it would be difficult for Israel to say no. Today's Security Council meeting was requested by Lebanon. **********2 Reasons for Israeli Opposition **********Israel has opposed any role for United Nations observers in Beirut for two reasons. Israel does not want to collide with even a symbolic United Nations presence, and it wants an American-led force, not a United Nations team, to supervise the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Beirut. The observers have no such task, but their existence might encourage demands for United Nations troops to oversee any departure of the guerrillas. **********If United Nations observers are not placed between the Palestinian fighters and Israel, but are confined to points from which they can watch any military action, the confrontation problem will not arise, American diplomats say. **********The Council delegates were awakened at 3:30 this morning after reports were received of Israel's intensive armored, air and sea attacks on west Beirut. Five hours later, the delegates gathered in the @anterooms off the Council chamber to negotiate a text on which they could agree. **********Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the chief United States delegate, successfully edited a first draft. She deleted language critical of Israel and won an assurance that the observers would be limited to the Beirut area and a statement that the cease-fire should embrace not only Lebanon but ''all military activities across the Lebanese-Israeli border.'' **********Her success reflected the other members' eagerness to put United Nations observers in Beirut, and this was the heart of today's resolution. It ''authorizes the Secretary General to deploy immediately on the request of the Government of Lebanon, United Nations observers to monitor the situation in and around Beirut.'' **********Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar is in Tunisia on an African tour, but he stayed in touch with the Council by telephone.  He is drawing his cease-fire observers from the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. **********That little-known group consists of 298 officers ranging from captain to lieutenant colonel and drawn from 17 countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union. Its headquarters are in Jerusalem. The organization was set up in 1948 to oversee the end of hostilities after the first Arab-Israeli war. **********The truce supervision organization is commanded by Lieut. Gen.  Emanuel Erskine of Ghana, and he can immediately call on about 10 officers now stationed in Beirut. In addition, 80 officers attached to the organization are with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon. **********Mrs. Kirkpatrick was silent in today's debate.

The Administration announced in January its intention to continue to allow Taiwan to produce the F-5E, while denying it access to more advanced fighters. **********But official notification of the decision has been delayed because the United States sought to work out first a new understanding with Peking governing relations in which continued American arms sales to Taiwan would be at least tacitly accepted by China. **********China has publicly denounced American arms sales to Taiwan as an infringement of China's sovereignty over the island and not in keeping with the decision by the United States to establish diplomatic relations with China in January 1979 while severing official ties with Taiwan. Taiwan Relations Act **********Under the Taiwan Relations Act, approved by Congress after relations were established with Peking, the United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan and is committed to supplying Taiwan with ''such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' **********The State Department refused to comment on Mr. Holdridge's discussions.  Participants in his briefings, however, said that in the communique, worked out in Peking by Ambassador Arthur W. Hummel Jr.  and Chinese officials, the United States reaffirmed its view that ''there is but one China'' and that it attached great importance to good relations with the Peking Government. **********The Chinese, in the preamble to the statement, said that they were committed to the peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the ''motherland'' and that that was ''a fundamental policy.'' Congressional sources reported that Mr. Holdridge said that the stress on peaceful reunification was significant. **********On Dec. 15, 1978, when the two sides announced diplomatic relations would be established on Jan. 1, 1979, the Chinese said that ''as for the way of bringing Taiwan back to the embrace of the motherland and reunifying the country, it is entirely China's internal affair.'' **********Actually, the Chinese have been stating their desire for peaceful reunification with Taiwan since September 1981.  The United States said in the new communique, the sources said, that given the statements in the preamble, it would not exceed annually either in quantity or quality the level of arms sales to Taiwan in any given year since normalization. In 1979, the United States shipped about $800 million worth of arms, the highest amount to date. Level of Sales to Be Reduced **********In the statement, the United States also said that the level of arms sales to Taiwan would be gradually reduced, but there was no cutoff date for such sales as sought by the Chinese during the negotiations that have been going on for the last 10 months. **********According to the sources, the major issue that had held up an agreement in recent months was the disagreement over the American desire to link gradual reduction of arms sales to Taiwan with progress toward peaceful solution of the Taiwan issue. The Chinese said this was tantamount to interference in their affairs. **********The formula as finally worked out has the Chinese stating that peaceful reunification is a fundamental policy of China, and Washington asserting that in light of that statement, it will gradually reduce arms sales. **********According to participants, when Mr. Holdridge briefed the Foreign Relations Committee on the document, concern was voiced over the commitment to reduce American arms sales to Taiwan There was questioning of whether this was undermining the Taiwan Relations Act. **********Mr. Holdridge defended the language, asserting that the Administration would live up to the commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act. Under Fire From Conservatives **********The Administration has been under fire in recent weeks from conservatives, such as Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, who have complained about the delay in going ahead with the F-5E co-production plans with Taiwan, and who feared that the Administration might sign a communique with Peking setting a time for ending arms sales to Taiwan. **********It has also been criticized by others for endangering relations with Peking, which former officials like Zbigniew Brzezinski view as crucial to American long-range strategic interests against the Russians. **********Negotiations intensified in the last two months as the Administration informed Peking that it had to send the F-5E notification to Congress before Congress recessed in late August and it preferred to have a statement worked out with Peking before doing so. **********Administration officials have said that they assumed the Chinese would not let the sale of American military equipment to Taiwan lead to a rupture in relations with Peking, but there has been concern that Peking might reduce the level of relations or take some other symbolic step if the F-5E sale went ahead without some framework statement such as the one just worked out."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/21/business/laidlaw-transportation-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/06/world/around-the-world-protestant-militants-lose-in-belfast-election.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protestant Militants Lose In Belfast Election", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Protestant Militants Lose In Belfast Election", "body_text": " **********The Rev.

Rowny, a retired Army lieutenant general, said the movement for a nuclear arms freeze ''hurts'' Reagan Administration efforts in talks with Moscow. The strategic arms talks with the Russians are set to begin in Geneva on Tuesday. **********The effort to freeze nuclear forces at the existing level ''hurts me as a negotiator,'' Mr. Rowny said. ''It hurts to have someone looking over my shoulder, believing this will have an impact, believing there's a sentiment.'' **********On a recent trip to Western European capitals to discuss the approaching arms negotiations, Mr. Rowny said, the movement for a freeze appeared to be on the decline. Western European leaders, he said, ''are very much afraid of a freeze.'' Movement Said to Peak Out **********''They feel the freeze movement has kind of peaked out and is on a downscale and that's good,'' he added.  Mr. Rowny said the Europeans were especially concerned that a freeze could mean that the United States would forgo the deployment overseas of two weapons that many West Europeans want: Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles. **********''The freeze locks inequalities into position,'' said Mr. Rowny, who held a breakfast meeting with reporters as well as a news conference at the State Department. ''You have to begin negotiating what a freeze is all about. Then you have to negotiate the verification aspects of the freeze. The freeze is just a bummer from a negotiator's point of view.'' **********Mr. Rowny, who resigned from the strategic arms negotiating team in 1979 because of disagreement over American concessions to the Soviet Union, voiced optimism about a new pact. ''I think the Soviets want an agreement,'' he said, adding that his assessment was based on ''intuition, plus feedback.'' Sees Brezhnev Commitment **********He said Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, seemed ''committed'' to an arms agreeement. ''They think detente can come back,'' he said of the Russians. ''They desperately want technology transfers, they want credits.'' **********Mr. Rowny said that in the last 10 to 15 years the Soviet Union had build up its strategic arsenal to create a potentially ''destabilizing situation'' with the United States. The Administration proposal for the talks calls for each side to reduce its missile warheads by a third, down to 5,000 on no more than 850 missiles. This would require the Russians to cut their missile force by 1,500, compared with 850 for the United States. **********Asked about the ''linkage'' concept, in which United States attitudes toward the Soviet Union are based in part on Soviet actions in other matters, Mr. Rowny said, ''Linkage is always in the background, you can't negate it. **********''If relations are better, you have a better chance of getting an agreement,'' he continued. ''If there are strained relations, it's a tougher chance.'' Verification Issue Cited **********In response to a question about the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and reports of the use of biological and chemical warfare there and elsewhere, Mr. Rowny said: ''I worry about what they're doing in other areas. This impinges on what I do.'' He indicated that Soviet actions elsewhere were especially closely linked to the delicate issue of verification, the procedures to insure that the Russians are not cheating on an agreement. **********''There is an impact in what happens in other areas,'' he said. He remarked that the Administration had ''not ruled out on-site inspection'' as a verification method, although the Soviet Union has consistently opposed it. **********''You have to move toward more cooperative means,'' he said. ''You have to push them to agree to more openness.'' ---- Talks on Medium-Range Arms **********GENEVA, June 24 (AP) - In one of the briefest sessions since negotiations began almost seven months ago, American and Soviet representatives met for an hour and 50 minutes today in their talks on reducing intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe. **********The meeting was the 34th of the current series.

For August, factory use declined to 69.4 percent, off half a percentage point from the low July level. **********Under the impact of excess capacity, industry has been cutting its capital appropriations steeply. Alan Greenspan of Townsend-Greenspan notes that, excluding highly volatile petroleum expenditures, manufacturers slashed their capital appropriations 17 percent in the second quarter and 34 percent in the last three quarters. Actual capital spending seems to have some way still to fall. **********Mr. Greenspan finds that cash flow of corporations is providing even less support to capital spending than in 1975, ''despite the passage of the 1981 Economic Recovery Act,'' which was to provide strong stimulus to saving and investment. **********In a new econometric analysis, Prof. Robert S. Chirinko of Cornell University finds a ''low response'' of investment and saving to tax changes but re-emphasizes the importance of capacity utilization and cash flow to capital spending. **********Professor Chirinko concludes that ''recently enacted personal and business tax cuts will have little direct effect on spurring new investment.'' And he warns that, ''if these cuts, combined with other aspects of the Reagan economic program, result in depressed levels of demand and capacity utilization, they may well have perverse effects on capital formation in the 1980's.'' **********However, the Reagan Administration's economic program, adverised as a supply-side policy, is not entirely lacking in measures to increase total demand as a means of creating jobs. **********The major demand stimulant in the Administration's program is military spending, which is scheduled to rise to $364.6 billion in 1987 from $190.5 billion in the current fiscal year. Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger has been waging a stubborn campaign to prevent the defense budget from being trimmed by critics in Congress or within the White House who argue that too rapid a military buildup is hurting the economy. **********In a recent interview, Mr. Weinberger said, ''You get 35,000 more jobs for every extra $1 billion you spend on national defense.'' This is a number that came to him from an economic unit within the Pentagon called the Defense Economic Impact Modeling System. **********This system, known as Deims, employs a macroeconomic model similar to those used by Data Resources and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, private economic forecasting concerns, both of whose models derive from an essentially Keynesian view of the world. **********In addition, Deims uses an input-output model, derived from the work of Wassily W. Leontief, to trace the impact of defense expenditures on 400 industries and 161 skilled labor categories as an method for helping defense producers plan ahead. **********The Pentagon's economists regard 35,000 jobs per extra $1 billion as a conservative estimate. They now estimate that the direct effect of military outlays on prime contractors, subcontractors and material producers is 25,000 jobs per $1 billion and that its indirect or multiplier effect, as the dollars are respent in other industries, is to create 25,000 or 30,000 more jobs, for a total of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs per $1 billion in military spending. **********Deims finds that, at present levels of spending, the military budget accounts for 2.2 million industrial jobs, not counting 960,000 civilian jobs in the Department of Defense. By the fiscal year 1987, it estimates that military spending will account for 3.4 million industrial jobs plus about a million civilian jobs in the Defense Department. **********Mr. Weinberger says the case for rising military spending depends primarily not on its economic benefits but on ''our high estimate of the Soviet threat.'' However, he insists that ''doing this is not bad for the economy.'' He maintains that the impact of military spending on budget deficits is exaggerated by its critics because ''military outlays generate greater tax revenues, unlike transfer payments.'' **********These arguments have apparently helped Mr. Weinberger keep the support of the President, and he says he has other supporters in the White House, of whom he names two: ''Judge Clark and Ed Meese.''

And another retailer, the May Department Stores Company, has expressed interest in a possible merger with Field in the last few days. **********Despite a lingering ill feeling against Carter, Field reportedly has been making inquiries through a third party. The third party appears to be Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bankers, hired by Marshall Field last week to help it find ''alternatives'' to the Icahn group. **********Field recently obtained a temporary restraining order blocking Icahn from making further purchases of Field shares. Looking for Other Buyers **********People close to the situation said Goldman, Sachs had been actively ''shopping the market'' for a more appealing investor or merger partner. John Boyle, chairman of the May stores in St. Louis, met with Angelo Arena, Field's chairman, in Chicago. But discussions were inconclusive, according to financial sources. **********There are indications that the Icahn group hopes to increase its holding of Marshall Field common (if it can emerge from the restraining order) to 20 percent. Once that threshold is achieved, the owner of the block could report a like share of Marshall Field's earnings as its own. That prospect would enhance the Icahn group's ability to find a purchaser for its Field shares if it decides to sell them. **********Reports yesterday indicated that the restraining order against Icahn would be partly lifted today, with the rest to be removed tomorrow. **********The Icahn Capital Corporation, principal entity of the Icahn group, said Friday that investors affiliated with Icahn had filed an amended 13-D statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The amended statement included a plan covering the sale or financing of Field's valuable real-estate assets. Comments From Officers **********A top executive of Carter Hawley Hale said there had been no contacts ''to my knowledge'' with Goldman, Sachs. Waldo H. Burnside, vice chairman and chief operating officer of Carter, said in a telephone interview, ''The economics of the situation and our stock price would, I think, make any arrangement with Field's a remote possibility.'' Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale was said to be away on a holiday. **********Carter's common has recently been selling at about l3 after reaching a year's high of 20 7/8. Marshall Field's common has recently been selling at close to 20 after peaking at 22 within the last year. **********Carl C. Icahn, head of Icahn Capital, declined to see a reporter late last week. Two members of his law firm -Gordon, Hurwitz, Butowsky, Baker, Weitzen & Shalov - consented to answer questions but mostly skirted making direct replies. **********Asked if Marshall Field's opposition to the Icahn purchases reflected its perception that Mr. Icahn had usually made investments in companies and sold them for a profit, David Butowsky, a partner in the law firm, replied, ''He has had some situations in which he has sold stock he bought and one, in the instance of Bayswater Realty and Capital Corporation, where he remained, became chairman and is running the company.'' Opportunist or Investor? **********Mr. Butowsky added, ''It's to the advantage of an entrenched management to paint Mr. Icahn as an opportunist, but any investor is free to follow any of his options.'' **********In a suit filed by Field on Feb. 8, which led to the restraining order, the Chicago retailer charged Mr. Icahn and several companies associated with him of having violated Federal securities law in their purchases of Field stock. **********Marshall Field has been considered ripe for takeover for some time because of its erratic earnings record, management's relatively small stock ownership, its holdings of valuable real estate and the impression that it barely defeated the stockholder suits filed against it after it rejected Carter Hawley Hale's offer. **********But John Landschultz, who has watched Field since 1959, does not consider the big retailer so vulnerable. Mr. Landschultz is an analyst at Mesirow & Company, a Chicago brokerage house. **********''Marshall Field dominates this area,'' he said, ''and it's a much improved company over what it was four and five years ago, even though we are in a recession. Icahn, it seems to me, is in pretty deep and can't get out on his own without finding a buyer. Icahn's money is tied up, and he needs to find someone or have someone found to buy him out.'' Stockholder Suits a Factor **********Other analysts believe, however, that Marshall Field may have to locate a buyer for the company in view of the class action suits filed in the wake of Carter's offer. **********Fran R. Blechman, vice president and analyst at Merrill Lynch, said, ''It's difficult to see any major department store chain that could buy Field's without running afoul of antitrust regulations, so it may be another kind of retailer or even a foreign company.'' **********Monroe H. Greenstein, a partner at Bear, Stearns & Company, noted that Field's attractive real-estate assets, its Water Tower Place Center, the State Street store in Chicago's Loop and several shopping centers it owns all offer an ''interesting target.'' **********Although Mr. Arena of Marshall Field was not available for comment in Chicago, an associate who asked not to be identified said that Field's options were not confined to finding a merger partner or a buyer of the Field shares held by Icahn. ''We could buy another company, too, or issue stock for that or another purpose,'' he said.  ''There are at least 15 options that Goldman, Sachs could pursue for us.

A more ideological group of settlers, however, remained opposed to the withdrawal in principle, calling it a ''retreat'' and urging the Israeli public to resist the pullout. **********The Cabinet decision, proposed by Simcha Ehrlich, the Deputy Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister, allocates about $263 million to approximately 1,400 families in the Yamit area and in Sharm el-Sheik on the Red Sea. **********The grants, which amount to an average of nearly $188,000 per family, are meant to cover the costs of abandoned structures and equipment and to compensate for years of building stores, factories and lucrative hot-house farms.

Among those opposed was Finance Minister Yoram Aridor, who argued that the large sums would undo his efforts to cut Government spending as a way of curbing inflation. **********But the decision to make such large grants, and the authorities' refusal to prosecute any settlers for arson, testifies to Israel's deep ambivalence over relinquishing the final swath of Sinai, which runs from El Arish on the Mediterranean to Sharm el-Sheik on the Red Sea. **********Under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, it must be returned to Egypt by April 25, when it is to come under patrol by an international military force. **********The idea of pulling out Jewish settlements touches a nerve of discomfort in Israel, where settlement has always been regarded as integral to the nation's solidity and well-being.

Many Israelis, noting the assassination in October of Egypt's President, Anwar el-Sadat, see a peaceful Egyptian regime as a fragile thing, and wonder what will happen to Cairo's policy after April. Many distrust the United States, which is supposed to be the guarantor of the Camp David accords but has taken to punishing what is viewed in Washington as Israeli misdeeds by delaying weapons shipments or curtailing aid to Israeli military industries. **********Nevertheless, various officials in the Government, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin himself, have repeatedly said that Israel intends to observe its commitment to withdraw on time.

A five-pound box of candy for 98 cents. **********The prices are all listed in the 1933 Christmas catalogue of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which the giant Chicago retailer has reprinted in a limited edition for the nostalgic. It was the first Sears Christmas gift catalogue. **********Although it was published nearly a half-century ago, the 88-page booklet shows that times, at least in one way, have not changed.  Promotional lures were in effect even then. **********For example, Sears advised its customers in 1933 that if they ordered $5 or more in merchandise from the holiday or fall general catalogue they could buy a Hammond electric clock or an Ingraham spring-wound clock for $2.99 (both sold regularly for about $7.50 each). Customers ordering $7.50 or more in goods were entitled to buy a 26-piece Rogers silverware set for $4.99 (the regular price was about $15). A Hard Year **********Promotions were needed in 1933, a year in which the Great Depression hit bottom. The average American who had a job - almost 25 percent were out of work -earned only $16.65 a week, compared with today's average salary of $332.13 a week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********Thus, although the Sears prices of the 1930's may look attractive in the 1980's they may not have been any more affordable to the consumer at that time. **********''The right way to think about prices is not how many dollars they involve as much as how many hours a typical consumer has to work to earn the cost of a particular item,'' said F. Thomas Juster, director of the Institute of Social Research of the University of Michigan. **********''Today's prices are much higher than 1933's,'' he continued, ''but the typical American has to work fewer hours to pay for those higherpriced goods. That means that real productivity has gone up and that is reflected in wages rising faster than prices.'' **********Professor Juster said in an interview from Ann Arbor, Mich., that graduate students at the university had asked undergraduates to choose between the prices of the Sears catalogues of the 1940's and those of the 1960's. ''The instructors found that the students selected the higher-priced 1960's catalogues because along with the price changes comes a subtle series of product quality and innovation changes,'' he said. **********In Chicago, Ernest L. Arms, national news director of Sears, said that slightly less than 10,000 copies of the 1933 catalogue had been printed. ''We wouldn't, of course, want to live through the times that that catalogue represented,'' he said. **********The catalogue was reprinted ''strictly for internal use and for people in the media,'' Mr. Arms said, adding, ''It is not for sale and a sentence on the inside cover says, 'Merchandise shown in this reprint is not offered for sale.' '' **********Commenting on the Sears reprint, John D. Rich, a principal in Case & Company, a management consulting firm in New York, said yesterday: ''It's an interesting thing that Sears has done. It is becoming a trend for old-established companies to reproduce mostly as a goodwill gesture catalogues, packages and wrappers that they used decades ago. In the Sears case, though, the 1933 catalogue came out during an unhappy Christmas and it's a poignant reminder of what we don't want to get back to this season.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/business/caldor-takeovers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caldor Takeovers", "print_headline": "Caldor Takeovers", "body_text": " **********The Associated Dry Goods Corporation said that its Caldor discount store subsidiary would take over the five Stewart & Company stores in Maryland, starting next spring. **********Associated operates both Caldor and Stewart, as well as other store groups around the country.

They strongly urged Mr. Reagan to make greater haste in seeking a resumption of nuclear arms control negotiations. **********The former officials, James R. Schlesinger and Harold Brown, also suggested that American nuclear deterrence might be weakened by statements that the Soviet Union had superiority. **********Mr. Schlesinger, who headed the Pentagon under Presidents Nixon and Ford from 1973 to 1975, and Mr. Brown, who was Secretary under President Carter from 1977 to 1981, made their remarks in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. **********On Thursday, the committee began what its chairman, Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, described as ''landmark'' hearings on the rising debate over nuclear weapons. At Odds With Weinberger **********On some points, the testimony of the former officials contrasted sharply with that of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. On Thursday, he insisted that President Reagan was correct in saying at a news conference on March 31 that the Soviet Union had a ''definite margin of superiority.'' **********But Mr. Schlesinger and Mr. Brown broadly supported some important aspects of the Reagan Administration's defense policy. Both endorsed an increase in conventional strength and the production of the MX missile. And both declined to endorse the proposal for a freeze in the deployment of nuclear weapons that had prompted Mr. Reagan's remark about Soviet superiority. **********Mr. Schlesinger acknowledged that the Soviet Union had ''gradually acquired a hard-target kill capability against American forces which now in all probability substantially exceeds'' that of the United States. **********But he added that the United States ''should not brood about or overstate'' this deficiency and ''above all we should not suggest that the deficiency in this single dimension implies inferiority because the word 'inferiority' may suggest to others that our deterrent is, indeed, inadequate.'' Mr. Brown expressed similar views. Accuracy of Soviet Missiles **********In the argot of nuclear strategists, a hard target is one, such as a missile silo or military command post, that has been strengthened to withstand some levels of nuclear blast, heat and radiation. No target can withstand a nearby explosion by a powerful warhead. **********The Soviet Union has developed land-based intercontinental missiles with very powerful multiple re-entry vehicles. In recent years the missiles have reportedly become accurate enough in theory to destroy most of the 1,052 operational United States ICBM silos. **********But Mr. Brown said the Russians ''do not have anything like strategic superiority in a useable sense.'' The two officials said they believed the United States had substantial superiority in submarines carrying nuclear missiles, strategic bombers and cruise missiles under development. **********''The United States has and will continue to have, in my judgment, sufficient surviving and deliverable weapons to destroy the urbanindustrial base of the Soviet Union - even after absorbing a Soviet strike,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. **********Mr. Schlesinger, who headed the Atomic Energy Commission and the Central Intelligence Agency under President Nixon and was Mr.  Carter's first Secretary of Energy, said ''such a capability is frequently considered the ultimate deterrent.'' **********''If the present discussions of superiority and inferiority are taken to suggest that the Soviet Union can deny the United States that capability, then the suggestion that the Soviet Union has superiority is invalid,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/06/business/new-chief-at-automatic-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 907, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW CHIEF AT AUTOMATIC DATA", "print_headline": "NEW CHIEF AT AUTOMATIC DATA", "body_text": " **********Many companies do not get as much time as they would like to plan for changes at the top. But Automatic Data Processing Inc., whose chairman and chief executive officer, Frank R. Lautenberg, was just elected United States Senator from New Jersey, had more than a year. **********Long before the Senate campaign began last winter, Mr. Lautenberg had picked Josh S. Weston, the president of A.D.P., as his successor at the Clifton, N.J., computer services company. Mr. Weston will assume the additional title of chief executive officer when Mr.  Lautenberg leaves for Washington in early January. **********In the last month, the long-sluggish price of A.D.P. stock rose 30 percent. Financial analysts say that if Mr. Weston, who is well liked in the investment community, can help see A.D.P. through its current troubles, most of them traceable to the recession, the company's future is bright. **********''Lautenberg did an excellent job at A.D.P.,'' said Sandra P.  Kraus, who follows the company for Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.  ''But I have a lot of confidence in Weston, too. I have very positive feelings about the company these days.'' **********Mr. Weston does indeed have some problems to overcome. A.D.P. has had a comparatively tough year. The company, which offers computerized record-keeping services to companies that do not have their own computers, predicted that its earnings would rise 10 percent in the 1983 fiscal year, which ends June 30. That growth would be impressive for most companies. But during the last decade, profits at A.D.P. rose at an annual pace of at least 15 percent, far more in some years. **********A.D.P. earned $58 million on revenues of $669 million in the 1982 fiscal year. Its stock closed Friday at 35, down 1 3/8, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The recession has hurt A.D.P., particularly its payroll-processing business, which represents a third of the company's revenues. The company processed 290 million paychecks last year. **********In an interview, Mr. Weston said many of the 80,000 companies using A.D.P. payroll services have reduced their staffs because of the economic downturn. ''Our average customer had 4 percent fewer employees'' in October than it did in the same month of 1981, he said. ''Since we get paid by the transaction, we get affected,'' he said. **********The recession also made difficult the start last year of a payroll system intended for companies with fewer than 20 workers. A.D.P.  estimated that the service, called Autopay 1, would have 15,000 clients by now. It fell 20 percent short of the goal, despite extensive advertising. 12 Years With Company **********Mr. Weston, 53 years old, joined A.D.P. in 1970 and became its president and chief operating officer seven years later. When Mr.  Lautenberg became more involved in New Jersey politics in the late 1970's, Mr. Weston assumed day-to-day command of the company. **********Starting next month, Mr. Weston will have control at A.D.P., even though some of his corporate duties will be shared with the company's newly named chairman, Henry Taub. Mr. Taub was chairman once before, from 1969 to 1977. (His brother, Joseph Taub, is president of the New Jersey Nets professional basketball team.) **********''Weston has run A.D.P. for a while now, and he's shown himself to be a tough manager,'' said David Wu, a technology analyst for Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco brokerage firm. Under Mr.  Weston, Mr. Wu said, ''A.D.P. has made very few mistakes.'' **********Ulric Weil, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said he expected changes at A.D.P. under its new chief executive. Mr. Weston, he said, might pursue a more conservative acquisitions policy than did Mr. Lautenberg. Between 1979 and 1982, A.D.P. bought 18 companies at an average cost of more than $3 million each. **********''Weston is very cost-conscious,'' Mr. Weil said, ''And in the future, I think, there will be a tougher assessment of profitability before an acquisition is made.'' **********Another challenge for A.D.P. will be sharpened competition in the data processing industry, especially after the creation of American Bell Inc., the new communications equipment subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********But analysts say that if the recession does not worsen, A.D.P. will be in good shape to meet the new competition. And its traditional computer operations, which provide data processing for small- and medium-sized companies, should show steady growth, they say. Push Into High Technology **********Of more interest to many of the analysts, however, is A.D.P.'s recent push into high-technology, high-growth markets, including electronic banking. **********Last year A.D.P. began selling automatic teller systems - networks of computerized banking machines that offer customers 24-hour-a-day service - to small banks and savings and loan associations. **********More than $4 million will be spent in 1982 to expand the automatic teller division, ''which makes it our biggest single ongoing investment,'' Mr. Weston said. A.D.P.'s teller machines are installed in 20 states. **********So far A.D.P. has lost money on electronic banking ''and it won't break even on it for a year,'' said Mrs. Kraus of Lehman Brothers.  ''But I think it's going to be a very attractive market for the company.'' She said A.D.P. had indicated to analysts that its electronic banking business would bring in annual revenues of $50 million by 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/05/business/us-allies-discuss-trade.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S., Allies Discuss Trade", "print_headline": "U.S., Allies Discuss Trade", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini of Italy said today that the United States and key allies were moving closer to an East-West trade policy that would allow the Reagan Administration to drop its sanctions against companies taking part in the construction of the Siberian gas pipeline. **********Shortly after his speece at the National Press Club, negotiations on trade issues resumed between Lawrence S.

But they also have contributed to the current recession in Canada and abroad by increasing the cost of consumer credit and of corporate borrowing for capital investment. **********Analysts said the Canadian dollar's latest slump was less the result of new factors than a reflection of the strengthening American dollar and renewed attention to the continuing weaknesses of the Canadian economy. **********The currency has been weakened by the recession, by large government budget deficits, by a balance of payments deficit and by the appeal of even higher interest rates available abroad. It also has been hurt by a growing fear of nationalist Canadian economic policies that restrict foreign investment, especially in oil and gas. **********Recent buy-outs of some foreign holdings in Canadian energy concerns have also dumped large sums of Canadian dollars on exchange markets, further weakening the currency. **********Many experts expect the dollar to fall to 78 cents in the months ahead, with a few even forecasting a 75-cent level in the absence of decisive government steps to reverse the trend. Domestic Political Issue **********With unemployment currently exceeding 9 percent and the annual rate of inflation still over 11 percent, the stagnant Canadian economy has become a hot domestic political issue. Finance Minister Allan MacEachen in the past has mentioned that the Government might be willing to reassess its economic policies in July if conditions did not improve by then. **********''These situations are quite often transitory,'' he told reporters today, noting that last August the dollar fell from 83 cents to nearly 80 cents, and rose again to 83. **********Mr. MacEachen, who today rejected opposition party demands that he order the Bank of Canada to lower the official bank rate, also announced that the Government was trying to raise $750 million on the European bond market to bolster the country's official currency reserves. Currency Reserves in Decline **********The reserves fell by $651 million last month. Most of the total, along with some of a $300 million line of credit with Canadian chartered banks, was spent buying unwanted Canadian dollars to support the currency. **********A key problem is the country's current account deficit. Although Canada has enjoyed a substantial trade surplus of about $11 billion a year in recent years, demand has been softening among most of its major trading partners. **********At the same time, the flow of interest and dividend payments out of the country to foreign investors and banks has been climbing. It may reach $18 billion this year, leaving Canada with at least a $7 billion deficit in its current account. **********The Liberal Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau has shown little inclination to moderate its spending policies, which are expected to create a $13 billion budget deficit this year. **********The Trudeau Government has denied frequent rumors that it is considering devaluing the dollar or imposing foreign exchange controls. Such steps were taken by Canada in World War II and during the Korean War. They were later lifted and a free-floating Canadian dollar was worth $1.0552 in American funds in October 1959.

People here were very pleased to read, for example, that after his surrender, to an overwhelming force, Mr. Hunt refused to shake hands with the Argentine commanding general. **********''I do not shake hands with an invader of British territory,'' he told the general. The Argentine said that it seemed ungentlemanly behavior, to which Mr. Hunt replied, ''I think it very uncivilized to invade our country.'' 'Don't Lose Heart' **********During the two and a half months that followed, Mr. Hunt has remained in Britain, his role somewhat ambiguous and his future uncertain. In general, he avoided public attention, though he did make an occasional attempt to raise morale back in the Falklands. For example, in an Easter message broadcast by the World Service of the BBC, he said: ''Don't lose heart. I'm looking forward to coming back soon.'' **********At one point in Britain's negotiations with Argentina, it seemed that his job, with its colonial connotations, might be eliminated as a concession to the Argentines. But no one in the British Government is talking about conceding anything to the Argentines any more, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, announcing on Tuesday that Mr. Hunt would be going back to the Falklands, said that he would be ''in effect'' a kind of civil commissioner, working in concert with Maj.  Gen. Jeremy Moore, who commands the British military force there. **********While the Prime Minister was speaking in the House of Commons, paying tribute to the British servicemen who had died ''that others may live in freedom and justice,'' Mr. Hunt was listening from the gallery. And the tears that he occasionally wiped from his eyes were a reminder of the close ties that have built up between the Governor and his island territory in the two years that he has served there. **********''He is the most popular governor we have had in years and years,'' said a longtime resident of the Falklands, who is in London.  ''Well before this crisis started, Rex Hunt was known as a man who really had the islanders' interest at heart.'' A Former R.A.F. Pilot **********An affable, gregarious man with the blunt, direct manner often associated with his native Yorkshire, Mr. Hunt likes to drive himself in a Land-Rover across the marshy Falkland countryside. For longer trips, he flew his own Cessna Skyhawk, using skills learned as a Royal Air Force pilot in the closing days of World War II, when he was still a teen-ager. (He thinks the plane was destroyed during the war.) **********He and his wife, the former Mavis Buckland, often entertain in Government House, their roomy, green-roofed residence on the west side of Stanley, on the waterfront, and their 20-year old daughter and 18-year-old son, on visits from England, are also well known to the 1,800 islanders. **********''Rex is the kind of unpretentious chap who, instead of telling someone else to do something, will pull on his Wellington boots and march across the bogs to do it himself,'' a friend from the Falklands said. **********In an interview with a British newspaper early in the confrontation, Mr. Hunt said that he would like to be aboard one of the ships in the naval task force, so as ''to be with them when they land'' in the Falklands. **********But he also attaches importance to the ceremonial side of his job.  For formal occasions, he rides around Stanley in the official governor's car, a maroon London taxicab with the Union Jack flying on the front fender. And for his expulsion by the Argentines, he insisted on wearing the full regalia of his office, which includes a sword and a hat with ostrich plumes. In Saigon at the Fall **********In response to a question, he said Tuesday that he is taking these symbols of the Falklands' colonial status back to Stanley with him.  But it was a reflection of the ambiguous nature of his new status that he added, in reference to the plumed hat, ''I will wear it if I am authorized to wear it.'' **********Mr. Hunt, who has a degree from Cambridge University, joined the overseas civil service in 1951, and served a long tour in Uganda, retiring from there as a district commissioner in 1963. He then joined the diplomatic corps, in which his posts have included Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. **********He was in Saigon at the time of its fall in 1975 and was evacuated to Singapore, an experience that he said was ''very similar'' to his departure from the Falklands last April. **********Today, he said that he was all packed to return to Stanley, and would be going as soon as the Defense Ministry could arrange it. And he said there would soon be other arrivals on the islands. Six hundred people have applied to settle in the Falklands - not only from Britain, but also from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. **********''They say they want a new life helping to rebuild the islands,'' Mr. Hunt declared, saying that skilled immigrants would be very welcome. ''The Falklands have a very bright future indeed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/30/world/talks-on-fate-of-the-plo-are-said-to-be-deadlocked.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1982-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1050, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TALKS ON FATE OF THE P.L.O.

Habib, told a European Ambassador that, although the Palestine Liberation Organization had accepted the principle of neutralizing its military presence in Lebanon and transferring its leadership elsewhere, ''there is a total block on how and when this should be done.'' **********Palestinian officials said the P.L.O. was negotiating in good faith and recognized the predicament that it was in. But the officials said the guerrilla group was also ''playing for time.'' **********The organization's leader, Yasir Arafat, still appears to be hoping that pressure on the United States from Saudi Arabia, as well as pressure on Israel from the European Economic Community, the United States and domestic critics may avert an Israei assault on west Beirut, where 6,000 to 7,000 guerrillas are trapped. **********The Threat of an Assault **********Once the threat of an Israeli assault is removed, Palestinian officials said, the P.L.O. leadership will be better able to negotiate the details of their disarmament and future presence in Lebanon. **********But today's events seem to indicate that time is not on the side of the P.L.O.  Senior Lebanese security sources said the Israelis had moved troops trained in street fighting into the hills around Beirut. The troops were said to be backed by a large number of small, Israeli-made Merkava tanks, which are more suitable for urban warfare than the large American-made M-60's also used by Israel. **********The P.L.O.'s Moslem leftist allies are openly calling for the surrender of the guerrillas.  Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Moslems in Lebanon, whose militiamen fought alongside the P.L.O. in southern Lebanon, said today that the battle was lost. ''The P.L.O. has to accept the terms of the victor,'' he said. ''The sooner the Palestinians do that the better.'' 'A Very Sensitive Stage' **********This evening, former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, the principal intermediary between Mr. Habib and Mr. Arafat, declined for the first time to discuss the details of the negotiations. **********Although he did not rule out the possibility of a breakthrough, he said, ''The talks have entered a very sensitive stage and I do not want to say anything that might upset them.'' **********On Monday, Mr. Habib was given the P.L.O.'s proposals for the future presence of the guerrilla group in Lebanon. He relayed them to the Israelis, who reportedly rejected them as ''absurd.'' **********Mr. Habib, in a meeting today with Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan and Foreign Minister Fuad Butros, offered a new set of American questions for the P.L.O. The guerrilla group's answer to them may determine whether the talks continue. Dispute on Disarmament **********Lebanese Government sources familiar with the negotiations said the P.L.O. had accepted the fact that it must neutralize its military and political presence in Lebanon. But they said the guerrillas' idea of how that should be done was totally inconsistent with both the Lebanese and American positions. **********The United States and Lebanon have called for full disarmament of the P.L.O., total Palestinian subservience to the Lebanese authorities and the removal of the guerrilla leadership from Lebanon as soon as possible. **********The P.L.O. Executive Committee met this evening and reaffired its unanimous intention to hold out for a ''symbolic'' military presence under Lebanese Army control as well as an honorable departure for P.L.O. fighters ''if and when they leave Lebanon.'' **********Palestinian and Lebanese Government sources outlined the major points in dispute in the negotiations. 'Absolutely No Way' **********The P.L.O. wants two brigades of the Palestine Liberation Army to be put under the command of the Lebanese Army, similar to the guerrilla group's status in Jordan, Egypt and Syria. A senior Lebanese defense official said there was ''absolutely no way the Lebanese Government would accept this.'' **********The Palestinians want between 50 and 75 of their own policemen to be permitted to carry arms and control security within the refugee camps. This demand has also been rejected by the Lebanese. **********The Palestinians want United Nations guarantees that if the P.L.O.  leadership leaves the country the 600,000 Palestinian civilians remaining will not be subjected to Lebanese or Israeli harassment. **********The Lebanese Government is willing to negotiate these assurances, but it is insisting that all the guerrilla fighters who entered Lebanon illegally, particularly after 1970, must leave. In addition, all the Palestinians who remain will once again be under the Department of Refugee Affairs and will not be permitted any extraterritorial previleges. A Diplomatic Mission **********The guerrillas also want the Lebanese Government to reaffirm that the P.L.O. is the sole representative of the Palestinian people and that the guerrillas will be allowed to maintain a mission here with full diplomatic status. In addition, P.L.O. leaders would be permitted to travel in and out of Lebanon after they leave. The Lebanese Government stand on these demands is not yet clear. **********The Palestinians are insisting that any disarmament should be gradual, beginning with the deposit of heavy weapons at a specific location guarded by the Lebanese Army. The Lebanese Army would eventually deploy troops in all refugee camps in west Beirut. If any P.L.O. fighters chose to leave, they would be able to take their weapons with them. **********The Lebanese Government is divided on the issue of arms. The Moslem Cabinet ministers are willing to be flexible about disarmament, but President Elias Sarkis and the Christian Ministers want an immediate and total disarmament. **********The P.L.O. is also demanding American and Soviet guarantees for the safety of any guerrillas who leave Lebanon. And it is insisting that any withdrawal must be with dignity. **********The Moslem ministers are flexible on this point, but the Christians want to get the P.L.O. out of the country any way that they can.Finally, the P.L.O. is unwilling to approve the details of the agreement until the cease-fire is consolidated.  ''We will not negotiate with a gun to our heads,'' said a Palestinian official with knowledge of the meeting. ''If our backs are pushed up against the wall, we will fight before accepting Israeli or Lebanese surrender terms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/business/trico-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRICO INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "TRICO INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/first-union-real-estate-equity-mortgage-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-marc.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRST UNION REAL ESTATE EQUITY & MORTGAGE reports earnings for Qtr to Marc", "print_headline": "FIRST UNION REAL ESTATE EQUITY & MORTGAGE reports earnings for Qtr to Marc", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/07/business/minnesota-fabrics-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MINNESOTA FABRICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "print_headline": "MINNESOTA FABRICS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/business/hunts-invest-in-film-studio.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hunts Invest In Film Studio", "print_headline": "Hunts Invest In Film Studio", "body_text": " **********Sherwood Productions, the fledgling movie studio here that hired David Begelman as president on Aug. 4, is being financed partially by Nelson Bunker Hunt and W.

Last Friday, the futures index closed at 240.5, up from 239.1 on the week, but down from 272.7 a year ago. **********All this was academic, if not amusing, to the small but growing number of investors in commodity funds, almost all of which registered extraordinary gains in assets. Indeed, the gains surpassed those of practically every other investment medium in the first half. **********''Of the 40 commodity funds we monitor, 38 posted gains in assets, quite large gains in fact, while the only losses were of 1.5 and 4.6 percent,'' said Jay Klopfenstein, president of Norwood Securities Inc., a Chicago securities brokerage house that is not involved in commodity futures or funds. **********''We began to look at these funds as part of our research work a few years ago and since then have only followed those that provide us with full disclosure of their operations,'' he said in a telephone interview last week. **********As shown by Mr. Klopfenstein's latest monthly report, which covers the first half and last month's results, the gains for both periods have been ''spectacular, but by no means unusual.'' The reason, he went on, was that the funds, also known as commodity pools, rely on two basic systems that are generally unavailable to the average individual trader. **********One is the extensive use of computers to forecast commodity futures price trends. The other is the willingness to sell short, when the computer signals this course of action. ''Obviously, the pool managers were heavily short during the price decline of the first half,'' Mr. Klopfenstein noted. Most individual speculators are fearful of being short: that is, promising to deliver something they don't own. **********Whether this fear of selling short is a carryover from the futures speculators' earlier trading pattern in securities, as many brokers hold, or some other reason, it has long been a factor that commercial hedgers, who are generally short the market, depend upon to assume the price risks the hedgers seek to avoid. **********But there is no doubt about the reasons for the growing popularity of the commodity funds with small investors in the few years since most of them were organized. These operations were discussed by Alan J. Sarnoff, vice president of the Eastern Capital Corporation, which has underwritten several of these funds, in an interview last week. **********''The typical fund consists of between 5,000 and 15,000 shares that are offered to the public by brokerage houses or other underwriters at $1,000 each, plus a one-time commission, usually of $50 to $70 per share. Once the shares are sold, a professional management team then takes over and runs it. The managers receive their income from flat fees charged each month as well as incentive fees based on the fund's performance, which is usually reported to shareholders each month.'' **********Mr. Sarnoff pointed out that hardly any fund invests all its capital in the futures market at any given time; many keep about half in Treasury bills as a reserve. What about losses? **********''The way most funds have been set up recently, all the investor can lose is half the investment because the funds self-liquidate when the assets reach 50 percent of the original offering price,'' he continued, ''at which time the remaining money is disbursed to the shareholders, who can then recover a portion of their loss as a tax deduction. Some funds disburse part of their gains periodically as dividends; others reinvest all profits.'' **********Shareholders can withdraw their money, usually on 30 days' notice, at certain specified times or at any time. ''By law these conditions are spelled out in the prospectus and investors should read them carefully before investing,'' he cautioned. **********While commodity trading in any form is still considered far from prudent by people accustomed to more traditional investments such as stocks and bonds, the performance of most of the funds, in which nearly $500 million has been invested thus far, has led many to chose them for their Individual Retirement Accounts since the law covering such instruments was liberalized last year. **********The first and thus far the only futures fund specifically for I.R.A. investments was organized by Mr. Sarnoff's company this year as Boston Futures Fund III. It was sold out and began operating last June 3. Funds I and II have been operating as regular funds for several years. **********Because a limit of $2,000 a year has been set on individual investments in I.R.A. accounts, that is the minimum accepted by Boston Futures Fund III.

Three days earlier, attackers sprayed the offices of the Israeli military attache in Paris with machine-gun fire. **********Although a shadowy Beirut-based group called the Lebanese Revolutionary Armed Faction claimed responsibility, Israel accused the Palestine Liberation Organization in the two attacks.

In a letter last week explaining his disapproval, Mr. De Muth cited several reasons, including the council's delay in issuing the regulations until a few days before the comment period had closed; concern that the new requirements might aggravate the reporting requirements on the banks, and the fear of possible ''misinterpretation and misuse'' of public information. **********The new disclosure forms, as planned by the regulators, involve two phases. The first was to have become effective for the quarter ending Sept. 30, but has been delayed for three months. In that phase, all commercial banks will be required to file quarterly reports about past-due loans, interest rate sensitivity, contingent liaibilites and other off-balance-sheet items. Beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 1983, these reports will be made available immediately to the public. **********The second phase, which the council has decided to delay until March 1984, also calls for a more extensive listing of balance-sheet assets and liablilties, statements of income and expenses and supporting schedules.

Sixteen martial law internees had walked out this morning, some into the arms of waiting relatives, some to walk alone to the bus stop 200 yards away. A few stayed behind to see whether their friends would be released. **********One middle-aged woman, dressed in white, had been coming every day since Wednesday. Her husband had been in Bialoleka, southeast of Warsaw, for 221 days. Most of those destined for release had already walked out and she was becoming apprehensive that her husband was among the 637 destined to remain interned. No Advance Notice of Release **********Prison guards offered no help, nor did the Interior Ministry. The internees were not being told in advance of their release, and simply emerged in knots, dazed and surprised, without any idea as to how many others would follow. **********''When they come out and learn how things are,'' one of the women on the bench said, ''some find they were freer inside than out. Some have gone back to their factory to learn they have no job, and their friends are sometimes wary of being too close to them.'' **********The scene in the driveway outside Bialoleka was probably being repeated at detention centers across Poland following Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's announcement Thursday that 1,227 people interned at the time of the imposition of martial law Dec. 13 would be freed. **********Two days after his announcement, it became clear that he had not meant the immediate release of those 1,227, but a process that had begun several weeks earlier and would continue for an unknown time more. Dissident's Son Is Freed **********Among those released from Bialoleka was Maciej Kuron, the 22-yearold son of Jacek Kuron, the prominent dissident. He was playing table tennis when a prison officer told him he was leaving.  Within 30 minutes he was out. **********A bear of a man with short hair, long beard and a ready smile, Maciej Kuron seemed unmarked by his seven months in detention, and he said he looked forward to returning to Warsaw University in the fall. His father remains in Bialoleka, where the son saw him only three times in seven months. His mother is hospitalized with tuberculosis she contracted while in detention. **********''There were about 300 detainees in Bialoleka at one time, although by the time I was released only 80 had been there, like me, from Dec. 13,'' Mr. Kuron recounted. **********''Morale was good. We agreed from the outset not to allow any interrogations, and nobody did. It was worst at the beginning when they interned whole families, placing children in foster homes. I was in a cell with a person whose wife died and he had been taking care of his child. **********''The police took the child to a foster home. I was told the child had a terrible shock and is now partly paralyzed, and the father talked about nothing else.'' **********Mr. Kuron said people desperately eager to get out to rejoin children were offered statements of loyalty to sign. Few Signed Loyalty Statement **********Those who did found that they were soon asked to sign another statement, pledging cooperation with the authorities, before they would be released. He said only about 5 percent of the internees at Bialoleka had signed the loyalty statements, and reports from other detention centers gave similar figures. **********Like other detainees, Mr. Kuron reported little direct mistreatment. He recalled only one incident in his seven months in detention. On May 13, the security police ''undressed people with their boots,'' ordering prisoners to undress while they kicked them after the detainees began singing defiant hymns. **********The meager prison food was regularly augmented by generous parcels from relatives and the Red Cross. But facilities were cramped and primitive, and after an inspection on July 5, the International Committee for the Red Cross declared conditions at Bialoleka worse than at any other camp. **********The detainess at Bialoleka were forbidden to hold seminars or meetings. But Mr. Kuron described an elaborate information system that included radio receivers, regular information on the Solidarity underground outside, and even internal news bulletins passed from hand to hand. Solidarity Leaders Isolated **********But if the rank-and-file detainees enjoyed a limited amount of contact, Mr. Kuron's father and the members of Solidarity's National Commission, who were held under rigid isolation, did not. **********These men were held in a prison cell block where they could gather only two at a time and where meetings with outsiders were rarely allowed. **********Mr. Kuron said the authorities made only a half-hearted effort to indocrinate detainees. In the beginning, a lecturer was brought in to discuss the economic situation, but the response was so negative that there were no further lectures. **********Mr. Kuron also reported only limited receptivity to the Government's offer of emigration visas for any Solidarity leaders who wanted them. Of those at Bialoleka, he said, only 10 or 15 of the 500 or so internees who passed through while he was there agreed to emigrate, and none were well known. **********Western embassies expect the interest in emigration visas to grow if released detainees begin having difficulties finding jobs. General Jaruzelski's announcement that Poles outside Poland would be allowed to return freely was expected to further enhance the appeal of emigration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/washington-homes-inc-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WASHINGTON HOMES INC reports earnings for Yr to July 31", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON HOMES INC reports earnings for Yr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/05/business/l-sound-and-fury-131460.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUND AND FURY", "print_headline": "SOUND AND FURY", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: ''Our national discussion of poverty is superficial,'' wrote Professor Bergmann.

That conclusion is not only superficial, but empirical studies have indicated that it is false. **********It's discouraging that such myths are still repeated by economists who have honest intentions, now that the Federal Government has sponsored four income maintenance experiments, designed and operated by economists, specifically to test labor supply response to unconditional income guarantees more generous than those provided by existing welfare programs. **********The experiments began in 1968 with the New Jersey Graduated Work Incentive Experiment. Since several three- and five-year samples have been concluded, most recently those in Seattle and Denver, analysis of the labor supply results has appeared so frequently in economic journals that economists, at least, should be aware that the work reductions of able-bodied adults supporting families are most certainly not ''beyond bounds,'' even in response to an income guarantee at 135 percent of the poverty line. **********The percentage reductions in hours of work of prime age males, as measured against control samples not eligible for those income guarantees, have fallen in the range 1 percent to 8 percent. Those empirically quantified work reduction averages are typically characterized as ''moderate.'' **********From 1968 through 1980, the four experiments cost taxpayers about $30 million in benefit payments and $80 million in administration, data collection, and research costs. Analysis of the data has advanced standards of econometric sophistication. Methodologies developed in the experiments have been adopted by economists investigating quite a few other topics. **********Because so much expertise and money has been spent on the income guarantee experiments, attention and respect should be paid to the evidence they offer about the labor supply, as attention and respect has been paid to the statistical techniques that produced that evidence.

If the traders could, then longs would surely opt to buy gold at a lower price and shorts would have sold bullion when prices were much higher. **********Oddly, gold traders can benefit from hindsight through the use of ''lookback'' options sold through brokerage houses by the Mocatta Metals Corporation. With these lookback options, the investor has the right to buy gold at its lowest price during the life of the ''call'' option, while those who bought ''puts'' may sell the metal at its highest price. **********By definition, a call option gives the buyer the right - but not the obligation - to purchase the underlying commodity at a predetermined price during a specified period of time. A put option is the right to sell it under the same conditions. How much the options cost the buyer depends on the current value of the commodity, the time remaining in the option and related factors that determine the odds for making a profit. The cost of all options is the premium, plus the brokerage commissions. **********Last Thursday, when the price of gold bullion was quoted at $330 an ounce, based on the then London afternoon fixing, Terry S. Mayer, director of marketing at Mocatta Metals, explained the new lookback options as follows: **********''Suppose one buys a three, six, nine-month or longer call option on gold at $330 a ounce and, during the life of the option, the price drops to, say, $270, before coming back to, let us say, $330.  Ordinarily, the buyer of the call would be out the premium and use this loss as a tax deduction because it would not be worthwhile to exercise the option. But with a lookback call option, the buyer has the right to buy the bullion at $270 an ounce, its lowest price, and thus either make a profit or at least offset the premium cost.'' **********Again, with gold selling at $330, the strike price of a typical put option would be much lower, say, $270, for comparision purposes. If the price came back to $330 toward the option's expiration, the buyer of the lookback put option could exercise it at its highest price, $330, and acheive the same results as the lookback call buyer. **********''Obviously, the odds on a lookback option are more in favor of the buyer and the premium on the standard 100-ounce option is also slightly higher than on ordinary calls and puts,'' Mr. Mayer said.  ''As for commissions, that depends on the brokers who retail our options. Mocatta doesn't deal with the public.'' **********What about the premiums? Mr. Mayer pointed to a small computer in his office and said: ''As with any commodity, prices are changing every moment, depending on changing market prices, the flow of call and put orders and other factors that are constantly being computed.  Every broker that handles our options has one of these machines and can execute an order in seconds, even faster than it takes to execute a futures trade. **********The reference to futures was intended because commodity options, including gold bullion, on regulated exchanges is due to start within a few months. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has set up a pilot program that will let each exchange offer options on one of their futures markets. Most of the nation's 11 major commodity exchanges chose options on their most popular futures market. New York's Commodity Exchange, the biggest metals futures market, has chosen to trade gold bullion options. **********But Mocatta Metals, which is the American affiliate of the 310-year-old London brokerage house of Mocatta Goldsmid Ltd., is pleased at this development because it will create a much greater and, most important, legitimate market in options. Since June 1978, Mocatta and a few small bullion dealers have had a virtual monopoly as dealers in options. **********The reason: the C.F.T.C., unable to halt the widespread frauds in dealer options at the time, outlawed all options, except those offered by such reputable bullion dealers as Mocatta, which has long had a policy of buying back any of its options (at current values) at any time, although it is legally not bound to do so. **********In any case, Mocatta has been offering options on many commodities, all through brokerage houses. Besides gold, silver and platinum bullion, these include various gold bullion coins, copper and United States coins with silver content. And they will soon offer options in foreign currencies that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange has requested Federal permission to trade later this year. **********Another reason why Mr. Mayer welcomes exchange-traded options is that much of Mocatta's business is ''customized'' to suit trade and individual clients. ''We don't think the standardized exchange options will compete with our lookback options or our new 'trading range' options that we plan to introduce in a few weeks,'' he noted. **********Trading range options will offer investors less expensive premiums because they will limit the profit obtainable on these instruments.  For example, Mr. Mayer said that the ordinary or lookback option sets no limit on the profit a buyer may make. ''But,'' he went on, ''suppose one bought a $400 gold call and was willing to forgo all profits above, say, $425. In such cases, the premium would be sharply reduced. The same would apply to put options. In other words, why pay premiums for unrealistic profits when more reasonable investment gains can be had for more modest outlays.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/08/world/around-the-world-us-explosives-expert-s-digging-out-sidewinder.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.  Explosives Expert s Digging Out Sidewinder", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S.  Explosives Expert s Digging Out Sidewinder", "body_text": " **********American explosives experts used jackhammers today to dig out a live United States Air Force Sidewinder air-t o-air missile embedded in the concrete floor ofa barn. **********The police said the experts were not expected to finish until Monday.

Project Estimates at Issue **********''I would not have bought my Tosco stock,'' Mr. Good said, if he had realized that the difference in estimates for the cost of the shale-oil plant, known as the Colony Shale Oil Project. ''I suspect that many of you feel the same way.'' **********Mr. Good acquired his Tosco holdings for $50 million, or an average price of about $25 a share, including interest payments. Tosco shares, which sold for a high of $45 late in 1980, closed today at $14.125 a share, up 75 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Mr. Good also criticized Tosco for spending $40 million last year in ''unallocated'' corporate expenses. He charged that much of the money was wasted on staff at its headquarters for the ''preservation of Mr. Winston's personal fiefdom.'' Microphone Disconnected **********At one point, Mr. Good's microphone was disconnected at the direction of Erwin Millimet, a lawyer seated at Mr. Winston's right who ran much of the meeting. He warned Mr. Good against ''personal attacks'' on any Tosco officials. **********Earlier, Mr. Millimet, a partner in Stroock, Stroock & Lavan, a Manhattan law firm, noted that a ''sergeant-at-arms'' was present and added, ''It is hoped that it will not be necessary to ask an unruly shareholder to leave.'' **********Stern-faced security guards in business suits were evident in several areas of the ballroom throughout the meeting.  On the day of Exxon's announcement, Mr. Winston said Tosco would retain about $100 million in profit from the Exxon payment after various expenses. Mr. Good said the amount does not include another $120 million in cash Tosco accounted for as repayment of invested capital. **********In response to a shareholder's question, Mr. Winston said today that the amount of a special dividend had not been determined by Tosco's directors. He indicated earlier that the dividend would be less than $4 a share. **********In his comments, Mr. Winston, a Harvard-trained lawyer who joined Tosco in 1962, said that the company, the nation's second-largest independent refiner, had come through the oil glut in better shape than most of its competitors. Optimistic Forecast for '83 **********He said he anticipated that gasoline prices would rise again before the end of the third quarter. ''Our prospects for 1983 look quite bright,'' he said. **********Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Winston denied that Tosco had been aware of Exxon's higher estimates for the Colony project last fall. ''At no time did I have any indication that Exxon was considering a shutdown of the project,'' he added. **********He reiterated that Tosco still believes that shale-oil production is workable. He said Tosco will step up its lobbying with the Reagan Administration and Congress to gain more Government funding. **********He added that Tosco's negotiations to sell a portion of Tosco's large holdings of shale-oil property in Colorado and Utah to Japanese interests, which he declined to identify, were continuing. **********''It is gratifying to see that there remains strong interest elsewhere in the world in shale-oil development,'' he said.  Mr. Good said that if his slate of five nominees to the Tosco board is defeated, he might continue to buy Tosco shares. He said he would sell many of his real estate holdings, valued at more than $100 million, to finance the purchases. **********Asked if he would lead another proxy fight in 1983 should he lose, he replied, ''I might own the company by then.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/04/world/london-ordering-35-ship-task-force-to-the-falklands.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Rattner", "pub_date": "1982-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LONDON ORDERING 35-SHIP TASK FORCE TO THE FALKLANDS", "print_headline": "LONDON ORDERING 35-SHIP TASK FORCE TO THE FALKLANDS", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking during the first weekend session of Parliament since the Suez crisis of 1956, said today that the Falkland Islands ''remain British territory'' and ordered a large naval task force to the South Atlantic. **********In addition, Mrs. Thatcher announced that Argentina's financial assets in Britain would be frozen and other economic sanctions would be imposed. **********In Buenos Aires, the military Government said it would ''not retreat'' from its seizure of the islands. It broke diplomatic relations with Britain, in response to a similar move by London on Friday, and froze British assets in Argentina. (Page 18.) **********Mrs. Thatcher, in a 24-minute opening address to the packed chamber of the House of Commons, declared: ''The Falkland Islands and their dependencies remain British territory; no aggression and no invasion can alter that simple fact.  It is the Government's object to see the islands are free from occupation.'' Calls for Ministers to Quit **********Nonetheless, politicians of both the Conservative and Labor Parties repeatedly called during the tumultuous three-hour session today for the resignations of key ministers. **********The Prime Minister, who canceled all weekend engagements to remain at 10 Downing Street, steadfastly refused to say what action would be taken when the large convoy, which will consist of 35 to 40 ships representing about two-thirds of Britain's naval strength, reaches the Falklands in about two weeks. **********''I stress I cannot foretell what orders the task force will receive as they proceed,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, somber and choosing her words deliberately. ''That will depend on the situation at the time.'' **********The British action of freezing Argentine assets closely resembled the American freezing of Iranian assets during the period of the hostages' captivity. **********Traditionally, the freezing of assets represents an extreme and unusual step, just short of war. The British action is estimated to apply to $1.5 billion in gold, securities and currency deposits, onequarter of what Britain is believed to have at risk in Argentina. **********In addition, new export credits to Argentina were suspended. And late this afternoon the Government announced that it would halt sales of military equipment, aircraft and spare parts to Argentina. Most arms sales to the military Government are already banned because of its record on human rights, but last year Britain sold $22 million worth of military equipment to Argentina. **********Britain's strategy clearly rests on the hope that the impending arrival of such a large military force will spur Argentina to accept a diplomatic solution. **********But near the end of the session of Parliament, John Nott, the Defense Secretary, who has become the target of the harshest criticism, said that if diplomacy ''fails - and it will probably do so - we have no choice but to press forward with our plans.'' Mr.  Nott, whitefaced and shaking, was repeatedly drowned out by jeers from the opposition. **********The Defense Secretary said the task force would be led by the 19,500-ton aircraft carrier Invincible, which will sail from Portsmouth Monday. The force will include a second carrier, destroyers, frigates, landing ships, 1,000 marine commandos and a ''substantial'' number of other troops, military officials said. **********The force will include Queen Elizabeth's second son, the 22-yearold Prince Andrew, who has been serving as a helicopter pilot aboard the Invincible. **********The Government has refused to provide military details, but a substantial portion of the convoy is believed to be already under way. The ships are expected to rendezvous at the mid-Atlantic island of Ascension, which is being restocked with ammunition, fuel and supplies by Royal Air Force transport planes from Lyneham Air Base in Wiltshire. **********The Defense Ministry refused to discuss reports by an Argentine news agency that the nuclear submarine Superb could reach the Falkland Islands by Sunday. **********Whatever the outcome of the crisis, it appeared certain to have substantial ramifications for Britain's military spending plans.  Although this nation has been increasing military outlays faster than any other in Europe, it has simultaneously begun reducing the size of the surface navy, a cutback which now seems in substantial jeopardy. 'Certain Heads Must Roll' **********The criticism of the Thatcher Government was notable for the intensity of the attacks from Conservatives over the lack of anticipatory measures. Mr. Nott and Lord Carrington, the Foreign Secretary, were singled out for leaving Britain in the difficult position of trying to regain control over the islands, which have been a British possession since 1833. **********''In order to save the Prime Minister and the Government, I am afraid that certain heads must roll, including that of the Foreign Secretary and, I very much regret to say, that of the Defense Secretary as well,'' said John Stokes, a Conservative Member of Parliament. **********In the debate, several Conservative backbenchers joined opposition demands for the resignation of Mr. Nott and Lord Carrington over the handling of the affair. **********''What has happened to the Falklands is a disgrace to the British flag,'' said a Convervative M.P., Nicholas Winterton, calling on both officials to take the ''honorable'' course and quit. 'Skin Off a Rice Pudding' **********''In the next week or two, this House, the nation and Mrs. Thatcher herself will find out of what mettle she is made,'' said Enoch Powell, the former Conservative Cabinet official, urging a military attack. **********Lord Wigg, a Laborite, said, ''We have spent 111 billion pounds on defense since the end of the last war and we can't knock the skin off a rice pudding.'' **********Another full-scale debate in Parliament on the Falkland situation will be held Tuesday and Wednesday and an investigation will be begun by the Commons Select Committee on Defense. **********Substantial unhappiness with the Thatcher Government also resulted when Humphrey Atkins, the Deputy Foreign Secretary, apologized for ''misleading'' members Friday about when he was last in touch with the Falkland Islands. **********Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament that there were no civilian casualties in the Falklands in the takeover, but implied that the marines put up resistance. **********The Prime Minister said that she had spoken by telephone to the ousted British Governor, Rex Hunt, after he was flown to Uruguay by occupation forces, and that he reported that the marines ''were superb - they acted in the best tradition.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher said Mr. Hunt told her the Falkland Islanders were ''in tears and don't want to be Argentinian.'' Despite the Government's initial inaction, the Prime Minister said it would have been absurd to dispatch the British fleet ''every time there is bellicose talk in Buenos Aires.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/25/business/myers-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MYERS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "MYERS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/26/world/fewer-vietnamese-reach-thai-coast.html": {"writer_name": "Colin Campbell", "pub_date": "1982-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FEWER VIETNAMESE REACH THAI COAST", "print_headline": "FEWER VIETNAMESE REACH THAI COAST", "body_text": " **********Vietnamese ''boat people'' have been arriving on the southern coast of Thailand in markedly smaller numbers this year than in the first three months of last year or the year before, according to a field officer here for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. **********Seventy-six boats bearing 1,977 Vietnamese arrived on the southern coast of Thailand, between Chumphon and the Malaysian border, in the first three months of this year. The total compares with 5,935 arrivals in the same period of 1981 and 5,672 in the first three months of 1980. **********The proportion of boats that have been attacked by Thai pirates has remained the same, according to preliminary statistics based on reports from United Nations receiving points for refugees up and down the coast. **********Last year, four out of five such boats arriving here were said to have been attacked while at sea. Among those that were attacked, the ''average'' boat was attacked 3.5 times. Robbings and beatings of those aboard continued unabated, and on 44 percent of the boats that were attacked in 1981, the women were raped. Statistics Holding Steady **********''These statistics are holding for 1982,'' said the United Nations officer here in Songkhla, the largest port in southern Thailand. The official asked not to be named on the ground that such statistics should come from United Nations officials in Bangkok. **********The Gulf of Thailand has been virtually unpatrolled by armed Thai Government vessels since last September when a patrol program financed by the United States expired. **********A naval patrol program similar to the one abandoned in September, but organized this time by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is expected to be presented soon for the Thai Government's approval. Eight donor nations have agreed to contribute $3.6 million for the purchase and operation for six months of four patrol boats, four Vietnamese fishing boats for use as decoys, four Thai trawlers, and a computer with which the Thai Government plans to keep track of the registration numbers of fishing boats in its coastal provinces. **********The High Commissioner's office first proposed late last year that it take over the formerly American-backed program. The Thai Government, however, objected to a provision that certain foreign diplomats in Bangkok act as monitors. It was unclear here this week whether diplomatic monitors were still part of the United Nations plan. Camp's Population Down **********The Songkhla camp for boat people, which held more than 6,000 people for long periods of 1980 and 1981, had a population of 536 today. The camp is now officially considered a transit facility, and the Thai Ministry of Interior regularly buses its population, gathered from smaller camps along the coast, to a larger camp north of Bangkok. **********In a recent case that is said to be typical, 11 Vietnamese men in a fishing boat landed March 28 on a Union Oil Company rig in the Gulf of Thailand about 150 miles north of here. Eleven others -four women and their babies - who had left South Vietnam in the same boat had been abducted in an attack by pirates, they reported. **********On April 9, the Herta S, a ship privately financed in Western Europe that assists boat people, visited the 11 men, who were being kept on a barge attached to the oil company's rig. The ship provided them with a doctor and two days ago, after United Nations officials had been granted permission by local Thai authorities, the men were brought ashore. **********Last year, 211 Vietnamese boat people were reportedly abducted, nearly all of them by Thai pirates. Of those, 133 are still missing.  Some have been taken to isolated islands. Others, according to local accounts, have ended up in the brothels of Hat Yai, a busy tourist center a few miles west of Songkhla. Boats Arriving Now Are Smaller **********The Vietnamese boats that have been arriving since last October, when the flood of boat people began to ebb, have been smaller than earlier boats and have carried fewer people per boat than in 1980 and early 1981, when 300 or 400 refugees would often pack themselves into one overloaded vessel. **********A Vietnamese boat that arrived here March 9, for example, was carrying 32 people - 15 men, 10 women and 7 children. The boat is still stranded in front of the Samila Hotel - a reminder that this long, spectacular coast of sandy beaches and coconut palms, a haven for tourists as well as fishermen and pirates, received 737 Vietnamese refugees during March. **********Nearly all the recent boat people have been ethnic Vietnamese. In 1979 and for a time afterward many of those leaving Vietnam by boat were ethnic Chinese. **********The United States is expected to be the largest contributor to the international program designed to reinstitute Thailand's antipiracy patrols. Among the other donor nations are Australia, Norway, Switzerland, France and West Germany. **********In early June Songkhla, Thailand's main receiving point for seaborne refugees, will be one of the sites for a major naval exercise involving the United States Seventh Fleet. The operation, named Cobra Gold, will include a landing by United States marines as well as joint maneuvers with the Royal Thai Navy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/28/business/camco-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CAMCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/02/world/the-un-today-aug-2-1982-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

The Greens, an ecological party opposed to NATO and its plans to station new nuclear missiles here, attracted the ballots of many young people, who in the past were considered Social Democratic supporters. **********Since the 13-year-old national coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats won re-election in October 1980, the Bonn Government has been weakened by strains between the coalition partners, growing economic problems and dissension in the Social Democratic party between those backing Mr. Schmidt and leftists who have challenged his security policy and the strong alliance with the United States. Free Democrats Also Gain **********Today's election results gave the Christian Democrats, who have governed alone in Lower Saxony since 1978, their best showing in the state since 1947. The Greens, who are believed to have profited from scandals in labor unions allied to the Social Democrats and from bribery investigations involving aides of the Chancellor, entered the State Legislature for the first time. The Free Democrats, who failed to win representation in the legislature four years ago, returned to the parliament by winning more than 5 percent of the vote. **********On the basis of official preliminary results from all polling stations in Lower Saxony, the Christian Democrats won 50.7 percent of the vote, compared with 48.7 percent in the 1978 election. The Social Democrats fell to 36.5 percent, down from 42.2 percent four years ago. The Free Democrats won 5.9 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in 1978, and the Greens got 6.5 percent, compared with 3.9 percent in 1978. **********The state election was the first of four this year in West Germany. Mr. Schmidt's coalition will probably face a crisis if the state government supporting the national coalition is defeated by the Christian Democrats either in Hamburg in June or in Hesse in September. **********Beyond the psychological effects of such a defeat, an opposition victory in either state would mean that Christian Democrats would attain a two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house of Parliament, whose members are appointed by the states. This would enable the opposition to block any legislation initiated by the Government. 'Loser Is Named Helmut Schmidt' **********''The loser of the election is named Helmut Schmidt,'' said Helmut Kohl, the Christian Democrat's parliamentary chief and former candidate for Chancellor. **********Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic chairman, said the results showed that the national coalition had not been ''convincing enough.'' **********Ernst Albrecht, the Christian Democratic Minister-President in Lower Saxony, said: ''The obvious difficulties of the Social Democrats are only beginning. The coalition at the national level is clearly at an end. It's truly half dead. I just don't see how they can work out of this situation.'' **********Spokesmen for both the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats, however, insisted that the results would not affect their national alliance. **********Peter Glotz, national manager of the Social Democratic Party, acknowledged the sharpness of his party's defeat, which, he said, showed ''that the attitude toward us is poor at the present time.'' But the election involved the state alone, he said, and nothing more.  Leftists Start New Party **********Gunter Verheugen, the general secretary of the Free Democratic Party, said the Greens had won entry into parliament in Lower Saxony at the expense of the Social Democrats. But he acknowledged that the victory by the opposition ''won't simplify things, although it doesn't start any irreversible process.'' **********Additional problems for the Social Democrats developed over the weekend with the founding of a new left-wing party. Called the Democratic Socialists, the party is led by Manfred Coppik and Karl Heinz Hansen, two members of Parliament who had renounced their membership in Mr. Schmidt's party with accusations that it had become a vassal of the United States on security issues and an ally of big capitalism in economic matters. They said the party would enter the elections in Hesse. **********The new party called for a ''decisive demonstration'' against the policies of President Reagan when he visits West Germany June 9 and 10 for a summit meeting of NATO member nations. **********A spokesman for the Greens expressed interest in a ''fruitful dialogue'' with the new Democratic Socialists."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/25/business/personal-finance-dividing-future-benefits-in-divorce.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1982-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Personal Finance; DIVIDING FUTURE BENEFITS IN DIVORCE", "print_headline": "Personal Finance; DIVIDING FUTURE BENEFITS IN DIVORCE", "body_text": " **********WHEN couples begin to wrangle over the specific details of a divorces ettlement, the first things they tend to think about are who gets t he house, furniture, car, stock and children. But equally important m atters, such as whether the wife will be covered under her husband'sg roup health insurance plan or have a claim against his pension, tendt o get overlooked. **********''With divorce rates where they are, it's surprising that these items haven't become a more important issue,'' said Lloyd M. Kaye of William M. Mercer Inc., a New York employee benefits and compensation consulting firm. **********The precedent for letting a divorced wife share in her former husband's pension is well established. A pension represents income the husband earns during the marriage that is being foregone until his retirement. Marriage is an economic as well as emotional partnership, the argument goes, and so the man's retirement pay should be subject to division in the same way as his current salary and other assets. At the same time, a woman's right to her former husband's group health insurance policy is a murkier issue. A woman can potentially save thousands of dollars over the years if she successfully bargains for a claim against such benefits, or their equivalent in cash or other assets. **********Although a good health insurance policy can be vital to a woman divorced in middle age, especially if she already has health problems, obtaining coverage through her former husband's work policy is virtually impossible if he complies with the rules. And the cost of buying an individual policy can be prohibitive, exceeding $2,000 or $3,000 a year, depending on a woman's health and age. **********''Most group policies are geared to a definition of a worker's dependents, which generally does not include the person's exspouse,'' said Theresa B. Stuchiner, a partner with Kwasha Lipton, an employee benefits consulting firm in Fort Lee, N.J. **********In order to continue coverage for a former spouse, the worker usually neglects to tell his employer about the divorce or falsifies information on the claims form, benefits experts say. ''What typically happens is that the company never finds out about the divorce until the employee remarries,'' Mr. Kaye said. **********A similar situation exists with the health insurance plans that cover Government employees. Military wives, for example, lose their right to free medical care at service bases upon divorce. And while the divorced spouses of Civil Service employees are supposed to have the right to convert their former partners' group medical policies into an individual policy within 30 days, without having to undergo a medical exam, some say the provision is not adequately policed or publicized. **********''I know of one case where an insurance company wrote to a divorced woman who converted and said it would not cover her for the ailment it had been paying for when she was married,'' said Edith Fierst, a private attorney in Washington. **********But help for divorced spouses of military men may be on the way.  The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a bill last week that would allow 180 days' medical care coverage to all former spouses, and continued coverage for former spouses with serious ailments who were married for at least 20 years during a serviceman's career and who do not remarry. And earlier this year, the state of Massachusetts passed a law giving divorced spouses the right to remain in a company group health insurance plan until the nonworking spouse or the insured worker remarries. But the law is applicable only to new contracts and not to existing ones. And in the event of the worker's remarriage, the law gives the former spouse the option of remaining in the group plan or buying an individual plan. THE situation of getting a cut of the husband's benefits is much m ore defined with pensions. ''The basic question is to what extent s he can get at that money,'' said Mrs. Stuchiner. ''It's quite clear t hat the Federal courts will go along with permitting attachment of p ension benefits to support alimony or child support obligations. In m ost of the cases, the courts have leaned over backward to a ccommodate the nonemployee spouse.'' Typically, the cases arise whena former husband has been delinquent in alimony payments or child s upport. **********But there is a complicating piece of law - the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Under Erisa, pension plan administrators are specifically prohibited from assigning a worker's pension to anyone other than the worker. Many divorced husbands and plan sponsors maintain that Erisa overrides state laws that entitled a former wife to claim some portion of the husband's assets. However, lawyers for divorced wives argue that the nonassignment clause in the law was included mainly to prevent creditors from attaching a worker's pension and not for it to be placed beyond the reach and economic needs of his dependents. **********The courts have tended to agree. ''It would be ironic indeed if a provision designed in part to ensure that an employee spouse would be able to meet his obligations to family after retirement were interpreted to permit him to evade them with impunity after divorce,'' said the Federal District Court in northern California in April 1978. **********One notable exception to the trend of court cases favorable to divorced wives was a Supreme Court decision last June that held that a military pension was the ''exclusive property'' of the retiree. The man did not have to divide his retirement pay with his former wife, said the high court, because the Federal military retirement system overrides state community property laws. **********But Congress may soon reverse that situation. When the Senate Armed Services Committee approved last week the bill providing limited health coverage for divorced military wives, it also approved a provision that would restore the right of state courts to include military retirement pay as marital property that may be divided in divorce settlements. **********The situation regarding other Government workers is spotty. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 says that the former wives of foreign service officers who were divorced after Feb. 15, 1981, are entitled to a share of their former husbands' pensions proportionate to the duration of their marriage during the time the men worked for the Foreign Service. **********But the former wives of Civil Service employees, who are not covered by the Social Security system, are not so fortunate. Although the women can claim a part of their former husbands' pensions while the men are alive, they lose the right to a survivor's annuity - which guarantees continued benefits -when the men die. There is a very limited provision that allows the man to give the annuity to his first, rather than his current wife, but the provision is little publicized and consequently little used."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/09/business/little-arthur-d-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LITTLE, ARTHUR D, INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "LITTLE, ARTHUR D, INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/19/business/grupo-alfa-snag.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grupo Alfa Snag", "print_headline": "Grupo Alfa Snag", "body_text": " **********Negotiations have broken off between Grupo Industrial Alfa and the Mexican Government on the country's purchase of some of Alfa's subsidiaries. **********In addition, the Government is refusing to allow Alfa to draw on an unused line of credit, money that Alfa was depending on to cover a cash shortage.

Men Are Not Indicted **********The families of the slain women had been told by the State Department that the men would be indicted today, but the court action was apparently a preliminary procedure. **********Today's development came at a time when the Reagan Administration is seeking to demonstrate that the Salvadoran Government has improved its human rights performance. One of the conditions set by Congress for continuing aid to El Salvador was that there should be progress in the investigation of the slaying of the four Roman Catholic missionaries. **********On Dec. 2, 1980, Ita Ford and Maura Clarke, members of the Maryknoll Order, returned from a trip to Nicaragua and were met at the airport in San Salvador by Dorothy Kazel, an Ursuline nun, and Jean Donovan, a lay worker. All Subject to Threats **********All four had been working in poor communities and had been subjected to threats. Weeks before their killings, a sign was tacked to the door of the parish house where two lived saying that its occupants were ''Communists'' and ''anyone who enters this house will die.'' **********The four were last seen by Canadian missionaries in the baggage area of the airport. Their bodies were found the next morning by villagers in Santiago Nonualco, 15 miles northeast of the air terminal. They had been shot in the head, partly disrobed and beaten. National Guard soldiers quickly buried the bodies, but a judge subsequently ordered them exhumed. **********The case drew great attention i n the United States and led the Carter Admini stration to suspend aid to El Salvador on Dec. 5, 1980. The controver sy grew with suggestions that the Salvadoran military was stalling the investigation because of signs pointing to the involvement o f ranking military officials. **********The brother of one of the slain women said Tuesday that he thought the time it had taken to bring the soldiers to court was an indication that higher-ranking members of the Salvadoran military were involved. **********Robert E. White, the American Ambassador at the time of the murders, charged that ''the message we were getting was that this would crack the military wide open.'' **********Under United States pressure, a special investigating commission headed by a Salvadoran Army colonel was appointed, but last November American officials here said that it was not actively pursuing the investigation. **********The judge in charge of the case, Mario Alberto Rivera, said it was at a ''dead end.'' He had assumed the case after the sudden resignation of a predecessor, and shortly afterward he too quit. **********Ballistics and fingerprint tests by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation resulted in the arrest of two National Guard soldiers in April 1981. Four other National Guardsmen who were on patrol with them on the night of the killings were also arrested at the time. Two were later released and two more guardsmen were arrested last month. Two Kept Apart From Others **********The six men presented to Judge Bernado Rauda Murcia today were Luis Antonio Colindres Aleman, Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, Jose Roberto Canjura Moreno, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios, Daniel Canales Ramirez and Salvador Rivera Franco. **********They stood in pairs, handcuffed together and dressed in rumpled civilian clothes. Their hair was unkempt and only one was cleanshaven. They alternately kept their heads lowered, some shielding their faces with their hands, and chatted with the blackhelmeted former colleagues guarding them. **********Two were kept apart from the other four. There have been reports that new evidence leading to today's proceedings was obtained through confessions. **********According to a letter submitted to the judge by the Commander in Chief of the National Guard, Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, five of the men were discharged from the National Guard Tuesday and arrested by civil authorities at 6 P.M. The other was arrested the day before. **********Accompanying the letter was a 56-page investigative report compiled by the military that was not made public. The letter said that the report included a statement of a former National Guard soldier whom the letter identified as a ''witness.'' General Casanova wrote that the witness, Julio Cesar Valle, could not be found. The only physical evidence presented by the military authorities to day was a tire, a yellow automobile jack and a burgundy dress from th e scene of the murders, though the F.B.I. has examined rifles, bu llets and a tooth fragment. **********Court authorities declined to answer any questions about the proceedings.

Means Are in Dispute **********The means by which this control was achieved remain in dispute.  The military and the Government of Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, which took power in a coup last March, insist that the renewed support for the regime resulted from a failure by the leftist insurgents to fulfill their promises of a better way of life, combined with a new level of social concern by the Government. **********''They promised them the sky and the earth but they didn't fulfill them,'' said a ranking officer at the Santa Cruz del Quiche military base. ''Instead of leaving a bad situation for a better one, they left a bad situation for something worse.'' **********Others, including church workers and international human rights organizations, say that the military conducted a five-month wave of terror in enough selected locations in the countryside to cause widespread intimidation of the people, thus convincing them that continued support of the leftists was hazardous to their lives. Coercion by the Guerrillas **********One thing on which substantial numbers of both sympathizers and opponents of the leftists have come to agree, as some trappings of peace have returned to the countryside, is that the guerrillas at least partly caused their following to drop to its present low level by forcing unwilling Indians to support their cause. **********''They started out really easy with the people, paying for things, but in the end they did exactly the opposite,'' said a religious leader in Huehuetenango province. ''They forced people, they killed people for joining the civilian patrols. But to my knowledge, they never wiped out a village - at least not in Huehuetenango.'' **********A ranking military officer in Quiche, talking about the villagers of his province, put it this way: ''Why are there no guerrillas?  Because they were the guerrillas.'' **********''The guerrilla in the civil population is like a fish in water,'' he continued, paraphrasing Mao Zedong. ''You take the water from the fish, the fish dies; you take the people from the guerrillas and they die.'' Villages Are Diverse **********While most people here think it premature to say that the guerrilla movement is dead, a journey from Huehuetenango, the provincial capital, to this tiny northern village illustrates many of the changes that have come to the region. **********To get to San Mateo Ixtatan, a policeman in Huehuetenango said, pointing into the mountains, ''you take the north road and climb, climb into the clouds.'' That is just the beginning. Above the clouds, the road continues to wind on and on, a steep, rutted route that gives the impression of driving up a flight of stairs covered with fist-sized rocks. **********Where the road nears a village, every tillable piece of land that is not a sheer drop seems to be planted - with corn, wheat, cabbages, watermelon or other crops - making an orderly patchwork of the mountainside. **********The difficulty of transport has contributed to the survival of strong distinctions among the Indian population; from one village to another just a few miles away there may be a difference in dress and even in language. This physical and cultural separation makes any kind of broad organizing effort problematic. Many Checkpoints on Roads **********Between the provincial capital and this village, 18 civilian patrols man road checkpoints, monitoring the flow of traffic with varying degrees of vigilance. The men speak of their recent lives with varying degrees of relief and concern. **********From one point to another, the movement of the guerrillas' apparent retreat can be traced - from ''todo tranquilo,'' or ''all calm,'' at checkpoints near the outset, to a colorfully unprintable term meaning ''still messed up'' closer to the point where, earlier this month, leftists sledgehammered a concrete electrical tower, dropping the lines into a 4,000-foot canyon and leaving the northern half of Huehuetenango without power. **********The civilian patrols began under President Romeo Lucas Garcia, who was subsequently overthrown, but have been stepped up dramatically under General Rios Montt's ''rifles and beans'' program of pacification and rural aid. The Government insists the patrols are voluntary, but most of the participants believe otherwise. **********''They threaten you with punishment if you don't serve - put you in prison,'' said Clemente Francisco, who was manning a checkpoint near the village of Soloma. Another problem, he said, was that manning the post - which he had done 24 times since July 1 - took time from tilling his land, ''and we have big families to take care of.'' No Gerrillas Are Sighted **********None of the men at the checkpoints reported having seized or even seen a guerrilla since they started patrolling with their sticks, slingshots, flintlock rifles or M-1's earlier this year, and some were beginning to have doubts, particularly since in Huehuetenango few have received any of the ''beans'' promised by the Government. **********''We are fulfilling the orders of Rios Montt,'' said Fernando Joaquin. ''They say they will give us something later.'' He added that the patrols had been keeping track of the hours they served and hoped to see some reward for their efforts later in the month. **********Elsewhere along the route, Indian villagers, some of them women with babies in slings on their backs, can be seen among thousands of fallen pine trees. At the military's behest, they are cutting a swath 20 to 30 yards deep away from the road to remove cover that might be used for guerrilla attacks. **********While there are still scattered reports of military men stealing from vilagers, a change in tactics has led to a marked improvement in the relations between the Indians and the soldiers in this region.  The change is noticed and discussed by soldiers although their superiors will not acknowledge it. 'We Have Dialogues' **********''Now we talk to the people, we have dialogues,'' said one of several soldiers guarding workers who were trying to erect a wooden pole to replace a shattered electrical tower. ''It's better; it's less dangerous for us. Before we harassed each other.'' **********Some people here see the patrols less as self-defense and more as a means of forcing the Indians to commit themselves by working against the leftists. **********An occasional adobe house displays a slogan scrawled in spraypainted black letters: ''Not a piece of bread or a tortilla for the guerrilla.'' **********And the military has taken to putting signs on some of the electrical towers it replaces, in both Spanish and Indian dialect, saying: ''We the poor of these places and villages suffer more if we don't have light from light bulbs. With candles or gas we waste a lot of money. We plead with you not to knock down this post.'' New Problems for Indians **********The speed with which villagers moved from insurgency to counterinsurgency has created some new problems. In some places, villagers have turned on one another. There have been several reports of Indians who originally encouraged their neighbors to support the leftists now returning, under military pressure, to point out those who ''collaborated.'' **********A church worker in Huehuetenango province, who had earlier seemed sympathetic to the leftists' aims, said he sees a three-stage program by the military: first, intimidate the villagers; second, control them; third, be nice to them. **********''The people wanted to get free of the guerrillas; they just couldn't stand it anymore,'' he said. ''It's an awful tough thing to have two enemies out there.'' **********While the church worker acknowledged that the program seemed to be bringing a level of peace to the countryside, he worried about the effect on the Indian culture. **********''What's happening to the Indian today when he's forced to go on civil patrol, when he's forced to do all these things?'' he asked.  ''What's going on inside of the Indian person? What's being done to the culture? You can just feel that it's hurting.'' Administration Cites Gains **********The present state of relative peace in the countryside has been cited by the Reagan Administration as evidence that the human rights situation here is improving under General Rios Montt -a preliminary step toward allowing Guatemala once again to receive United States military aid, which has officially been cut off since 1977 because of human rights concerns. **********The questions the Government here has had difficulty answering is how, after years of battling the guerrillas, calm was so quickly restored and why, if the guerrilla threat has been vanquished as President Rios Montt says, military aid is still necessary. **********Amnesty International, the human rights group, maintained in a report earlier this year that peace came at the price of some 2,600 Indian lives, many of them women and children, as the military systematically attempted to eliminate guerrilla leaders and instill fear in their supporters. Church sources place the figure still higher. Refugees interviewed along the border with Mexico have told harrowing stories of the destruction of their villages by Government security forces. **********President Rios Montt, providing answers to written questions, dismissed the charges as ''lies, falsely promoted by entities that aid subversion.'' **********''I can say with total honesty,'' he asserted, ''that I have never ordered the killing of one single person, much less 2,600.'' He said the Government was winning over the people because ''there is now in Guatemala a Government that is concerned with the wellbeing of 70 percent of the people, the ethnic Indians that inhabit the major part of our territory.'' Army Rules More Blunt **********The army, in its written rules of engagement, is somewhat more blunt in describing its means: ''Destroy, neutralize or capture the permanent or clandestine guerrilla forces; win back the civil population that supports or tolerates whatever form of subversion; protect the population and help it in its development.'' **********''Subversion,'' it adds, ''should be combated using its methods and techniques. A disinformation plan should always be in execution.'' Military officers assert that, while combating the guerrillas more aggressively in recent months, they did not intentionally kill civilians. **********''Whenever there is a clash between the army and the guerrillas, some civilians are lost,'' said a military officer at Santa Cruz del Quiche. **********Asked how many civilians had died in this manner, he said, ''Not as many as you would imagine from reading The New York Times or The Washington Post.'' **********Another officer added: ''There was a period of more force, with more combats, but we were careful. I wasn't an assasssin a year ago and I'm not an assassin now. I've been doing this for 20 years.'' Diminished Need Is Noted **********While President Rios Montt continues to seek some military aid - aircraft parts and other items but, he says, ''nothing sophisticated or expensive'' -his field officers say the need for this type of help has diminished. **********''We don't need any military help,'' a ranking officer said, ''not because we are self-sufficient but because the problem of subversion is not a military problem but a problem of economic development. We need economic help.'' **********While some here have taken encouragement from the military's recently increased attention toward providing aid to civilians, some concerns linger, particularly over what the Government's response would be if the guerrillas regrouped and renewed their efforts. **********''The real problem is that there has not been a change in any institution before or after,'' said a church worker. ''There are people who are untouched who were the masterminds of the last regime.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/02/world/38-dead-and-37-are-missing-as-typhoon-strikes-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "38 Dead and 37 Are Missing As Typhoon Strikes in Japan", "print_headline": "38 Dead and 37 Are Missing As Typhoon Strikes in Japan", "body_text": " **********Thirty-eight people were dead and another 37 were missing after a typhoon battered central Japan during the night from the Pacific into the Sea of Japan, the police said today. **********Officials said 78 people were injured as the storm caused floods and hundreds of landslides that destroyed homes and washed out bridges, roads and railway lines. **********Nearly 300 houses were destroyed, and 17,000 flooded and road and rail communications were disrupted over a widespread area, including parts of Tokyo, the police said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/28/business/cannon-mills-chief-resigns.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cannon Mills' Chief Resigns", "print_headline": "Cannon Mills' Chief Resigns", "body_text": " **********Otto G.

The hills form a sharp ridge overlooking a featureless plain leading to the capital and would give the British valuable positions for observation and possibly for artillery. **********British control of the whole ridge would expose enemy forces, bottled up on a thin finger of land jutting into the South Atlantic, to 105-millimeter howitzer fire from one direction and 4.5-inch naval gunfire from the other. **********No Britons Reported Killed **********According to the Press Association, Britain's national news agency, no Britons were killed in the fighting, which was said to have occurred among pockets of snow on the hillsides. The agency reported that some Argentines had been killed and fewer than 10 Britons wounded. **********In Buenos Aires, a brief military communique said that Argentine warplanes had bombed British positions on Mount Kent, which appeared to confirm the statements here that Britain now controlled the peak. **********Britain announced, meanwhile, that first estimates indicated that about 250 enemy soldiers had been killed in the severe fighting around Goose Green last Friday. Over the weekend, the Defense Ministry said that 1,400 Argentines had surrendered and that 16 Britons had been killed in the battle, by far the biggest of the war so far. Argentine Troops Accused **********Maj. Christopher Keeble, the acting commander of the battalion that took Goose Green, charged in a delayed radio broadcast from the front that Argentine soldiers had kept firing after raising white flags. **********''They fought until they realized they were beaten,'' Major Keeble told Jeremy Hands of Britain's commercial television service. ''Then they showed the white flag. Then they fought a bit further. That's what sickened me, especially when you look into the loss of one particular officer's life.'' **********The battalion commander, Lieut. Col. Herbert Jones, and two other officers were killed when they led a party of 20 men in wiping out a nest of Argentine heavy machine guns blocking the British advance. **********Brian Hanrahan of the BBC reported late tonight from the South Atlantic that drop tanks of napalm, together with instructions for fitting them to Pucara ground-support aircraft, had been found at Goose Green. British officers fear, he said, that the Argentines may have built up further stocks of napalm at Stanley for use in the climactic battle of the campaign. **********Although it imposed a news blackout on most operational details, the Defense Ministry reported that a C-130 Hercules supply plane had been shot down by a British Sea Harrier about 50 miles north of Pebble Island off West Falkland. **********Hercules transports are usually unarmed, although one was said to have dropped bombs near a British warship over the weekend.  Ian McDonald, the ministry spokesman, said the Harrier involved in downing the supply plane was based on the aircraft carrier Invincible, which Argentina claimed to have put out of action last week. Carrier Reported Undamaged **********Dispatches from the fleet, published in British newspapers this morning, said again that the Invincible was undamaged. They said that an Exocet sea-skimming missile, of the type that sank the destroyer Sheffield, had been fired but had flown wide of its target. **********The ministry also reported that the civilian container ship, Atlantic Conveyor, hit by an Exocet on May 25, had finally sunk. Mr.  McDonald declined to say whether any of the ship's cargo, which included Chinook helicopters and spare parts, had been saved. **********Few details were available, even from unofficial sources, of the operations around Mount Kent. The British main force is said to have reached the peak from the northwest and the Second Battalion of the Parachute Regiment, the victors at Goose Green, to have pushed into the same general area from the southwest. Some sources said that only advance elements had moved that far forward. **********Helicopter gunships and artillery were believed to be supporting the advancing British columns, as well as Sea Harriers. 2 Bridges on the Routes **********An important detail that remained unknown was whether British troops had crossed two strategic bridges that the Argentines may have mined - one spanning the Fitzroy River on the southern track across the island, the other spanning the Murrel River on the northern track. **********Unconfirmed reports here and in Buenos Aires said that a third British column was moving toward Stanley from the north. It was said to be composed of the 3,000 to 3,500 Gurkhas and Scots and Welsh Guards of the Fifth Brigade, who were said to have opened a second beachhead after landing from the assault ships Fearless and Intrepid. **********If Maj. Gen. Jeremy Moore, the marine officer commanding British ground forces, chooses to bring all his combat forces into the battle for Stanley, he will have 7,000 to 8,000 men -about the same number that the Argentines reportedly have in the capital. **********General Moore has two options, military analysts said: to launch an all-out attack on Stanley and its critically important airfield or to besiege it. He also has the authority to offer the Argentine commander, Brig. Gen. Mario Menendez, the chance to surrender, political sources said after a meeting of the war cabinet today. Labor M.P.'s Press Point **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is coming under increased pressure from the opposition Labor Party to make such an offer to save bloodshed and avoid humiliation of the junta in Buenos Aires, in the hope that in such circumstances a long-term settlement might be easier. The Argentine Foreign Minister, Nicanor Costa Mendez, has said in the past that the word ''surrender'' is not in his Government's vocabulary. **********British journalists were told in background briefings at the Defense Ministry today that no all-out assault on Stanley would be possible until supplies had been brought up from the original beachhead on San Carlos Bay, now more than 40 miles behind the British spearheads. But such briefings have sometimes proved incorrect in recent days. **********At the beachhead, arrangements were completed for the transfer of men wounded in earlier fighting.

Since the winter of 1981 Kosovo has been the scene of repeated irredentist riots, the worst of which caused nine deaths. **********For several years the Tirana leadership under the Communist Party secretary, Enver Hoxha, the longest-ruling leader in the Balkans, has been circulating maps of a Greater Albania that encompasses an area more than twice the size of contemporary Albania. **********But the National Conference Devoted to the Formation of the Albanian People, Their Language and Culture, convening under Mr.  Hoxha's aegis, would appear to carry the national goals a step beyond the maps. Albania acquired its modern frontiers by fiat of the great powers at the end of the first Balkan War in 1912. Historical-Political Significance **********While most scholars over the last century appear to agree that the Albanians probably derive from the ancient Illyrians, a group of tribes that spread up the Adriatic Coast to the edge of present-day Italy and eastward to the Danube, the conference represents the first time that this academic assumption has acquired a historic-political connotation in terms of Albanian territorial claims. **********In effect, Professor Buda asserted that today's Albanians - the 2.7 million in Albania proper and the nearly 2 milllion beyond the frontiers - can trace their origins directly back to Balkan Peninsula people who came on the scene even before the Greeks. **********The Balkans are full of these kinds of backdated ethnic claims.  The contemporary Rumanians hark back to the ancient Dacians, who were conquered by the Romans in the second century; the Bulgarians look back to ancient Thrace; the Serbs recall a short-lived medieval empire that stretched across parts of Albania and Greece, and the Greeks, having ranged as far as Gilbraltar in the west and India in the east, also claim a chunk of Macedonia. Albanian Claim Is Oldest **********The Albanian-Illyrian claim is the oldest, however, since the Illyrians were colonized by Greeks in the seventh century B.C. They were cited by Herodotus and other Greek historians. They defied the expanding Roman Empire under their Queen, Teuta, and it took two Roman invasions to subdue them. The history of the Albanians, like that of the Illyrian tribes, has principally been a matter of internal feuds and struggles against invaders. **********Another Albanian scholar who played a central role in the Tirana conference was Prof. Androkli Kostallari, director of Tirana's Institute of Linguistics and Literature. He has specialized in tracing Albanian place names back to the Illyrians. His associate, Prof. Mahri Domi, spoke on ''the forming of the Albanian language.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/31/world/14-die-in-chilean-bus-crash.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "14 Die in Chilean Bus Crash", "print_headline": "14 Die in Chilean Bus Crash", "body_text": " **********Fourteen people died and 70 were injured early today when two buses collided and plunged into a 60-foot gorge on the outskirts of the Chilean capital, the police said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/30/business/finance-briefs-130950.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** David Jamison Carlyle Corp. said it had completed a one-year $13 million secured financing package with Security Pacific National Bank. *********** Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. filed an offering of 700,000 shares - 553,361 by the company and 146,639 by selling stockholders - through L.F.

A year ago, before Mr. Mitterrand's first devaluation, the franc was worth 18 American cents; by last June, when the second devaluation occurred, it was at 14.6. **********Finance Minister Jacques Delors acknowledged today at a meeting with reporters that currency markets were in an ''agitated'' condition. But he asserted that the franc would not be devalued or removed from Europe's fixed exchange rate monetary system. ''These are perturbations we must face up to,'' he said. **********French officials argued privately that the Government was determined to resist the latest bout of speculation against the franc because it believed currency traders had failed to appreciate the nation's new austerity budget for 1983, which is intended to fight inflation and restore confidence in the currency. **********Dealers reported rumors that France might seek new international credits, perhaps from the other member countries of the European Monetary System, to help tide it over the current speculative wave while the new austerity measures, announced last week, take effect. **********Speculation against the franc was given impetus today by an analysis by the Lloyds Bank in London, which argued that the new pressure on the French Government showed that the markets were unconvinced by the budget-cutting measures planned by the Mitterrand Government. **********In particular, Lloyds mentioned France's big trade deficit and its inflation rate, still running at twice West Germany's despite a freeze on wages and prices, as reasons for concern about the franc's future. **********French bankers also expressed doubts about the Government's ability to get its new budget measures through a Parliament dominated by Socialists who are generally more leftist than the Cabinet. They also wondered whether the unions would agree to the wage restraint the Government is asking. **********Figures issued by the French central bank show that France is continuing to lose reserves as the authorities fight to hold the franc's parity. Last week, the central bank reported losses of the equivalent of about $142.5 million, after acknowledging a huge loss of the equivalent of about $570 million in the week ended Aug. 26. Rumors on Dual Rate **********In recent days, currency dealers have reported persistent rumors that the French authorities may be forced to introduce a dual exchange rate if the speculative pressure keeps up. This means that France would continue to maintain a fixed exchange rate for the franc against other European Monetary System currencies for designated ''commercial'' transactions involving imports and exports of goods. But a separate market would be set up for capital movements and for other transfers of money or purchases of currency. This would be the ''financial'' franc and would be allowed to float freely. **********Some French bankers believe that such a ''financial'' franc would depreciate to about eight francs to the dollar while the ''commercial'' franc would be at a better rate. **********From the Government's point of view, a split exchange rate would insulate the French reserves against speculative capital outflows, though not against losses resulting from the trade deficit.  Politically, it would enable President Mitterrand to maintain that he had not devalued the franc or withdrawn it from the European Monetary System, which Francehelped create three years ago. ---- Gold and Silver Off By The Associated Press **********Gold fell $6 an ounce yesterday, to $442, on the New York Cmmodity Exchange, after having risen earlier in the day.

John Deere turns its swans loose to strut around the manicured grounds of the company's headquarters. And the Deere factories usually switch into high gear to get ready for the year's peak selling season. **********But spring has come late to the Middle West this year, and a slackening in the demand for agricultural equipment has been one result of that delay. Consequently, Deere & Company, the farm implement industry's largest and most profitable company, is cutting back at a time when it normally would be expanding. **********Last week, Deere told its salaried workers, a proud and pampered group that has escaped the agony of its counterparts at the troubled International Harvester Company and Massey-Ferguson Inc., that it was freezing all salaries. Merit raises and a stock purchase plan were also canceled. **********A few days before that shock, Deere predicted a ''serious decline'' in earnings this year and announced it would slash production schedules by an additional 5 percent, dropping the level of output to 15 percent below last year's rate. The move was especially surprising because many economic forecasters have said that inventory cutting has run its course, and are predicting that a recovery is imminent. Does Not See a Recovery **********But Deere's president, Robert A. Hanson, does not see any recovery in the farm equipment and construction machinery areas - at least not yet. **********''Retail demand by farmers and contractors just isn't very strong right now,'' he commented. ''We looked for strengthening in December, January and Februray, but we didn't see that. So we're trimming to make sure we don't end up with too much invento@ry.'' **********At Deere, a well-disciplined and conservative organization where management decisions are made by consensus, the predominant feeling is that interest rates will stay high enough to keep demand for farm equipment, its main product line, below the anemic levels of last year. **********In the business and financial community, Deere has earned a sparkling reputation for planning and execution. In four decades, it outstripped competitors by building a strong balance sheet and an enviable dealer network. Heavy investment in new plants and modern equipment has made it the low-cost producer of farm equipment. **********But the recession in the farm economy, the worst since the 1930's, is blemishing Deere's remarkable performance. Fourteen percent of its 50,000 workers are already unemployed, with more layoffs on the horizon. Profits rose to $251 million in 1981 from $228 million the year before, but return on equity plummeted to 11.6 percent in 1980 and 11.8 percent in 1981, from 17.8 percent in 1979. **********And the situation promises to get worse. Exports, a significant part of Deere's business, have been eroded by the strength of the dollar. Commodity prices are low. Farm income, which fell 13 percent last year, to $19 billion, according to Continental Bank, is not expected to improve this year. In Deere's first quarter, which ended in January, profits fell 11 percent, to $33.7 million, on sales of $1.06 billion. **********''The farm equipment market is far different than anything we've ever seen,'' said Boyd C. Bartlett, senior vice president for farm equipment, ''Three companies are in trouble and they're liquidating inventory at distressed prices, trying to turn their product into cash.'' **********Massey-Ferguson announced recently that it would offer rebates of up to $5,500, or financing at 11 percent for one year, to buyers of some farm and construction equipment. Robert J. Gerstenberger, Deere's senior vice president for the construction business, said that on some $130,000 tractors discounts of up to $45,000 are common among makers - discounts that Deere refuses to match. A Strategic Decision **********Analysts said that Deere has made a strategic decision to trim inventories rather than prices.  ''They would rather sacrifice market share in the near term than destroy the integrity of their pricing structure,'' said John McGinty, at the First Boston Corporation. **********Deere insists that its inventories in the field are in better shape than its competitors, even though dealers owe the company almost $400 million more than they did at this time last year. Deere, and its competitors, generally extend credits to dealers for several months before they demand payment. **********These policies may have aggravated the inventory problem in the field, because dealers were looking for an upturn in the spring.  ''We have some big tractors that I wish we didn't have; I don't think we're going to sell them,'' says James M. Curless, owner of the Ruim Equipment Company in Lowell, Ind. He said that if business did not improve soon, he might have to lay off some of his 11 employees. **********Parts and raw materials have also piled up in Deere's warehouses, despite a computerized inventory control program started four years ago. Under the program, the company has learned to live with a oneand-a-half day supply of tires instead of a five- or six-day supply. **********And Robert W. Boecke, a senior vice president at Deere, said that the company was working toward the Japanese ''just in time'' model, which gets parts and materials to the plant only 30 minutes before they are needed. **********The recent decision to retrench will take time to implement, Mr.  Boecke said: ''It'll probably be the end of the summer before we get to the level we're comfortable with.'' **********As part of its austerity program, Deere has also asked its suppliers for a 2 percent across-the-board price cut, and has reduced capital spending to $175 million, half the planned level. **********Because of the capital spending revisions, the combines plant here in Moline will have to slow its modernization and expansion. The new modern paint shop that will use robot technology will have to wait a few years, as will other projects. **********But analysts said that Deere stood alone in facilities and technology. It has the country's most modern tractor plant at Waterloo, Iowa - one result of a recent $1.3 billion capital investment program. And the $175 million in capital programs is all going into product improvement. **********That augurs well for the company when the markets regain their strength.

(Page D11.) **********Oil, Steel Capacity Lost **********''We clearly are losing capacity'' as unneeded plants are closed or mothballed, asserted William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. This, he added, ''raises the specter of bottlenecks'' when demand picks up again. **********A Federal Reserve economist, who asked that he not be identified, said today that he was working on new revisions of the nation's industrial capacity that would be made available within the next several weeks. **********''We're looking at the whole issue right now,'' he added, noting that ''I have a lot of evidence'' of significant declines in such sectors as oil refining and steel production. **********Indeed, low as the utilization figures are, they would be even lower if capacity were not being eliminated by plant closings.  The Gulf Oil Corporation, for example, has closed refineries in Toledo, Ohio, and Venice, La., during the current recession. This has had the effect of reducing its capacity to process oil even as it raised its utilitization rate to more than 80 percent. The industry average for the week ending Nov. 5 was 70 percent, up from a low of 64.6 percent in February. **********At the Inland Steel Company's Indiana Harbor works, the nation's biggest steel plant, only three of nine blast furnaces are now operating and the 76-inch hot-strip mill and the 14-inch bar mill are about to be idled for a week. Such shutdowns make inroads in employment levels as well as capacity. More than 5,300 Inland workers are on indefinite layoff. Idle Capacity Actually Doubled **********Economists caution that the capacity utilization figures are not as reliable as many other statistical series and the Fed itself notes that even in normal times plant utilization never approaches 100 percent. From 1955 to 1979, the rate for manufacturing averaged about 83 percent with a high of 88 percent in 1973. **********This means that the amount of idle plant capacity is now about twice as great as in normal times - one-third of the total instead of about one-sixth. **********Despite the deficiencies of the utilization index, which registered a decline of eight-tenths of a percentage point last month, its current readings are a source of concern, economists said. **********''I worry about it,'' the Fed economist said, ''because it shows the industrial part of the economy is very weak.'' He also noted that last month's declines were spread broadly among the various categories. **********The automobile industry skidded to an operating rate of 49.7 percent last month, six points above its February low but far below the 61.3 percent recorded as recently as July, today's report showed. **********The rate for producers of industrial materials fell one-half point, to 67.2 percent, putting it below its previous record low of last June. **********Within manufacturing, the operating rate for advanced processing industries fell 1.1 point, to 69.8 percent, while the rate for the primary processing industries fell three-tenths of a point, to 65.8 percent. Permanent Losses **********The utilitization rate for producers of durable goods materials fell one point, to 61 percent, as producers of raw steel, aluminum, parts for consumer durables and parts for equipall curtailed operations. **********The rate for the production of energy materials, however, rose six-tenths of a point, to 78.5 percent.  Mr. Dunkelberg observed that some of the plant capacity that was being more or less permanently lost because of closure, age or lack of maintenance would probably never be needed again. This is because of shifts in the economy itself, such as the progressively higher proportion of it based on services. **********''Some of it,'' however, he added, ''you worry about because it doesn't come back very easily.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/28/business/dow-declines-2.67-to-822.77-weakness-in-utilities.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1982-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Declines 2.67, to 822.77; Weakness In Utilities", "print_headline": "Dow Declines 2.67, to 822.77; Weakness In Utilities", "body_text": " **********Stock prices gave ground yesterday as additional companies reported lower profits for the June quarter.

O'Neill Jr. said, ''I hear some rising objections to what Haig is doing from within the Democratic Party and from my area at home.'' **********But his fellow Democrat, Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader, said in an interview, ''I agree with the Administration position, and I very actively oppose any effort to withhold assistance to the moderate Government of Duarte.'' Two Unappealing Choices **********Perhaps the most frequent reaction on Capitol Hill, however, was expressed by Senator J. James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, who said the United States had two unappealing choices. ''If we turn down the additional aid,'' he said, ''we could be helping the Communist guerrilla takeover of the country. But on the other hand, we'd be aiding a Government we're not happy with. The bottom line is, which is the lesser of two evils?'' **********Some members of Congress have long criticized the human rights record of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, the leader of El Salvador's military-civilian junta. There have been frequent criticisms, for example, of his Government's investigation of the murder in December 1980 of four American churchwomen there. Those murders prompted Congress to require the Administration to certify that El Salvador was making progress on restoring human rights before it could continue receiving aid. **********The latest protest on Capitol Hill was triggered by the White House decision to certify that El Salvador was making such progress and could therefore receive $135 million in aid this fiscal year.  Officials have said this amount was to be increased and the Administration has said it would send $55 million more from unrestricted Pentagon funds. In Congressional testimony yesterday, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. vowed that Washington would do ''whatever is necessary'' to prevent the overthrow of the Salvadoran Government by leftist guerrillas. **********In reply, more than 30 members of Congress introduced a resolution opposing the President's certification. The resolution appears to have little chance of passing, and some lawmakers said it would have no legal force even if it did. But it indicated a significant segment of Congressional opinion. **********In another move, more than 50 lawmakers wrote to President Reagan, asking him to withdraw the certification. An organizer of the effort, Representative Richard L. Ottinger, Democrat of Westchester, declared: ''We want the President to know that we can not accept a certification based on facts that were pulled out of a hat. His assessment simply flies in the face of realit y. There is compelling evidence that the human rights violations in El Salvador have never been more brutal and widespread.'' Memory of Vietnam **********Representative O'Neill said today that many Roman Catholics, including priests and nuns who have served as missionaries in El Salvador, were expressing their concern to members of Congress.  Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the majority whip, said he had heard from many religious officials, not just Catholics.  ''There's a lot of concern out there,'' he said, ''and I don't think the Administration is sufficiently aware of it.'' **********Alluding to Vietnam and a not uncommon concern, Senator Donald W.  Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said: ''In the past the United States has gotten itself deeply involved in situations by doing it a step at a time. At some point we cross a line and we find ourselves making a commitment of resour ces and prestige without doing it carefully.'' **********Mr. Riegle also worries that in a time of tight budgets the United States cannot afford a major commitment to El Salvador. ''I'll be very blunt,'' said Mr. Riegle, whose home state leads the nation in unemployment, ''we need an aid package for Detroit.'' **********Others say Secretary Haig has increased concern on Capitol Hill.  ''My reaction is that he doesn't care about listening to Congress,'' said Mr. Foley, who added, ''I think we are playing a macho game in El Salvador.'' Few Alternatives Seen **********Despite the criticism, many in Congress seem inclined to support the Administration on a difficult issue. For example, Representative Clement J. Zablocki, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said, ''I'm not completely satisfied with the Duarte Government, but what is the alternative?'' **********Those who oppose aid to the country, Mr. Zablocki said, ''want to write El Salvador off to the fate of Cuba or Nicaragua.'' He added: ''I'm not of that opinion. This Administration would be condemned if it didn't try to keep El Salvador from becoming Communist.'' **********''The Administration was criticized last week because it wasn't strong enough in Poland,'' Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip, complained. ''How can you win?'' **********While some legislators remembered Vietnam, others remembered Cuba and said the United States made a mistake in not resisting Fidel Castro's takeover more actively. ''I can't believe,'' said Representative Wright, ''that the Batista Government, with all its corruption, was as bad as the bloodbaths that followed in the wake of Castro.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/29/business/finance-briefs-170350.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** CBS Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell $150 million principal amount of 10-year notes to be offered through an underwriting group led by Morgan Stanley. *********** Chemical New York N.V. is offering a $150 million 12-year floating-rate note issue through a European syndicate led by Credit Suisse-First Boston. *********** Piedmont Aviation announced it had filed with the S.E.C. to offer $40 million principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due in 2007, convertible into the company's common stock, par value $1.60 a share, to be sold through a Merrill Lynch group. *********** Sensormatic Electronics Corp. said it had filed with the S.E.C.  for a proposed public offering of $50 million of convertible subordinated debentures, to be sold through an L.F.

He had threatened to close The Times and The Sunday Times if the unions refused to accept his plan to stem losses running at the rate of more than $25 million a year, but he expressed hope after the breakdown in the talks that he could keep publishing. **********However, a union official hinted strongly that the papers would be hit by an immediate strike.  ''We have already decided not to accept the dismissals,'' said Barry Fitzpatrick, who heads the clerical branch at The Times of the National Society of Operative Printers, Graphical and Media Personnel. ''If he dismisses people on the scale he says he plans, it will not be possible to bring out the two papers.'' **********Original Deadline Extended **********After more than a decade of mounting losses, labor troubles and periodic closedowns, Mr. Murdoch had decided upon severe staff cutbacks as the only means of survival. He had set a deadline for Sunday night for agreement by the trade unions, but he extended it for 24 hours, with the possibility of another 24-hour extension if an agreement on the principles of an settlement had been reached by late tonight. **********Union and management negotiators plunged into talks this morning, but they failed to work out an agreement, despite the statement of a spokesman for News International Ltd., Mr. Murdoch's holding company, that closing would begin by noon Tuesday in the absence of an agreement. **********Just before 10 P.M., Mr. Murdoch and the union men appeared in the lobby of the newspaper's offices. The publisher, who owns other papers here, in Australia and in the United States, including The New York Post, read a formal statement. Clerical Branch Assailed **********After announcing the failure to reach agreement on staff levels, he said that some of the unions involved had shown ''good will,'' but that the clerical branch of the printers' union, which had been asked to give up a large number of jobs, had given no ''sensible response.'' **********He went on: ''This means that tomorrow morning mandatory notices go out to 210 clerical staff. These are the minimum immediate requirements - and they are made in the clerical department because that is the most grossly overmanned in the industry. The company invites everyone who works for The Times and The Sunday Times to come in as usual. If production continues, we hope that the present negotiations can resume and can be concluded with urgency.'' **********The publisher clearly hoped to split the printers' union from the other unions by restricting the dismissals to the most militant group, hoping the others would accept his action to save their jobs.  Implicitly, he backed away from his threat to close the papers if he got no agreement on the staff cuts. Formula Reported Modified **********But officials of other newspapers doubted that the unions would permit Mr. Murdoch to succeed.  Originally, he had demanded the elimination of 600 full-time employees and equally large reductions in shifts worked by part-time staff members. He reportedly modified that formula during Sunday's meetings, agreeing to consider a different pattern of reductions that would save about the same amount. **********In recent months, The Times has been losing almost $600,000 a week, and The Sunday Times, once a big money-maker, has also slipped into the red. Together, they have a full-time workforce of 2,600 people. **********Mr. Murdoch is believed to be planning to put Times Newspapers Ltd. into receivership if he cannot get the staff cuts he wants, then to try to revive them - perhaps as a single, seven-day-a-week newspaper - some weeks or months later. But he will be able to do that only if the two newspaper titles can be protected from subsequent sale."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/03/business/finance-briefs-181350.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Canada is floating a $750 million five-year note issue at par bearing 14.375 interest through a Eurobond syndicate led by a Deutsche Bank syndicate. *********** Canon Inc. plans to issue simultaneously a $50 million convertible bond issue in the Eurobond market and a 40-million-mark convertible bond issue in West Germany. *********** Chase Manhattan has increased its offering of floating-rate series E preferred stock to 5 million shares worth $250 million from 4 million shares worth $200 million. *********** Connecticut Power and Light is offering 800,000 shares of series M 15.04 percent preferred stock at the par value of $50 a share through a Blyth Eastman Paine Webber group. *********** First National Boston's board has authorized the purchase of up to 1.2 million, or 7 percent, of its common shares outstanding. *********** Golden Nugget received about $25 million from private placement of $472.5 million of zero-coupon notes due in 1998. *********** Phillips Petroleum is offering 937,145 common shares at $30.75 each through a Morgan Stanley group. *********** Trans World Corporation filed a preliminary registration statement with the Securites and Exchange Commission for an offering of about 1.8 million units, each consisting of one share of common stock and one dual option warrant. *********** United Technologies plans to exchange up to 2 million common shares and an undisclosed amount of cash for about $165 million of outstanding debentures held by Goldman Sachs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/21/world/around-the-world-china-s-premier-in-egypt-at-start-of-african-tour.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China's Premier in Egypt At Start of African Tour", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; China's Premier in Egypt At Start of African Tour", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang of China arrived here today at the start of a 10-nation, monthlong visit to Africa and immediately met with President Hosni Mubarak. **********''The purpose of my visit is to promote understanding and friendship, strengthen solidarity and cooperation and learn from the African people,'' Mr. Zhao said in a statement distributed to reporters. **********Mr. Zhao is the highest Chinese official to visit Africa, which he called an ''awakened and rejuvenated continent,'' since Zhou Enlai came to Cairo in 1964. **********Mr. Zhao was greeted on his arrival by Mr. Mubarak and given a state welcome.

''In the face of the manipulation of which he may feel himself the object by means of drugs, exaggerated sex, violence, the young Christian will not search for methods of action that will lead him to the spiral of terrorism,'' he said. ''That would lead him to the same or worse evil than that which he criticizes and deprecates. **********''He does not lapse into insecurity and demoralizaiton, nor does he take refuge in empty paradises of escapism or indifference. Nor drugs, nor alcohol, nor sex, nor a resigned and uncritical passivity are a response to evil.'' 'Consciences Must Be Awakened' **********The Pope was repeatedly interrupted not only by applause but also by frequent ''yesses,'' roars of approval and the shouting of slogans declaring his listeners' love for him. **********While the Pope often underlined his remarks to the young people with a warning index finger, he adopted a more somber tone in his speech to the scientists. **********''Consciences must be awakened,'' he said. ''Your responsibility and possibilities of influence on public opinion are immense. Make them serve the cause of peace and real progress of man. What marvels can be realized in our world if the best talents and the best researchers took each other by the hand to explore the roads of development of all men and all regions of the earth.'' **********Pope John Paul also met today with representatives of the Polish and Jewish minorities.  He urged the Poles to keep up their national traditions and faith, especially in these difficult days of their nation, and wished the Jews ''Shalom.''

Stoessel Jr. to Cairo, one of Mr. Begin's aides said. **********Mr. Stoessel flew to Cairo after a second round of talks this morning with Prime Minister Begin and other Israeli officials.  Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Boutros Ghali, also met with Mr. Begin, delivering the letter from President Mubarak. 'Promised to Do Everything' **********In addition, an Israeli official said that Egypt's chief of military intelligence, whose name was not given, arrived in Israel for talks on Israeli charges of the infiltration of weapons and explosives by the Palestine Liberation Organization through Sinai into the Israeli-controlled Gaza Strip. ''They promised to do everything they could to close this border to such activities,'' the official said. Egypt has denied that it has in any way countenanced such smuggling. **********Although the Israelis contend that they have repeatedly complained to Egypt about the smuggling, they were impressed that President Mubarak dispatched a high intelligence official to deal with the problem. **********Israel's Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, met with Mr. Mubarak in Cairo Thursday and said when he returned that Egypt had agreed to remove troops and equipment that Israel said exceeded the deployment limits in the parts of Sinai already returned. ''General Sharon didn't have to work too hard to convince the Egyptians,'' one official said. The United States field mission in Sinai is to check Egyptian compliance beginning Saturday, according to Israeli radio.  The Egyptians have denied the charge of excessive troops, although they did say that Mr. Sharon had discussed it with Egyptian officials Thursday. Border Still in Dispute **********One area where disagreement remains, however, is the new border to be established between the two countries after the April 25 withdrawal. The line is in dispute at 15 points, most seriously on a stretch of beach called Taba, south of Eilat, where an Israeli conern is building a luxury hotel. Egypt and Israel both claim the territory. Egypt's Foreign Minister, Kamal Hassan Ali, is scheduled to visit Israel Sunday for talks on the subject. **********The letter to Mr. Begin from President Mubarak was described by an Israeli official as ''a very good letter,'' written in a warm tone and containing ''very many expressions of goodwill.'' **********The Egyptian leader reportedly assured Mr. Begin that the final withdrawal from the last third of Sinai would remove the last obstacle to fruitful relations and that Egyptian-Israeli ties would enter a new era. In that period, Mr. Mubarak was reported to have written, more Egyptians will be pleased to visit Israel and to establish contacts ''with their cousins and neighbors.'' **********The wording was described by an aide to Mr. Begin as highly encouraging and an indication that any Egyptian actions would not be undertaken at Israel's expense. ----"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/08/business/japan-escapes-rise-in-jobless.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Escapes Rise in Jobless", "print_headline": "Japan Escapes Rise in Jobless", "body_text": " **********Unemployment crept up last winter not only in the United States but also in its main industrial rivals, except for Japan, according to figures made available today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********Japan, which has held its jobless down to a 2 percent range since a small increase of the late 1970's, was still at 2.2 percent at the beginning of this year. **********The latest United States figure, for the month of May, was 9.5 percent.

But Fianna Fail was certain to hold more seats than the coalition of the Fine Gael and Labor Parties, which formed the outgoing Government of Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald. **********With complete returns reported from 38 of the 41 multimember constituencies, Fianna Fail had captured 78 seats, with 59 for Fine Gael, 13 for Labor and 6 for minor parties and independents. **********The Irish television predicted that Fianna Fail would have 81 seats after the completion of the complex calculations under the country's system of proportional representation, with 78 for the coalition and 7 for the others. Fianna Fail's own election experts said Mr. Haughey could hope for no more than 83 seats. In either event, Mr. Haughey would be forced to negotiate with the independents to form a government. **********In effect, the election produced another stalemate between the major political groupings, tilted this time slightly toward Fianna Fail. Some politicians suggested that yet another election might be needed in coming months. **********Early this morning, Dr. FitzGerald declined to concede defeat and said it was still conceivable that he could carry on as Prime Minister. He said it was ''remarkable that our vote held up as well as it did, given the fact that we went to the country on so tough a program.'' **********Dr. FitzGerald's Cabinet fell last month when several of the independents on whom it had depended for its majority refused to support the extremely severe budget he proposed to deal with Ireland's fiscal crisis. To combat 23 percent inflation and 12 percent unemployment, the Prime Minister proposed major tax increases and a debt-reduction program. **********The campaign centered on economic issues, with relatively little attention to the problems in Northern Ireland. Candidates of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, fared badly, as did the independent Republican, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey. **********Mr. Haughey has said that he will continue talks on Northern Ireland with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain - talks that he initiated several years ago and that Dr. FitzGerald continued.

At first, Mr. Haughey argued that there was no reason for an austerity budget, but he quickly backtracked and said he would be forced to increase taxes if he was elected. **********Public-opinion polls showed him to be one of the least popular party leaders in Irish history, and he appeared to have hurt his party's performance. **********Among the independents who were elected was Jim Kemmy, the Socialist whose vote was the key in bringing down Dr. FitzGerald."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/07/business/other-business-the-supply-side-of-publishing.html": {"writer_name": "Jacqueline Wilson", "pub_date": "1982-02-07", "snippet": "If there's any doubt about the trickle-down effect of Reaganomics, one need only enter a bookstore.

''A lot of people think the Reagan tax cuts are for them.'' **********Blanche Blante, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, agrees. ''Tax preparation books always do well, but this year is incredible.''

''Most people just wait until April to start buying.'' said Miss Blante.  When Americans buy these tax guides, they can deduct the price of the books from the statements they file with the Internal Revenue Service. But deciding which book to buy can be as mind-boggling as the tax law. **********Many of the how-to books are packaged in eye-catching gloss of yellow, red and orange.

Holzman that was published by Harper & Row. **********Others suggest they contain opportunities to cut pretty close to the law -like Rosalie Minkow's ''Creative Tax Benefits,'' published by Ace Books and selling for $4.50. **********Some of the books tout the opportunities their authors have discovered to take more than 2,000 legitimate deductions.  At least two new books this year have been written by former I.R.S insiders. There's ''The 1982 Tax Fighters Guide'' by Philip Storrer and Brian K. Williams, and Paul N.

For that reason, companies like Apple, Tandy, I.B.M. and Warner Communications' Atari unit want students to learn from earliest youth how to use their equipment and the software, or computer instructions, that run it.  Eventually, the theory goes, the students or their families are likely to buy the same computers. **********Foremost among the companies riding the crest of what Mr. Rosen calls ''a tidal wave of personal computers sweeping the educational establishment'' is Apple. The Apple II is now in thousands of classrooms. **********Thousands more are likely if the company is successful in obtaining passage of the so-called Apple bill, Federal legislation that would allow companies to write off two times the manufacturing cost of all computer equipment they donate to primary and secondary schools in one of the next three years. **********Two months ago the bill passed the House of Representatives by a 323-to-62 vote. Another version, with more restrictive write-off provisions that Apple says may jeopardize its giveaway program, passed the Senate Finance Committee before the November recess. The full Senate is expected to take it up before the end of the year. **********While Apple Computer keeps one eye on the legislation, its other is trained on the International Business Machines Corporation, which has made huge inroads into the market since it announced its first personal computer in 1981. **********At first, the computer giant seemed to eschew the school market, but it has recently placed ads in education journals urging the use of I.B.M. equipment in classrooms from kindergarten to college.  I.B.M. said last Wednesday that accredited schools and colleges could receive ''price allowances'' of about 22 percent on the basic personal computer system. **********Rapid growth in the field is forecast. According to a study last year by Creative Strategies International, an industry analysis group, hardware and software for ''computer-aided instruction'' produced revenues of $2 billion in 1981. The study indicates the figure will exceed $13 billion by 1987. **********Last month, I.B.M. also joined with Carnegie-Mellon University in a project that should result in the placement of 7,500 I.B.M. computers in every dormitory room and faculty office on campus. ''Nobody is hiding the fact that we and Carnegie-Mellon are trying to develop a system that other universities will want to install'' by the late 1980's, Lewis Branscomb, a vice president of I.B.M. and its chief scientist, said in a recent interview. **********If successful, the I.B.M.-Carnegie Mellon project could combine the best features of relatively inexpensive personal computers and much more expensive time-sharing systems that connect users to a large central computer through a terminal that has no processing capability of its own. **********The so-called work stations under joint design by I.B.M. and the Carnegie-Mellon staff are expected to be several times more powerful than a personal computer, and would operate independently. That would enable users at an infinite number of work stations to perform complex operations quickly without overloading the central computer with demands from users on each terminal. **********I.B.M. and the university are also installing a large mainframe computer to store large files, a more efficient system than the record-like ''diskettes'' used to store permanent files in most home computers. Expansion via Cable TV **********The mainframe will enable each student and faculty member to communicate with others through their machines. Carnegie-Mellon is also negotiating with Warner Communications, which holds the cable television franchise for the Pittsburgh area, to make the system available to every household in the area. **********Under the Carnegie-Mellon plan, students would likely be required to buy their computer, and they would take it with them after graduation. **********There are hopes, too, that students familiar with computers will buy them before entering college.  ''That idea has not eluded us,'' conceded Frederick M. Hoar, vice president of communications for Apple. But the ''primary emphasis'' of the Apple bill, he added, ''is to improve computer literacy in the schools.'' He said Apple would not be the only beneficiary of the bill. **********While Apple's competitors did not oppose the House measure, they have given Apple no help in Washington. One I.B.M. employee, who asked not to be identified, said that if passage of the bill led to indiscriminate donations of computers ''some are going to be used as expensive doorstops.'' **********Ron G. Stegall, vice president of computer sales for Tandy, which markets Radio Shack computers, said, ''We are not certain that the American taxpayer should be subsidizing our portion of the tax burden.'' **********Others in the industry, however, say that some computer companies and even parents are putting pressure on the schools, particularly at the elementary level, to buy equipment they do not need or do not know how to use. **********While I.B.M., Apple and Tandy have led the race to put computers into the classroom, others have also made inroads, including Commodore, whose PET computer is attractive to some schools for its relatively low price, and Texas Instruments. **********While few question the usefulness of computers at the college level, some students at Carnegie-Mellon have protested that purchasing a computer, at a cost of about $3,000, will add significantly to the price of an education. **********University officials say that in a decade, so much of the university's resources will be centered on the computer system that a work station will be as necessary as a library card. **********Whether computers will ever become that prevalent on campuses is still in doubt. So far, I.B.M. has committed itself only to an investment of about $20 million over three years at Carnegie-Mellon.  ''But this is phase one,'' Dr. Branscomb one. ''We're not counting on it going down the tubes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/25/business/dow-off-6.25-to-919.52-volume-at-7-week-low.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1982-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Off 6.25, to 919.52; Volume at 7-Week Low", "print_headline": "Dow Off 6.25, to 919.52; Volume at 7-Week Low", "body_text": " **********Stock prices retreated yesterday as investors worried over the uncertain course of interest rates and the timing of the economic upturn. **********Volume sank to a seven-week low.

The police picked him up for gambling and eventually sent him off for three years of ''re-education through labor.'' **********Mr. Liu never stood trial for his offense and was never formally convicted. But he has served more than 16 months so far in a prison farm south of Peking. **********''I deserved it,'' he said as he stood with other inmates in front of a communal wash trough. ''Playing cards for money isn't allowed.'' Still, he acknowledged with a laugh, ''I don't like it here.'' **********Mr. Liu, who is 30 years old, is just one among thousands of Chinese who get disciplined outside the courts after running afoul of the law. Petty Thievery and Seduction **********The Tuanhe Farm, where he is confined, has 2,410 inmates serving administrative sentences for offenses ranging from brawling and petty thievery to gambling and seduction. **********Since late 1978, China has revived the rule of law, which was submerged by the arbitrary persecutions of the Cultural Revolution.  Criminal and civil codes have been promulgated and the legal profession has regained respectability. **********Yet ''laojiao,'' or re-education through labor, remains an accepted device for clearing the streets of troublemakers, most of them young, whose transgressions seem too petty to warrant a full criminal trial. **********The regulations on nonjudicial punishment, originally published in 1957, were reissued in early 1980. They give nonjudicial committees, which include the local police, the power to confine offenders for one to three years. No Stigma of Prison **********The system's proponents contend that it prevents the court system from being overloaded with trivial cases. Because sentences are flexible, the offender is encouraged to repent. He is not locked up with hardened criminals, and, at least in theory, he does not carry the stigma of prison when he returns to society because he has no record of a criminal conviction. **********''Our work here is to educate and reform those offenders whose offenses are not serious enough to require a jail sentence,'' explained Liu Shili, the deputy director of the Tuanhe Farm. **********Mr. Liu, a beefy man wearing the white jacket and red collar tabs of the Public Security Bureau, the Chinese police, said, ''We ask all our personnel to treat offenders just like doctors treat patients who have an infectious disease, like mothers teaching their children, like teachers instructing their pupils.'' **********Re-education through labor is a convenient way for the authorities to deal with a rise in juvenile delinquency. Although China's problem is still modest by American standards, recent articles in the press suggest that it is widespread. Trains Stoned by Youths **********Earlier this month, a Shanghai newspaper disclosed that 46 passengers had been injured so far this year by stones that youths had thrown at city trains. In the Peking suburbs, three teachers were hounded by students to the point of nervous breakdowns. In the southern province of Hunan, a recent report revealed that vandals had wrecked 10 of the 25 high schools in Xintian County. **********A sociologist, Liu Liexing, reported in a social science journal in northeastern Liaoning Province that juvenile delinquency was steadily rising and that crimes were being committed at a younger age. A conference in Kunming last year disclosed that more than 80 percent of the prisoners in Yunnan Province were juveniles. **********Although the inmates at the Tuanhe Farm range from 17 to 60 years old, the overwhelming majority - 87 percent -are under 25 years old, Mr. Liu said. **********More than half the inmates were there for some form of stealing.  Another third were sent for ''hooliganism,'' which Mr. Liu defined as ''fighting which disturbs the peace or taking liberties with women.'' The others were mostly accused of smuggling, blackmail or gambling. **********There were no female inmates at Tuanhe, but a visit to a similar prison farm in Shanghai last November revealed that most women were there for having premarital sex with boyfriends. **********The Tuanhe Farm, one of three in the Peking area, is considered a showpiece by Chinese standards, which is why the municipality let foreign journalists in for a recent visit. **********The 250 uniformed guards and other staff members do not carry weapons, and Mr. Liu said they were forbidden from cursing or hitting their charges. **********Each inmate can earn $14 a month laboring in the surrounding orchards, vineyards and fields. Last year, the farm produced 2,000 tons of fruit, 800 tons of vegetables and 400 tons of grain for the city. **********But life is still spartan. The inmates sleep wedged together on communal platforms in unheated barracks and eat rations that feature steamed millet bread and vegetables. Daily work in the fields is followed by two hours of evening study. Exercise includes military parade drill. ''We ask them to act collectively,'' Mr Liu said. ''We ask them to learn from the army.' A Monthly Evaluation **********Eager cooperation is the fastest way to get out. Mr. Liu said the behavior of the inmates was appraised monthly, with a full evaluation every six months. Those with a positive attitude might get out early. Those fighting the system could be kept an extra year. **********Li Fengming, a 21-year-old coal miner serving three years for beating up a colleague, wrote his self-criticism when he arrived and is now on his best behavior. ''If we continue to commit mistakes, our sentences will be extended,'' Mr. Li said as he nervously answered a journalist's question. **********Zhang Zhenshan, 21 years old, was caught picking someone's wallet and, after a month in police custody, was sent to the farm for two years. ''I'm looking forward to getting out,'' Mr. Zhang said as he vigorously pruned grape leaves in the vinyard. **********According to The farm's records, nearly two-thirds of the inmates were workers or unemployed youths. Less than 8 percent were the sons of Government employees. Mr. Liu avoided answering whether any were the children of party officials, China's most privileged class. **********Ma Yuliang, 38, told reporters that he had been put away for meeting with foreigners, which is discouraged in China. The farm director, Sung Yibin, became angry and insisted that his prison farm had no political detainees. **********''His offense is not contact with foreigners but hooliganism,'' the director said. He said Mr. Ma was in nonjudicial detention because he procured prostitutes for foreigners, seduced four women and committed robbery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/04/business/barclays-merger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barclays Merger", "print_headline": "Barclays Merger", "body_text": " **********The Barclays Bank of New York, a subsidiary of the London-based Barclays Bank P.L.C., said it had completed a $26.5 million acquisition of a subsidiary of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation.

WITH THE ISRAELI ARMY in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, Sept. 2 - The Israeli Army is deployed in significant strength across the width of Lebanon, ready for war or peace. **********Israeli tanks, long-range artillery and infantry face the Syrian Army along a cease-fire line that begins 15 miles east of Beirut and sweeps for about 45 miles southeast to within a few miles of the Syrian border. Israeli 175-millimeter guns are within shelling distance of Damascus. **********Most of the confrontation line is in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, a fertile area of vineyards and apple orchards. But on a tour of the Israeli side of the front line, the area was being used more by soldiers than farmers. Donkeys Replaced by Armor **********The armored personnel carrier has for the time being replaced the donkey as the principal means of human transport in this green valley and on the surrounding dusty hillsides. **********Within a few days of invading Lebanon on June 6, the Israeli forces pushed the Syrians north to the present cease-fire lines.  The military situation in the Bekaa is now referred to by officials in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as Phase II of Operation Peace for Galilee. **********Phase I was clearing Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas from Israel's border areas and driving them out of Beirut. That was officially completed on Wednesday. Mutual Withdrawals Sought **********Phase II, senior Israeli officials say, is the mutual, simultaneous withdrawals from Lebanon of the Israeli Army and the Syrian Army. Politicians and diplomats in Jerusalem, Damascus, Washington and Beirut are supposed to arrange such withdrawals. In addition, Phase II presumably provides for the pullout of P.L.O.  guerrillas from Tripoli in the north and the Bekaa. **********The stated policy of all the nations involved calls for Israeli-Syrian withdrawals in an effort to avoid more war in Lebanon.  The President-elect of Lebanon, Bashir Gemayel, has said he wants all foreign forces to leave his country.  Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger said on a visit to Beirut Tuesday that preliminary plans for mutual withdrawal were already being discussed. **********Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense Minister, has said that Israel does not want another war with Syria. But both Mr. Sharon and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria have said their forces will not be the first to leave. **********Prime Minister Menachem Begin has stated, and Mr. Sharon has publicly reminded Syria several times, that Damascus is now within range of Israeli artillery. The Israeli guns along the front line southeast of the Bekaa are 5 miles from the Syrian border and 15 miles from Damascus. Israelis Are Digging In **********The Israeli troops in Lebanon, many of whom are reservists, would prefer to go home to their professions, trades and university classes. But a tour of the front indicated clearly that they were preparing to spend the fall and winter in Lebanon if the withdrawal negotiations lagged. **********The Israelis were laying asphalt on old and damaged roads in case they had to fight in the muddying rain expected to start late in the year. Trailer trucks were bringing in prefabricated houses for soldiers to live in when the weather cooled. Israeli officers said the Syrians were making the same preparations. **********The size of the two armies is a military secret. Israeli military officials said the Syrians had as many as 50,000 troops in Lebanon, backed by several thousand P.L.O. guerrillas who had not been trapped in west Beirut by the Israeli Army. Although Israeli officials declined to disclose the size of their force in Lebanon, officers in the field gave the impression that it was at least (seven words deleted by censor). Israelis Are Confident **********The Israeli troops in the field said, predictably, that if they had to fight they would win. The Israelis expressed that opinion repeatedly during a reporter's tour of the front. **********An escort officer accompanied the reporter, but let him travel freely in the area, taking photographs while observing military units in the Bekaa and the hills that flank it. The Israelis interviewed spoke openly, but the officers asked that their surnames not be published. **********Generally, the officers said, there has not been much military conflict along the cease-fire line in recent weeks. Artillery, Armor and Infantry **********None of the Israeli officers would disclose details on the Syrian units facing them. But a map given journalists by the Israeli military, dated July 26, indicates that the Syrian forces include seven armored brigades, two artillery groups, three mechanized brigades and one infantry brigade. **********The Israeli map does not provide additional detail, but the armored brigades, according to field reports, include Soviet-made T-55 and T-62 tanks, but not the more powerful T-72's. Syrian artillery is reported to be ample, but not close enough to hit Haifa, the nearest large Israeli city. In a total war, of course, both sides could use planes and missiles against large cities. **********About a mile north of (one word deleted by censor) on the southeastern front, Captain Yosi, his fair skin reddened by the sun, wore a bathing suit, a T-shirt and a crew cap with the brim down as he stepped out of his command post, an armored personnel carrier crammed with radio equipment and maps. **********He commanded a battery of four 155-millimeter guns mounted on tanktread vehicles. The 40 men who operated the guns slept in tents a few feet from them. The guns, with an effective range of 12 or 13 miles, could rain shells on the Syrian forces two or three miles to the east. With binoculars, the Israelis looked up at the Syrian soldiers on the top of a ridge on Mount Hermon, and assumed the Syrians are looking right back. 'It's Been Quiet' **********''There were some artillery exchanges,'' the captain said, ''but it's been quiet for two weeks now. We are just waiting for orders.'' He said his men assumed that the Syrians had (six words deleted by censor) but he added of the Syrians: ''They'll go back without fighting. None of us want to fight. We only want to go home. **********A few miles northeast of the 155-millimeter battery was a battery of four 175-millimeter guns on vehicles. The guns were set in a patch of olive trees that provided no cover for the artillery but some shade for the soldiers. The olives on the trees tasted bitter. The guns were aimed at the Syrian lines, three or four miles to the north, but, according to Lieutenant Moti, they could be turned quickly on (one word deleted by censor). **********(Twenty-eight words deleted by censor) Lieutenant Moti, 32 years old, was an importer of furniture, mostly from Rumania, in peacetime. He had not had to order his men to fire on the enemy for more than two weeks.

''So we gave them a lesson. Just for a few minutes. We don't have to shoot for hours. It is enough for a few minutes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/28/world/man-in-the-news-moscow-s-changing-of-the-guard-at-the-kgb-yuri-v-andropov.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1982-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOSCOW'S CHANGING OF THE GUARD AT THE K.G.B.: YURI V.

ANDROPOV", "body_text": " **********If there were any doubt that powerful men in the Kremlin are positioning themselves for the end of the Brezhnev era, it seemed to be dispelled with the announcement on Wednesday that Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov, a career Communist Party official, had been relieved of his duties as head of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency. **********The transfer of Mr. Andropov had been expected after the disclosure the day before that he would return to his former post of a secretary in the 10-member party secretariat, which under Leonid I.  Brezhnev, the general secretary, runs the Soviet Union's affairs. Mr. Andropov was moved from the secretariat to the chairmanship of the K.G.B. in 1967 as part of an effort to affirm party control over the security agency. **********The announcement of his return to appeared to confirm rumors that Mr. Andropov wanted to place some distance between himself and the K.G.B. to strengthen his hand in what Sovietologists have dubbed the ''presuccession struggle'' in the Kremlin. It has long been assumed that the K.G.B. job is a deadweight on anyone aspiring to be the top man in the Kremlin. **********Viewed as a Moderate in K.G.B. **********Although the glowering look of his official photographs hardly conveyed it, Mr. Andropov was a moderate during his 15-year tenure at K.G.B. headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Square. Dissidents found him an implacable foe, but the party and the population as a whole rested easier. **********Placing the K.G.B., including its huge network of agents, under at least a semblance of ''socialist legality'' was the task set by Mr.  Brezhnev when he pulled the aide out of the secretariat and sent him to the K.G.B., a couple of blocks from the party's secretariat offices on Moscow's Old Square. **********Over the years, Mr. Andropov succeeded to the point that the ruling Politburo has judged it safe to reassign the post to a career security officer, Vitaly V. Fedorchuk. Move May Be Viewed as Gamble **********For Mr. Andropov, the move could be a gamble. While remaining at the security agency might have disqualified him from the party leadership, it would still have given him a voice in designating Mr.  Brezhnev's successor. By moving back to the secretariat, he has relinquished that power base for a more amorphous position where his skills at political infighting could decide whether he recedes in influence or inherits Mr. Brezhnev's job as general secretary. **********So far, the two main contenders seem to be Mr. Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko, a longtime Brezhnev confidant. Mr. Andropov staked his claim by giving the annual speech on Lenin's birthday last month, but Mr. Chernenko countered with an ideological speech to a gathering of political commissars of the armed forces two weeks later. **********The Brezhnev Politburo has presented an image of lifeless anonymity to the public, but Mr. Andropov's career provides some shadings. At the K.G.B., he established his ideological mettle, and any suspicions of queasiness in the face of popular challenge had been dispelled earlier by his role as Soviet Ambassador to Hungary during the uprising there in 1956. **********Last year, rumors reached Western diplomats that he was pressing for tough action in Poland before Mr. Brezhnev was ready for a crackdown. But readers of Soviet intellectual journals have found evidence suggesting that he may be more pragmatic than some of his rivals if his authority were extended to economic issues. From a Humble Background **********Like most men in the Kremlin hierarchy, he comes from a humble background. He was born June 15, 1914, the son of a railway worker, and took jobs as a telegraph operator and film projectionist before attending college. His first party job, as head of the Young Communist League in what was then the Karelo-Finnish republic, was interrupted for a stint organizing guerrillas in this area behind German lines in World War II. **********As a promising young official he was sent to the party's secretariat staff in 1951, and, except for a four-year stint in Hungary, remained there until he moved to the K.G.B. in 1967. While at the security agency, he was elected to the Politburo, first as an alternate member in 1967, and then as a full, voting member in 1973. **********Although his travels have been limited to Communist countries, he has impressed diplomats with his command of English, a rare accomplishment among Soviet leaders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/18/world/us-and-soviet-try-to-cut-un-costs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AND SOVIET TRY TO CUT U.N.

As far as is known, the Soviet Union has not specified a target, but has said that costs must be held down. **********Spending at the United Nations is determined by the General Assembly, where each of the 157 members has an equal vote.  Assessments, however, are fixed by a formula that takes into account each country's total output and per capita income. So dozens of smaller and poorer nations can vote for conferences, experts and new programs, aware that the costs will be borne almost entirely by richer and larger countries. **********The United States share of this year's budget is $180.3 million, or 25 percent. The Soviet share is $93.4 million, or 13 percent.  Britain, whose share is $32.2 million, or 4.6 percent, is the sixth largest contributor after Japan, West Germany and France. **********The three diplomats meeting with Mr. Perez de Cuellar are expected to stress that United Nations spending has risen over 80 percent in five years. For the United States, this has meant a rise in its contribution from $99.4 million in 1977 to the present level of $180.3 million. A New American Tactic **********This week the United States unveiled a new tactic to advertise its resistance to higher costs. It introduced amendments to at least three resolutions, approving their substance ''only to the extent that they can be financed without exceeding the level of resources approved in the budget.'' All three amendments were soundly defeated. **********But as one American official said: ''We want people to know we are serious. If they do, we hope the escalation in costs will stop.'' The United States now holds back its share of spending for the Palestine Liberation Organization and the South-West Africa People's Organization, the insurgents in the territory known as Namibia. **********Other nations have also refused to pay for activities of which they disapprove. France and the Soviet Union did not pay their share of the costs for United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Congo in 1960. So, far, however, no nation has withheld a payment for budgetary reasons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/world/bullfight-arena-collapses-in-mexico-killing-14.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bullfight Arena Collapses In Mexico, Killing 14", "print_headline": "Bullfight Arena Collapses In Mexico, Killing 14", "body_text": " **********The bleachers of a bullfight arena collapsed tonight, killing 14 people and injuring 400, Mexican state television said. **********The television said the accident occurred when spectators rushed to one side of the stadium at Milpa Alta, on the southern edge of Mexico City, to watch a bullfighter, Antonio Lomelin, arrive in a helicopter outside the ring. **********Red Cross spokesmen said casualty reports were not immediately available, apparently because the victims were rushed to numerous hospitals around Mexico City.

The proposal, the third modification of the debt plan, is expected to give the lenders a large share of Harvester's stock, but will also provide new financial liquidity. **********Harvester said it would not disclose the details of the package until the terms were definitive, but the company's lenders said the proposal involved the conversion of debt into equity, the easing of interest payments and the raising of additional collateral. The changes were needed, it was said, to permit Harvester to maintain liquidity for the next 12 months and avoid filing for bankruptcy. **********''It's the best solution for Harvester and the banks,'' said Rudy Mueller, an analyst with Sterling, Grace & Company. ''The banks would rather get 8 percent from a living company than zero from a corpse.''  30 Percent Stake for Lenders **********Under the proposal, Harvester would convert as much as $350 million in principal and interest owed to the banks into equity, giving the lenders about a 30 percent stake in the company. The equity would be in the form of nonvoting stock, most likely with warrants attached to buy common stock. **********In addition, Harvester would be able to defer some interest payments, and be allowed to make lower payments on the balance of the interest due, depending on the company's cash requirements.  Harvester's current interest rate is set at 108 percent of the prime rate, with the company paying interest in notes when the prime is above 16 percent and in cash when it is at 16 percent or below. **********The lenders also want Harvester to raise more collateral. The company has already mortgaged about 80 percent of its manufacturing assets. **********The new proposal requires the unanimous approval of Harvester's 200 lenders, and it has already run into a snag because one unnamed foreign bank has been reluctant to go along. This bank is said to support a plan to separate Harvester's finance subsidiary from the parent company. **********''The finance unit is doing just fine,'' a lender said. ''Some banks are not exposed to the parent company, and they are tired of the parent milking the child to help pay its bills. However, we don't see one little-bitty stubborn bank as pouring cold water on the plan.'' **********The new proposal, however, does not give Harvester everything it had wanted. In July, the company said it would ask its lenders for the conversion of more than $400 million worth of debt into equity, and the elimination of all cash interest payments on loans retroactive to July 1, offering lenders an equity security instead of cash. **********A compromise was drafted last Friday during Harvester's regular monthly meeting with its lenders.  ''Sure, it was a perfect negotiating tactic on Harvester's part to ask for more than they need, hoping to get more than we were willing to give, but we hold the purse strings,'' a lender said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/25/world/brazil-elections-bring-victories-for-opposition.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1982-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 939, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAZIL ELECTIONS BRING VICTORIES FOR OPPOSITION", "print_headline": "BRAZIL ELECTIONS BRING VICTORIES FOR OPPOSITION", "body_text": " **********In the first three nationwide elections in Brazil in 17 years, opposition parties won an overwhelming majority of the vote and control of several major states. **********The voting was the centerpiece of a gradual politicial liberalization program known as apertura, or opening in Portuguese.  Although the continuing tabulation of the Nov. 15 election gave the Government party only about 30 percent of the vote, it was enough to assure them of a majority of the states and control of the electoral college that will choose the country's next President in 1985. Prospect for Civilian Rule **********The orderliness of the process, the reasonable showing of the Government's Social Democratic Party and the preference of opposition voters for moderate candidates over leftist ones appeared to enhance chances that the next President will be a civilian. The current President, Gen. Joao Baptista Figueirido, is the fifth consecutive military head of state since the armed forces took power here in 1964. **********Because the vote for gubernatorial, legislative and municipal posts is still being tallied, there could be a switch of several states before official results are announced next month. Reliable projections showed the governing Social Democratic Party with 12 states, the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party with 9 and the Democratic Labor Party of Leonel Brizola, the most controversial gubernatorial candidate, with the state of Rio de Janeiro. **********Mr. Brizola's brother-in-law, Joao Goulart, was President when the military took over Brazil in 1964. Mr. Brizola tried to turn enlisted men against their superiors and to mount armed resistence to the military takeover. Charges Are Traded **********Even before the votes were fully in, he and military officials traded charges. Mr. Brizola suggested that an excessively slow count in Rio indicated the Government was trying to steal the election, and Gen. Delio Jardim de Mattos, the air force secretary, called him a political ''arsonist'' in response. **********President Figueiredo's brother, Gen. Euclydes Figueiredo, said Mr.  Brizola was a ''bone we will have to swallow and digest and,'' he added menacingly, ''get rid of at the right time.'' **********Mr. Brizola moved to calm the dispute by promising an administration ''open to dialogue with all citizens and all authorities, be they civil, religious or military.'' He also praised President Figueiredo for the tenacity of his commitment to hold elections and liberalize Brazil's political life. **********Mr. Figueiredo's apertura program , has already brought about the lifting of most censorship, the restoration of political parties, the release of political prisoners and an amnesty under which men such as Mr. Brizola, who was exiled for 15 years, were able to return to Brazil and re-enter public life. **********Although falling two states short of its election eve hopes and having to accept Mr. Brizola's victory, the military-run Government appeared satisfied with the overall outcome. It had viewed winning a majority in the electoral college as crucial, and it appeared to be capturing some 230 of the 479 seats in Congress, 10 more than its most optimistic forecast. The possibility arose that the Government could negotiate a voting majority with a smaller party. . Figueirido's Prestige Rises **********The prestige of Mr. Figueiredo also rose. He had persistently assured doubters that the elections would take place, and his aggressive personal campaigning was seen as the principal reason the party survived voter resentment over the country's deep recession and its annual inflation of nearly 100 percent. **********The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party came away with the governorships of states containing over 60 percent of the population and producing 70 percent of the gross national product. At the same time it suffered key losses in two states that it had seemed sure of at the start of the campaign, Rio Grande do Sul and Pernambuco. **********Its most important conquests were Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, the industrial centers of the country. The two new Governors, Franco Montoro and former Prime Minister Tancredo Neves, are both from the moderate faction of the party that ended up accounting for all the party's major victories. **********Mr. Montoro announced that he would not join any proposed ''front'' of opposition governors against the Government, and Mr.  Neves, calling himself ''a man of conciliation, dialogue and understanding,'' said he wanted to meet with President Figueiredo. Presidential Possibilities **********Of the potential civilian aspirants to the presidency, former Gov.  Paulo Maluf of Sao Paulo attained his objective of receiving more votes than any other Congressional candidate in Brazil's history, about 600,000, but he still emerged diminished because of the poor performance of his party in the state. **********The hopes of Interior Minister Mario Andreazza were sustained but not augmented by the showing of the Government party, whose campaign he supervised. **********Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the departing Governor of Bahia, stayed high on the list by masterminding an overwhelming party victory in his state even after his first gubernatorial candidate was killed in a plane crash in the middle of the campaign. **********Marco Antonio Maciel of Pernambuco, the 42-year-old departing Governor and newly elected Senator, entered the list by producing a party victory in a state the party once considered unwinnable. **********As of today, the Government had won the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Sergipe. The opposition had won Amazonas, Acre, Espirito Santo, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para, Parana, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/15/business/gte-and-western-union-post-quarterly-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1982-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 568, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.T.E.

Without the extraordinary items, earnings for the quarter would have risen 12 percent. **********G.T.E., until recently known as the General Telephone and Electronics Corporation, said net income for its second quarter rose to $201 million, or $1.14 a share, from $178.4 million, or $1.08 a share, in the 1981 quarter, when there were fewer shares outstanding. Revenues rose 13.5 percent, to $3.03 billion, from $2.67 billion in the 1981 quarter. **********Theodore F. Brophy, chairman and chief executive officer of the Stamford, Conn., company, said in a statement that ''the company performed well in the face of an adverse economic environment.'' Impact of Rate Increases **********G.T.E.'s telephone operations benefitted from $125 million in additional revenues derived from rate increases granted in the last 12 months. The company received twice as much in new rate increases in the first half of 1982 as it did in the first half of 1981, Mr.  Brophy said. **********The company said that the recession resulted in sluggish growth in long distance calling and in new telephone customers. Long-distance calling in the quarter rose 5.8 percent over the same period a year ago, compared with a gain of 8.7 percent in the year before that. The company said that the number of customer lines in service on June 30 was 2.1 percent higher than a year ago, compared with a 3.5 percent gain achieved the year before. **********The company said its sale of communications products rose 20 percent and net income rose 17 percent.

Telenet Communications, the company's computer-to-computer communications network, showed a 29.3 percent gain in revenues, to $30.8 million, in the quarter.

Revenues rose less than 1 percent, to $230.1 million, from $228 million. **********The company said its earnings results included a one-time gain of $5.7 million, or 33 cents a share, resulting from a $12.7 million refund received from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.  The Federal Communications Commission ordered the refund after it found that Bell had overcharged communications companies for leased communications facilities. **********Partly offsetting the refund, Western Union said it had set up a $7 million reserve to cover possible costs resulting from the Government's recent cancellation of a military communications system that the company had been providing. **********For the six months, G.T.E. said its net income rose to $398.9 million, or $2.28 a share, from $356.7 million, or $2.18 a share, a year earlier.

The Glass-Steagall Act allows banks to underwrite general obligations of states and municipalities, but not bonds that depend for repayment on revenues generated by a governmental agency. **********For example, although commercial banks may underwrite general obligation bonds of New York City and New York State, they may not underwrite bonds for such agencies as the Port of New York Authority, the New York State Power Authority or the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. **********''Our aspirations go beyond wanting to underwrite revenue bonds,'' Mr. Ogden continued.

Since the Drysdale collapse, the credit markets, which had been cautiously eyeing a projected $45 billion in Treasury financings during the third quarter, have turned skittish at the sight of new Government paper.  With the economy struggling to get out of its rut, the change in attitude could not have come at a worse time. **********The bond investor is likely to purchase the new Treasury notes, says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at E.F. Hutton, but only at interest rates that insure a still-born recovery. And while most analysts acknowldege that recent upward movements in key short-term rates make a rise in the prime to 17 percent highly likely in the near term, that may not be the end of the increase, Mr. Yardeni says. **********A big surge in July's money supply, in conjunction with Treasury borrowings, could push the prime to 18 percent by August, he predicts. Such a rise would make real interest rates, already at high levels, more punitive and could push the economy back into recession. Prices Pick Up **********Those who expected high interest rates and a lingering recession to rule out anything other than minute increases in consumer prices are in for a surprise this week, when May's report is released by the Labor Department. Thanks to rising mortgage interest and energy costs, prices are apt to show their biggest monthly increase since last September, says Donald Ratajczak, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University. When measured against inflation's performance over the last few years, the increase Mr. Ratajczak expects - 7 percent at an annual rate - is hardly alarming. The upward blip is not likely to be temporary, however. Interest rates remain persistently high, and the full impact of rising gasoline prices will not be felt until the June and July reports are released, Mr. Ratajczak says. As measured by the Consumer Price Index, those factors are likely to cause the inflation rate to more than double between the second and third quarters, he predicts, to 7.5 percent at an annual rate. Some cooling is likely in the fourth quarter, he says, as mortgage costs start to ease. Still, the fact they have stayed so high for so long has caused Mr. Ratajczak to revise his inflation projection for 1982 upward by half a point, to 5.8 percent.  Commodities Crumble **********Just when it seemed that things could not get much worse for commodities, they have.  In the past month, the Commodity Research Board index, which has been sliding ever since peaking at 337 in November of 1980, has dipped another 6 percent, to around 230, the largest sell-off in post-war history. And, while the worst of the decline is over, some analysts say that further deterioration is likely in coming months. **********Despite the price decline, demand remains very weak, preventing excess supply from being drained out of the market. To speed the process, production, which in a number of areas has already been slashed, is likely to fall further, says Gregory Kipnis, chief economist at ACLI International, a commodity service firm. And, as output declines, the price index is likely to drop, too, perhaps by as much as 10 percent by summer's end. The E.M.S. Buys Some Time **********By realigning the French franc against the German mark and the Dutch guilder, the European Monetary System, created to promote greater economic and exchange rate harmony among its member countries, has managed to survive another crisis. However, unless President Francois Mitterrand of France follows up recent austerity moves - a temporary freeze on wages and prices and a further 10 percent devaluation of the franc - with additional steps, few analysts expect the tranquility to last long. **********If France is serious about defending the franc beyond this fall, decisions about further cuts in the workweek and increases in business taxes - both of which undermine productivity and investment - will probably have to be reconsidered, says Jonathan Francis, director of foreign exchange forecasting at Wharton Econometrics. **********If that does not occur, the franc is likely to come under renewed downward pressure late this year and early in 1983, he says. Rather than agree to a third realignment in two years, the French, whose commitment to the E.M.S. is wavering, may decide to withdraw, Mr.  Francis said, throwing the system's survival into question. **********Kenneth N.

But we are not so aware that these same associations a re actually being used to establish cartels for their members. And s uch cartels are convenient vehicles for setting higher fees on many k inds of health and other professional services. **********Congress will have to address this contradiction in a pending authorization bill that would drastically curtail the Federal Trade Commission's authority as policeman of these professional associations. Currently, the F.T.C. is able to bring actions against licensing boards and medical associations that violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, prohibiting conspiracies in restraint of trade. **********Not surprisingly, medical and other lobbies that favor clipping the F.T.C.'s wings argue that the agency has been harassing morticians, optometrists and even doctors and dentists by over-regulating their licensing procedures and activities. **********On the other hand, more public-minded economists favor continuation of the F.T.C.'s strong regulatory authority, and they include those usually noted for objecting to excess regulation. Their position is that while the morticians and surgeons control entry into their professions to protect consumers against quackery, there have also been many instances of misuse of their licensing power to restrict entry and thus make profits greater for current members. In this case, the economist is correct in opposing a reduction in the F.T.C.'s power. **********Consider the case in principle for totally free entry into these professions, which in practice almost no one supports. Any practitioner could use the title of mortician, lawyer or dentist just as anyone can now use the title of economist. Those who are poorly trained or prone to mistakes would lose patronage as their performance became known. Others would improve their skills by practice and their market shares would increase. Eventually, the incomes of quacks or incompetents would fall to the point where they would be forced to close and perhaps go into teaching or consulting. **********This is not, however, a very compelling argument for total deregulation in present day circumstances. Before market forces expelled the untalented, they might well have done considerable harm, both financially and by raising the mortality rate. **********By requiring practitioners to be licensed, so as to eliminate those that are incompetent, even the first mistakes that lose patients could theoretically be prevented. Public regulation through licensing can correct the serious problems created by lack of knowledge in the market. But do not be too quick to embrace total regulation. In practice, the licensing board can apply the wrong test or biased review procedures that produce even worse overall results. **********While the system works to keep the quacks out, it also can be used to keep legitimate competitors from offering cheaper and more abundant health care, and it is obviously in the self-interest of just such a professional association, though never spoken, to use the limitation on entry in order to keep fees at monopoly pricing levels. **********The problem is that licensing to remove quackery can also be used as a convenient excuse to raise the required level of service quality too high. More years of training, more equipment and longer apprenticeships could be required by the licensing professional association. These would be costly steps, and would thus be the basis for raising fees, greatly benefiting those already in practice.SUCH a conflict of interest often occurs when a licensing board c onfronts someone trying to introduce no-frills service, versus the r egular full-line service. Full-line has less potential for harmful e ffects on quality but also carries higher prices and profits. Such at endency to charge too much for full-line can only be checked by a s hift to no-frills service by large numbers of consumers. And the l icensing board, by banning no-frills service in the name of e nhancing health care, is not being entirely honest. Its actual aim i s to maintain and increase the profits to its members. **********There have been several examples of this in recent years. One was brought to light in a 1979 F.T.C. investigation of morticians, who were requiring consumers to buy coffins as a condition for cremation, thus raising prices to unjustifiable levels by their self-licensing activities. The victim is the consumer, required to pay for more than he needs. **********But the most questionable self-regulation centers on direct control of professional fees. The setting of a schedule of fees for service so as to discriminate between higher charges for high-income consumers and lower charges for others is the key to the use of monopoly power by any professional association. **********To maintain such a schedule it is necessary to prevent fee advertising so that the wealthy do not perceive that they are being overcharged. Also, it is important to prevent the development of services not on a fee basis, such as prepaid medical or dental care, since it is impossible to determine from such arrangements whether fees are being cut in violation of the schedule. **********Fee setting is a long way from state board licensing to solve quackery problems. Can we have one without the other? The Federal Trade Commission has operated in recent years to allow selfregulation, but to prevent conspiracy to set monopoly professional fee levels. Agency cases have dealt with fee fixing by the Michigan State Medical Society, and boycotts against health insurance cost containment programs by the Indiana Federation of Dentists. **********Another example was the F.T.C.'s rule requiring eye doctors to give copies of eyeglass prescriptions to all patients. Before this rule, many optometrists required that patients had to buy the glasses from them after the examination. Now, the patient, with prescription in hand, can shop around for the cheapest source of glasses. The banned practices may have had some uplifting effect on service quality, but they seem mostly to have been for the purpose of putting more money in optometrists' pockets. **********On the whole, the F.T.C.'s operations have dealt with the monopolizing activities of the professional associations. These activities have been more widespread than might be expected, and have contributed to higher costs of medical, dental, mortician and other services for more than 100 occupations. The objections to F.T.C.  practices have come from the professional associations themselves, not from economists concerned with the quality and price of professional services. **********If the morticians and dentists pressure Congress to limit these antitrust activities, we will all pay more for the same fillings, eyeglasses and appendectomies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/01/business/xerox-slashes-copier-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Dylan Landis", "pub_date": "1982-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 533, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "XEROX SLASHES COPIER PRICES", "print_headline": "XEROX SLASHES COPIER PRICES", "body_text": " **********In an apparent acknowledgement of the inroads being made on its business by Japanese competitors, the Xerox Corporation slashed prices on some copiers yesterday by as much as 47 percent and said that for the next three months it would offer several discount financing programs to ''meet competition head-on.'' **********Analysts said that the sharp cuts, which averaged 27 percent and affected primarily reconditioned machines at the lower end of Xerox's product line, were an effort to stimulate sales in a weak economy as well as to rebuff stiffening competition from Japan. **********The price reductions, effective today, range from 10 percent for the Xerox 2350 and 2830 copiers, originally priced at $3,995, to 47 percent for the Xerox 3109, originally $7,495. **********Under the financing plans, available through Oct.1, customers will be allowed to spread payments over 12 months with no finance charge.

''There's general weakness in copier pricing, but I'm not aware of any other companies being on such a big program.'' **********Eight of the 14 discounted models, however, are no longer in production, and most are rental machines.

He suggested that his command, with its 34 fighter wings, was far short of the 54 needed. **********The plea by General Creech echoes that of other senior commanders who have asserted that the forces planned by the Reagan Administration are inadequate to fulfill the military commitments of the Administration. **********The Administration's strategy calls on the armed forces to prepare for a protracted conventional war with the Soviet Union, possibly in Europe, the Persian Gulf and Asia simultaneously.

But he noted that Israel had about three times as many F-16's as F-15's. **********The rest of the Syrian planes were hit by older F-4 Phantoms.  Israel reported the loss of three aircraft to Syrian ground fire: an F-4, an A-10 attack plane and a helicopter.  General Creech said that all but a handful of the Syrian planes had been hit by Sparrow and AIM 9-L American-made missiles from distances of up to 24 miles. Only a few Israelis got close enough to an enemy plane to use conventional guns. This underscored the increasing importance of radar-guided and heat-seeking missiles in air combat. **********The general contended that the F-16 had shown itself to be reliable when maintained properly under wartime conditions.

Depleted energy reserves are another grave issue, and the ninemember presidency has appealed for cutbacks by industry and individuals. **********The presidency said stagnating coal production, insufficient oil imports caused by foreign-exchange shortages and a prolonged drought affecting hydroelectric power had brought Yugoslavia to the verge of an energy crisis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/05/business/4-held-in-mexico-in-tax-case.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1982-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 581, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 HELD IN MEXICO IN TAX CASE", "print_headline": "4 HELD IN MEXICO IN TAX CASE", "body_text": " **********The Mexican Government has charged four directors of a Mexican company with tax evasion involving commissions received from an American oil equipment concern. **********The directors of Grupo Industrial Delta were arrested in connection with commissions received from Crawford Enterprises Inc., a Houstonbased company that sold equipment to Petroleos Mexicanos, Mexico's Government-owned oil company. Grupo Industrial Delta acted as Crawford's Mexican agent. **********The directors, who were arrested last Saturday and arraigned on Monday, were said by the authorities to have received $45 million from Crawford and to have sent the money to banks in Switzerland and the United States without reporting it as income. Allegations Denied **********The arrests came shortly before it became known that Crawford was one target in the wide-ranging United States investigation of charges that several American companies have paid millions of dollars in illegal bribes to officials of Petroleos Mexicanos. The Houston company has denied the allegations and has complained that the long Justice Department investigation, which has not resulted in any charges, has cost it business. **********Asked whether the money sent abroad by Delta was destined for officials at Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, an authoritative source in the Mexican Attorney General's office said that it was impossible to prove.

The chairman of the board, Ricardo Garcia Beltran, was not among those arrested and is believed to be in hiding.

Sales of $647 million were made, but income estimated at $45 million was not recorded by Delta and was instead sent abroad, the Attorney General's office said. **********It added that the money was sent in dollars through Mexico's Multibanco Comermex to banks in Switzerland and the United States, among them the Swiss Volksbank and the Texas Commerce Bank, based in Houston. The statement said that Delta's tax evasion may be higher than the estimate because ''other United States companies with which it did business must still be investigated.'' **********Asked whether Mexico had acted in response to information provided by the United States Department of Justice, the source at the Attorney General's office said, ''We were both following the case and we both knew about it.'' **********The arrests were made two days before an article about the grand jury investigation of Crawford appeared in Excelsior, a Mexican newspaper."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/16/business/patents-a-paraplegic-is-named-inventor-of-the-year.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1982-01-16", "snippet": "Intellectual Property Owners Inc. announced this week the selection of the Inventor of the Year for 1981.

They were attending Argentina's first legal political rally in more than six years of dictatorship. **********Friday night's rally, sponsored by the Radical Youth, a faction in the center-left Radical Party, was called two weeks ago in defiance of the military. But it suddenly became legal when the military regime lifted its ban on political gatherings last week. **********Ricardo Alvarez, a party organizer, stood in the back and scanned the sea of faces as the crowd roared again and again, ''The military dictatorship is going to end.'' He grinned with welling emotion.  ''They feel and want liberty,'' he said. Frenzied 'Historic Moment' **********He called the frenzy a ''historic moment,'' marking the revival of party politics in this intensely political nation.  The military, discredited for surrendering to Britain in the Falkland Islands and failing to put Argentina's chaotic economy in order, has been fullfilling part of its promise to return the nation to democracy within 20 months. **********Government workers are pulling dusty voting boxes from warehouses to repair them. Other workers are studying outdated voting lists.  But many Argentines, although gratified by their new freedom, are skeptical about some of its implications. In the past, the political parties, as well as the military, have failed them. **********''We are worse off than we were,'' an Argentine said in a letter published last week in La Nacion. ''And as if that weren't enough, power is being delivered to the same people who say today exactly the same thing they said before - the same people who, through influence or compliance, are responsible for the national unhinging of the 1970's.'' **********By ''the national unhinging,'' he meant the leftist terrorism that traumatized the country and brought on a military coup in 1976.  A larger complaint has built up over the last 50 years against many civilian political leaders. They have had a poor record of espousing wild-eyed populism, engaging in corruption and goading the military into coups against competitors. **********Only one elected President, Juan Domingo Peron, completed a full term in that period, as succeeding civilian and military goverments turned over the country to each other when their failures became too much for the public to bear. President Peron eventually fell victim to a coup. A Common Frustration **********One woman in her 30's who periodically escapes abroad reflected a common frustration. ''After you're here for a while, your standards lower,'' she said. ''But then you get so sick you can't take it anymore.'' **********Many politicians recognize the mood.  Admitting that ''the military is not the only one to blame'' for the country's ills, Deolindo F. Bittel, the acting head of the Peronist Party, said last week that ''the most grave problem is precisely that the people don't believe in anything anymore.'' **********Mr. Bittel called for ''faith'' in the re-emerging parties, but there has been little in their politics to inspire it.  The Government recognizes at least 15 national parties, not counting the Communists, underground leftist groups and independent provincial parties. Few Ideological Differences **********There are few ideological differences among the 15. All but one are left of center by American standards. Most are dominated by old men divided by personal ambitions. **********The single ideological exception is the centrist Federal Party, whose members hold political beliefs similar to those of liberal Republicans in the United States. There is no party for Reagan-style conservatives, depriving Argentina of what many political analysts say is needed balance. **********The military has filled the conservative role until now, usually allying itself with the upper class, but the reported idea of forming a conservative party has been dropped. **********The existing parties are faction-r@idden.  The Radicals, founded in the 1890's, represented the growing number of urban immigrants and broke the landed oligarchy's political control. But the party grew rigid as its longtime leader, Hipolito Irigoyen, refused to step aside or meet the changing demands of new industrial workers. He was overthrown as President in 1930 in the first military coup of the century. **********Many of today's parties are offshoots of the Radicals. The party itself, after almost 40 years under the control of Ricardo Balbin until his death last year at the age of 77, is headed by a portly, 66-year old biochemist, Carlos R. Contin. **********The Radical Party, generally regarded as the nation's second largest, is seriously split between two factions, Mr. Contin's National Line and the Movement for Renovation and Change, headed by Raul Alfonsin, a 55-year-old leftist firebrand with a long face and a drooping mustache. **********Mr. Alfonsin spoke Friday at the rally. He warned of the nation's ''tendancy to dissolution,'' and then accused the more moderate Mr.  Contin of being a ''collaborator'' with the military regime, a heady charge. **********Mr. Contin retained control of the party in a heated vote by party leaders Monday, but not until after a brief outbreak of shoving. Deeply Divided Peronists **********Argentina's largest party, the Peronists, are even more deeply divided, with about a dozen factions. Members have ranged from the extreme leftists who assassinated policemen in the mid-1970's to the extreme rightists who assassinated the leftists. **********The party's titular head, former President Isabel Martinez de Peron, is in exile in Spain.  The military had set out with wide popular support after overthrowing Mrs. Peron to restructure the party system. But the generals could not agree among themselves. **********Now, though a new law governing internal party procedures is expected any day, many parties have already chosen to ignore it.  Party leaders argue that the recurring military coups have prevented a firm grounding in democracy. The promise of democracy, however, has lured many Argentines, particularly young ones such as those at Friday's rally, to try again. **********''This meeting is education for me,'' said a 25-year old office worker, ''and I hope we are on the road.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/17/world/the-un-today-april-17-1982-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 14, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

He apparently mistook you for Russians.'' **********There aren't many countries where being mistaken for a native would be cause for an apology. But then there aren't many countries, in Europe at least, where a foreigner evinces such awe, deference and profound suspicion. **********Peter the Great imported foreigners as a cure for Russia's backwardness and then isolated them in a section of Moscow dubbed the ''German quarter.'' Generations of foreigners since then have been isolated and coddled by a society that brands them as guests and spies in almost the same breath. Segregated as Much as Possible **********Foreigners in Moscow still live in separate and guarded compounds, with facilities superior to anything Russians have. A network of hard-currency shops, hotels and restaurants, and a host of separate services supplied by a compliant ''diplomatic corps service bureau,'' further insure that a foreigner can live in the style he or she is presumed to require, segregated as much as possible from Soviet citizenry. **********Whole regions and cities of the Soviet Union are declared offlimits to foreigners, and advance notice or special permission is required for travel even in ''open areas.'' **********Much of the special treatment can be explained by the expedient of extracting as much hard currency as possible from the bourgeois visitor. To this end, a Soviet hotel that charges a Soviet citizen 10 rubles, or about $15, will unabashedly charge the foreigner 60 rubles and may demand payment in hard currency to boot. **********There is also the inherent Soviet suspicion that every foreigner, especially if from the West, is a potential spy and threat to the Socialist morals of society, and therefore to be watched and isolated. But beyond this is a genuine compulsion to please and impress a personage who by the very virtue of being an outsider is deemed very important. Room Service in Yakutsk **********Two reporters visiting Yakutsk, a Siberian administrative center that is off the normal tourist track, were informed on arrival at the Lena Hotel that all their meals would be served in their room. The dining room, it seems, was being renovated. **********Accordingly, a liveried waiter appeared to set the table and serve a rather elaborate meal. It took considerable effort to refuse the service without seeming ungrateful for the attention. **********One motive for such unusual and compulsory room-service was obviously to keep the foreigners away from the natives. But it was equally clear that the authorities regarded the rowdy local eateries as below the dignity of foreigners, even if the reporters were professionally drawn to them. **********It is common, in the same vein, for tourists at hotels to be seated at tables decorated with their national flags - a gracious gesture of international friendship and a signal to unwary citizens that this table is off-limits. A Game of Impersonation **********But even when foreigners venture into the streets, doors closed to the masses open wide. Tickets to theaters or circuses, access to restaurants, service at a crowded store all materialize for the ''guest.'' And, notwithstanding the incident at the start of this article, Russians seem to have an uncanny knack for recognizing a foreigner. **********A popular game among teen-agers in Moscow is to ''dress up like foreigners'' and try to fool a doorman at a restaurant or a clerk at a store. It is somewhat akin to an American teen-ager's parading as an adult to buy a six-pack of beer - it's titillating, potentially rewarding and mildly risky. **********The advantages of being identified as a foreigner are substantial.  Traffic cops rarely stop a car with the distinctive foreign license plates; if they do, they even more rarely issue a summons. **********Foreigners are permitted to cut to the head of the six-hour queue to pass through Lenin's mausoleum; they are routinely ushered into V.I.P. lounges at airports and allowed to pass through the jam of Russians who, in the absence of assigned seats, regularly fight it out at the foot of the Aeroflot boarding ramp. 'And You, What Are You?' **********Vladimir Vysotsky, the bard, now dead, whose songs of the trials of everyday Soviet life have become a fixture of popular culture here, has one about people grumbling about others cutting in their line. In the refrain they are told in confidential tones: ''We ask you, friends, please leave. Those who are eating, after all, are - foreigners. And you, I beg your pardon, what are you?'' **********The line captures a sense of inferiority that so many Russians have before foreigners, an attitude also reflected in the high premium set by owning imported goods or having foreigners as friends and in the defensiveness Russians often show about their own goods, ways of life and achievements. **********Television programs and the press regularly depict a casual contact with a foreigner as the start of a downhill slide to sedition, and dissidents who are interrogated by the K.G.B. say contacts with foreigners are routinely held up as evidence of subversive intent.  Even for a loyal member of Soviet society, playing host to a foreigner or attending a reception at an embassy can lead to a chat with the ''authorities.'' The Snow in Chita **********For foreigners traveling about, the attention can be overbearing.  Two American reporters seeing Siberia were told their flight from the mining town of Chulman southwest to Irkutsk, via Chita, had been canceled because of snow at Chita. **********They were flown north to Yakutsk and transferred to a scheduled flight that had been waiting, fully loaded, for three hours. It was a detour of 1,500 miles, three times the original route, and when passing through Chita a few days later by train the visitors were told there had been no snow for weeks. **********But the Chita airport did double as a military airfield.  The law on the subject of controlling foreigners is rather typical of Soviet legislation on such matters. Enacted last year, it grants foreign citizens every conceivable right in the Soviet Union. But then it declares that any or all of these, including the right to live or travel anywhere, can be abrogated by unspecified ''competent authorities'' on grounds of state security, protection of the social order or ''protection of the health and morals of the population.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/03/world/some-rights-gains-seen-in-guatemala.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1982-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOME RIGHTS GAINS SEEN IN GUATEMALA", "print_headline": "SOME RIGHTS GAINS SEEN IN GUATEMALA", "body_text": " **********Since a coup gave power in March to a three-man military junta headed by Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, there appears to have been a marked improvement in the human-rights situation for Guatemala's urban middle class, according to diplomats and Guatemalans. **********There has been noticeably less repression of the Roman Catholic Church, the press and the university. There are fewer kidnappings and killings of politicians and workers, hundreds of whom were assassinated in the civil war that began during the previous regime. **********However, ''the slaughter goes in the countryside as if nothing had ever happened,'' said one businessman who, like most people in Guatemala City, is still not confident enough to allow his name to be used. **********In recent interviews, a range of foreign diplomats, Protestant and Catholic religious leaders and politicians of opposing ideologies agreed that the killing of peasant Indians was greater than before the coup. 'No Break With the Past' **********The Indians ''are systematically being destroyed as a group,'' a Western European diplomat said. ''There is no break with the past.'' Indians make up 60 percent of Guatemala's population. **********The Committee of United Peasants, a leftist organization that seized the Brazilian Embassy here recently, said more than 3,000 peasants had been killed by the Government in the first six weeks after the coup. **********One politician, asked why he believed repression had diminished in the cities but continued in the countryside, said, ''The army no longer sees the politicians as enemies, but the peasants still are.'' **********According to an account carried in the country's second-largest newspaper, El Grafico, 110 people were assassinated in a 48-hour period late last month in Quiche, a rugged, mountainous province in the western part of the country that is a rebel stronghold. **********Among 21 peasants identified in a mass grave, four were said to be infants from 7 months old to 5 years; five others were 13 and younger; one man was 75, another 58. **********In Saquilla, a village about seven miles from a major military base, the dead were said to be 26 children, three men and 14 women, four of whom were pregnant. **********El Grafico recently carried an unusual editorial harshly condemning the violence.  ''The assassination of defenseless children and pregnant women is stupid, bestial,'' declared the editorial, which was signed by the paper's editor and publisher, Jorge Carpio Nicolle. 'Not Worthy of Any Aid' **********Calling the killings ''genocide,'' Mr. Carpio added: ''It seems incredible, but this new outbreak of mass assassinations demonstrates that Guatemala is far from peace or, at least, from the diminution of violence. The world will again close its doors because we really are not worthy of any aid while this continues.'' **********General Rios Montt has acknowledged that the editorial was laying the responsibility for the killings on the Government.  What happened in the jungle hamlet of Josefinos in the middle of May when at least 40 civilians and soldiers were killed shows how complex the situation is. **********As related by a survivor and other villagers in the remote region in the northern reaches of the country, a large guerrilla force entered Josefinos. They gathered the villagers for a political meeting and brought in cases of provisions. **********The guerrillas also killed two men they said were members of right-wing death squads, according to the villagers. Guerrillas Get Away **********The guerrillas fled before the army responded, but in a battle a few miles away, between 20 and 25 soldiers were killed.  About midnight, more soldiers arrived. The villagers say the soldiers began setting fire to the hewn-wood, thatched-roof houses and killing villagers. At least 20 people were killed, most of whom were women and children, the villagers said. **********A former soldier who now works for a small company in Flores, the largest nearby town, acknowledged that the army had burned the village and killed the people, because ''they were subversives,'' he said. **********Asked if the Indians in Josefinos supported the guerrillas, the survivor answered ''probably.'' Asked why, she glanced in the direction of the soldiers in camouflage uniforms who were manning a machine-gun post and answered: ''Because they have unjustifiably killed so many. They have taken them away, they killed them.'' **********The Government contends that the guerrillas are to blame for the killings.

For the week, the loss was 0.45 cent. The other deliveries showed somewhat smaller losses for Friday and the week. Each hundredth of a cent is equivalent to $11.20 on each contract of 112,000 pounds. **********While the market in foreign sugar had been expecting, and absorbing, heavy selling since President Reagan ordered the reimposition of import quotas on May 5, the severity of last Friday's price break stunned many traders. After all, world sugar futures had already tumbled more than a cent since the President's proclamation. **********Another indicator of the intensity of the selling was that volume on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange last Friday rose to an estimated 11,000 contracts from 6,100 the day before. More important, the open interest is expected to show a large drop when it is reported tomorrow morning. As it was, the number of outstanding contracts fell by 2,400, to 62,000, in the first four days of the week. **********According to several brokers, many buyers were caught off guard because they had expected Friday's activity to be largely devoted to squaring accounts before the Memorial Day weekend. Indeed, many in the trade had left by the time the full force of the selling occurred. **********''What many longs didn't realize, or ignored, was that Tuesday is first notice day to deliver sugar against the July contract, and the shorts are more than eager to do so,'' one broker said. ''The country is awash in sugar, and the full impact of the new quotas will not be felt for a long time.'' **********Another view was offered by Erik N. Dunlaevy, sugar analyst at Balfour, Maclaine Inc., commodity brokers, who observed: ''Many traders had expected the No.11 world sugar market was finished after May 5, but when it continued quite active, albeit at declining values, they decided to ride it out.'' **********What the steady open interest and volume in the world sugar futures market did not disclose to many remaining speculators was that the composition of the hedging was changing rapidly. Many domestic producers, refiners, merchants and other hedgers had turned to the No.12 domestic sugar futures market on the same exchange. **********The No.12 market had been relatively inactive since the import quota system was abandoned on Dec. 31, 1974. Most domestic and foreign hedgers preferred the far more active and thus more liquid No.11 world futures. **********''Since May 5, domestic hedgers have been moving into the No.12 market because its prices are now more in line with values, while the shocked and confused foreign producers and users have rushed into the world futures to protect themselves from further price declines,'' Mr. Dunlaevy noted. **********Overall, he added, ''there would have been even more foreign hedge and outright selling, except that many of them did not want to sell into a declining market, preferring to wait for some technical or other rally to afford them an opportunity to do so without further sinking the market.'' **********How distraught the foreign producers have been was discussed by Nauman Barakat, sugar analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Many foreign traders didn't expect world sugar to break 8 cents and sell at levels not seen since the second half of 1979,'' Mr. Barakat said. **********''Also, many thought the current import quota of 220,000 tons for the period ending June 30 would be revised sharply higher for the third quarter, thus taking some pressure off the surpluses held by foreign producers,'' he said. **********But this view is fading, as foreign producers have begun to compete against one another for the sharply restricted United States market despite the higher import fees that accompanied the President's proclamation. **********''Take the case of Argentina,'' Mr. Barakat said. ''In the first quarter of 1982, they sold 99,507 tons of sugar in this country.  Under the current quota, Argentina can only sell 9,460 tons. They will have to find other markets for the rest. So will all the larger exporters, such as the Dominican Republic, Brazil, the Philippines and the Central Americans.'' **********Their plight is equaled by many independent domestic cane sugar refiners who normally buy foreign raw sugar and sell the refined products to their customers under long-term contracts. These refiners also have rushed into the No. 12 domestic sugar futures market to try to lock in much of their forward sales commitments. **********Last Thursday, these refiners had sought an immediate preliminary injunction in Federal court against the new quota system. But Judge Bernard Newman of the United States Court of International Trade said he would reserve judgment on the matter. Because many in the trade expect no decision for several weeks, it also provoked some selling late last week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/23/business/acceptance-of-surtax-is-hinted.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Cowan", "pub_date": "1982-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 931, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ACCEPTANCE OF SURTAX IS HINTED", "print_headline": "ACCEPTANCE OF SURTAX IS HINTED", "body_text": " **********Without committing President Reagan, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan hinted broadly today that the Administration would accept a temporary surtax on upper-income taxpayers as part of a budget compromise with Congress. **********The Secretary also articulated more fully than he has before the view that concerted action by Congress and the Administration to shrink future projected budget deficits is essential to reducing interest rates and to the success of the Reagan economic policy. **********For the first time, Mr. Regan also said that the Administration has to **********Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, repeated his call for big reductions in projected Federal budget deficits. Page D2. deal with the public perception - mistaken in his view - that the President's tax and budget-cutting policies have hurt lower-income groups more than others. **********Speaking to some 400 corporate lobbyists and lawyers at a United States Chamber of Commerce breakfast, Secretary Regan said that the income surtax might be 4 percent of Federal tax liabilities in excess of $5,000. Illustratively, he said that someone who owed $10,000 in Federal taxes would pay an extra 4 percent on the second $5,000, or $200 more. **********''Will $200 destroy your incentive?'' the Secretary asked his audience -men and women who, he implied, make at least as much as the $69,000 annually that Cabinet officers are paid. His tone conveyed disbelief. His point was that the surtax would not materially dilute the incentives for work and risky investment that are supposed to flow from the three-stage tax cut the President signed into law last August. A tax cut of 5 percent took effect last October and 10 percent cuts are scheduled for July 1 of this year and next. **********The Treasury chief, a regular participant in the budget talks, was careful to say that the matter was not settled. ''This is a bone of contention, the surtax,'' he said. ''This has not been accepted by either side as being in place.'' **********After the breakfast, Mr. Regan expressed to several reporters a sense of urgency about the budget talks, a sense that officials said the Secretary had also expressed to the President. 'The Country Is in a Mess' **********''The country is in a mess,'' Mr. Regan said. ''People are hurting from this recession. Interest rates are staying remarkably high because of the perception we are not dealing with budget deficits.'' **********Mr. Regan, Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and other senior officials have become concerned in recent weeks that unless interest rates decline more than they have, the expected recovery from the business recession may be delayed, feeble and short-lived. Accordingly, there is in the budget negotiations what Mr. Regan called ''a sense of urgency.'' **********The senior officials are understood to have expressed these fears to President Reagan, who was said to share their sense of urgency about the importance of fashioning an early agreement with Congressional leaders on raising revenue and cutting spending.  Meanwhile, Mr. Reagan has been receiving contradictory advice from supply-side economists and others, such as the United States Chamber of Commerce, who oppose any tax increases as likely to hobble the economy. Support for Tax Increases **********Secretary Regan was authoritatively reported to have assured members of Congress participating in the budget talks that the Federal Reserve System would not choke off any recovery with a tigher monetary policy. He has also sought to allay fears that the central bank might abruptly shift to easy money, causing a sudden surge in the money supply that might drive interest rates up by triggering expectations of a compensatory tightening. **********Support for tax increases and cuts in military and other spending were urged upon the Administration by several business representatives at a White House meeting this afternoon. **********''We urged them to move forward with the process which requires the acquiesence of the Administration and the business community in tax increases,'' said John M. Albertine, president of the American Business Conference, after the 90-minute meeting with senior White House officials. **********Alexander B. Trowbridge, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said he counseled that the Administration seek a budget package that includes ''cuts in the defense budget, a capping of the rate of indexing in all entitlement programs and a search for new sources of revenue.'' Chamber Forecast Disputed **********Also represented at the meeting were the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the Business Roundtable. The Chamber of Commerce, which has issued a relatively bullish economic forecast in support of its opposition to tax increases, is experiencing strained relations with the other business groups and had a separate session at the White House last Friday. **********The chamber forecast last week that the economy would grow at an annual rate of 1 percent this spring and at a snappy 5 percent rate in the September quarter. **********In his breakfast talk to the corporate lobbyists, Secretary Regan addressed the politics of the budget exercise, starting with the observation that in politics, ''perception is reality.'' **********He also said: ''It is perceived that the Republican Party and Ronald Reagan's tax plan have benefited the rich more than the poor.  If there are to be some type of compromises reached in which social programs are cut back and taxes increased, one of the things that should be done is to try to make a better balance here between different groups in the United States.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/29/business/calumet-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CALUMET INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "CALUMET INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/aeroflex-laboratories-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AEROFLEX LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "AEROFLEX LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/business/credit-markets-long-term-bonds-advance-short-term-prices-mixed.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1982-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Long-Term Bonds Advance; Short-Term Prices Mixed", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Long-Term Bonds Advance; Short-Term Prices Mixed", "body_text": " **********A lack of supply helped raise long-term bond prices a point or more yesterday, but was not much help to the shorter-term markets, where prices rose slightly or declined in some cases. **********Securities dealers attributed the strength of the bond market to the likelihood that the Treasury may not sell a 20-year bond in late March, as had been expected. Most of the buying yesterday was by speculators and arbitragers, market participants said. **********A slight increase in overnight financing costs, and an increase in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market kept short-term rates essentially stable. The rate on high-grade commercial paper due in 30 days was little changed at 13 3/4 percent while three-month certificates of deposit were yielding 14.1 percent in the secondary market. **********New Drop in Yields Awaited **********With companies able to borrow at rates less than 14 percent in the commercial paper market, investment bankers say that many potential issuers of notes and bonds are waiting for long-term yields to fall further, even though the lack of new Treasury securities makes the market more attractive. **********Among those companies that are selling longer-term issues, a $75 million issue of Baa/BBB-rated 16 5/8 percent bonds of the Consumers Power Company go on sale today at a price of 99 to yield 16.832 percent to maturity in 1992.

Federal Deficit Cited **********Although the Treasury's presence in the marketplace is not too burdensome now, analysts warn that the Federal deficit is not going away and that the Treasury will re-emerge in the second quarter as a heavy borrower. The short-lived nature of the hiatus in Treasury financing may be one reason why institutional buyers have not been rushing to the market, they added. **********Analysts at Merrill Lynch recently forecast that the Treasury would raise $26 billion of net new cash in the second quarter - a record amount for that quarter, which is traditionally a time of debt reduction as income tax receipts bolster the Treasury's coffers. **********In the bill market, the Merrill Lynch forecast is for weekly auctions of three- and six-month issues to rise to $10.4 billion by June, compared with $9.6 billion recently, while one-year bill auctions remain at $5.25 billion. **********In the note market, Merrill Lynch expects $5.25 billion of two-year notes to be sold monthly, plus one issue each of four, five, and seven-year notes of $3.5 billion each. Finally, the May refunding package of notes and bonds is expected to total $9 billion. **********In the tax-exempt market, the savings to borrowers who sell shortterm issues is even more pronounced than in the corporate market. Many issuers pay less than 7 or 8 percent on short-term obligations due in a month or so, compared with 12 percent and higher for top grade long-term bonds. **********A new issue of A-rated Chicago general obligation bonds shows how yields increase with longer maturities. Underwriters led by the First National Bank of Chicago reoffered the bonds at yields ranging from 9.25 percent in 1984 to 12 1/2 percent in 1992, with a 13.65 percent yield on term bonds due in 2003 and 13.75 percent for bonds due 2013.

The notes mature March 11, 1983, and are offered to yield 8.75 through underwriters led by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.

The 58-year-old monthly journal of cultural affairs and literary criticism has often been in financial peril - it was declared bankrupt in 1973 - and it has been losing $1 million a year for at least the past three years. **********The owner, Robert I. Weingarten, said no final decision had been made, but the staff at the magazine's offices at 150 East 58th Street had been warned to prepare for the worst. **********''We're still grappling with the options,'' Mr. Weingarten said.  ''We're in the last hours of doing so.'' He said he had set a deadline of noon Monday for responses from people he had approached about ways to keep the publication in business. 480,000 Subscribers **********The June issue was mailed to 480,000 subscribers, but the combined issue prepared for July and August has not yet been printed. A dozen staff members have already been dismissed, a move that Mr. Weingarten said would have been taken in any event to pare costs. **********The magazine is owned by Macro Communications, a closely held public company that is traded over the counter. Mr. Weingarten controls Macro, which also owns the relatively healthy Financial World, a biweekly covering business news. A third Macro publication, View, devoted to coverage of television, is being sold. **********Since buying Saturday Review, Mr. Weingarten has raised both the advertising rates and subscription rates, but the majority of copies are sold through magazine discount houses at prices that provide little or no revenue to the magazine itself. **********The magazine has passed through a number of hands and a number of formats since it was founded in 1924 by Henry Seidel Canby and Amy Loveman. Its greatest success came after World War II, when, under the editorship of Norman Cousins, it provided a lively weekly look at cultural affairs, in general, and literature, in particular. Mr.  Cousins left Saturday Review in 1971, and although he later returned to run it for a few years, the magazine never recovered from the decision, by one set of owners, to split it into four separate monthlies. It later went to a biweekly format. Magazine Repositioned **********When Mr. Weingarten took over, he changed it to a monthly, to cut costs. He also took it out of the general-interest field, where it was competing with Atlantic and Harper's magazines, and restored the original editorial direction, concentrating on literary critcism and news of the visual and performing arts. The June issue, for example, included an article by Anthony Burgess about James Joyce, a review by Mordecai Richler of John Barth's new novel and articles on Louis Malle, the filmmaker, and on the London theater season. **********The editor, Stephen B. Shepard, said he thought the magazine had been sucessfully repositioned but ''we haven't had the money to do the necessary promotion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/11/business/advertising-american-heritage-to-accept-ads.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; American Heritage to Accept Ads", "print_headline": "Advertising; American Heritage to Accept Ads", "body_text": " **********SOON after American Heritage magazine went to soft cover in 1978 after 25 years as a hard-cover publication, there appeared within its covers an ad for subscriptions along with a bound-in card. It was the first ad the magazine had ever carried. Some time later, the six-a-year publication began to carry ads for American Heritage catalogue products. **********Subscribers may not have realized it at the time, but that was the nose and the ears of the camel of advertising coming into their tents. The publishers were testing the waters for public reaction, and got five negative letters at most. **********As a result, after all these years of abstinence, American Heritage will become an full-fledged advertising medium beginning with the August/ September issue. But with a difference. One of the first people the magazine turned to for advice, Joseph H. Newman, vice president-media director of Marsteller, convinced the publishers to take a very special route: a single advertiser per issue. **********Behind these major changes is Samuel P. Reed, 47-year-old chairman of the American Heritage Publishing Company, grandson of the late Samuel F. Pryor, chairman of the executive committee of Remington Arms, and son-in-law of the late Charles W. Englehard, multimillionaire precious metals industrialist and race horse owner. **********Mr. Reed quit the presidency of the Engelhard & Hanover investment firm to buy American Heritage from it. It had previously been owned by McGraw-Hill, which had bought it from the original crowd, which, led by James Parton, brought out the first 80,000 print order with a stake of $64,000. Now, for $67,500, a single advertiser can have six to eight advertising pages in a single issue but no back cover. **********With Byron Dobell, 55, editor, and Paul E. Hale, 39, the president and publisher he brought in from Time Inc., in his office, Mr. Reed noted that, when he became owner of the magazine, he was determined to go to soft cover, which he did three years ago; take advertising, which is soon to happen, and increase the publishing frequency, something to look forward to. **********The first advertiser to go after the 110,000 circulation will be Grumman, a Marsteller client, and the second, Oscar de la Renta, the fashion and fragrance company, whose agency is Calet, Hirsch, Kurnit & Spector. **********Should the readership be taken aback by the sudden appearance of commercial messages, although the management has research that says they will not be, Mr. Dobell will seek to soothe them in his editorial with the assuring words that the move ''fortifies our future and takes the burden of increasing costs off the necks of our readers.'' **********This is despite the fact that the recent increase in annual subscription price to $24 from $21 for the soft cover and to $45 from $35 for the deluxe (artificial leather) hard cover caused no drop in consumer interest or the comforting 74 percent subscription renewal rate. It had revenues last year of about $2.2 million. **********Mr. Dobell arrived in January after a distinguished career that included being managing editor of both Esquire and New York. He said yesterday that he planned very few changes to the history-oriented magazine except a few little touches that might make it even easier to read. **********Mr. Hale noted that for the single advertiser there were distinct possibilities for merchandising the involvement, and, to help, the company will make available at a reduced price additional copies of the magazine in both cover versions. **********Another change that Mr. Reed hath wrought is in the area of newsstand sales, where the publication had never ventured even when its circulation was way up over the 300,000 mark. But since last October, through Eastern News, distributor of a number of quality publications, American Heritage at $3 a copy has begun a ''slow and careful'' move into the retail marketplace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/07/world/around-the-world-filipino-athlete-s-family-gets-new-ransom-note.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Filipino Athlete's Family Gets New Ransom Note", "print_headline": "Around the World; Filipino Athlete's Family Gets New Ransom Note", "body_text": " **********The family of a missing athlete, Tommy Manotoc, who secretly married the daughter of President Ferdinand E.

Texaco Inc., the nation's third-largest oil company, reported a 1.4 percent gain and the Standard Oil Company (Ohio), No.13, reported an even smaller rise. **********The lackluster performance has been attributed to a poor economy that has damped demand for oil products. Although some crude oil prices have softened, prices for refined products have dropped even more, squeezing oil refinery margins, analysts said. **********Texaco's earnings were termed ''not bad'' by Bruce E. Lazier, an analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc., in light of a retroactive rise in the cost of crude from Saudi Arabia and the declining dem and - and prices -for refined products. ''Texaco's overseas refi ning market was down, and it increased its exploration expenses,'' M r. Lazier said. ''So it wasn't a bad performance. And it was a strong performance in relation to market conditio ns, which are pretty bad.'' **********John K. McKinley, Texaco's chairman and chief executive officer, citing the sluggish business conditions, said that ''operating in this business environment,'' Texaco ''could not fully recover'' increases in the cost of its Saudi Arabian crude. **********Sohio, however, was somewhat protected from the squeeze on refinery margins because a large percentage of its earnings come from the sale of crude from the North Slope of Alaska. Texaco **********In the fourth quarter, Texaco earned $507 million, or $1.96 a share, on revenues of $14.7 billion. This compared with the net income a year earlier of $500 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenues of $14.1 billion. **********Fourth-quarter earnings benefited from a $113 million after-tax gain in inventory profits from the sale of older inventories built up when crude prices were lower. But this was partly offset by a $43 million write-off after the closing of a Lockport, Ill., refinery and by a $21 million loss from translating operations in foreign currencies back into dollars. **********Net income for the full year dropped 3 percent, to $2.3 billion, or $8.75 a share, on revenues of $59.4 billion, from $2.2 billion, or $8.31, on revenues of $52.5 billion in 1980. **********For 1981, foreign currency translations yielded a net gain of $57 million. The 1980 results included a $402 million gain from the sale of Texaco's interest in the Belridge Oil Company. Standard of Ohio **********Fourth-quarter income at Standard of Ohio totaled $477.8 million, or $1.94 a share, on revenues of $3.70 billion. This compared with net income of $475.8 million, or $1.93, on revenues of $3.06 billion in the 1980 period. **********For the year, Sohio reported a 7 percent rise in net income, to $1.95 billion, or $7.92 a share, on revenues of $13.81 billion, from $1.8 billion, or $7.37, on revenues of $11.34 billion in 1980. **********Sohio's revenues reflected the inclusion of the sales of the Kennecott Corporation, which Sohio acquired on June 4. Kennecott's metals-mining operations lost $59 million since the June 4 acquistion, because of depressed copper and precious metals prices, but its industrial products and services operations earned $32 million. **********Sohio said earnings were hurt by higher ''windfall profit'' and severance taxes and by a doubling in exploration costs. A $30 million write-off of a desulfurization project in Cleveland partly offset increases in operating income from refining and marketing operations.  Sun Company **********The Sun Company, ranked No.11, reported that fourth-quarter earnings were up about fifteenfold, to $448 million, or $3.59 a share, compared with $30 million, or 22 cents, in the 1980 fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter revenues rose to $4.4 billion from $4.1 billion. **********But Sun's 1981 fourth quarter included one-time gains from sales of assets totaling $2.39 a share, while the 1980 period included a $1.33-a-share write-off of discontinued shipbuilding operations. **********Fourth-quarter operating earnings rose to $149 million in 1981 from $92 million in 1980. The company attributed the increase to higher domestic crude oil and natural gas prices. **********For the full year, Sun reported a 48 percent gain in net income, to $1.1 billion, or $8.59 a share, on revenues of $16 billion, from $723 million, or $5.71, on revenues of $13.2 billion in 1980. The full-year results included a gain of $135 million, or $1.07 a share, from the sale of the Sun's Sperry-Sun oilfield services subsidiary.

Mulhern, Citicorp senior vice president and general counsel, said the ruling would clear the way for the holding company, parent of the nation's second-largest bank, to offer such new services as banking at home on computer terminals and electronic publishing of financial and economic data, which Citishare's customers would be able to read on computer terminals. **********''It sounds as though what we asked for, we got, pretty much,'' Mr. Mulhern said. ''It will have real significance in our being able to compete in the new world of technology, and we couldn't be more pleased.'' **********The pace-setting Federal Reserve Board ruling is expected to clear the way for other bank holding companies to also enter the rapidly growing field of data processing. **********The Fed found no evidence, as the computer service firms had feared, that Citicorp would tie its sales of computer services to making of loans through its Citibank unit or that it would subsidize its computer services with revenues from other activities. **********Citicorp was not given a carte blanche entry into computer services, however. Its activities must be restricted to ''banking, financial and economic data.'' **********Jerome Dreyer, president of the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, which represents computer service companies, said it was likely the group would appeal. However, he said the decision was not as permissive in allowing Citicorp's expansion as he feared it would be. **********The Federal Reserve Board agreed that the activities proposed by Citishare are closely related to banking and therefore permissible under its Regulation Y, which governs the nonbanking activities of holding companies. Earlier this year, an administrative law judge appointed by the board had issued a similar ruling. **********Banks already engage in data processing and transmission for their internal needs and for their banking customers. Computers, for instance, are used to keep track of bank balances and for financial analysis. Automatic teller machines represent a form of data processing and transmission. **********The Fed ruling allows Citishare to offer computer programs, services and hardware to other banks, businesses and consumers, thus putting it into competition with computer companies. **********According to its application, Citicorp is considering a wide range of services. It expects to sell programs on a time-sharing basis to other banks and businesses, allowing them to perform such tasks as credit analysis and financial modeling. It plans to provide accounting, bookkeeping and economic forecasting for business generally. It also wants to provide customers with access to data bases containing information such as economic statistics and foreign currency quotes that are stored in Citicorp's computers. **********The application said it also expects to sell software, hardware, and data transmission services for fund transfers between banks.  Citicorp already owns two channels on a Western Union satellite, which it can use for its internal data transmissions but could also use for outside customers. It also might sell computer terminals and service to consumers, allowing them to pay bills, request balances or perform other banking functions at home.

He declined to elaborate ''inasmuch as there is a judicial process under way on these complaints.'' **********On the basis of total demand for steel last year of 104 million tons, which includes domestic shipments plus imports but less exports, 4.95 percent would amount to a little more than 5 million tons, compared with 6.4 million tons the Europeans shipped here last year. **********However, the European offer excludes tubular products, which some industry sources said made it unacceptable. These products are used mainly in pipe for the oil and gas industry. They were in short supply last year, but because of cutbacks in domestic drilling activity inventories today are high. **********One industry source said that ''American steel companies are not going to give that market away.'' European steel industry sources said, on the other hand, that even after expansion, now under way, of tubular production capacity, future needs for this type of steel for oil and gas exploration will lead to a demand so great that the American industry will be unable to meet it. Last year American steel companies, such as United States Steel, were the biggest importers of tubular products. West Germany was the biggest supplier. **********Altogether, the Common Market's shipments of tubular goods last year into the United States totaled 1.8 million tons.  According to industry sources, the market share would be based on forecasts that would be self-correcting as the year progressed. The steel would come in ''competitively priced'' under a formula that would peg it close to domestic market prices, according to the proposal of Mr. Baldrige, the sources said. They added that the Common Market commission would monitor the steel on a product-byproduct and country-of-origin basis. **********In the unfair trade practices case, should the department agree with United States Steel and six other domestic producers that foreign governments provided substantial subsidies to help their companies sell at low prices in the United States, allegations that are denied by the Europeans, a process would follow that could bar much European steel from this market. **********The industry has charged that the subsidies, in the form of interest rebates, tax waivers, conversion of debt to government equity and other aids, amounted to as much as $300 on a ton of steel that currently sells for $450 to $500. The Commerce Department's concurrence would lead to the imposition of substantial countervailing duties that would price much of the foreign steel out of the market. **********European officials have made no secret of their intention to retaliate against American products if their steel market is sharply curtailed in the United States. **********The European steel industry is about as depressed as that of the United States and that creates pressure on the Europeans to keep up exports. In Belgium and France, there have been major steelworker riots protesting plant closings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/14/business/occidental-oil-find.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Occidental Oil Find", "print_headline": "Occidental Oil Find", "body_text": " **********The Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced today that its Argentine subsidiary had discovered a new oilfield in Argentina, with a well testing 3,586 barrels of 32-degree oil daily in the Mendoza area.

Soon, however, he found himself browsing through racks of literature at the store's financial service center, where employees were selling insurance, stocks and bonds, and homes. **********But on that day, all Mr. Janda did was browse. Such is the challenge faced by Sears: Can the world's largest retailer interest its traditional shopper in the financial services on which it has staked so much? **********Of course, Sears fully expects to succeed.  ''We definitely see this as viable in terms of public acceptance,'' said Douglas Fairwether, a Sears spokesman at its Chicago headquarters. ''If anyone was wondering if people will buy stocks where they buy socks, they will. We've seen that.'' **********About three months ago, Sears opened financial service centers - where consumers can buy auto insurance, sell 100 shares of A.T.& T.  or determine the best way to finance a home - in eight of its 851 stores, including the one here. Depending on how this test works out, other such centers could be introduced in the months ahead. **********But some financial service competitors have some doubts about the experiment. For example, Jim Settle, senior vice president and director of marketing at Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., said that ''Sears is really emphasizing savings and spending under the same roof.'' He went on: ''But an investor's relation with his stockbroker is a very personal and intimate thing. I'm skeptical, but with a company with their resources, you've got to watch very carefully what they're going to do.'' **********And Peter Muratore, executive vice president and national retail marketing director at E.F. Hutton & Company, observed, ''Generally our industry is not a walk-in business and it isn't a casual business. I think investments are sold more than bought and I'm not sure that the atmosphere in a department store is conducive to this type of selling. But we hope they do very, very well and we would be happy to do similar things with other people if it is successful.'' Company in Position for Move **********The increased interest by Sears in financial services had its genesis at the start of 1982, when the company completed two big acquisitions - taking over Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a securities broker-dealer, and Coldwell, Banker & Company, a real estate broker, for a total of more than $800 million. **********Sears already owned the Allstate Insurance Company - the country's second-largest writer of automobile and homeowner insurance after State Farm Mutual - and thus was positioned to offer one-stop shopping in finance just as it had been doing in general merchandise. While 76 percent of Sears's revenue of $18.2 billion in the first half of 1982 was still derived from its merchandising group, the company now has an important position in three major financial services - insurance, securities and real estate. **********''We plan to bring a variety of financial services to American consumers,'' said Charles F. Moran, vice president for corporate planning at Sears. ''What better place to do it than in the place where they are most familiar with you - in the Sears store.'' **********But Sears is less than loquacious about the results so far of this experiment in selling services. It refuses to disclose any statistics about the number of customers who have visited the centers, the amount of new financial accounts that have been opened or the revenue derived from this expensive square-footage. **********''Sometime after the first of the year, we'll be able to put together an evaluation of the data and determine what comes next,'' is all that Mr. Moran will say on this subject. ''But in any event, it is most probable that we would not have a financial service center in every store, because some are small and would not be able to support this kind of unit.'' Vast Potential Market **********The marriage of financial services and retailing is not unique to Sears. A number of supermarkets around the country installed automatic teller machines hooked up to local banks some time ago. And just last month, a joint venture was inaugurated between the Kroger Company and the Capital Holding Company to sell such products as insurance, money market funds and individual retirement accounts at some Kroger stores, starting with one in Grove City, Ohio. **********At Sears, however, the theory is that everyone in the store is part of one big, happy family, since the parent corporation is selling its own services as well as its own merchandise. And with 24 million active retail accounts and another 12 million catalogue customers, the company feels that the potential market for its financial services is huge. ''The Sears customer is America,'' asserted Mr.  Fairwether, the Sears spokesman. **********''People can come into a nonmedicinal, nonintimidating atmosphere for their financial services,'' said S. David Whipkey, manager of this 230,000-square-foot, two-level Sears store at the intersection of Route 50 and Interstate 66 in the Washington suburbs. ''And it's not like buying from a street-side vendor, either.'' **********The financial service center in Mr. Whipkey's store is an area of 1,400 square feet next to the busiest entrance and directly across from the catalogue, credit and customer service departments.  Decorated in subdued earth tones, the center is open and informal, shaped in a semicircle and with separate selling alcoves for its three components - Allstate, Dean Witter and Coldwell, Banker. **********Like the store itself, the financial service center is open from 10 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. daily and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday - longer by far than most brokerage, insurance and real estate offices operate.  Traffic in this service area varies from extremely light, as it was around noon on a recent Tuesday, to heavy, as employees say it is on Friday nights and Saturdays. Initially customers were drawn to the center through targeted promotional mailings offering a free financial planning guide to those who came in, but now business is largely generated from those customers who pass by. **********The employees that operate the Dean Witter and Coldwell, Banker booths in the service center rotate on a regular basis from nearby offices of their firms. Allstate workers are assigned to the store on a full-time basis and, like insurance salespeople everywhere, they spend much of their time calling on potential customers at their homes. **********''This place is very good for generating leads,'' said Shaun English, a Dean Witter registered representative who works one day a week at the store. ''We've been opening over two new accounts a day.'' **********Sears people like to tell stories about the unusual business that has developed since the financial service centers opened last July 19. For example, they talk about the couple who came in to open a $2.9 million brokerage account. And they recall the woman who saw a picture of a house in the Coldwell, Banker section of a center and told the representative there that she wanted to buy it - regardless of price or location."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/16/world/reagan-welcomes-halt-in-fighting.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1982-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 480, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN WELCOMES HALT IN FIGHTING", "print_headline": "REAGAN WELCOMES HALT IN FIGHTING", "body_text": " **********President Reagan welcomed the end of fighting in the Falkland Islands today and pledged the United States to assist ''in any way it can'' to produce a lasting political settlement. **********Despite the President's offer, senior Administration officials said Argentina and Britain should first try to settle their differences by themselves. One official said it would be ''presumptuous'' for the United States to seek to mediate or offer proposals without being asked by the Argentines and the British. **********This seeming reluctance by the United States to play a more active postwar role in the Falklands is largely a result, officials said, of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's determination to restore British political control over the islands and not to appear to reward the Argentines for their seizure of the Falklands by encouraging third-party involvement in negotiations. U.S. Said to Be Understanding **********One official said the United States would have preferred a more ''magnanimous'' approach to the Argentines by Mrs. Thatcher. But, he said, given the loss of British lives and the prolonged crisis, the Administration was understanding of her seeming refusal to do more than in effect demand unconditional surrender by the Argentines. **********Mr. Reagan's reaction to the cease-fire was made public in written form by the White House and was devoid of any praise for the British, whose side the United States has supported since April 30, after Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.'s mediation efforts had broken down. **********The statement also avoided terming the events an Argentine ''surrender,'' trying not to embarrass the Argentines, with whom Washington would like to improve relations now that the Falkland fighting is over. **********''The United States welcomes the cease-fire which is now in place in the Falkland Islands,'' Mr. Reagan's statement said. ''We hope the tragic loss of life which has thus far occurred in this crisis can now be brought to an end. For its part, the United States continues to stand ready to assist in any way it can to help resolve this conflict.'' Worsening of Ties Anticipated **********As a result of the decision to side with Britain, American officials have said that they expect a dramatic worsening of United States relations with other Latin American countries, particularly with Argentina and countries like Venezuela that strongly supported the Argentines. **********Various Latin American experts in the State Department have urged that the Administration give priority after the fighting to trying to repair relationships in the hemisphere, but to avoid dramatic steps such as a high-level visit to the region for fear that this would provide a target for anti-American groups and perhaps worsen the situation. **********Rather, they have advised seeking consultations after tempers have cooled, and making an effort to persuade Latin countries that the United States remains committed to the hemisphere alliance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/13/world/shanghai-catholic-seminary-admits-36-in-its-first-class.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shanghai Catholic Seminary Admits 36 in Its First Class", "print_headline": "Shanghai Catholic Seminary Admits 36 in Its First Class", "body_text": " **********China's breakaway Catholic Church has opened its first seminary for student priests in Shanghai, the official New China News Agency said today. **********It said the first class consisted of 36 men from Shanghai and neighboring provinces of eastern China.

Strange, the islands' conservationist. **********The penguins and seals, he said, ''were out to sea.'' The large colonies of seabirds, meanwhile, migrate in the winter, the season it was during the fighting and still is in these remote islands in the South Atlantic. ''If the fighting had commenced three months earlier,'' Mr. Strange said, ''it could have had a disastrous effect.'' **********The islands' wildlife, however, may yet feel the war's aftermath.  With the nearly certain prospect of Britain's establishing a large military garrison, probably doubling the Falklands' population of 1,800, the wildlife could be threatened, according to Mr. Strange. Tourist Trade Imperiled **********''There will be a lot of ship involvement,'' he said, glancing out at a harbor crowded with warships and transport vessels, ''and with that there will be accidents, oil spills.'' **********Another postwar difficulty, he said, is the likely curtailment of a small but steady tourist trade, most of it geared to Falkland wildlife. Ships that brought conservationists and photographers usually stopped in Argentina before sailing to the Falklands. ''They would then go on to Antarctica,'' Mr. Strange said. **********Argentina's strained relations with Britain, however, may prompt the tourist ships to bypass the Falklands. ''In any case,'' he said, ''I see political problems.'' **********For those who once came on their own, on a weekly flight from Argentina, prospects are similarly dismal because that link has been severed. Air Fleet Destroyed **********Within the islands, access between Stanley and the remote settlements on the main islands, and to the even more remote islands rich in wildlife, was almost entirely by air. But the entire local air fleet - two float planes and a land plane - was destroyed in the fighting. **********''There are only helicopters now,'' Mr. Strange said, ''and I've been trying to get on one to visit New Island,'' a reserve at the extreme western edge of the islands. **********''But our priorities are not high enough,'' he said.  Mr. Strange lives with his wife, Maria, and their 15-month-old daughter, Georgina, in a Scandinavian-style house made from a special sort of driftwood. ''About 80 years ago,'' he said, ''a ship called the Bertha was shipwrecked here, and it was carrying a cargo of cedar logs. I gathered them up and built the house.'' Stayed During the Occupation **********Mr. Strange arrived here 22 years ago from Lincolnshire, England, to run an experimental sheep farm, but he turned to conservation, following an interest that his grandfather and others in his family had pursued. He earns his living as a wildlife artist, stamp designer, writer and lecturer. **********During the Argentine occupation of the islands, he said, ''we refused to leave our house.'' That was a decision made by about half the people of Stanley, who assumed, correctly, that empty houses would be occupied by Argentine soldiers. ''I bricked up a corner,'' he said, ''which we used as a shelter, and in fact a couple of bullets went through a window.'' **********The house also suffered some shrapnel damage when a salvo from the British naval bombardment ''landed 30 meters away, by their radar installation.'' **********The Argentine authorities ''knew everybody here,'' Mr. Strange said, ''because many had worked for years as Argentinian representatives.'' **********''They were generally good normal people.'' Life Still Far From Normal **********Mrs. Strange is an Argentine, and she was asked to serve as a translator. ''She said she'd do so only in the hospital,'' Mr.  Strange said, ''and they accepted that.'' **********The fighting has ended, but life in the Falklands is still far from normal. ''People are short-tempered and very nervous toward each other,'' he said. **********''Just the sheer volume of noise,'' he added, glancing out at the busy waterfront. ''I haven't touched a paintbrush. I find it very difficult to concentrate.'' **********Among the qualities of the Falkland wildlife are the sheer numbers. ''There are millions of penguins, millions,'' Mr. Strange said.  ''There are also albatrosses, large seal herds and a variety of marine animals, such as dolphins and porpoises, and a few whales.'' **********Many seabirds use the islands as a breeding ground in the summer months, from October to March. Nobody had done any wildlife census work, he said, although he once estimated that the albatross colony numbered two million and that the penguins were more numerous. Some Birds Limited to Islands **********''We also have certain species of seabirds only found here,'' he said, ''such as a form of petrel prion and a rare form of hawk, the striated caracara, that exists only in the Falklands.'' **********He said the wildlife was concentrated on West Falkland, one of the two major islands, where there was relatively little destruction from the fighting. **********Stanley, where much more damage was inflicted, ''is not reknowned for wildlife,'' he said. ''But in Stanley the Agentinians used scare depth charges against possible frogmen, and porpoises and dolphins would have been killed, here and outside of Port William.'' Port William is just north of Stanley. **********Mr. Strange said Argentine soldiers inflicted some damage on the wildlife. ''They were short of food and were prepared to shoot anything in the bird line,'' he said. Strict Measures Needed **********The British presence, 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers now, is likely to be 2,000 in a permanent garrison.  Conservation measures will have to be strict, Mr. Strange said.  ''The islanders themselves,'' he said, ''tended to be conservationoriented, but we've had a lot of visitors and the younger people view wildlife with a different eye.'' **********Education, he said, was perhaps the answer. ''I have great difficulty teaching,'' he said. ''I can lecture easily, in the States and elsewhere, but one is a bit shy among one's own people. I'll leave that to the teachers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/21/world/spain-holds-drug-smugglers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spain Holds Drug Smugglers", "print_headline": "Spain Holds Drug Smugglers", "body_text": " **********The police said today that they were holding five Latin Americans who had tried to smuggle 10 pounds of cocaine into Spain.

The partnership consists of 26 general partners, plus 59 Oppenheimer employees and 36 investors. **********The biggest individual stakes belong to Oppenheimer's two principal architects and driving forces, Jack Nash, 52 years old, chairman and chief executive officer, and Leon Levy, 56, chairman of Oppenheimer Management, who will remain active in certain aspects of the combined company. Firm Started in 1950 **********The Oppenheimer brokerage firm, the original basis for the partnership's current vast interests, was started in 1950 by the late Max Oppenheimer -no relation to the South African Oppenheimer family, whose leading member, Harry F. Oppenheimer yesterday announced his retirement as head of the giant Anglo-American Corporation. **********Its first business was making markets in blocked German currencies after World War II. Mr. Levy joined the firm in 1951, originally building up the customer research effort, while Mr. Nash came aboard the next year. **********The firm's reputation for innovation reflects its role in such deals as raising $40 million in capital for John Z. DeLorean's gullwinged sports car several years ago. Last year, it floated a publicly owned bond, now traded on the American Stock Exchange, as a means of raising capital - the first privately owned Big Board firm to have done so. **********Along with various acquisitions, the firm also acquired - for its fashionable 32-floor private dining room -French-born Anne Marie Durand, the former personal chef of Katharine Graham, principal owner of the Washington Post Company. **********The merger with Mercantile marks not only the latest in several large investment-firm mergers but also the first whereby a foreign entity would acquire complete control of a major United States securities firm. 'Global Synergism' **********In an interview, Oppenheimer's 41-year-old president, Stephen Robert, said of the deal: ''You could call it global synergism.'' **********Its chief significance, he said, was that ''it will allow both Mercantile House and ourselves to expand our products and services - brokerage, money management and commodities - on an international scale.'' Previously, Oppenheimer, operating out of five branches in the United States and one in London, had enjoyed only limited exposure overseas. **********In recent years, foreign investments have been made in a number of Big Board firms, including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the First Boston Corporation and the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. **********Meanwhile, the increasingly global scope of the investment business was underscored only last month when Merrill Lynch, this nation's biggest broker by far, signaled that it intended to offer its services in worldwide markets far more aggressively. Merrill Lynch agreed to establish a Hong Kong connection by acquiring a 25 percent stake in Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. and a 15 percent interest in the affiliated Sun Hung Kai Bank. **********Last October, the Phibro Corporation, the world's largest trader of commodities, acquired Salomon Brothers, the nation's biggest privately owned investment banking firm. This was interpreted as a move to position Phibro-Salomon as a marketer of any commodity, including money, to any customer anywhere in the world at any time. Wall Street Admiration **********Reaction to Oppenheimer's major deal generally was one of admiration yesterday on Wall Street. **********''This gives Mercantile House direct access to U.S. markets in one fell swoop,'' observed George L. Ball, president of the E.F. Hutton Group, one of the securities industry's largest still-independent firms and itself a recurring object of takeover rumors. **********Perrin H. Long Jr., who follows the brokerage industry for Lipper Analytical Services Inc., was more exuberant. ''It's a very good deal for Oppenheimer's management,'' he declared. ''If I offered you 3.4 times your 'book value,' or net worth, which is what Oppenheimer Holdings is getting, you'd be crazy not to take it.'' **********Moreover, he noted, the $162.5 million price tag comes to more than nine times last year's reported profit of $17 million by Oppenheimer Holdings. **********Friends of Oppenheimer's two largest owners, Mr. Nash and Mr. Levy, said yesterday that these men, along with other senior partners, had indicated their desire privately for some time ''to cash in on their investment.'' **********As moving forces at Oppenheimer, the two men have complemented each other in remarkably successful fashion. As the partnership grew, it was Mr. Nash's role initially to watch over the finances while Mr.  Levy became the guiding light for money-making ideas. Later, in 1975, when Oppenheimer was reorganized into several units, Institutional Investor magazine characterized Mr. Levy as ''the partner in charge of interplanetary affairs.'' 'Call Me Jack' **********In personality, the two men are strikingly different. Mr. Nash, who often works in shirt sleeves at the firm's luxurious headquarters at One New York Plaza, is given to quick, direct answers. Once, when a visitor addressed him as ''Mr. Nash,'' he responded: ''Call me Jack.  Mr. Nash is my father.'' **********Mr. Levy, in contrast, has been described by friends as often conveying the air of an absent-minded professor. According to one documented story, he once ushered a woman into a taxi, walked around to the other door, opened it and then said: ''I'm sorry. I didn't know this cab was taken.'' **********Oppenheimer executives who will join Mercantile House's board of directors are Mr. Nash and Mr. Robert, along with Nathan Gantcher and Donald W. Spiro. **********Another beneficiary of the deal is Electra Investment Trust, which has been an investor in the Oppenheimer Group for seven years.  Electra's investment in the Oppenheimer partnership entitles it to 20 percent of the sale proceeds, to be paid in Mercantile House stock. The Oppenheimer partnership, meanwhile, is to receive 90 percent of its interest in cash and its remaining 10 percent in stock. **********Mercantile House will receive Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., the Big Board's 25th-largest firm, with capital of $41.15 million. It also will get three money-management and realty operating companies - the Oppenheimer Management Company, the Oppenheimer Capital Corporation, and Oppenheimer Properties Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/04/business/market-place-scrutinizing-dayco-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Metz", "pub_date": "1982-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Scrutinizing Dayco Stock", "print_headline": "Market Place; Scrutinizing Dayco Stock", "body_text": " **********THE Dayco Corporation, the dominant producer of fan belts for the automotive industry, has been regarded as an investors' asset play.  Dayco's shares have languished since mid-1979 when automobile sales began to sag more deeply than anyone had expected. Earlier this year the shares traded at 11 3/8. **********Asset-conscious investors recognized this price as less than half the company's book value per share, and they reasoned that business would improve someday. Besides, despite hard times, the company was reporting fine profits and was generally optimistic. **********In its fiscal year ended last Oct. 31, Dayco seemed to have been unusually successful in view of the car makers' slump. The company initially reported earnings of $1.13 a share. This figure was higher than the general Wall Street estimate of $1.05 a share and was up from the $1.10 a share earned a year earlier. All figures shown are on a fully diluted basis. **********Then came the shocker. Dayco indicated in January that it had monitored foreign orders placed by an independent sales agent and discovered that they apparently were not valid. Dayco said that the $9 million profit it initially had foreseen would turn into an aftertax loss that could be as much as $5 million on a ''worst case'' basis. **********Last week Dayco announced an $11.7 million nonrecurring write-off because orders delivered to a port warehouse had not been picked up.  Thomas Ryan, vice president of corporate communications, explained that this write-off had eliminated the anticipated $9 million profit and resulted in a net loss to the company of $2.7 million. **********In its report last week, Dayco said there were ''substantial discrepancies between representations made to us by an independent sales agent and information received from foreign customers.'' So the company was forced to write off about $20 million in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses. **********Meanwhile, the automotive, off-the-road equipment and construction industry businesses have been doing poorly. Many of Dayco's original-equipment customers closed their plants to hold inventories at lower-than-normal levels, partly to trim interest costs at a time of high rates. **********What bothered at least one investor in Dayco stock was this barely noticed news item: The short interest in the shares of Dayco rose substantially in the month ended Feb. 11. **********Short interest, representing the sale of borrowed shares, indicates the degree to which investors are willing to bet that a stock will trade lower in the foreseeable future. For example, traders who think a company may fail to meet its earnings goal can go short, hoping that the stock will go down. If it does, they can buy shares in the open market at the lower price. The difference between what they get in selling the borrowed shares and what they pay later is profit. **********On Jan. 15 the short interest in Dayco was 136,599 shares. A month later it totaled 160,451 shares, an increase of 17 percent. (In February there was no trading on either Friday the 12th or Monday the 15th because of the Lincoln and Washington Birthday holidays.) Since the average daily volume was just 12,889 shares, the short interest represented a substantial part of the month's volume. **********Some of the short interest could represent hedging operations against the company's outstanding convertible bonds. Dayco's chairman, Richard J. Jacob, was reached at company headquarters and was asked to comment. He said he thought the rise in short interest did represent hedging against convertibles. **********But it is possible that someone who knew about the foreign-order problem sold a lot of shares short.  Since the company had already disclosed a potential loss, the prospects of a short-selling profit were modest. The price of the shares, at 12, appeared to discount fully the expected loss. When the actual extent of the loss was announced, the company's dividend seemed to be in jeopardy. The stock has been declining since then.  Dayco set a 12-month low of 10 late last week, and it closed yesterday at 10 1/4. **********Those who have been buying the shares on the basis of their intrinsic value have been disappointed.

Galtieri Was Ousted on June 17 **********He did not say what the commanders of the navy and the air force, the two other services making up Argentina's ruling junta, thought of his desire to continue the war. General Galtieri was ousted June 17, three days after the Argentine surrender in the Falklands, and was replaced as President by Maj. Gen. Reynaldo B. Bignone. **********In a new shake-up of top officers who took part in the war, the navy today announced the retirement of 18 admirals. Among them are Juan Lombardo, chief of the South Atlantic theater of operations in the war, and Leopoldo Suarez del Cerro, wartime chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **********It was the second of the three armed forces branches to shake up its command after the Falkland defeat. The air force was restructured last month with the retirement of its wartime commander, Gen. Basilio Lami Dozo, and a dozen other generals. Military sources say a shakeup in the army could come later this month, when an army commission studying the service's performance in the war ends its investigation. **********General Galtieri said Argentina's main allies in the conflict were ''our Latin American brothers'' and members of the group of nations professing nonalignment. He said Libya ''sent five Boeing airliners loaded with different materials, with very valuable elements, without our having asked for or offered to buy anything, and without any economic or political obligation involved.'' Exocets Used Effectively **********He did not specify what the Libyan shipments contained, but unconfirmed reports circulating here during the war said Argentina had received French-made Exocet missiles from Libya. The Argentine Air Force and Navy made effective use of Exocets against British warships, sinking four of them. **********General Galtieri denied reports that his Government tried to capture the islands in a move to divert public attention from a social and economic crisis. Argentina is suffering from its worst recession in 50 years. **********He said he would not have ordered the invasion if he had thought Britain would use nuclear arms in a confrontation. ''Had we considered it probable that Britain would use its nuclear arsenal, with support from the United States, it would have been harebrained to attempt the April 2 operation,'' he said. **********General Galtieri, who said he now lives on his army pension, described himself as being ''at peace with my conscience, God, my family, my friends and my country.'' He added, ''I am happy.'' **********The 74-day Falkland war left 712 Argentines and 256 British dead.

An Israeli military spokesman in Beirut said Israeli forces were not involved in Tuesday's fighting, which broke out in the Bhamdun area 12 miles east of Beirut near the withdrawal route. **********But this was disputed in Lebanese Christian broadcasts and by the state-run Beirut radio. Both said Israeli gunners were exchanging heavy artillery fire in the Bhamdun area with the Syrians. **********Meanwhile, the pullout of Palestinian guerrillas continued Tuesday, with about 600 fighters from various factions leaving on a Cypriot car ferry for Yemen. The departing Palestinians were saluted by volleys of gunfire triggered by comrades still here.

Mr. Gemayel is to succeed Elias Sarkis next month. **********On Tuesday the homes of six more Moslem Members of Parliament who took part in the parliamentary session at which Mr. Gemayel was elected were attacked in west Beirut, as was a bank in which another owned half interest. On Monday, antitank shells and rocket-propelled grenades were fired at the homes of three Moslem Members of Parliament. The decision by some Moslems to attend the session raised the number of participants to 62, a bare quorum, making the holding of the election possible. 'A National Confrontation' **********Other Moslem politicians, religious leaders and militia chiefs met in a constant stream Monday and Tuesday at the mansion of Saeb Salam, a former Prime Minister, to discuss their response to the election of Mr. Gemayel. A statement was issued declaring their intention of ''offering a national confrontation.'' **********The statement accused the Lebanese Christian Phalangists of seeking through the election of Mr. Gemayel ''to impose a regime whose factional, dictatorial and fascist features are already obvious.'' **********''The election would not have taken place,'' the statement said, ''had it not been for the fact that the national public will was crippled by the Israeli military occupation.'' Premier Must Be a Moslem **********But some politicians suggested that the statement was carefully enough worded so that it did not preclude the possibility that some kind of a deal could be made. **********The President, who must always be a Maronite Catholic under the unwritten covenant that governs politics here, must name a Sunni Moslem as his Prime Minister. **********Former Prime Minister Rashid Karami, who lives in the northern port city of Tripoli, issued a statement rejecting the election entirely, saying, ''No power in the world will be able to force us to accept these results.'' **********Walid Jumblatt, the Druse leader who heads the coalition of leftist militia forces, gloomily told reporters here that he expected Mr.  Gemayel to use Israeli forces to suppress west Beirut. **********''Lebanon has now entered a big prison,'' he said.  Soon after the election of Mr. Gemayel on Monday, gunmen from various militia factions roamed the streets of west Beirut and began attacking the homes of Members of Parliament. **********At about 3 A.M. Tuesday, a powerful explosion blew apart the offices of the Beirut Riyadh Bank over a little pizza place on Hamra Street, and the bank was looted. Hussein Mansour, a Shiite Moslem, who attended the session, is a co-owner of the bank. **********By nightfall Tuesday, a total of nine homes had been attacked, including that of Kamal al-Assad, the Shiite Moslem Speaker of Parliament who had called the election. At one home, neighborhood people drove off firefighters who tried to put out the blaze. **********Most of the explosions came in west Beirut, but one was in the northern Lebanese town of Aqura, in an area controlled by the Maronite Catholic militias of former President Suleiman Franjieh.

But they will not be allowed to expand, he said. Smaller chains will be allowed to expand up to the 20 percent limit. Big Chains Under Indictment **********Southam has 28 percent of the newspaper market and Thomson 21 percent. Both are under indictment on charges of conspiring to reduce competition in four cities by closing or merging papers. **********Another restriction on press concentration contained in the new legislation will forbid ''cross media holdings,'' or the ownership by one company of a newspaper and a radio or television station in any single market area. Those who already have such holdings will have to demonstrate ''real hardship,'' Mr. Fleming said, to avoid having to give up one property. The Canadian Radio and Television Commission has had a policy of discouraging newspapers from owning broadcasting outlets, and that policy will now be applied more firmly. **********A private company not previously involved in the press will have to demonstrate that any newspaper it acquires will be managed independently of its other interests. **********The legislation will provide for a Canadian Advisory Council on Newspapers to receive complaints from the public and to promote public debate on press questions. The council will deal with newspapers that are not already members of provincial press councils. The Advisory Council, with 50 part-time members representing publishers, journalists and the public, will act independently of government and will have sanction power beyond the impact of public criticism of a paper. **********Mr. Fleming also announced a five-year cost-sharing program with an annual maximum of about $810,000 in government grants to help individual newspapers establish news bureaus outside their provinces and abroad. Foreign Dominance Cited **********He told students at the London, Ontario, university that ''Canadians continue, especially in the print media, to receive too little news from other parts of their nation.'' He added that with the dominance of foreign press agencies, ''we are receiving a view of the world most often filtered through non-Canadian eyes.'' He described the grants as ''purely economic'' and ''completely nonjudgmental editorially.'' **********Mr. Fleming said the Government had to avoid ''intruding or appearing to intrude in a matter intimidating to editorial freedom.''

''I am outraged that my country has permitted the Israeli Government to sacrifice the people of Lebanon so as to rid itself of the P.L.O.'' 'Fueled the Fire' of Hostility **********Moments earlier, Representative Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, said; ''Resorting to such an appallingly violent approach in Lebanon, Israel has fueled the fire of Arab hostility. Since we serve as Israel's weapons supplier, that hostility is extended to us as well.'' **********In approving the Reagan Administration's request for $20 million in emergency food, clothing and medical supplies for Lebanon, members of the House said that more money for the nation would probably be needed. **********Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, said: ''We are hearing about carnage of enormous proportions.'' He said ''fairly reliable reports from Lebanon'' suggested that as many as 10,000 civilians had been killed since the Israeli attack, more than 16,000 wounded and in urgent need of medical supplies and as many as 600,000 uprooted. Israeli casualties, dead and wounded, are in the hundreds, he added. 1,000 Amputations in a Day **********Mr. Hamilton said that a doctor at the American University Hospital in Beirut reported that on Sunday about 1,100 limbs were amputated.  ''For purely humanitarian reasons, the fighting should be stopped,'' said Mr. Hamilton. He added that once the fighting ended the dimensions of relief needs would be assessed and ''further assistance will be discussed.'' **********Besides requesting $20 million in aid to Lebanon, the Administration has also announced a $5 million emergency assistance program, once the Beirut international airport and the harbor are reopened, to allow food and medical supplies. **********Representative Oakar urged the allocation of at least $200 million to rebuild Lebanon.

Lantos, Democrat of California, took strong exception to some of the comments by Miss Oakar and Mr. Rahall, who testified before the panel, as well as statements by Representative Paul Findley, Republican of Illinois.  Mr. Findley, a member of the panel, is a supporter of Palestinian statehood. **********Mr. Lantos said that Lebanon was a peaceful nation until Palestinian and Syrian troops moved in. ''Thousands of P.L.O.  terrorists and Syrian soldiers overwhelmed the whole country, and the world watched,'' he said. ''Terrorists fired rockets into peaceful villages in Israel, and the world watched. Pregnant Israeli women, and Israeli children were murdered, and the world watched.'' Arms to Libya Cited **********He added that it was ''unfair'' only to cite American arms supplies to Israel, when weapons from the Soviet Union and Libya played a significant role in the violence that had racked Lebanon in recent years. **********Also appearing before the panel were Wat T. Cluverius, Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and Bradshaw Langmaid Jr., an administrator for the Near East at the Agency for International Development. **********Mr. Langmaid said that providing medical help, assisting the homeless and rebuilding water supplies appeared to be the major priority at the moment. Food stocks, he added, appeared to be ''adequate.'' **********Mr. Cluverius said the Administration was committed to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon. ''We want to see the Government of Lebanon reconstituted,'' he said. **********He said also that, while the United States wants an Israeli withdrawal, ''Lebanon can no longer be a launching pad for attacks against Israel.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/business/brass-craft-manufacturing-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRASS-CRAFT MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BRASS-CRAFT MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/16/business/diversified-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/27/world/soviet-sees-danger-in-dispute.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET SEES DANGER IN DISPUTE", "print_headline": "SOVIET SEES DANGER IN DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union said tonight that more fighting in the Falkland Islands dispute between Britain and Argentina would pose ''great danger'' - especially to ''those who provoke'' it. **********The warning, in a commentary carried by the state-controlled television, was the first substantive reaction here to the British retaking Sunday of South Georgia, a Falklands dependency. **********It did not specify the dangers the Soviet Union foresaw. **********The commentary criticized the mediation efforts of Secretary of State Alexander M.

Habib, shared the optimistic assessment of Israeli officials that an announcement on the details of a P.L.O. and Syrian withdrawal from west Beirut might occur in the days ahead. **********James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff, said, as President Reagan had done on Friday, that the Administration was ''reasonably optimistic'' that resolution of the west Beirut crisis would be achieved. Removal Regarded as Essential **********The officials, however, cautioned that although world attention had been riveted on west Beirut in recent weeks, it was imperative that for restoration of stability in Lebanon all non-Lebanese forces leave that country. **********There are about 7,000 Palestinian guerrillas in northern and eastern Lebanon unaffected by the deal being worked out for west Beirut. In addition, there are estimated to be 30,000 Syrian forces in Lebanon and more than 50,000 Israeli forces. **********On Saturday, President Reagan met at Camp David with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and senior officials of the National Security Council and the State Department to discuss steps to take if the Habib mission arranges the evacuation of the P.L.O. from west Beirut. **********The officials said that there was agreement to give priority to the Lebanon situation, because until there is stability there, free of outside pressures, attention cannot be focused on reviving the dormant Israeli-Egyptian negotiations on self-rule for the Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan and Gaza Strip. Leadership Needed in Rebuilding **********In addition, plans for reconstructing the war-torn areas of Lebanon require calm and the political direction of the Lebanese authorities.  Officials said that papers had been drawn up dealing with specific problems, but that first and foremost, the Administration's attention was on making sure that the complicated plan for the withdrawal of the P.L.O. and Syrian forces from west Beirut goes forward. American, French and Italian forces are expected to monitor the pullback of the estimated 10,000 troops, of whom about 7,000 are said to be P.L.O.  forces. **********The withdrawal should take place over two weeks, the officials said, once an announcement is made by the Lebanese Government. At the same time, they said, talks with the Lebanese authorities will be intensified on achieving a withdrawal of Israeli forces and the remaining Syrian and P.L.O. forces. **********A complication in the situation, the officials said, is the coming expiration on Sept. 23 of the term of office of President Elias Sarkis. The Lebanese Parliament is expected to choose a Maronite Christian as his successor. Reports reaching officials here said that the process of picking a new president could begin this Thursday. Phalangist the Sole Candidate **********The only declared candidate is Bashir Gemayel, the leader of the Phalangist movement, who has been regarded as collaborating with the Israelis. But since the Israeli invasion began June 6, Mr. Gemayel has sought to leave the impression that he is independent of the Israelis. **********Under the Lebanese system, the one-chamber Parliament must achieve a two-thirds majority on the first ballot to elect a new president.  After that ballot, a majority is all that is needed. Some officials believe Mr. Gemayel could win on a second or third ballot. **********The Lebanese Government and most Lebanese public figures have said that all foreign forces must leave their country. This is also the policy of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, who has promised to pull his forces out of Lebanon once Israel's security is guaranteed and the Syrian and P.L.O. forces are gone. **********Mr. Reagan has repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including Israel's, from Lebanon. Plans to Foster Withdrawal **********In a recent interview with an Arabic newspaper published in London, Al Hawadith, Mr. Gemayal said that, if elected president, he would set down, within 48 hours of the formation of his government, guidelines for the withdrawal of all foreign troops. **********Admnistration officials here said they were concerned that the Israelis, having used heavy military force to achieve the withdrawal of P.L.O. and Syrian forces from west Beirut, may try to duplicate that by launching attacks on Syrian and P.L.O. strongpoints in the north and east of Lebanon. **********The United States plans to assure that the cease-fire in Lebanon is maintained, the officials said.  What has not been decided, they added, is the form of the discussions of the post-Beirut phase of the withdrawals. Mr. Habib would be a logical choice as an intermediary, they said, but it was not certain whether he would take on the task, likely to require considerable time and effort. Forum Remains to Be Arranged **********The forum for the discussions will have to be worked out with the Lebanese Government, they said.  Until Israeli forces leave Lebanon, Egypt has said it will not resume the stalled autonomy talks for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, the plans to disperse Palestinians from Lebanon to several Arab countries, a new urgency arises for finding a solution to the Palestinian problem, the officials said. **********This in turn may lead such Arab leaders as those in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere to take a more active part in seeking a formula acceptable to Israel within the framework worked out in Camp David in 1978. The Camp David accords offered the Palestinians considerable self-rule but left the status of the West Bank and Gaza to negotiations also involving Jordan. **********Richard Fairbanks, the State Department official in charge of the autonomy talks, took part in Saturday's meeting with Mr. Reagan and is expected to become more active in discussions with other nations of the Palestinian issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/05/world/asian-games-give-mrs-gandhi-a-political-victory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ASIAN GAMES GIVE MRS.

The Sikhs are members of a religious group living mostly in northern India. **********The Sikhs were not the only ones opposed to the games, which cost the Government about $1 billion to stage. Opposition parties called the games a waste of money and said it could have been better spent on development projects. **********Both the local press and the public paid little attention to the Sikh demonstrations.  Many Indians, moreover, were proud of the speed and skill with which thousands of laborers, architects and engineers built the stadiums and sports centers for the games, which are held every four years. ''It shows that we are capable of pulling off a major technological and managerial event,'' said Gopal Shastri, a computer engineer with a Government company. Victory for Mrs. Gandhi **********For Mrs. Gandhi, the successful staging of the games became more than an issue of prestige. The Sikh threat turned the games into a political challenge, which, even her critics concede, she won. **********After the Sikhs announced plans to bus supporters from Punjab into New Delhi on the day the games were to open, hundreds were arrested as the police and paramilitary troops stopped their buses. Some Sikhs evaded the police and made their way to New Delhi, where they took refuge in a large temple. The police placed guards around the building but did not enter it. **********Scores of Sikhs then emerged from the temple every day to shout anti-Government slogans and walk to waiting police buses, which took them to jail. But beyond causing minor traffic snarls, they were unable to enforce their threat to disrupt the games. ''It was a washout,'' a senior police officer said. ''They couldn't achieve anything.'' Want Government Limited **********The Sikhs' demands are seen as a threat to the political integrity of India and to law and order. The Sikhs want the central Government's authority and functions in Punjab to be limited to military matters, foreign relations, communications, railways and currency. The Government has rejected this. **********Mrs. Gandhi, however, is said to be considering granting some of the Sikhs' demands, including one involving the transfer of Chandigarh, a union territory on the Punjab-Haryana border, to Punjab. **********The Akali Party, which is led by religious militants, has conducted a campaign in support of its demands since September. In October four Sikhs were shot dead when a mob tried to storm the Parliament building in New Delhi. Thousands were jailed but were released before the Asian Games started. **********New Delhi itself was freshened up in preparation for the games.  The capital's roads were cleaned and resurfaced, its lawns and fields were trimmed, new trees were planted, buildings were painted and hotels and bridges were opened. **********The organizers included top military, intelligence and police officials and influential political leaders like Rajiv Gandhi, the Prime Minister's son."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/17/world/dominican-leader-in-inaugural-speech-sets-austere-course.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1982-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 830, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOMINICAN LEADER, IN INAUGURAL SPEECH, SETS AUSTERE COURSE", "print_headline": "DOMINICAN LEADER, IN INAUGURAL SPEECH, SETS AUSTERE COURSE", "body_text": " **********The new President of the Dominican Republic, Salvador Jorge Blanco, declared his country ''financially bankrupt'' today and proposed a restructuring of its economy. **********President Jorge Blanco's inaugural address was a chronicle of economic devastation similar to those being heard throughout the Caribbean region as prices for agricultural exports, particularly sugar, fall and the price of imported oil rises. **********''We are victims of factors outside of our control,'' he said, ''induced by European and United States protectionism and by the estimated deficit of this latter country, which keeps international interest rates exaggeratedly high.''

The limits on exports, combined with a sharply reduced world price for sugar, have placed sugar-producing countries in a major economic squeeze. **********''For every three dollars that came to the Central Bank last year, only two dollars will come this year,'' Mr. Jorge Blanco said. He added that while 1,000 pounds of sugar would buy 12 barrels of oil in 1974, the same amount would buy only four this year. **********Asserting that ''for severe illnesses severe remedies'' were required, Mr. Jorge Blanco called for a ban on imports of most foods and a year's freeze on wages and the prices of basic goods. **********He proposed new levies on property transfers and on urban property holdings, as well as increased import taxes on luxury items. ''The hour has come,'' he declared, ''that the Dominicans who have more pay more taxes to the nation.'' **********He also said that license fees for automobiles would be increased, both to raise money for the Government and to discourage the use of imported oil. **********Hours later, Mr. Jorge Blanco decreed by executive order a cut in the salaries of public employees earning more than $375 a month, including his own, which will drop to $3,000 a month from $5,000.

The internal deficit of the Government and its agencies, Mr. Jorge Blanco said, is also projected at $400 million. **********The drastic nature of his proposals repeatedly caused an audible stir among the Dominican legislators, foreign dignitaries and other guests packed into the stuffy chamber of the National Congressional Palace for his nearly two-hour address. **********Moments after donning the red, white and blue presidential sash, presented to him by the outgoing head of state, Jacobo Majluta Azar, the 56-year-old Mr. Jorge Blanco announced that he would not seek re-election and proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar presidents from serving more than one term in office. 'Moral Force' Acclaimed **********''The possible diminution of political power that we will suffer,'' he said, ''will be more than compensated for by an unlimited increase in a force that is superior to political power: the moral force.'' **********He said the Dominican Republic, having shown through the orderly transition of power from president to president that it could achieve a political democracy, must now work to create an ''economic democracy.'' **********Within this plan, he announced a number of other proposals, including the creation of ''free trade'' zones to encourage foreign investment in manufacturing here and a program that would allow investments by Dominicans outside the country, in dollars, at higherthan-usual interest rates, with the capital to be used to help resolve the country's critical housing shortage. **********His message, despite its grim tone, was applauded loudly by the audience, which included representatives of several Latin American countries, including President Luis Alberto Monge of Costa Rica, President Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela, and Sergio Ramirez Mercado, a member of Nicaragua's ruling junta. Bunker Heads U.S. Delegation **********The United States delegation was headed by Ellsworth Bunker, the veteran diplomat, who with Mr. Jorge Blanco helped negotiate the withdrawal of occupying United States troops from the Dominican Republic in 1965. **********The delegation also included Thomas O. Enders, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, who has been using his visit here to hold informal meetings with representatives of a number of countries, including Costa Rica and Argentina."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/business/hbo-co-atlanta-ga-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HBO & CO (ATLANTA, GA) reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "HBO & CO (ATLANTA, GA) reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/13/business/french-steel-output-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Steel Output Off", "print_headline": "French Steel Output Off", "body_text": " **********French output of crude steel in 1981 fell 8.2 percent from 1980, to 21.27 million tons, the steel producers' association said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/business/armstrong-rubber-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMSTRONG RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ARMSTRONG RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/10/business/frequency-control-products-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FREQUENCY CONTROL PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FREQUENCY CONTROL PRODUCTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/01/business/provigo-inc-reports-earnings-for-16-weeks-to-aug-14.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROVIGO INC reports earnings for 16 weeks to Aug 14", "print_headline": "PROVIGO INC reports earnings for 16 weeks to Aug 14", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/31/business/tri-chem-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRI-CHEM INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "TRI-CHEM INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/27/business/zurn-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZURN INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "ZURN INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/17/world/greece-to-insist-on-deadline-in-talks-on-bases.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1982-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 700, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GREECE TO INSIST ON DEADLINE IN TALKS ON BASES", "print_headline": "GREECE TO INSIST ON DEADLINE IN TALKS ON BASES", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has issued a warning to the United States that if no agreement is reached on the American military bases in Greece within a specified time, the bases will have to go. **********Mr. Papandreou said the time limit for the talks would be fixed by the negotiators. Discussions between the United States and Greece on the issue are to begin Oct. 27. **********Mr. Papandreou, in an interview Friday, insisted that he was not seeking a confrontation with the Reagan Administration. But he said: ''Either there is an agreement, a new agreement, or then we are through with the status of the bases. In other words, suppose we fail to agree in six months' time or nine months' time, whatever it is, if we fail to agree, it does not mean the bases stay as they are. It means they will have to leave.'' **********Mr. Papandreou has said before that the negotiations could not drag on indefinitely. He is known to be under strong pressure from the Communists and his own Socialists to live up to election pledges of a year ago calling for the removal of the four American bases and some smaller installations. Mr. Papandrou now says, ''It was not one of our highest priorities, but the time has come.'' **********''I'm not sending any ultimatums to Washington,'' he said, ''but I do think they have to understand that this present state of affairs cannot last.'' **********He said the Americans, too, wanted a rapid conclusion. One of the Prime Minister's close aides said earlier that Greece was thinking in terms of six months to a year to complete all aspects of the talks. **********Mr. Papandreou said that on the issue of how long a period a new agreement would cover, the Greek position ''will develop at the negotiating table.'' The Communist Party has been pressing for the bases to go by the end of the Socialist Government's mandate, in three years. Mr. Papandreou said recently he would need two terms, or eight years, to carry out his party's program. Other sources close to the Government, however, talk about keeping the bases until some unspecified time when there is an agreement on the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact and NATO. **********The bases are not related to Greek national defense or to NATO, Mr. Papandreou said, but ''are strictly American facilities.'' He said they were set up in ''a neocolonialist climate'' that emerged after the civil war, which ended in 1949. **********The Prime Minister refused to say what price his Government would ask for the bases in the way of military and economic aid or security guarantees. **********''We do think that since the presence of bases in Greece is of some strategic interest to the United States that the question of Greek national defense might be associated with the problem of the bases,'' he said. **********Mr. Papandreou made no threats to quit NATO and, in fact, mentioned that Greece had taken part in a recent NATO exercise with the understanding that this would not jeopardize its claims to the airspace over Greek islands in the Aegean near Turkey. **********An agreement with Turkey on a moratorium on mutual recriminations has improved the atmosphere, he said, although no easy resolution of the Aegean dispute is in sight. As for Cyprus, Greece's major objective is to have Turkish troops withdraw from the island, but that depends on Turkey, he said. Turning to another subject, the Prime Minister xpressed some optimism that Socialist candidates would do well in Sunday's local elections, which are widely seen as the first significant public opinion test for the Papandreou Government.  He said, however, that the Communist Party was waging ''a very aggressive'' campaign, confronting the Socialists everywhere for the first time since Greece's return to democracy in 1974, and was even prepared to vote for rightists to keep the Socialists from winning. **********If the Communists make significant gains, Mr. Papandreou said, it will be partly attributable to the Government's foreign policy but more to its failure to achieve its economic objectives."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/business/pennwalt-stock.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pennwalt Stock", "print_headline": "Pennwalt Stock", "body_text": " **********The Pennwalt Corporation, a manufacturer of chemicals, health products and precision equipment based in Philadelphia, reported that a Denver investor had purchased 878,000 shares of Pennwalt common stock and 46,000 shares of convertible preferred stock. **********Pennwalt said the stock purchase ''is unsettling to our business and detrimental to the best interests of our other shareholders.''

They agreed that no early end to the recession is in sight and that six million more people are likely to become jobless this year, raising the total number of unemployed in their counries to more than 30 million. **********The ministers, attending the annual meeting of the Organizaton for Economic Cooperation and Development, which monitors the economic performance of its member nations, promised to keep trying to reduce inflation, preserve free trade and modernize industry. **********But their final communique shows they remain seriously divided over how to tackle the crises gripping their countries' economies. ''The message is not a very pleasant one,'' said Emile van Lennep, secretary general of the organization, in summing up the ministers' work at a final news conference. **********Views of Smaller Nations **********The O.E.C.D. meeting was scheduled this week to let smaller industrial nations express their views on the world economy before next month's meeting of government heads from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan at Versailles, France. **********In the view of many officials at the O.E.C.D. meeting, its somber conclusion and the divisions between many of its participants will cast a shadow over prospects for the Versailles meeting. **********As expected, the O.E.C.D. ministers again endorsed the joint recovery strategy to which they have been committed since the second surge of oil price rises in 1978. This holds that a lasting reduction in Western unemployment ''cannot be achieved on a sustainable basis'' unless inflation is beaten and the industrial nations develop internationally competitive industries capable of earning their way in the world. Action by Big 3 Suggested **********The major new recommendation to emerge here was a plea, expressed in imprecise language, for the United States to encourage faster growth by reducing its budget deficit and lowering interest rates. **********In the same recommendation, the ministers implied that Germany and Japan, which already have low inflation rates and booming exports, should maintain their big budget deficits to bolster world trade, which fell 1 percent last year. None of the countries were named in the communique, but officials confirmed that the wording pertained to the United States, Germany and Japan, the three strongest economies in the O.E.C.D. At the closing news conference, Mr. van Lennep said everybody wanted a reduction in the United States budget deficit. **********The American Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, said Monday that his Administration also wanted to cut its deficit and to lower interest rates, now unusually high in comparison with the rate of inflation. **********But he warned that lower interest rates in the United States might not bring down rates in other countries unless they also trimmed their government spending. Both the German and Japanese ministers agreed that a lasting economic recovery requires a government to cut its deficit, making room for an upturn in borrowing by private industry to finance new investments. **********France's Foreign Minister, Claude Cheysson, defended his Socialist Government's decision to triple the French budget deficit in two years despite 14 percent inflation, saying it had given France ''somewhat faster growth and a better employment performance than other European countries.'' **********Similar differences in national outlook also undercut the ministers' reaffirmation in the communique of their ''commitment to combat all forms of protectionism'' and maintain ''an open trading system.'' **********Indeed, the meeting suffered a last-minute reverse today when France rejected a laboriously prepared compromise limiting the extent to which members might subsidize their exports with cheap credit.  Officials agreed that the French move threatened to unleash exactly the kind of trade war the ministers are pledged to avoid, unless a new compromise is reached before the present restraint agreement expires later this month. **********Bill Brock, special trade representative for the United States, called for a far-reaching commitment to extend free trade into wholly new areas of economic activity. He warned that the Western world was in danger of drifting into ''a new era of protectionism,'' **********In particular, he said, governments should quit subsidizing hightechnology industries, should accept free competition in the services sector and should treat foreign investors just like domestic ones. **********Arguing that future job creation will be concentrated in these fields, Mr. Brock said, ''We must make sure that these areas do not become subject to new types of protectionism, which would deny all nations the benefit of expanded trade.'' **********But his ambitious proposals, which worry many European governments, found no echo in the final communique. And Mr. Cheysson of France, which gives huge subsidies to high-technology companies, argued that the economically ''weaker'' countries had a right to help build up modern industries while it was the duty of economically ''stronger'' countries to practice free trade. **********The Foreign Minister of Japan, Yoshiz Sakurauchi, under heavy pressure to open up his country's markets to foreign imports, again promised concessions. But he did not say what his Government would offer or when it would do it. **********Finally, the O.E.C.D. ministers demonstrated the fragility of their consensus on policy, as well as their reluctance to make new pledges at a time of rising unemployment, by refusing to publish new policy recommendations made by the organization's secretariat. **********The secretariat paper, according to sources familiar with it, set out a wide range of specific economic reforms that individual countries should make as their contribution to a lasting recovery, in addition to the general O.E.C.D. commitment to curb inflation and maintain free trade. The most important of these recommendations is the one for the United States to cut its budget deficit and for Germany and Japan to maintain theirs. This found its way in convoluted form into the final communique but without any country being mentioned by name. **********In addition, the secretariat argued that countries such as Belgium, France and Britain must restore corporate profitability - the first two by cutting taxes and social charges and Britain by compensating for the squeeze on profits resulting from an overvalued pound. **********Washington, Bonn and Tokyo all dislike the O.E.C.D.'s recommendations on budget deficits, officials say, because they recall the secretariat's earlier ''locomotive'' recovery strategy, now considered discredited. This attempted to apply the Keynesian economic theory of demand management to the world scene by calling on low-inflation countries to reflate, thus giving a lift to the world economy. **********But according to the monetarist theories embraced by the present American, German and Japanese administrations, higher government spending gives only a temporary lift to output, which will eventually disappear in higher inflation. Lasting recovery, according to these theories, can be secured only by cutting government spending, lowering inflationary expectations and encouraging private industry to invest. **********Other European governments, officials say, are simply reluctant to make new economic commitments while their political freedom of maneuver is tightly restricted by the continuing recession and rising unemployment. **********---- High Jobless Levels **********WASHINGTON, May 11 (AP) -Unemployment, which reached a post-World War II high of 9.4 percent of the American work force last month, has also risen to record and near-record levels in Canada, France, West Germany, Britain and Japan, according to the Labor Department. **********British unemployment, the highest among the Western industrial countries, rose from 11.3 percent in 1981 to 13 percent in the first three months of this year. For West Germany, the Labor Department calculated unemployment at 5.5 percent in the first quarter, up from 4.3 percent for 1981.

The suspension was for one crop year, which for sugar cane, one of El Salvador's main crops, is four calendar years. **********Suspension 'a Political Maneuver' **********In his homily today, the Acting Archbishop of San Salvador, Arturo Rivera Damas, indicated that the legislators had wanted to repeal the land to the tiller law. He called the suspension a ''political maneuver'' designed ''to leave open the possibility of North American aid, which is conditioned on the reforms not being halted.'' **********In Washington on Thursday, the Foreign Relations Committee was told by Senator Charles H. Percy, its chairman, that ''not one cent of funds shall go to the Government of El Salvador'' if it suspended the land redistribution program. The Reagan Administration has proposed $128 million in economic aid for El Salvador through its plan to assist countries in the Caribbean region as well as $60 million in military aid. **********Five right-wing parties won 36 of the 60 Assembly seats in elections March 28, while the centrist Christian Democratic Party won the rest. The Assembly later elected Alvaro Alfredo Magana, a centrist with no formal party affiliation, to be provisional President of the country. He succeeded Jose Napoleon Duarte of the Christian Democrats, who had headed a military-civilian junta for the last two years. **********El Salvador's land redistribution program was begun two years ago in an effort to persuade peasants not to support the leftist-led revolution. Before the enactment of the program, fewer than 2 percent of the population controlled more than half of this tiny nation's fertile farm land. Program Acclaimed by Reagan **********The program was hailed as ''unprecedented'' by President Reagan recently and as ''the most revolutionary land reform in Latin American history'' by the American Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton. **********Under the first phase of the program all farms larger than 1,235 acres were expropriated, with compensation, and converted to peasant cooperatives. The second phase, which was announced but never carried out, provided for similar expropriatiion and conversion of farms larger than 247 acres. And the third phase, which is known as the land to the tiller law, decreed that peasants could buy up to 17 acres of the land they had been working as tenant farmers or sharecroppers. **********The second and third phases have been affected by the Assembly's actions.  Eighty-five percent of the peasant families who were to benefit from the agrarian program as originally announced live or work on the phase 2 and phase 3 properties. These farms contain 70 percent of the land included in the original redistribution plan. **********As explained by an agrarian analyst and a lawyer, the Assembly acted against the second phase when it repealed a law enacted by the previous Government that permitted expropriations. Since phase 2 had not been carried out, it is no longer constitutionally possible to expropriate those lands for conversion to peasant cooperatives. **********In terms of a more equitable distribution of the country's wealth and income, the second phase was the most important element of the agrarian program. In El Salvador's agricultural-based economy, wealth has long been measured primarily by the amount of land one owns. Coffee, cotton and sugar bring in about 75 percent of the country's export earnings and phase 2 farms accounted for about threefourths of these crops. Phase Lacked U.S. Support **********The demise of the second phase was expected, in large part because it did not have the support of the Reagan Administration. Most of the properties that would have been expropriated under the program are owned by people that ''constitute a considerable element of the country's political power structure,'' according to a study prepared for the United States Agency for International Development by Checchi & Company, a Washington consulting concern. **********But the suspension of the land to the tiller program was more of a shock. This program would have benefited more peasants than phases 1 and 2 combined. **********Most of these peasants are subsistence farmers, struggling to grow corn, beans and vegetables, often on tiny, sometimes seemingly vertical hillside plots. More than half of the country's corn, beans and sorghum, a key crop in this country, which grows no wheat, is cultivated by these peasants on parcels whose average size is about three acres. **********The prototype for the land to the tiller law was carried out by the United States in Vietnam. The principle architect there and in El Salvador was Roy L. Prosterman, a law professor at the University of Washington. 'Left Fears Land Reform' **********''The left fears land reform,'' Mr. Prosterman told a hostile audience of Salvadoran businessmen after the law was enacted. ''It deprives them of their most valuable weapon in implementing revolution because they can no longer appeal to the landless.'' **********Although the land to the tiller law has technically been suspended for only one crop year, there is considerable doubt that it will ever be reactivated. **********The Checchi report noted that while the army supported the first phase of the agrarian program, ''there appears to be no similar military commitment'' to the land to the tiller law. **********''It is not very clear until when the suspension is going to last since it could be like the state of siege that keeps being prolonged by the will of the legislators,'' Bishop Rivera Damas said today. The state of siege, first enacted in March 1980 for 30 days, has been continually re-enacted for 30-day periods and is still in effect. 'Victory for Landowners' **********Responding to protests by peasant organizations, the Assembly added a proviso to the suspension legislation that protects the rights of tenant farmers who had already received provisional titles, had applied for them or were entitled to apply for them under the original law. **********Roberto Viera, a Christian Democratic Party legislator, called the protections ''fine on paper.'' But he said that ''in practice'' the legislation was a ''victory for landowners.'' Landowners, bolstered by the legislation, will now begin to evict tenant farmers, he said. **********According to the Popular Democratic Union, a federation of labor and peasant organizations that is aligned with the Christian Democrats, 9,600 peasant families have been evicted from land they were renting since the Assembly began to chip away at the land redistribution program. Some 60,000 families have been threatened with eviction, the group said. **********The threat of eviction could discourage more renters from filing claims or perfecting their titles.  Since the land to the tiller law was enacted early in 1980, no peasant has received a clear title. Out of the potential 150,000 beneficiaries, provisional titles have been issued to 29,000 peasants and 7,000 more have filed claims."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/23/business/advertising-compton-gets-paine-webber.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Compton Gets Paine Webber", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Compton Gets Paine Webber", "body_text": " **********Compton Advertising, which will soon be a subsidairy of Saatchi & Saatchi of London, is suddenly becoming a more valuable property as it adds Paine Webber Inc. to its client list.

Israeli forces had begun observing a new cease-fire in Lebanon and that Israel's agreement to do so had been communicated to Philip C. Habib, President Reagan's special envoy, currently in Beirut. **********The military spokesman said that the Beirut-Damascus highway was in Israeli hands from the Beirut suburb of Baabda to the town of Bhamdun, an east-west stretch of about 10 miles. **********This afternoon the Israeli forces gave the Syrian soldiers encircled in Beirut and in the town of Aleih along the highway an opportunity to leave peacefully in the direction of Syria, the spokesman reported. He said that many had done so. Says Israel Is Close to Goals **********The spokesman said that Syria's 62d Brigade, which had been stationed north of the highway, had also begun a retreat toward the Syrian border. **********Interviewed on television tonight, Defense Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel had as a result of the combat of the last four days drawn very close to realization of the two main goals of the invasion of Lebanon - ''the total elimination of the Palestine Liberation Organization'' as a factor in Lebanon and the removal of Syrian forces, which he characterized as the main support of the Palestinian guerrillas. **********The minister said that the Israeli ring around Beirut was impenetrable to hostile forces. Asked whether Israel intended to enter west Beirut, the largely Moslem and Palestinian-held sector of the city, Mr. Sharon said that many possibilities were under consideration and he declined to go into details. **********The official position of the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin is that its army will not enter Beirut. However, a Cabinet session on Thursday was reported to have decided to review this position, possibly after an expected visit here by Mr. Habib. **********Mr. Sharon said that Israel had proposed letting all members of the Palestine Liberation Organization leave for another Arab country in convoys to be inspected by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Israel maintains that the departure from Lebanon of at least the ''core'' of the Palestinian leadership is one of its minimum conditions for withdrawal from that country. **********The military spokesman announced that the brunt of the fighting today centered on the Aleih-Bhamdun segment of the highway.  For the first time, Israel reported that Lebanese Christian troops had joined the battle, moving eastward out of their stronghold in east Beirut. They were said to have captured the town of Jamur. **********Israeli officials have been showing signs of impatience with the inactivity of the Christians, bitter enemies of the Palestinians in the Lebanese civil war, since the Israeli invasion. Pullout Is Not Imminent **********Mr. Sharon sounded triumphant tonight, in the latest of a series of broadcast interviews on the course of the war. He said that whoever controlled the Aleih-Bhamdun stretch of highway controlled, in effect, Lebanon, and the Israeli Army now controlled it. He said he expected a letup in the fighting soon but predicted that Israeli troops would remain in Lebanon ''much longer than 10 weeks.'' **********The Defense Minister asserted that the latest flare-up in fighting had been brought on by Syrian violations of the cease-fire. He said that Israel replied to such violations not necessarily in the same sector where they occurred, suggesting that Israeli forces may have started the battle that led to their capture of the strategic highway after an outbreak of firing elsewhere in Lebanon. **********The military spokesman announced today that 22 more Israeli soldiers had been killed in battle Thursday. The total of dead of the invasion now exceeds 260. **********In a lecture to a private club today, the Israeli Tourism Minister, Avraham Sharir, declared that Israel's successes against surface-toair missiles supplied by the Soviet Union to Syria had been accomplished through technology invented here.

The Fed is faced now with money supply data that will probably remain above its targets. But the bank does not want to wrench the money supply downward, because, many say, an economy with a 10.1 percent unemployment rate would suffer too much pain from higher interest rates. **********By reducing the discount rate again last week, the Fed signaled that it has decided to be tolerant of both the past and prospective increases in money supply growth. Not only would that policy encourage the lower interest rates that economists say are needed for a sustainable recovery, but it might also defuse political criticism of the Fed in advance of the November elections. **********The Fed will no doubt defend its actions by saying that money supply data are being distorted by changes in the banking system.  Specifically, it can point to the maturing of $27 billion of one-year tax-exempt certificates in the first week of October, which would result in a record large increase in the basic money supply to be reported this Friday. The 'Sixth Effect' **********Financiers in 17th-century London had their own tricks. They used a weather vane to indicate pending increases in the creation of money. When the vane showed an east wind, they knew that ships would be coming up the Thames to the city, where the exchange of goods would lead to an increase in the creation of money. **********A modern rule of thumb for predicting money supply growth relies on a pattern of large increases in the first week of each month - particularly the first month of a calendar quarter, when Social Security checks go out to millions of recipients. The ''sixth effect'' is a variation on this theme, which explains what to expect in months like the current one, when the sixth day falls on a Wednesday. In such months, the Treasury distributes Social Security checks on Friday, the first day of the month rather than on the third day, which falls on Sunday. As a result, the checks' proceeds may be on deposit in checking accounts - and thus counted in the money supply - for an extra two days. To cope with this, the Fed formed a committee of statisticians to prepare new seasonal adjustments. The refined adjustments would produce a different level of money supply than the Fed's traditional monthly seasonal adjustment process. But so far, the ''sixth effect'' remains a monthly footnote. The technicians have not figured out how to put the refinement into the seasonally adjusted figures that the Fed reports weekly. No Signs of Recovery **********Even with the fourth quarter underway, forecasts for it are thoroughly confusing. Some economists foresee another small rise in real gross national product; others say that a drop in output is possible. This adds to the confusion generated by the piddling growth reported for real G.N.P. in the second and third quarters. At first glance, those figures from the Commerce Department seemed to indicate an end to the recession. But many economists insist that economy is stagnant, with no convincing signs that a sustainable recovery is underway. **********The increase in the unemployment rate is likely to be another depressant, because unemployment fears seems to discourage consumer spending on big-ticket items even among households that could afford them. **********Sales of cars and housing are languishing at or near their lows and manufacturing companies are not increasing their output. In fact, industrial production is already 10 percent lower that at the start of the recession. Tax-Exempt Watershed **********The tax-exempt bond market, enjoying a record year, is nearing a watershed. In the past, more than 90 percent of the about $400 billion of outstanding securities issued by state and local governments have been sold in bearer form, where possession means ownership and there is a minimum of record keeping. But the new tax bill requires that all new bond issues after Jan.1 be sold in registered form. The Internal Revenue Service hopes that the registration records will help it spot wealthy individuals who are not reporting their income. **********The change is expected to be a shock to the tax-exempt market, where wealthy, privacy-conscious individuals have accounted for an estimated three-fourths of all purchases. Dealers expect that a twotier market will develop, with outstanding bearer bonds selling at a higher price and lower yield than similar registered bonds.

Haig Jr. has said that ''extremely sensitive discussions'' are under way with Peking over the Taiwan issue and that he is ''not in a position to predict the outcome.'' **********American officials previously said that talks were going on over the United Excerpts from interview, page 12. States' decision to continue arms sales to Ta iwan, something Peking regards as infringing on its sovereignty. But Mr. Haig's remarks, in an interview in his office Friday, seemed to indicate concern for future relations not voiced previously. **********''It would be counterproductive to go into details, because things are at a delicate stage, but speaking candidly, some diffi cult issuesare involved, '' he said. ''We are making a major effort to bridge these differe nces. I will be just as frank when I tell you I am not in a position to predict the outcome.'' **********Peking Arms Sales Shelved **********He also said plans to discuss the sale of American arms to Peking had been shelved and were ''hostage'' to resolution of the Taiwan talks. **********Asked whether the problem seemed serious, Mr. Haig nodded affirmatively and said, ''It has been serious.'' Mr. Haig is scheduled to leave on Sunday for Madrid, where he will represent the United States at a meeting of the conference on East-West security and cooperation in Europe. **********At the conference, he and other Western foreign ministers intend to accuse Poland and the Soviet Union of violating the human rights provisions of the Helsinki Final Act by imposing the military crackdown in Poland. Reagan Threatened Further Steps **********President Reagan has said that if there was no improvement in the situation, he might take further steps against Poland and the Soviet Union beyond the economic and political curbs announced earlier. **********But in recent weeks, American farmers have expressed opposition to any curbs on the sale of agricultural products. They have been supported in their campaign by the Secretary of Agriculture, John R.  Block. **********Mr. Haig, when asked about further economic sanctions, refused to rule anything out, but he hinted that he personally opposed an embargo on grain sales because the Soviet Union would be able to buy enough elsewhere. **********''I think the basic question in the area of economic sanctions has always got to be: Will it be effective?'' he said. ''Nothing could be more foolhardy than to unilaterally punish all or segments of American industry or agriculture with meaningless sanctions.'' **********The main question, he said, is whether such actions would be ''meaningful, lacking coordinated and comparable measures by other grain-producing nations.'' **********''The answer to that is unfortunately rather clear; that is, it would be circumvented,'' Mr. Haig said.  On another contentious issue - the Administration decision to pay domestic banks $71.3 million that Poland had not repaid on schedule rather than announce that Poland had defaulted - Mr. Haig affirmed his support for the move, despite criticism of it by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. **********Mr. Weinberger is reported to feel that he was not adequately consulted. He has also made the point that the decision was an interim move and would be reviewed again when other debts come due.  Mr. Haig concurred on that point. **********Mr. Haig said that it was an Administration-wide decision and that the Defense Department agreed with it. Cash Problem for Soviet Seen **********''The basic issue is, do you relieve the Poles and the Soviet Union from the obligation of meeting their international obligations or do you continue to press for the repayments, given the growing cash dilemma in the Soviet Union,'' he said. **********He said he did not want to become involved in a dispute whether Pentagon officials had known about the decision, but he acknowledged that it would be reviewed again. **********''I don't mean to suggest by that that there is any inclination to depart at this time from a decision that was made, because we feel unanimously that it was the right decision,'' he said. **********Mr. Haig's attention was called to a number of articles in the press suggesting that, as a result of the decision to move William P. Clark from the post of Deputy Secretary of State to that of national security adviser to the President, Mr. Haig would find himself increasingly isolated. The articles suggested that Mr. Clark, an old friend of President Reagan, would have increasing influence and would advocate positions different from those held by Mr. Haig. Haig Avows Close Ties to Clark **********When asked about such reports, Mr. Haig laughed and said, ''It is inconceivable that I will be isolated.'' ''I may have some surprises in store, but I sense precisely the opposite there,'' he said.  ''I have been very , very close to Bill Clark, and I remain very close to him. We are in constant contact allday long.'' **********He said it was ''very normal and natural'' for an Administration at the end of its first year to make changes in the way it handled foreign policy management and ''we are not finished yet.'' The China q uestion has been one of the most difficult ones for the Reagan Admini stration and Mr. Haig made no effort to disguise it.  Mr. Reagan, as a candidate for the Presidency, had made a number ofstatements ad vocating closer ties with Taiwan. This provoked expressions o f concern from Peking even before Mr. Reagan took office. **********The Communists in Peking contend that the United States, in recognizing them as the Government of China in 1979 and in ending official ties with the Nationalists on Taiwan, had given up the right to sell arms to Taiwan. No Loud Protest by Peking **********The Carter Administration, however, promised to maintain Taiwan's ability to defend itself, and the Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress in 1979 also stated that the United States would ''make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantities as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.'' **********Peking did not publicly protest very strongly about the Taiwan Relations Act at the time and, in fact, was rather quiet about continued American arms sales to Taiwan during the last two years of the Carter Administration. **********Mr. Haig, who was in China last June, said the Administration valued its relations with China and was ''determined to do all we can'' to advance them. **********''It goes without saying that since the beginning of this Administration, we have also had to face continuing disagreement with Peking over our arms sales to Taiwan,'' he said. **********For most of the year there was debate over whether Taiwan would receive an advanced fighter. The decision announced last month was that Taiwan would not get a new fighter, but would be permitted to continue to co-produce the F-5E fighter. Peking Stresses Principle of Sales **********This was regarded by some officials as a concession to Peking, but the Chinese contend that it does not matter what kind of plane is being sold to Taiwan, that it is the principle that counts. **********Peking says it will never be able to persuade Taiwan to unify peacefully with the mainland so long as the United States provides arms to Taiwan. It wants the United States to announce an elimination of arms sales over a set period - say, five years. **********Mr. Haig said the United States had made its position clear in both the Carter and the Reagan administrations on selling arms to Taiwan, but ''recognizes this is an area to be approached with prudence and discretion.'' **********He said that ever since Foreign Minister Huang Hua was here in October, there had been ''extremely sensitive discussions'' that were continued when John H. Holdridge, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, went to Peking last month to disclose the decision on Taiwan arms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/22/business/triad-systems-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRIAD SYSTEMS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "TRIAD SYSTEMS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/01/world/two-soviet-naval-ships-start-repairs-in-a-greek-shipyard.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Soviet Naval Ships Start Repairs in a Greek Shipyard", "print_headline": "Two Soviet Naval Ships Start Repairs in a Greek Shipyard", "body_text": " **********Repairs have started on two Soviet naval supply vessels at a shipyard here under an agreement signed this year. **********The shipyard said Soviet Union would pay $2.5 million for the repair and servicing of the two vessels.

The board also retains a near-monopoly on the retail sale of liquor in the township as the owner and operator of all but one of its retail outlets. **********The Government offers discounts to shebeen owners who buy in bulk - in hopes of taking their business away from retail stores in white areas. However, the liquor squad pounces on them and confiscates their stock - beer mainly, augmented by white wine and brandy. **********To hold down losses, the shebeen owners seldom keep more than one night's supply on the premises, dispersing the bulk of their stock in safe houses around the township. Since none of the beer or liquor companies make deliveries to unlicensed premises, all this booze has to be shuttled around the township in a clandestine fashion. The runners who move it operate a complex system that bears comparison to the original proposal for shuttling the MX missile on underground tracks. Skepticism About Legalization **********In the Government and among the shebeen owners not everyone is enthusiastic about the effort to bring all this enterprise into the open by upgrading some of the shebeens and turning them into legal neighborhood pubs. For white bureaucrats in the Government outlets, which are supposed to be turned over to private enterprise, it means disruption and a possible loss of status and position. **********The plan for giving liquor licenses to blacks outside their socalled ''homelands'' also runs counter to the original apartheid ideology. An urban black with a liquor license is, by definition, what the system was supposed to prevent: a permanent resident deemed by the Government to be responsible. Someone might even ask, ''Why can't he vote?'' Self-interest and ideology often run together in South Africa, and the liquor board is now processing black applications for licenses at a rate that seems glacial. **********The shebeen owners are also split on legalization. ''Did Al Capone want prohibition lifted?'' a white in the liquor business asked.  ''I'm not interested,'' said Mrs. Mgcebetsha, a heavyset woman with a skeptical gaze who stations herself in her kitchen next to a freezer loaded with lager beer, sizing up newcomers and turning away those who fall short of her social and sartorial standards. No Taxes, No Health Rules **********Someone suggested that her business might expand if it went legal.  ''I've got more business than I can handle now,'' she replied.  She also doesn't have to keep books, pay taxes, meet various Health Department requirements, such as separate toilets for men and women, or close down before she feels like it, which is often dawn. **********Lucky Michaels, the operator of the Pelican Club, leads a group of shebeen owners who see a liquor license as a passport into the world of capital accumulation, where blacks have traditionally been turned away. **********As chairman of a budding interest group called the Soweto Tavern Association, Mr. Michaels is planning for a day when its members will control wholesale liquor distribution in all the major black townships and use their profits to buy into South African Breweries, the major corporate purveyor. **********''Rowena is going to need a license,'' he confidently predicted.  Her skepticism would be overcome, he contended, if the Government would grant temporary licenses to shebeen owners, giving them protection from police raids during a transition period in which they undertook to upgrade their premises. ''The shebeeners don't understand they are paying more taxes than real taxes by putting up with raids,'' he said. Corruption Called 'Multiracial' **********Mr. Michaels, who still gets raided even though his association is now in formal negotiations with the Government, was referring to fines and bribes. Asked who the takers are, he laughed and replied: ''The corruption scene hasn't got a color line. It's multiracial.'' **********Others are not so sure that legal bars will be able to take customers away from shebeens. A good shebeen is known for its clientele and its music; the stereo has to be the best, as well as the loudest, and the records have to be the latest. Usually they are imports featuring black American singers and groups. **********Recently, at a popular shebeen called Irene's, business didn't perk up until about midnight. This gave the young woman who was s erving drinks time t o finish a fat romantic novel by Helen Van Slyke about corporate pol itics in New York. It was called ''The Rich and the Righteous,'' and the first sentence was, at least, timely. ''In January,'' it went, ''New York takes on the sullen aspect of a brooding empr ess.'' **********The young woman kissed the book before putting it down, and then, back in Soweto, served up Martell's V.O. brandy in a pint bottle bearing the label of a local gin. Irene Tshabalala, the owner, put on a record of Frankie Beverly and a group called the Maze. ''Live in New Orleans,'' it was called. And, at 12:30, the dancing began, with a young man in jeans that said Jordache and a jersey that said Pierre Cardin leading off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/01/world/around-the-world-mozambique-in-drive-against-guerrillas.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mozambique in Drive Against Guerrillas", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Mozambique in Drive Against Guerrillas", "body_text": " **********Thousands of Mozambique Government troops have begun a major offensive against rebels, said to be South African-supported, in an effort to clear the main transport links to Zimbabwe, a rebel spokesman here said today. **********Fighting is raging on either side of the route between the Mozambique port of Beira and Mutare, formerly Umtali, 150 miles to the west in Zimbabwe, a spokesman for the Mozambique National Resistance said. **********The guerrillas regularly attack communication links in Mozambique, which are vital to the efforts of black southern African countries, especially Zimbabwe, to lessen their economic dependence on South Africa. **********According to the Mozambique Government, the guerrillas are made up mainly of elite black units of the old Portuguese army."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/03/business/zinc-prices-cut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zinc Prices Cut", "print_headline": "Zinc Prices Cut", "body_text": " **********Noranda Mines Ltd. of Canada reduced its export price for zinc to $900 (United States) a metric ton, from $950, the company announced yesterday.

Mr. Shamir met with President Reagan Monday at the White House and was told by Mr. Reagan that it was crucial that the ''constantly escalating violence'' end. Today Mr. Shamir repeatedly cited what he called the common goals of the United States, Israel and Lebanon in ousting the Palestine Liberation Organization from its strongholds as a prerequisite to peace in the Middle East. 'We Are Impatient' **********But he acknowledged ''there could be some differences about the urgency to reach these goals and about the tactics, how to reach them.'' **********''We are impatient,'' he said. ''We cannot wait for a long time.'' Mr. Shamir said he would not go into details about the differences but offered ''an example of the past'' that appeared to indicate some dissatisfaction with Philip C. Habib, the special American mediator in the Middle East. **********''A year ago - it was more than a year ago,'' he said, ''Philip Habib was sent by the President to Syria, to Lebanon, to Israel to find a solution for the removal of the Syrian missiles from Lebanon. **********''The goal of this mission was the removal of the missiles and the restoration of the status quo ante. There was full agreement about the formulation of this mision. But the results? The missiles all the time remained there until this last operation when they were removed of course no thanks to the efforts of Philip Habib.'' **********He added, ''There could be such a situation also now.'' Goal Is Removal of P.L.O. **********He did not elaborate and also remained silent on the immediate goals of the latest Israeli drive into west Beirut.  In his half-hour talk to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, 36 officials and their aides representing most of the nation's Jewish religious and secular groups, Mr. Shamir argued repeatedly that the P.L.O. had to be ''destroyed'' in order, he said, ''to have peace, security and stability in our area.'' **********The Foreign Minister called the removal of the P.L.O. ''a precondition for any improvement of the situation in our area and for any progress in the direction of peace between us and our neighbors.'' **********Mr. Shamir went on: ''The removal of the the P.L.O. from Beirut and Lebanon will announce a new era in the Middle East. They will leave Beirut and Lebanon and after the terrorist infrastructure will not be any more, not exist any more, after this center of world terrorism will cease to exist, after they will be able any more to send instructions through parts of the Middle East and many countries in the world about terrorist activities - at this moment everything will change in our area and we are sure new political horizons will be opened to all of us after many years to reach peace and stability.'' **********He added, ''We cannot exaggerate about the importance of this aim.'' 'A Solution Will Be Found' **********Mr. Shamir, a former Stern Gang fighter in the 1940's and Israeli hawk who declined to support the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt, returned repeatedly to the promise of peace once the P.L.O.  was ousted from Lebanon. **********''The moment we will finish,'' he said, ''a solution will be found for this problem. The peace process will be reopened and we will resume negotiations about autonomy'' - a reference to expanded selfgovernment for Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. **********A prime Israeli goal, he said, remains the creation of a 40- to 45-kilometer ''zone of security'' in Lebanon north of the Israeli border. Only a stable Lebanese Government free of P.L.O. pressure could agree to such an arrangement, Mr. Shamir said. **********However, he asserted, the P.L.O. is refusing to leave.  ''According to our information,'' he said, ''we know that they have not yet decided to leave Beirut and Lebanon. They try to gain time by procrastinating, by proposals without any prospect to be accepted.'' **********Mr. Shamir continued: ''If we want them to leave, and it is in our biggest interest to make them leave, we have to convince them that they have to leave as quickly as possible. The only choice they have before them is the choice of the way of leaving Lebanon, either to leave by negotiations or by other ways, other means.'' **********The Israelis must demonstrate to the P.L.O., the Foreign Minister said, that if diplomacy does not dislodge them ''there are other means to convincethem.'' **********Nevertheless he maintained that ''we are ready to accept a new cease-fire from this moment if the other side will keep it.'' He also said the army had taken extraordinary measures to limit civilian casualties by avoiding questionable targets. **********The removal of the P.L.O. from Lebanon would constitute a ''revolution,'' Mr. Shamir said. ''Lebanon which was until now dominated by the P.L.O. and by Syria and behind them Soviet Russia will become an independent country,'' he said, ''a part of the free world. It will have an impact on all other Arab countries.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/28/business/steel-output-drops-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steel Output Drops Again", "print_headline": "Steel Output Drops Again", "body_text": " **********United States steel mills operated last week at their lowest rate in 50 years, and less steel was produced than when the weekly recordkeeping began in 1962, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported yesterday. **********Steel production dropped to 880,000 tons in the week ended last Saturday, a decline of 16.7 percent from the previous week's 1.757 million tons. **********Production dropped to 29.8 percent of capacity, from 35.8 percent the previous week.

Those low growth rates, it is asserted, lead to high interest rates that have pushed the economy into a recession. The economic hardship could be alleviated, the critics say, by faster money supply growth that would not necessarily be inflationary. **********On another level, the Fed is criticized by the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of monetarist economists, who said that the Fed has failed to make technical changes that ''would improve its monetary control and remove current high risk premiums in interest rates.'' **********The risk premium for bonds, referred to by the Shadow Open Market Committee's policy statement, is ''about 2 percentage points and is due to the uncertainty surrounding monetary control,'' said Allan H.  Meltzer, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University. The risk premium is based on the idea that investors are so battered by sharp fluctuations in the prices of their notes and bonds that they now require compensation in the form of higher yields. Money Supply Controversy **********The technical aspects of controlling money supply are controversial in the credit markets, where analysts are uncertain how aggressively the Federal Reserve will try to keep weekly and monthly growth within its annual target. At a time when M-1 is above target, the analysts' uncertainty is heightened by predictions that the closely watched money supply measure will increase by several billion dollars in the week ending April 7. **********The nuances of the Fed's efforts to control money and credit are important because the more tolerant the central bank is of rapid money supply growth, the less upward pressure there will be on interest rates. Currently, the 13.38 percent yield on 30-year Treasury bonds is down from the peak of 15.2 percent last autumn but still higher than the 12.04 percent on President Reagan's inauguration day. **********Paul A. Volcker told Congress last month that money supply growth somewhat above target would be acceptable for a while, but he did not say exactly how much money supply growth is acceptable, and for how long. Predictions About Fed Moves **********Frank Mastrapasqua, economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said little change in Fed policy is likely if there is an early April bulge in money supply. He noted that in past years, except for 1981, the early April bulge in money supply has been subsequently revised downward, which might encourage the Fed to ignore the increase and wait to see if it is reversed in subsequent weeks. ''The possibility does exist that the April bulge will be less than expected,'' Mr. Mastrapasqua said. **********Donald Maude, a money market economist at Merrill Lynch, came to the opposite conclusion in the March 19 Credit Market Bulletin where he wrote that the likelihood of faster money supply growth as tax refunds are distributed will encourage the Fed to keep money supply growth from getting too far out of hand. **********''Should the Fed perceive that the recession is fading, it would be almost impossible for the Fed to ignore a renewed surge without fear that its long fight for credibility would be lost quite readily.'' Against Tighter Control **********Economists at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company said in their March 22 newsletter that stricter control over money supply by the Fed is not necessary because ''no one has yet been able to demonstrate that the reported volatility in money has any impact on either the pace of economic activity or inflation.'' **********''If economic and other developments make it necessary for the Fed to ease monetary policy in the near term, the Fed may be in for considerable criticism,'' they said, and accusations by monetarists that it had ''caved in.'' **********The Lanston economists concluded, ''It is not the Fed that has a credibility problem; rather it is the monetarists who lack credibility.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/world/ghotbzadeh-admits-role-in-plot.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GHOTBZADEH ADMITS ROLE IN PLOT", "print_headline": "GHOTBZADEH ADMITS ROLE IN PLOT", "body_text": " **********Iran's former Foreign Minister, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, confessed on Iranian television to receiving money in connection with a reported assassination attempt against Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Teheran radio said today. **********''I am shamed before the nation.

Robach, Democrat of Rochester, and Senator Ronald Stafford, Republican of Peru, pointed to ''an increasing number of unscrupulous promoters'' who are willfully engaging in fraudulent securities practices. **********''Most of such fraudulent practices involve a taking of property from members of the public under a common scheme or plan,'' the legislators added. **********Mr. Carey also approved a bill to eliminate the requirement that retailers prepay the local share of sales taxes collected on March sales. March Prepayments **********Under the current law, all retailers with quarterly taxable sales of $300,000 or more are required to file monthly reports of state and local sales tax collected and must remit those taxes to the state on a quarterly basis, except for sales taxes collected in March. Those taxes must be paid by retailers by March 20, 11 days before the end of the state's fiscal year. **********The law, which was enacted during the 1975 fiscal crisis to provide the state with additional revenue before the end of its fiscal year, was bitterly opposed by retailers statewide. **********The measure approved by Mr. Carey today would require retailers to prepay by March 20 only the state share of sales taxes collected on March sales. **********''The bill will give New York merchants some financial relief from a most burdensome tax,'' said the bill's prime sponsor, Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, Democrat of Long Beach, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''By dropping the local share of sales tax, merchants can be assured of a reduction in their 1983 estimate payment by about 40 percent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/18/world/around-the-world-police-in-india-kill-2-in-riot-over-language.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Police in India Kill 2 In Riot Over Language", "print_headline": "Around the World; Police in India Kill 2 In Riot Over Language", "body_text": " **********The police shot and killed two rioters and wounded two others today in Bangalore after a movie star spoke to a crowd about language rights, authorities said. **********The rioting spread to the town of Chitradurga, where the deaths occurred.

Muammar el-Qaddafi. That accord called for autonomy for certain Moslem areas, the establishment of a provisional government and elections. **********Mr. Marcos said in a speech two weeks ago that the Philippines had done all that was required under the agreement. He said his Government had even offered the chairmanship of the provisional government to Nur Misuari, one of the recognized leaders in the region. But Mr. Misuari, who now lives in Saudi Arabia, denounced the plan.

Martial law was lifted in the rest of the country in January 1981, but much of the southern area remains under emergency rule because the Government believes it is unsafe. **********The dates for the visit by Mr. Marcos and some Cabinet ministers, including the Minister of Energy, have not been announced.  Close ties with Saudi Arabia have been developing primarily as a result of the Philippine export labor program, which this year is expected to send thousands of Filipino laborers to Saudi oilfields.  Of the 240,000 Filipino overseas workers in the Middle East, 90 percent are in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Oil Is Imported **********In addition, the Philippines has been trying to insure its supply of oil.

Silin, director of consulting services of B.A. Asia Ltd., the Bank of America's Hong Kong merchant-banking arm, which conducted the study.  ''That means they have to keep those plants humming.'' **********In the last 48 months the pace of plant and equipment investment by Japan's 10 largest semiconductor producers more than tripled, to $828 million a year at present exchange rates, according to the report. **********This investment surge comes at a time when American semiconductor companies, suffering from weak markets in the United States and aggressive competition from the Japanese, have had to reduce operations and delay many investment programs. What Washington May Do **********To shield the domestic semiconductor industry from Japanese assault, the Reagan Administration is considering the possibility of limiting imports of one type of high-technology chip, the so-called 64K random access memory, on the basis of national security. **********But the Japanese industry is guiding its investment plans to sidestep the specter of other countries' protectionist actions, according to the B.A. Asia report. The 315-page volume, costing $590, is sold mostly to corporate and governmental clients (including the Central Intelligence Agency and the Soviet Government). The annual study - this is its third year - went to purchasers within the last two weeks. **********Increasingly, the Japanese are investing in semiconductor production and assembly facilities in the United States.  ''The nature of the Japanese competition will change over the next several years,'' Mr. Silin predicted in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. ''With offshore production, the Japanese challenge will not be something you can legislate against.'' More Unfinished Products **********Exports from Japan will more and more consist of unfinished products, such as silicon slivers, which are then packaged and bonded at Japanese-owned factories in the United States, the report says. Although the overall value of semiconductor exports may decline, shipments of unfinished items and the Japanese share of the American market could increase substantially. **********This strategy of offshore assembly to sidestep trade frictions has been successfully used in the past by Japanese producers of color television sets. Japan's TV companies, forced to curb exports for three years starting in 1977, now hold nearly all of the American market, but their share of it is no longer an issue. **********With leading Japanese semiconductor makers - such as Nippon Electric, Hitachi, Toshiba and Fujitsu -having set up assembly sites in the United States during the last few years, the trend is already apparent. In the four fiscal years through the one that ends today, the annual value of shipments of uncased integrated circuits (a type of unfinished product) from Japan increased nearly fourfold, to $145.9 million, the study says. Minimizing Trade Friction **********''The real issue, then, is not trade,'' the report says. ''Rather, it will be market penetration by Japanese-controlled corporations in the United States.'' **********In separate interviews, Japanese Government and industry officials said that recent moves to ease trade friction - especially Japan's ''voluntary'' restraints on auto exports -were taken into account in planning semiconductor investment in the United States. **********''We never again want to repeat the experience of the auto issue,'' said Hideji Sugiyama, deputy director of the industrial electronics division of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. **********Another reason for Japanese investment in America is to be close to the market, according to Keiske Yawata, president of N.E.C.  Electronics U.S.A. Inc. in San Mateo, Calif. Although some American semiconductor companies are beginning to step up their investment in Japan, Mr. Yawata said most of them had been content to ship their products from the United States. **********''That was a mistake,'' he said. Future of Market in Japan **********Indeed, it is in the rapidly growing $4.3 billion semiconductor market in Japan that American manufacturers may suffer the most because of the Japanese increase in production capacity. **********Last year, for instance, Japan's imports of integrated circuits slipped from 22 percent of total consumption to 19 percent, with American producers accounting for the largest share of this. The figure will drop to 10 percent ''over the next several years,'' the B.A. Asia study predicts. **********''And the American companies that want to do well here will have to manufacture in Japan,'' Mr. Silin declared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/flagship-banks-protest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Flagship Banks' Protest", "print_headline": "Flagship Banks' Protest", "body_text": " **********Flagship Banks Inc. of Miami has announced that it has filed a protest with the Federal Reserve Board in Atlanta asking that it disapprove the change of control filed by Juan Vincente Perez Sandoval and Inversiones Credival C.A., which are seeking permission to acquire up to 24.9 percent of Flagship's shares outstanding.

Haig Jr. said today that the United States would press its allies at a special NATO meeting here Monday for agreement on a framework for imposing sanctions against Moscow if the situation in Poland is not ''remedied in the immediate future.'' **********Mr. Haig, speaking at a news conference aboard his Air Force plane flying to the first emergency foreign ministers' meeting in the history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said that the United States also intended to ask the allies for a statement condemning Soviet involvement in the Polish situation. **********Mr. Haig's comments about what he expected from the alliance went beyond what he had said in Washington last week after President Reagan had met with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. Then, Mr. Haig indicated that the United States would not press for economic sanctions against the Russians - something opposed by Bonn at this time - and seemed satisfied with the NATO meeting limiting itself to a statement holding Moscow responsible for the Polish crisis. **********Mr. Haig said he was concerned that the Western allies not soften their response to the events in Poland by what he called ''the phony moderation'' of the Polish leadership in recent days. **********He said the formal lifting of censorship of foreign journalists and the parti al restoration of domestic telephone service in Poland fell into tha t ''phony'' category and were designed by the Polish leadership an d the Soviet Union to deceive Western public opinion. **********Reporters on the plane were told that in contrast to the amicable portrayal of Mr. Schmidt's meetings with Mr. Reagan and Mr. Haig as supplied by the principals themselves as well as by their spokesmen, the final session between Mr. Haig and Mr. Schmidt last Wednesday morning before the West German leader flew home was marked by some ''tough'' talk. A 'Floating Entity' **********Mr. Haig was reported to have told Mr. Schmidt that Washington was uncertain whether Bonn saw itself these days as part of the NATO alliance or as a ''floating entity between East and West.'' **********When some press reports appeared reporting these ''tough'' words, other officials on both the West German and the American side denied that the discussion had that character. **********Mr. Haig said aboard his Air Force 707 that the West had to tailor its policies for what he predicted would be ''a protracted, worsening, developing situation,'' with the possibility of growing repression within Poland and even direct Soviet military intervention possible. **********In addition, he said the Soviet Union was likely to try to take advantage of existing differences in perception within the Western alliance to further its ''strategic objective of splitting Western Europe from the United States.'' **********''What is clearly needed on the part of the West is the adoption of a common long-term strategic approach to events in Poland, an approach which will provide a long-term framework which would prevent a failure in the East from becoming a Western failure,'' he said. Mr. Haig said that already the Soviet Union , in messages to Western European leaders, was considerably mo re forthcoming and flexible than in its response to President Re agan. He said that the message from Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet l eader, to the President,was ''both cold and more rigid'' than in simi lar letters to European heads of state. **********In addition, he noted that the Soviet Union was threatening counter economic actions against European nations if they follow the American example and impose any sanctions. **********Mr. Haig said the West needed from the session on Monday of the NATO ministers ''a clear condemnation of the Polish 'junta' and Soviet responsibility for the events,'' as a ''clear recognition that the Soviet Union is behind the events in Poland.'' **********The ministers, he said, will repeat demands made previously by the Common Market and the United States for the end of martial law in Poland, release of the more than 5,000 prisoners, and renewal of negotiations on Poland's future among the Solidarity leaders, the church and the Polish authorities. **********Mr. Haig said, as he had in Washington, that he did not expect the Western Europeans to announce they would follow the American example and impose economic sanctions at Monday's meeting. 'Common Overall Approach' **********But he said today that the United States would regard the meeting as ''a success if we can achieve a common overall approach for the long haul, if we can establish a basis for action if the situation is not remedied in the immediate future.'' **********Without being specific, he said that he hoped that NATO would ''set in motion a framework for active consideration of economic and political sanctions.'' **********He noted that the West had already reached considerable agreement on sanctions against the Polish leadership, having already suspended any further government assistance to that country. But he said as to the Soviet Union, a consensus is ''badly lacking'' within the alliance. **********So far only the United States has announced any specific retaliatory steps against the Soviet Union. There is speculation in Brussels that at the meeting on Monday, there may be some language adopted talking of some reprisals in the political sphere, such as a limiting of political and cultural missions and exchanges. But there is no expectation of any specific economic steps at this time. **********Mr. Haig said that the United States intended ''to discuss concrete steps'' with the allies, but he recognized that ''the difference between member governments require in pragmatic terms individual approaches.'' One problem in drafting a joint statement is that the new Socialist Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of Greece is opposed to any steps against the Polish Government or the Soviet Union. Mr. Haig said, ''We must not let the lowest common denominator of Western action be the most recalcitrant member state.'' In the past there have been NATO statements adopted without full unanimity, pa rticularly on military questions in which France has nottaken part. **********''The United States must be prepared to do what is necessary and correct,'' Mr. Haig said, stressing that the Americans felt they must take the lead and that the Europeans would be coaxed to follow suit. **********Mr. Haig's firmer comments and his insistence that the United States was interested in future sanctions regardless of the European attitude at this time was in part a response to some press commentary in the United States suggesting that the Reagan Administration was dropping its insistence on sanctions because of the allied opposition. Effect of Sanctions **********Mr. Haig seemed nettled by some columnists, in fact, who suggested such acquiescence in today's newspapers. In that context, reporters were told that although Mr. Schmidt made clear his view to the Reagan Administration that economic sanctions would have no meaningful economic impact on the Soviet Union, there could be no misunderstanding by him ''of the direction'' that the Reagan Administration was taking. **********Reporters asked Mr. Haig to explain what he meant by ''framework'' for future actions and in particular whether he was envisaging some new standing committee of NATO. **********He said there was no need for any new group, since NATO already has various standing committees.  ''I think we should not get too hung up on the mechanism of this framework,'' he said. ''What I'm really talking about is that there is a unified common perception of the nature of this problem, its strategic and historic implications, the culpability of the Soviet Union for the events that have occurred and recognition that if this situation is not remedied it's going to have historic impact on the full range of East-West relations.'' **********When he was asked how, given the hostility expressed by the Reagan Administration toward the Soviet Union, it could be considering a conference between President Reagan and Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Haig replied sharply that ''When you have a crisis, you had better damn well communicate with the fellow who is perpetrating that crisis so he knows clearly where you stand.'' **********But he said he did not know when and if a meeting between the two leaders would actually take place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/22/world/around-the-world-party-of-ira-wins-3-ulster-assembly-seats.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Party of I.R.A.

Neither Nicaragua nor any of the countries of the Central American and Caribbean region can be considered as a geopolitical reserve of the United States, or as a part of its so-called ''strategic frontier,'' a concept that restricts the exercise of our sovereignty and independence. **********2. Therefore, Nicaragua can in no way represent a threat to the security of the United States. We are a small country, a dignified and poor country, that follows a policy of international nonalignment. The national interests of the people and nation of the United States should not be confused with the particular policy of the present Administration, which is trying to make its own points of view prevail, even at the cost of peace and security, not only of its own citizens but of an entire conglomerate of countries which, like ours, have a right to determine their own destiny. **********3. We are willing to improve the climate of relations with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and unconditional recognition of our right to self-determinatiuon. **********4. We are willing to begin immediately direct and frank conversations with the Government of the United States, even in a mutually agreeable third country, with the objective of reaching concrete results through such negotiations. **********5. The Salavadoran patriots of the F.L.M.N.-F.D.R. have authorized us to transmit their willingness to begin immediate negotiations, without preconditions, reiterating once more the call they made through me before the 36th ordinary period of sessions of the United Nations. **********6. The revolutionary Government of Cuba has authorized me to communicate to this Security Council its willingness as well to begin negotiations without delay. **********7. The Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua, the Government of Cuba and the Salvadoran patriots of the F.M.L.N.-F.D.R. back ther initiative for neogotiatiosn taken by the President of Mexico, Jose Lopez Portillo, on Feb. 21 in Managua. **********8. Nicaragua is willing to immediately sign nonaggression pacts with all bordering countries of the Central American area in order to insure peace and internal stability in the zone. **********9. Nicaragua is obliged to reject the attempt by the United States to impose humiliating restrictions on its inescapable and sovereign prerrogatives regarding national defense. Demands to U.S. Listed **********We demand, on the other hand, that the Government of the United States immediately put a halt to whatever measure or covert plan of the many that have been announced and denounced and which have never been denied officially: secret destabilization plans, organization and financing of paramilitary forces advised and trained by U.S.  military personnel in Honduras and active and retired militarymen from Argentina and other countries of South America. **********- Put a stop to the use of Honduran territory as a base for armed aggressions and terrorist operations against our homeland. **********- Put a stop to the existence of counterrevolutionary military training camps in U.S. territory, mainly in Florida. **********- Put a stop to the traffic in arms and counterrevolutionaries between the territory of the United States and Honduras. **********- Put a stop to the participation of the United States intelligence community in the financing, training and organizing of forces and clandestine plans against out homeland. **********- Put a stop to the presence of U.S. warships in waters of Central America and off Nicaragua's coast. **********- Put a stop to the flights of spy planes that violate Nicaragua's airspace.  The United States must, in an official and explicit manner, voice its commitment not to attack Nicaragua, not to initiate or promote any direct, indirect or covert intervention in Central America. **********Nicaragua calls on the Security Council of the United Nations to issue an explicit pronouncement in line with the charter of the organization, regarding the obligation to search for a peaceful means of resolving the problems of the Central American and Caribbean region; the council's rejection of the acts of force and threats, and its repudation of any direct, indirect or covert intervention in Central America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/30/business/impasse-worries-business-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1982-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 646, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IMPASSE WORRIES BUSINESS LEADERS", "print_headline": "IMPASSE WORRIES BUSINESS LEADERS", "body_text": " **********Except for cautious optimism from the automobile industry, business executives yesterday painted a generally gloomy picture for the economy in view of the budget impasse between President Reagan and Democratic Congressional leaders. **********The outlook - a rising budget deficit that would keep interest rates high -was viewed as particularly depressing for such areas of the economy as steel, housing, real estate, forest products, furniture and the suppliers that serve these and other industries. In credit markets, bond dealers and traders voiced dismay at the possibility of larger-than-expected deficits. (Page D1.) **********Richard M. Smith, vice chairman of the board of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which lost nearly $67 million in the first quarter, said the breakdown in talks would ''further delay economic recovery and that will further delay recovery of the steel industry.'' If, he said, there were a further decline in the rate of steel production - now 60 percent of capacity - employment would continue to fall for his company. **********Maintaining that the deadlock over the budget was becoming more devastating to the economy day by day, J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman of the Pennzoil Company, told stockholders at the company's annual meeting in Houston that ''the economic well-being of every man and woman in this country is being imperiled'' by the impasse. He warned that the economy had ''absolutely no chance of making a sustained recovery'' and that interest rates would not come down until a Federal budget was in place that ''demonstrates that Federal spending is heading downward.'' 'Disaster for Us' **********''What this will mean to us is total disaster,'' Michael Sumichrast, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said of the impasse. He estimated that settlement on the budget might have brought interest rates down to 12 percent from about 16 1/2 percent now. This, he said, might have raised housing production from 1.1 million units last year to 1.17 million this year and to 1.5 million in 1983. Now, he said, the prime rate would not come down and housing production this year ''at best'' might approach 1 million units, with no improvement next year. ''That's a disaster for us,'' he said. **********Arguing that the breakdown in budget talks meant ''paralysis of leadership until after the November elections,'' Jack Carlson, head of the National Association of Realtors and its chief economist, forecast ''only modest improvement in the economy this summer'' and predicted the economy would ''fall back into recession'' by the end of the winter. ''Only rich people will be able to afford the average home,'' he said, ''and middle-income and lower-income people will be left in the cold'' because of the failure to find a way to reduce the Federal deficit. **********At the Chrysler Corporation, Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman, stressed that the economy was the ''overriding issue'' facing the auto industry. He said that while the 10 percent Federal income tax cut, effective July 1, would be beneficial, ''we are concerned with the inability of the Government to deal with an ever-larger budget deficit, high interest rates, rising unemployment and sagging consumer confidence.'' **********Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, said the recession appeared to have ''about run its course,'' and if concern over the budget deficit could be contained, ''this would reduce the risk of recovery again being undermined by rising interest rates.'' **********In St. Louis, James A. Van Sant, chief executive of General Steel Industries, a supplier to a number of industries, said he was ''not sure'' there was a budget impasse, but added: ''Things are already extremely tough, and if they have to get a bit worse as part of the cure, General Steel is willing to stick it out. We've got to swallow the bitter medicine for a while longer to have a healthier economy this year or next.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/09/business/key-rates-242502.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/27/business/patents-other-uses-for-teller-machines.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1982-02-27", "snippet": "WASHINGTON A VETERAN inventor, with more than 200 patents, proposes that automatic bank teller machines be used to transfer funds to program the operation of postage meters in offices.

King Hussein has put his offer of asylum, which was formally transmitted to the P.L.O. 10 days ago, in the context of Arab solidarity. He and his country plainly feel strong enough today, politically and militarily, to control some disarmed guerrillas. **********On the other hand, native Jordanians admit some doubts and worries. The Palestinian population in Jordan has grown rapidly, and the Palestinians, although law-abiding in recent years, have caused grave troubles in the past. They have sometimes spoken against the monarchy, and, before being expelled, the P.L.O. provoked Israel. 'Instigators of Hollow Emotions' **********King Hussein, in a speech broadcast last Wednesday on the 30th anniversary of his accession to the throne, warned against ''instigators of hollow emotions and sedition'' in the wake of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and said he would show ''no mercy'' toward those who threatened his nation's unity, security and stability. The image that many of his listeners formed on hearing these remarks was of Palestinian guerrillas and their sympathizers. **********His words were taken less as a comment on the P.L.O.'s Jordanian homecoming than on the more general possibility that yet another Israeli advance might be followed by bitter political dissension among Arabs. Still, many Jordanians expressed surprise that the King had agreed to accept any of the guerrillas. Now that the guerrillas' arrival seems imminent, a typical attitude among Jordanians, according to one Palestinian official based here, is of ''latent apprehension.'' **********The official added, in a commonly held opinion, that Jordanian-Palestinian and Jordanian-P.L.O. relations had mellowed over the last few years. He also insisted, as almost everyone does, that no one could say what would follow the evacuation of Beirut. Memories of Black September **********One reason for the apprehension is the memory of Black September, a series of battles between Palestinian and Jordanian soldiers that began in September 1970 and ended only when bow-armed Palestinians had either been killed or expelled in 1971. Several thousand people died on each side, and deep bitterness toward the P.L.O. persists among some Jordanian soldiers, security officers and policemen. **********The Palestinians' sheer force of numbers has caused other grievances. And the likelihood that several thousand Palestinian refugees will soon head for Jordan can only add, however slightly, to those numbers. **********Excluding the West Bank, more than half of Jordan's 2.3 million East Bank residents consider themselves Palestinians, though most have been granted Jordanian citizenship.

A huge cloud rose over the city, singed red by the firestorm burning below. **********Professor Ogawa was in a unique position. He is the only nuclear physicist known to have observed the explosion of that first atomic bomb over Hiroshima. Within hours he began making calculations that led him to suspect what had happened, for Professor Ogawa knew that two teams of Japanese scientists were themselves secretly trying to build a nuclear weapon. The Pugwash Meetings **********Professor Ogawa also has a more pleasant recollection. Twenty-five years ago, he was one of a group of 22 distinguished scientists from 10 countries, including the Soviet Union and China, who met at this tiny fishing village of Pugwash to discuss ways of averting a nuclear holocaust. **********That conference, sponsored by the Cleveland industrialist Cyrus Eaton in response to an appeal by Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein at the height of the cold war, was the first such meeting between American and Soviet scientists. It and a series of so-called Pugwash meetings that followed helped lay the groundwork for the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the United Nations-sponsored treaty to ban the spread of nuclear weapons and the 1969 convention outlawing biological weapons. **********In 1960 the scientists split with their patron, Mr. Eaton, fearing that his close personal ties to the Soviet leadership imperiled their neutrality in the East-West conflict. **********But this weekend a group of 35 arms control specialists, disarmament activists and scientists, including Professor Ogawa, returned to Pugwash to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the meetings and pay tribute to Mr. Eaton, who died in 1979. **********Pugwash, across the Northumberland Strait from Prince Edward Island, was Mr. Eaton's birthplace. The conferences were held on the waterfront in the converted storehouse of a lobster fisherman, and the guests were housed in a 170-year-old white frame inn. Group Backs Weapons Freeze **********Although this weekend's meeting was an informal one - a full gathering of the 2,000 scientists from 75 countries who now make up the Pugwash movement is to be held in Warsaw in August - the group adopted a resolution supporting a nuclear weapons freeze, a reduction in nuclear arsensals and pledges of no first use of nuclear weapons like the one made by the Soviet Union last month. **********The major question before the group, which included Linus Pauling, twice a Nobel laureate, was that of how scientists could take advantage of the sudden popularity of the antinuclear arms movement, particularly the freeze campaign. For years scientists like Professor Pauling warned about the dangers of nuclear war without much popular response. **********Herbert Scoville Jr., president of the Arms Control Association and a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, recalled that President Johnson proposed a freeze on nuclear weapons in 1967 and that in 1970 the Senate approved a freeze resolution by a vote of 72 to 6. **********Most of the participants agreed with Sergei P. Kapitsa, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the host of a popular science program on Moscow television, that neither superpower can gain nuclear superiority. ''There is an essential parity of strategic weapons, overkill parity,'' Professor Kapitsa said, differing with the Reagan Administration's view that the Soviet Union enjoys an advantage because of its lead in large land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. There Is Some Disagreement **********But the participants did not all agree on how to put a freeze into effect. Paul M. Doty, director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said that in most freeze resolutions, which call for a moratorium on the testing, deployment and production of nuclear weapons, it would be difficult to verify whether a nation had stopped arms production. **********Professor Doty, a leading arms-control expert, said it would be simpler to monitor deployment and testing of nuclear weapons. ''I myself wish production wasn't part of the freeze,'' he said. ''We have too little experience with it.'' **********Professor Doty said he hoped to begin work soon on drawing up a more carefully defined freeze proposal.  He also said the next 18 months to two years would be a crucial period for arms control. If the talks in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic and medium-range nuclear missiles do not make progress within that time, he said, the United States may have deployed its cruise missiles in Europe. **********Cruise missiles could upset the strategic balance, he said, and would be almost impossible to verify as part of an arms-control agreement. The Soviet Union trails the United States in developing a sophisticated cruise missile, Professor Doty said, but it will eventually have them and the arms race will have escalated to a new level. **********But Professor Doty was skeptical of Moscow's recent pledge not to use nuclear arms first and of similar proposals by disarmament groups in the United States. Such pledges would be too easy to circumvent, he argued. All a nation would have to do, he said, is explode a nuclear device inside its own territory and assert that it had been attacked, absolving itself of responsibility for sticking to the promise. Hesburgh Trying to Form Meeting **********Another participant in the conference, the Rev. Theodore M.  Hesburgh, president of the University of Notre Dame, said he had been working for the last 18 months to try to bring the world's top scientists together with the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church ''for the first time since Gallileo.'' **********Father Hesburgh said that he had worked out a draft program on the dangers and possible solutions to nuclear war and that the presidents of 15 national academies of science, including that of the Soviet Union, would present the program to Pope John Paul II in Rome in September. The draft does not single out any particular plan, Father Hesburgh said, but by joining scientific and religious authority it could increase pressure on the world's leaders to act. **********Professor Ogawa said he remembered how, after the atomic bomb had been dropped of Hiroshima, he helped organize teams of scientists to determine what had caused the disaster. **********''Our first clue was that X-ray film in the hospitals had all been blackened, exposed,'' he said. ''That could only have happened by radiation. We also had seismologists who measured the distance from Hiroshima at which gravestones had been toppled. Their estimate of the bomb's size proved very accurate. **********''The bomb was a terrible thing,'' Professor Ogawa went on. ''But until it was dropped, the navy officers were very confident they could fight on. After it, they came to me and asked for books about physics. It may have shortened the war.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/12/business/us-is-said-to-lose-650-million-owed-in-81-royalties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. IS SAID TO LOSE $650 MILLION OWED IN '81 ROYALTIES", "print_headline": "U.S. IS SAID TO LOSE $650 MILLION OWED IN '81 ROYALTIES", "body_text": " **********The Government failed to receive $650 million in oil and gas royalties it was due last year, according to a special panel of investigators. It said that the loss was due to underreporting by companies operating on Federal lands and the inability of the Interior Department to police its ''honor system'' of collections. **********The investigators also report that thefts of undetermined amounts of oil from Government and Indian leases have become ''a serious national problem.'' The panel cites estimates that 2 to 6 percent of all crude oil produced in the United States is being stolen from oilfields and tank farms. **********The investigation was conducted by the Commission on Fiscal Accountability of the Nation's Energy Resources, a five-member body set up by the Reagan Administration last July to study long-standing allegations of underpayments and enforcement laxity. The report of the investigating panel was given final approval by the commissioners on Friday. Recommendations Are Made **********To deal with the problems involving a royalty system that is expected to generate $20 billion a year by the end of this decade, the commission has made far-reaching recommendations, including fines of as much as $10,000 a day for violations. Fines were never imposed before. Only recently, in fact, have those underreporting their production been made to pay interest on late payments. **********''There has been very significant mismanagement of the royalty resources of this country,'' declared David F. Linowes, a management specialist and professor at the University of Illinois, who is the commission's chairman. ''Internal controls are almost wholly lacking within the Geological Survey.'' **********Preliminary drafts of the panel's work have already spurred action at the Interior Department, where senior staff members have endorsed nearly all its recommendations and have prepared decision memorandums for Secretary James G. Watt. **********The Administration is expected to announce proposals to tighten the royalty-collecting system within the next few days. The process is moving swiftly so that additional revenues can be included in the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1983. Separate Office Is Urged **********In addition to the proposed fines, the commission is recommending creation of a separate royalty management office outside the Geological Survey, and it urges that all leaseholders draw up plans outlining who is responsible for making payments to the Government. **********The panel also recommends raising the royalty percentage for new onshore leases to 162/3 percent, the level for offshore leases, from the present 12 1/2 percent. The Interior Department staff opposes this change, however, and it is unclear what Secretary Watt will recommend to the President. **********''Royalty management is no longer a small collection effort which can be managed easily while buried in a large engineering or scientific organization,'' the commission declares in the report. It calls the performance of the present collection system a ''severe embarrassment to the department.'' An efficient system has not been installed, the commission says, despite numerous investigations by the General Accounting Office and other agencies over the last 20 years. **********In essence, the panel says the Geological Survey has spent too much effort acting as a bookkeeper for the oil and gas industry while virtually neglecting field inspections and other enforcement methods. The panel proposes that the oil and gas producers themselves be required to do this work under rigorous new rules that would force them to meet standards for oilfield security and to designate responsibility for channeling royalties to the Government. A Lack of Records Is Cited **********Despite a few attempts to improve the system, the commission has found, the Survey ''has no complete, up-to-date records of all the individuals and companies who pay royalties.'' **********There are several hundred thousand individuals and companies holding some 18,000 producing leases, the commiss ion says, and the Survey's records are only partly computerized . **********The industry is expected to strongly resist measures calling for more reporting responsibility.  Peter B. Wellish of the Independent Petroleum Association of America said today that many of his group's 7,500 members, including some very small operators, would have to add 6 to 10 employees ''just to keep track of all these numbers.'' He termed this a mammoth job that ''would just cost enormous amounts of money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/15/business/baxter-travenol-laboratories-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAXTER TRAVENOL LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "BAXTER TRAVENOL LABORATORIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/22/business/abbott-laboratories-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ABBOTT LABORATORIES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ABBOTT LABORATORIES reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/business/market-place-mta-bonds-firm-backing.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1982-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; M.T.A.

Bonds: Firm Backing", "body_text": " **********THE Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the operator of New York City's bus and subway systems along with some regional commuter train lines, continues to enjoy access to the bond markets, even though state legislators have not come up with a subsidy and tax package needed by the authority to close a budget gap estimated at as much as $300 million in the current fiscal year. **********New York State, meanwhile, faces its own budget deficit and will be hard-pressed to match the $290 million subsidy it gave the authority in 1982. A cutback in state assistance would hurt, but, according to 1981 legislation that gave the M.T.A. enough financial credibility to borrow money in the bond markets, a shortfall in revenues from fares or government appropriations would leave it with no alternative except to raise fares. **********With all the uncertainty about future financing, the bonds issued by the authority might be expected to be depressed. In fact, the authority still enjoys enough acceptance in the marketplace to plan a $125 million bond sale next week. **********The backing for next week's new bonds is significantly different than for the $250 million of revenue bonds sold in October. But both are an outgrowth of the 1981 legislation that is the foundation for the authority's creditworthiness in the eyes of investment bankers and bond buyers. **********That legislation, known as the 1981 Transit Act, included promises to bondholders by the state and the M.T.A. that are unusual in the annals of government finance but were necessary if the transit authority was to sell $1.6 billion of bonds as part of a $5.7 billion, five-year capital spending program. In essence, the legislation helped the M.T.A. separate the fate of its bondholders from the turmoil of the state and city budget-making process. **********Of course, the financial markets are still aware of the difficulty of obtaining government funds. As Moody's Investors Service noted in its analysis of the M.T.A.'s revenue bonds sold last October, investors should expect ''the periodic controversy that surrounds it to continue.'' **********But thus far, analysts can only discern a slight drop in the price of M.T.A. bonds relative to other tax-exempt issues. The 10 3/8 percent M.T.A. bonds due in 2012 have fallen from an offered price in October of 99 1/2 to 88 1/2 yesterday, to yield 11.77 percent. But prices of other long-term bonds sold at about the same time declined by similar amounts. The 10 1/8 percent bonds of the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Power Authority, for example, have dropped to 89 recently from a price of 100 on Oct. 15. **********The bonds to be sold next week are secured by a contract between the state and the M.T.A. in which the state promises to pay $80 million a year for the next 35 years for capital improvements.  Because the state has contracted to pay that money, the authority can borrow against it, even though the money must be appropriated annually by the State Legislature. **********The state's promise to pay is good enough to warrant ratings of A and A by Moody's and the Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively. Those ratings are a notch higher than the Baa and BBB+ ratings assigned to the revenue bonds that the authority sold for the first time last October. **********According to Robert Gerard, a managing director at Dillon, Read & Company, there is a significant difference between the Legislature's promise to pay $80 million annually and the assumption that the Legislature will make annual appropriations to subsidize the authority. **********''The direct result of a failure to appropriate money for the service contract would be a default on the bonds,'' Mr. Gerard said, ''whereas a bond default would not be the result of a failure to appropriate funds for the operating expenses.'' **********In Mr. Gerard's opinion, and that of many other market participants, the authority's revenue bonds, such as the $250 million sold last October, are well secured because of the requirement that the authority raise fares if needed to balance its budget.  Furthermore, that legislation allowed the authority to give the revenue bonds first lien on all its revenues and prohibited the state from allowing the authority to file for bankruptcy. **********Such legal protections are useful, but as analysts at both major rating agencies said, the ultimate protection for the bondholders depends on the ability of the transit authority to spend the borrowed money effectively enough to improve service and keep ridership from continuing to decline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/28/business/advertising-agencies-seek-sears-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Agencies Seek Sears Account", "print_headline": "Advertising; Agencies Seek Sears Account", "body_text": " **********WASTING no time, Sears, Roebuck & Company, which said Tuesday that it would consolidate its three apparel accounts at one agency, began talking to Chicago agencies yesterday in its Chicago headquarters.

It is also understood that the callers included the Leo Burnett Company, Chicago's biggest agency, which does advertising for Sears's Allstate Insurance Companies; Needham, Harper & Steers, and Tatham-Laird & Kudner. **********The two losers are McCann-Erickson, which handled men's apparel and Stern Walters/Earle Ludgin, which did children's apparel and is a subsidiary of Ted Bates/Worldwide. **********All agencies have agency-of-record jobs in certain media categories.

One of its recent changes was to consolidate the three apparel categories in the Merchandise Group and this month put them under Wayne T. Holsinger, who was moved from vice president, women's apparel, to vice president, wearing apparel. **********According to a Chicago adman on an inside track, Sears people ''are nice people to work with, and although they refer to agency people as suppliers, they treat them like marketing partners, just as they like to be treated.'' **********The fact that the only incumbent to get to compete is Foote, Cone & Belding is based on the lucky coincidence that Sears recently made a news-making agreement to sell Levi Strauss & Company jeans, breaking a long tradition of not merchandisin g any brand names but their own - and they do have a number of jean s.

Because if you throw in local promotion, Sears moves to the fore. **********With $599.6 million spent for national advertising in 1980, according to Advertising Age, Sears was second to P.& G. with its $649.6 million. But adding in the local stores efforts including newspaper, radio and direct mail, the total came to $707.9 million.  That's to get sales of $16.99 billion. **********The chain itself says it spent $545 million for advertising in 1980 and estimates that 1981 saw it in the range of $575 million to $600 million. **********Sears has gotten the hang of national advertising mighty fast. It only started getting into it in 1961 when it retained Ogilvy for a corporate campaign and later, with Ogilvy, pioneered its kind of store in television advertising. In 1980 it spent more than $100 million in the medium. **********It began working with J. Walter Thompson in 1966, Stern Walters in 1967, Foote, Cone in 1968 and McCann in 1970.

Income in fibers and plastics was sharply lower than in the strong fourth quarter of 1980, Allied said, because of the severely depressed automotive and housing markets. **********For the full year, Allied's net income increased 20.4 percent, to $348 million , or $9.17 a share, from $289 million, or $8.15 a share, in 1980.

But the two institutions did not write off their loans, which were well below $100 million, as losses. **********In fact, bankers said, the fact that these loans were put in the ''nonperforming'' category and not listed as losses indicated a belief that the loans would eventually be repaid. Bankers Remain Sanguine **********The accounting steps reflected an attitude that is widespread among American bankers with loans to Poland. Although they have been frustrated in their attempts to collect overdue interest payments, the bankers say the situation does not threaten the basic soundness of the international banking structure or the soundness of any individual bank. **********No bank has officially declared Poland to be in default. But that, bankers say, is a matter of semantics and technicalities. In fact, because it has been so late in interest payments, Poland has defaulted. **********If one of Poland's many creditors were to declare the country officially in default, the legal situation would be changed. But on a practical level, this would probably make very little difference, the bankers say. American banks, for example, still would not be obliged to write off the loans as losses. Major American Creditors **********No American bankers were willing to speak for attribution. But in private conversations, they stressed that commercial bank loans to Poland that were not guaranteed by non-Communist governments amounted to only about $7.5 billion, while another $8.5 billion or so in bank loans were guaranteed by Western governments. This exposure is spread among 460 banks throughout the major industrial countries. Of the $7.5 billion, about $1.2 billion is owed to American banks. Estimates var y, but according to one source, the Bank of America is said to have the greatest exposure among American banks - about $125 million. **********Two other major lenders are said to be Citibank and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, each of which is reported to have lent Poland about $100 million. Possible Impact on Profits **********If these loans had to be written off, which the banks are confident will not happen, it would hurt current profits but would not have a critical impact on any individual institution, bankers said. **********They asserted that the losses might be comparable to those sustained from the bankruptcy in 1975 of W.T. Grant & Company, to which several banks had lent about $100 million. The Grant losses cut into these banks' profits, but certainly were not devastating. **********According to rough estimates by banking sources, the Polish exposure of other American banks included: Chase Manhattan, $75 million; Morgan Guaranty, $75 million; Chemical Bank, $70 million; First National of Chicago, $65 million; Continental Illinois, $40 million; Bankers Trust, $40 million; Security Pacific, $15 million; First Interstate, $10 million, and Wells Fargo, $10 million. Biggest Creditors Are German **********The biggest creditors to Poland are reported to be West German banks. And although the impact of a Polish default could have a severe impact on some individual institutions, none is thought to be so vulnerable that its solvency would be threatened. **********American banking sources say that a large part of German banks' loans to Poland are guaranteed by the Bonn Government, and that only about $2.5 billion lack government guarantees. The largest nonguaranteed exposure of an individual German bank is estimated to be about $300 million, the American bankers estimate. **********European and American bankers are confident, however, that their Polish loans eventually will be repaid in full.  Unlike a company, a country cannot disappear, they say. Moreover, any country that depends on foreign trade cannot conduct its international business without the cooperation of banks. And, as the bankers warn, no additional loans will be granted to Poland until the interest that w as due in 1981 is fully paid. **********Thus, the banks say, they have powerful leverage over Poland. Total Debt Is Put at $26 Billion **********According to estimates by banking sources, Poland's total foreign debt amounts to about $26 billion. Of that, about $11.5 billion is owed to 17 major Western governments, which agreed last April to postpone repayment of about $2.4 billion of principal. **********Still another $2 billion to $2.5 billion is believed to be owed to the Eastern European countries. And more than $2 billion is said to be owed to nonindustrialized countries such as Brazil, Argentina and Thailand. **********Bankers say that Poland also owes money to some Arab countries, including Libya and Iraq, but these are described as ''political loans.'' **********A major problem in the banks' negotiations with Poland - even before the military crackdown there - is that they are uncertain about exactly how much Poland owes to whom, and when repayments are due. **********The most immediate problem, however, is the payment of about $500 million in interest that was due in 1981. Bankers generally are not particularly worried if a government cannot meet payments of principal: Even the United States Government, the bankers say, has never cleared up its debts, and no one expects it to. **********Interest is a different matter, however. Bankers say it is costly when a borrower does not pay its interest.  Often, government borrowers pay only slightly more than what the banks themselves pay for the money. Thus, banks might be paying 16 percent for their money today, while their borrowers might be paying 16 3/8 percent. If a borrower such as Poland does not pay its interest, the lenders still must pay the 16 percent to support the money that was loaned. Why Poland Is Different **********Bankers also like to feel that a country can meet its obligations, and interest payments are the acid test. Poland has failed that test but, the bankers say, that is not unusual. Each year some countries run into trouble and make headlines, but generally the problem is corrected within a few years. Similar cases include Peru and Turkey, which went through comparable problems a few years ago and which are now up to date in their paymen ts. **********A difference between Poland and most other problem cases, however, is that Poland is not a member of the International Monetary Fund.  The I.M.F. often plays an active role in restructuring a nation's debt and, as a multinational organization, is in a position to demand that certain measures be taken to improve the borrower's economy. Because of the political senstivities involved, it is difficult for individual countries or foreign banks to play this role. **********For this reason, before the imposition of martial law, a move was afoot to bring Poland into the I.M.F. Estimates of the Arrears **********American bankers vary in their estimates of just how far behind Poland is in its interest payments. **********According to one banker, however, Warsaw owed about $350 million in back interest in the October-December quarter to banks around the world. This amount has been reduced to about $250 million, this banker said. Another $150 million or so is said to be owed to other creditors. **********Last year, before martial law, Poland had agreed to pay $500 million in interest due in 1981 as one of the conditions for postponement in payments of principal. **********There have been reports that some banks might offically declare that Poland has defaulted on its loans, and that such an action would trigger automatic default clauses in most of its other loans.  But in real terms, such an event would be insignificant because most banks, especially those with the large loans outstanding, would be unlikely to take any actions beyond those already taken, the bankers say. Default Adds to Banks' Power **********An official default would give the creditors additional powers, but these are considered so drastic, and probably so costly to exercise, that at this time most major bankers say such moves are unthinkable. **********Technically, once a default is declared, a bank can seize any of the borrower's deposits that it holds. That was the case with Iran in 1979, when that country was declared to be in default after the seizure of American hostages. **********Iran, however, had huge deposits in American banks, far greater than the amount it owed, and these deposits were seized immediately.  But Poland's deposits in American banks are said to be less than $30 million. Possible Seizures of Goo ds **********An official default would also allow creditors to seek court permission around the world to seize Polish goods; the country still exports about $500 million a month to Western countries. **********But such action is considered so extreme that it is not used unless the countries involved are close to a state of war. Aside from Iran, banks took such action against Cuba when Fidel Castro declared that Cuba would not pay its foreign debts. American bankers say that since then, Cuba has had to rely almost exclusively on the Soviet Union for loans to finance trade. **********The bankers add that as long as there seems to be any hope that Poland will repay its debts, they will avoid declaring or acting on a formal default. ''That is why Poland has been making token interest payments all along,'' one New York banker said. ---- Creditor Nations Meet **********PARIS, Jan. 14 (Reuter) - Government officials from the nations to which Poland owes the most met here today to discuss the weak Polish economy, diplomatic sources said. **********But because of the decision by members of NATO to freeze negotiations on official debts, the question of deferring repayments was not discussed. A French Treasury spokesman said the talks were technical and that a communique probably would not be issued. **********The meeting, first planned before martial law was imposed in Poland, had been expected to discuss how repayment of the $2.4 billion due this year might be spread out. **********But, the sources said, France had sounded out the creditor nations and had gone ahead with the meeting at a reduced level, in preference to canceling it altogether. Polish Loss Reserve **********MONTREAL, Jan. 14 (Reuter) -The Royal Bank of Canada has set up a loan-loss reserve for its Polish loans, its chairman and chief executive offi-cer, Rowland C. Frazee, told the an-nual shareholders meeting today. **********He did not say how large either the reserves or the loans were. He said that, ''even with the worst possible scenario fo r Poland, the impact on the bank would be modest compared with past situations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/29/business/progress-at-a-streamlined-bl.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Rattner", "pub_date": "1982-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROGRESS AT A STREAMLINED BL", "print_headline": "PROGRESS AT A STREAMLINED BL", "body_text": " **********On the edge of the cluttered British Leyland auto-making complex, where Herbert Austin began one of Britain's first car companies in 1905, a sleek new building now houses one of the world's most modern body plants. **********In a bright and airy space the size of 10 soccer fields, huge automated body-framing lines and 28 dexterous robots help fashion 800 gray steel bodies a day. **********The plant, called the West Works, symbolizes the new BL P.L.C., as Britain's last major home-owned auto manufacturer is now called. From big losses and near-anarchy on the shop floor, the company has substantially improved both its financial performance and its productivity. But at the same time, its size has been sharply reduced and it has lost a share of the market in Britain. **********''Over all, the picture is of a sustained reduction of losses in spite of a slight drop in unit sales and virtually static sales revenue,'' said Frank Fitzpatrick, director of finance, in announcing midyear results recently. ''This improvement has been achieved primarily by reducing costs and increasing efficiency.'' Loss Is Reduced **********On the financial side, the company cut its loss to $189.1 million in the first six months of 1982, from $331 million in the similar period a year earlier. At the same time the company, which has received about $4.3 billion in Government support over the past five years, said that less state assistance would be required next year than had been forecast. **********Perhaps the most dramatic improvement at BL has been in productivity and labor relations. In 1978, the company counted 584 stoppages of an hour or more that together totaled 5 percent of all working time. In 1981, only five-tenths of 1 percent of work time was lost. **********Similarly, both productivity and quality have gained. Here at Longbridge, the number of cars built per worker rose from fewer than 8 in 1980 to nearly 17 just a year later, and the number of ''quality demerits'' has dropped sharply. The large new investment has played a key role, but the bulk of the improvement has resulted from better management. **********But as with many British companies, the news from BL these days is both good and bad. The slight rise in production this year followed a major contraction in the size of the company, from a peak output of 1,161,000 vehicles in 1973, to 525,000 last year. Market Share Is Down **********Perhaps even more significant, the company's share of its home market has dropped, to 16.2 percent last month, from 18 percent earlier this year and 24.3 percent in 1977. **********So small a producer has BL become that there have been suggestions that the company can no longer support the engineering and marketing arms that a large auto manufacturer needs. BL is now making a Triumph Acclaim under license from Honda and plans to develop a car jointly with Honda. **********Although BL has had big success with a new small car called the Metro, the company's product line has been virtually devoid of cars in the more lucrative middle sizes. Of the cars BL is developing in those sizes, the ''LM10'' will not begin production until early next year and the larger ''LM11'' is still further behind. **********And the company, which is 99.6 percent owned by the Government, continues to lose money at a time when car prices in Britain are as much as twice those on the Continent. Much of the reason, BL contends, is the high price of British components, which still account for 70 percent of the value of a BL car. Changes at the Top **********BL also faces a number of other uncertainties, particularly the effects of the departure of Sir Michael Edwardes last month after five years as chairman. He will be succeeded by Sir Austin Bide. **********It was Sir Michael who pared the company's work force from 195,000 at the end of 1977 to 108,000. In part, the reduction was achieved by closing 10 assembly plants and a number of smaller facilities. BL now has just two car manufacturing centers, the one here and another near Oxford. **********But within this 375-acre complex, car production has been increased by 1,000 a week, to 5,750, while the work force has been reduced from more than 18,000 workers, when Sir Michael arrived, to 9,866.  (Despite the high unemployment in Britain, the cut was achieved by voluntary departures.) **********Perhaps more important, Sir Michael developed a labor relations strategy to appeal to the rank-and-file over the heads of the more militant shop stewards, who once virtually ran the plant. In November 1979, Derek Robinson, a shop steward, was dismissed and to the surprise of many, the Longbridge work force refused to strike over it. **********Two years later, Sir Michael again went over the stewards' heads and won agreement from the workers on a 3.8 percent pay raise, at a time when inflation in Britain was 12 percent. Efficiency Bonuses **********In the course of the test of wills, all manning restrictions in the plant vanished and the sharp increase in productivity that resulted has led to efficiency bonuses so large that workers' pay has gone up by more than the rate of inflation in the past year. **********''There's extra money there for working harder,'' said Colin Taylor, a production foreman who has been with the company for 25 years. ''Now the men are willing to give anything a try.'' **********But BL has not entirely solved its labor problems. The company still builds fewer cars per worker than most of its European competitors. **********And with the signs of improving finances, there are indications that the labor force has become restive. The shop stewards have rejected a company proposal for a two-year contract, and have demanded a 20 percent pay increase next year. **********''Changes were necessary but there were other ways of making them,'' said Brian Mathers, Midlands secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. ''The Michael Edwardes style may be the way to quick, short-term results, but the price will have to be paid in the future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/09/business/aerosonic-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AEROSONIC CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "AEROSONIC CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/19/world/israelis-concede-and-defend-use-of-cluster-bomb.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1982-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1005, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELIS CONCEDE AND DEFEND USE OF CLUSTER BOMB", "print_headline": "ISRAELIS CONCEDE AND DEFEND USE OF CLUSTER BOMB", "body_text": " **********Israel has officially acknowledged to the United States that it used cluster bomb weapons in its invasion of Lebanon, but has asserted that its actions were consistent with Israeli-American agreements on the use of those weapons, according to Israeli sources here familiar with the message. **********The Israeli note was delivered Friday night, and White House and State Department officials said this afternoon that it was still being reviewed. **********They said ''no final decision'' had been made on whether to go ahead with a planned delivery to Israel on Monday of 4,000 rounds of cluster munitions designed for use in 155-millimeter howitzers. **********Some Administration officials said, however, that they anticipated at least a delay since they doubted that the review would be concluded by Monday. **********Pellets Disperse Over Area **********Cluster bombs are known technically as cluster bomb units. They are generally either dropped from aircraft or fired by artillery. In both cases, they consist of a canister of explosive pellets that are dispersed over a large area when the canister opens. **********The Israeli note did not specify whether the weapons were dropped from aircraft or fired by artillery. Most reports from Israel and Lebanon have described them as having been dropped from airplanes. **********President Reagan, who returned to the White House this afternoon, declined to comment on the Israeli note. Speaking briefly to reporters after getting out of the helicopter that brought him from Camp David, Mr. Reagan said the Israeli response to American requests for information ''had just come in'' and was ''under study.'' **********The President also said the Administration was undertaking a thorough review of all aspects of its Middle East policy, including arms shipments to the region. On Saturday, in his first full day in office, Secretary of State George P. Shultz spent considerable time with the Israeli and Egyptian Ambassadors separately, and with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and other experts on the Middle East from within the Government. **********Some officials have said that as a result of this review, Mr.  Kissinger, who has had extensive negotiating experience in the Middle East, or some other prominent American, might be sent on a mission to the region. But they said no decisions had been made. 'George Asked Them to Come In' **********Mr. Reagan also said no decisions had been made. ''George asked them to come in and have a meeting and get their thoughts on what's going on,'' he said. **********According to those familiar with the Israeli note, the Israelis said that their agreement on cluster bombs with the United States placed two major conditions on the use of the weapons and that Israel met both criteria. The first was that they be used against organized Arab armies; the second, that they be directed against clearly defined military targets. **********The text of the 1976 agreement has never been made public. But American officials in the past have said the agreement, which was reaffirmed in 1978 by Israel after it was accused of violating the accord in an incursion into Lebanon, did limit the use of the weapons to Arab armies in conditions similar to those of the 1967 and 1973 wars. **********The Israeli message reportedly took note of the large quantity and sophisticated quality of the arms in the hands of the Syrian Army and the Palestine Liberation Organization forces in Lebanon that Israel fought during the invasion that began June 6. The Israelis argued that this met the standard for use against organized armies. **********(United Press International quoted the Israeli radio as citing Syria's role in the conflict and as saying, ''In these conditions, it had been permissible for Israel to use the cluster bombs.'') **********In their note, the Israelis reportedly said the cluster bombs had been directed against ground-to-air antiaircraft missiles and against antiaircraft and artillery guns. This met the condition that they be used against clearly defined military targets, they said. No Official Confirmation **********But the Israeli note said many of the military targets were situated in the midst of built-up civilian areas, and that if the weapons had fallen on populated areas, this was unintentional, the sources said. **********State Department officials, when asked about this account of the Israeli note, would not confirm it, but said it was consistent with what Israel has said publicly on the matter. **********Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, a long-time supporter of Israel, said today that ''technically there's been violations'' by Israel in its use of American-made cluster bombs. But he did not go into details when asked about the matter on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' **********He added that as a result of the invasion of Lebanon there had been ''substantial erosion of support for Israel'' but that this was balanced by ''great admiration on the part of frustrated American citizens for the fact that when they seek to do something, they know how to do it and get it done.'' **********Mr. Jackson was critical of the Israelis for failing to consult the United States about their military actions. 'We Have to Consult' **********''If we're going to be allies, we have to consult,'' he said. If such behavior continues, Israel will lose its support in this country, he said. His view on Israel's loss of support was similar to that voiced a week ago by Senator Charles H. Percy, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who said relations between the United States and Israel were now at an all-time low. **********Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, who is also a strong supporter of Israel, said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that he would censure Israel if it turned out that the Israelis had used cluster bombs, jeopardizing civilian lives, in violation of the agreement with the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/14/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1982-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 746, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prospects", "print_headline": "Prospects", "body_text": " **********OPEC's Last Waltz? **********Times have never been worse for OPEC. Oil prices keep slipping, economists keep pushing back estimates of the strength and timing of recovery in major consuming nations, and the cartel's own revenues are falling sharply. So the OPEC gathering in Vienna this week is likely to be a critical and cantankerous one. **********Much of action may take place before Friday, when the session formally begins, says Philip Verleger, an oil analyst with Booz Allen Hamilton. In order to defuse bickering about future production levels, Saudi Arabia, which has cut ouput by roughly 3 million barrels a day in the last 12 months, to 7.5 million, may announce more cuts as well as a price drop of around $2 a barrel. However, those steps may not be enough, Mr. Verleger says. **********In order to recapture control of the oil markets for the cartel, Mr. Verleger says, the Saudis would have to cut production another 2 million barrels from current levels, and keep output at that pace for at least six months. Such a sacrifice is unlikely, Mr. Verleger says. Financing the kingdom's development plan requires a production level of around 6.5 million barrels a day, and the Saudis may not be willing to drop below that level. Plunging Profits **********High interest rates and sporadic economic growth have not done much to help corporate income statements. Corporate profits in 1980, after tax, declined nearly 3 percent from year-earlier levels.  Analysts expect that when the Commerce Department announces 1981 results this week, it will be another drop. And, as the recession lingers, the outlook for 1982 is not reassuring. **********As a percentage of national income, corporate profitability in the fourth quarter may have hit a new post-war low, says Gary Wenglowski, chief economist at Goldman Sachs & Company. That would mean sliding below the results of during the 1974-1975 recession, when profits were only 7.5 percent of national income. For the year, Mr.  Wenglowski says, after-tax profits fell more than 5 percent from 1980 levels, to $154 billion. Mr. Wenglowski estimates the sagging economy could cut profits another 8 percent in the first quarter. After that, an improvement of sorts is likely, he says. At annual rates, fourthquarter earnings should be up 16 percent compared to the first quarter. In spite of the rebound, corporate profits for the year are likely to average $142 billion, down 8 percent from 1981 levels. A Silent Spring for Autos **********Spring is usually synonymous with rising car sales. However, as the auto industry enters what normally is its busiest season, analysts see little reason to expect domestic sales, which ran at a 6 millionunit annual rate last month, to show much if any increase. **********Moderating inflation and stabilizing prices have watered down the attraction of rebates, says Paine Webber auto specialist Maryann Keller. Moreover, while manufacturers have not raised sticker prices since last September, they remain stuck at very high levels. Unless auto finance companies or banks are willing to extend loan pay-back periods even further - a notion Mrs. Keller dismisses as impractical - even a sharp cut in interest rates would do little to enliven sales. **********Conditions may improve marginally during the second half of the year, Mrs. Keller says, when the stimulus of the 10 percent tax cut in July boosts pay checks - but only to an annual sales rate of 7 million units. The Appeal of Apparel **********If the debut of spring means little for Detroit, it could be good for Seventh Avenue. Although men generally curb spending on clothes during economic downturns, women's apparel makes up about two-thirds total sales. And, with a new line of low-priced spring fashions on the racks, analysts are rather sanguine about the garment trade's fortunes. **********For the twelve months ending in January, retail clothing prices rose only 3.4 percent. Consumers responded by spending an inflationadjusted $83.7 billion on clothes last year, up more than 7 percent from 1980 levels. **********While increases in disposable income may not be enough to boost sales of big ticket items like autos, clothes remain affordable even during a prolonged economic downturn, says Elizabeth Allison, an economist at Data Resources. As a result, apparel sales should rise another 1 percent this year in real terms, she says, and possibly 3 percent, if the new, shorter skirts catch on. **********Kenneth N.

He was shown on television wearing a dark suit while attending a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Roman Malinowski, who is also chairman of the central committee of the United Peasants' Party. Need for 'Honest Work' Seen **********Interviewed by a television reporter afterward, he said that he agreed on almost all points with the Deputy Prime Minister and that the current situation called for ''honest work from the bottom'' to lift Poland out of its food crisis. **********''We discussed the possibility of my participation in the work of the United Peasants' Party,'' he said. ''For me, it's a great satisfaction.'' **********Rural Solidarity was formed partly in response to complaints from farmers that the Peasants' Party, one of the three in the Communistdominated National Unity Front, did not adequately represent their interests.

The detention center there is one of seven now holding more than 600 internees, including almost all of the union leaders. **********The sources said the police had been called in to put down a disturbance that erupted after prison authorities turned back families who had come for a Saturday visit. Mingled Freely in the Past **********On the previous Saturday, they said, the families were allowed in altogether and mingled freely with the inmates. One detainee escaped simply by walking out with the relatives at the end of visiting hours. Since then, the sources said, the prison commander had been replaced and a stricter regimen enforced. **********Last Saturday, when family members were refused admittance, the inmates rebelled. Some managed to leave their cells and reached the roof of the center. **********In addition to the police, firemen were ordered to join in the assault by driving water cannons but they refused, the sources said.  The water cannons were then driven by the police. **********At one point, a blast of water struck an inmate on the roof, toppling him over the side. He was reportedly hospitalized with damage to his spinal column. Others were beaten with truncheons before order was restored, the sources said. No Recent Reports of Beatings **********Although there were several reports of beatings of internees in the early months of martial law, such incidents seemed to have fallen off. The authorities are taking pains to try to depict the conditions of detainees as humane. **********The exact number still in detention is uncertain. The Government says 637 remain. But Western diplomats put the figure much higher. In addition, there are perhaps as many as 3,000 people who have been arrested and sentenced to prison terms for martial law violations. **********Meanwhile, a note of tension began creeping back into public pronouncements as the authorities braced for demonstrations on Aug.  31, the second anniversary of the Gdansk agreement that esatblished Solidarity. **********The Polish press agency today mentioned recent disturbances in Gorzow Wielkopolski, near Poznan, where two Solidarity activists were said to have been detained Monday for shouting slogans at a crowd leaving a church. There were more serious incidents in four cities on Friday, including Gdansk, where demonstrators trying to march on the local party headquarters were beaten back by volleys of tear gas and sprays from water cannons. Nightly Gathering at Floral Cross **********In Warsaw, crowds have gathered nightly around a floral cross laid out on paving stones in Victory Square. The cross, originally laid to commemorate the late Primate, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, has become a symbol of opposition to military rule, and on several occasions the police have charged the crowd and swept the flowers away. The cross has been reconstituted within hours. **********On Tuesday the police moved in to disperse a crowd of 80 people who assembled at the nearby Hotel Victoria and heckled Polish officials who were leaving a diplomatic function. Leaflets were distributed calling for a rally at four staging areas on Aug. 31. **********In an apparent attempt to defuse the cat-and-mouse confrontations around the cross, the Government announced that permission had been granted for a permanent monument to honor Cardinal Wyszynski one block from Victory Square, near the Church of the Nuns of the Visitation on Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/16/business/business-people-a-heinz-man-is-named-president-of-star-kist.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1982-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Heinz Man Is Named President of Star-Kist", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; A Heinz Man Is Named President of Star-Kist", "body_text": " **********Richard L.

He could face up to five years in prison on each of several counts if convicted. **********Mr. Posner, a Miami Beach resident who is often in the news for his efforts to acquire other companies, owns assets with a reported worth of $1 billion. He is chairman and chief executive officer of Sharon Steel, a major domestic producer of specialty steels with annual sales of about $800 million. **********Sharon, in turn, is a subsidiary of the NVF Company, a Delawarebased producer of plastics and speciality papers. Mr. Posner is also chairman and chief executive of NVF. **********In a statement denying the charges, Mr. Posner said, ''I am shocked that the Government would single me out for prosecution because of a disagreement over the value of land that I gave to a charitable cause in 1975. **********''I will vigorously defend myself against this false accusation,'' the statement said, ''and I am totally confident that when the facts are presented to a jury that I will be completely exonerated.'' **********His defense in the tax-evasion case is being handled by the Washington law firm headed by Edward Bennett Williams and by Stuart E. Seigel, a member of the Williams firm. Miami Broker Also Indicted **********The charges center on the worth of 22 acres of land that Mr.  Posner donated to Miami Christian College in 1975. William Scharrer, a Miami real estate broker who was named in four of the counts, was accused of providing Mr. Posner with inflated appraisals of the land's value. **********Efforts to reach Mr. Scharrer for comment at his office and home last evening were unsuccessful.  Kenneth V. Handal, the prosecutor in the case, said both defendants would be arraigned on May 6 in Federal District Court in Manhattan.  The indictment was filed in Manhattan, where Mr. Posner's tax returns had been prepared. **********Mr. Handal said Miami Christian College was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case.  According to the indictment, the land was worth a maximum of $1 million when it was donated to the college. Despite this, Mr. Posner used appraisals placing its value at $3 million and claimed charitable deductions based on the higher figure. **********In 1967, the indictment said, Mr. Posner paid $2,500 an acre for ''approximately 37 acres of unimproved land at S.W. 117th Avenue and 104th Street in Miami. He subsequently sold the land to a realty company for $38,000 an acre in 1974, it said, but the sale was canceled because ''it was not economically feasible to develop the property.'' Kept 15-Acre Parcel **********Mr. Posner then donated 16 acres to the college in 1975 and six acres in 1978, the indictment said. It added that he kept a 15-acre parcel that was considered to be the most valuable part of the tract. **********The first donation placed a value of $2 million on 16 acres, or about $125,000 an acre, when the defendants knew the fair market value was no more than $40,000 an acre, the indictment continued. It said the second donation valued six acres in excess of $1 million, or about $175,000 an acre, when the real value was no more than $60,000 an acre. **********The indictment said the Government's evaluations were based on an assessment of what the land would have sold for on the open market at the time of the donations. **********Mr. Posner used the inflated figures to take charitable deductions on his tax returns for 1975 through 1979, the indictment said, accusing him of evading $1.25 million in taxes. It disclosed that he had reported a taxable income of about $2 million a year for those years. **********In 1977, the indictment said, Mr. Posner was informed by Mr.  Scharrer that the college intended to sell the initital 16-acre donation for $33,000 an acre. It added that Mr. Posner sued the college to prevent the sale and settled when the college agreed not to sell the land before November 1982 without his permission. **********Mr. Posner, who began his career working in food stores that his father owned in Baltimore, built a fortune in real estate and then expanded into the acquisition of varied companies. His takeover activities resulted in some lawsuits. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission accused him in 1977 of having charged $1.7 million of family expenses to his companies, but he settled the suit by making a $600,000 repayment without admitting any wrongdoing. He later made a second payment of $700,000. ---- 'Never Been Wrong' **********Though shy of publicity, Victor Posner has been been somewhat less modest about discussing his reputation as one of the most successful stock pickers in the business. ''I've never been wrong,'' he remarked about a year ago. ''I have a 100 percent success record.'' **********In a long, highly publicized fight with Foremost-McKesson, for example, he was never able to convince the food, drug and liquor company that he was not bent on takeover. But even in defeat, Mr.  Posner last year sold a $30 million stake in the company, built over several years, for $65 million. **********Last April, he sold stock in the Bundy Corporation back to Bundy for some $400,000 more than it cost him. And recently, a British buyer took a big block of the Simplicity Pattern Company from Mr.  Posner for a pretax profit to him of $8 million -after exacting a promise from him not to buy any more Simplicity stock for 10 years. **********''We have positions in 40 or 50 companies,'' he said in a rare interview a year ago, ''and there's never a day we don't purchase more.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/27/business/worries-of-food-tampering.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1982-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORRIES OF FOOD TAMPERING", "print_headline": "WORRIES OF FOOD TAMPERING", "body_text": " **********As a result of the seven deaths from cyanide-contaminated Tylenol capsules in September, the nation's largest food manufacturers have become just as concerned about the possibility of tampering as their counterparts in the pharmaceutical industry. Many are so worried that they would not even discuss the problem. **********Although most of the tampering incidents of the past few months have involved drugs, such as Anacin, Dristan and Excedrin in addition to Tylenol, many food manufacturers are concerned that their products could be as easy to contaminate as over-the-counter drugs. **********In addition, they are worried that the drug tamperings could serve as legal notice that such problems are foreseeable and that further safety measures should be taken. 'No Simple Answer' **********''As soon as the Tylenol thing broke, we all began saying to one another, 'What if it happened to us?' and it was a question we couldn't shuck off,'' said Craig Shulstad, director of consumer and public affairs at General Mills Inc. ''Almost everybody in the food industry is reviewing not only their packaging but their product recall procedures. We're all wrestling with the question of where our liability as manufacturers begins - and there's no simple answer.'' **********On Nov. 5, the Food and Drug Administration issued rules requiring tamper-resistant packaging for over-the-counter drugs. Even though the rules do not apply to groceries, most food manufacturers are exploring ways to make their products less vulnerable to tampering. **********General Mills, for example, is reviewing its consumer product packaging to determine the vulnerability of its 200 grocery products.  Borden has also set up a committee on consumer product packaging, but, like most of those interviewed at a number of companies, Borden officials were nervous about discussing the specific changes being considered. Feeling Vulnerable **********''We've made tamper-resistance a major criterion in new product development, and we're going through all of our existing packaging to see how much it shows off tampering,'' said James McCrory, the corporate director of public affairs at Borden. **********''Some upgrading of the packaging may already have taken place,'' he continued, ''but I would not feel comfortable discussing that.  Actually, we are desperately worried about the Borden's name being used in any discussion, because all the nuts are watching, and you don't want to give anyone any ideas. I think we're all feeling very vulnerable, whether it's food or drugs. There's a kind of paranoia that has set in.'' **********Recently, William E. LaMothe, the chairman and chief executive of Kellogg, told the Food and Drug Law Institute, ''I can assure you that virtually everyone in the industry is looking for ways to give the consumer a higher confidence level that the product purchased has not been tampered with.'' **********But Mr. LaMothe, like most others in the food industry, is hoping to avert Federal rules to mandate tamper-resistant containers for all edibles. ''The cost would put many products out of the reach of consumers,'' he said. ''And what do we do with farm produce, fruit, vegetables, bread, cheese and milk?'' **********About 100 representatives from the food industry gathered in Washington on Dec. 16 to discuss these concerns at a ''Product Contamination Workshop'' sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Radical Changes Doubted **********''There was certainly a consensus that a problem existed,'' said Mr. Shulstad of General Mills, one of the participants. ''I think you'll see the food industry changing its packaging where it's feasible to do so, but I don't think there will be radical changes.  The longstanding criticism of the industry has been that there's too much money spent on packaging, and with the economy where it is, no one's interested in seeing prices go up. At the conference, it became clear to us that we're not as vulnerable as some other companies, like those producing fresh baked goods just wrapped in cellophane.'' **********One of the people faced with that problem is Paul Khan, the vice president for quality and food protection at the ITT Continental Baking Company. According to Mr. Khan, the tamper-proof seals and closures that might be useful for pharmaceuticals or foods packed in impermeable plastic or glass jars would be useless for baked goods. **********''It's a lot easier to protect against bacteria, insects and rodents than it is against people,'' said Mr. Khan, who estimated that the number of food-tampering incidents around Halloween was triple that of previous years. ''If you're dealing with cookies or bread - or bananas and apples - people can stick something right through them, or inject it. In 99 percent of the cases, that's what happens. I can't visualize a practical, economic solution to that problem. Punishing people for such acts, and publicizing those punishments, is the only solution I can think of. I don't think every apple should come in a metal case.'' **********The Food and Drug Administration, which developed the new rules on tamper-resistant packaging, concedes that from the tamperers' point of view, there is no difference between mouthwash or laxatives, for which new packaging will be required, and milk or orange juice, for which it will not. But, said Chris Smith, an F.D.A. spokesman, ''We don't think the danger is there as much in food.'' **********''People look more closely at their food,'' he said. ''They know what it should look like and smell like and taste like. Anyway, tamper-resistant packaging regulations for food are considered impossible in the time frame required for drugs. There are about two billion over-the-counter drug packages sold annually, compared with 338 billion food packages.'' What Cost for Safety? **********The question of whether tamper-resistant packaging should be more widely required ultimately comes down to one of costs: How much is safety worth? **********''I'm not sure people want to pay an extra two cents, or 10 cents, for every milk carton to be sealed differently,'' said Sheila Birnbaum, a products liability lawyer who teaches at New York University law school. ''We've already gone through this in airports, and there was a lot of discussion about whether the hijacking threat was so serious that we needed all the expense and bother of metal detectors. Now we've all paid for the metal detectors, we all feel a little safer, and maybe we're headed in the direction of spending more and more money to guard against the maniacs among us. But it's mighty expensive.'' **********For manufacturers, there are also legal considerations in deciding whether their packaging is adequate. Until the Tylenol deaths, they could not have been expected to anticipate lethal tampering. Now, however, they may be legally on notice that such things can happen - and, therefore, legally responsible for taking steps to prevent them. **********''If a problem is foreseeable, and if there is something reasonable to be done to prevent it, the manufacturer has a duty to do that something,'' said Miss Birnbaum. ''Generally, the legal standard of foreseeability is what is objectively reasonable to expect, not what might conceivably happen. Are we at the point where the manufacturer should expect criminal tampering? I don't think so, but the Tylenol cases are right on the cutting edge of the law.'' One Positive Result **********The new fears about tampering do have one positive effect.  According to Mr. McCrory, consumers have become more sensitive to signs of contamination. **********''One of our products has a seal with holes punched in it so that it can breathe,'' he said. ''After the Tylenol problems, people called in suspecting that the holes had been punched with a hypodermic needle. That kind of alertness is all to the good.'' **********Maybe so, but it can go too far. General Mills got a frightened call from a woman who had found a pill in a box of one of its cereals. It was only after the company representative arrived to investigate that she remembered she herself had dropped some pills into the box."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/14/business/cbt-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CBT CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/05/business/wurlitzer-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WURLITZER CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "WURLITZER CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/30/business/german-zinc-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Zinc Sale", "print_headline": "German Zinc Sale", "body_text": " **********Metallgesellschaft A.G. said it had agreed to sell 50 percent of its wholly owned zinc-producing subsidiary, Ruhr-Zink G.m.b.H., to an Australian company, Mim Holdings.

Then each line was attached to an old bit of advertising art work and the question asked again. **********And then each of the lines and each of the pieces of music were added to different bits of old commercial footage and retested, but this time in group sessions. Gallup & Robinson, the research company, followed up with day-after recall tests. **********There was also what Mr. Bergin called a test for ''the quality of communication.'' On top of all that there were 200 one-on-one consumer interviews that went on for two hours or more.  All this, said Mr. Bergin, whose other title is president, McCann-Erickson U.S.A., led to the final decision on ''Coke is it.'' **********Mr. Bergin said that those three little words reflect ''the product and w hat it is in the eyes of the consumer, t he mood of the company, aggressive management and bottlers,'' adding, ''The total marketing concept, a state of mind.'' **********Later, he said: ''It means something only as we shape it to mean something. Big taste. Refreshment.'' And that is worth reflecting on. Coke has spent millions of dollars over the years imprinting the image of its bottle in our minds. With the bottle and logo having insinuated itself into every corner of American life, all that the company has to do for it to benefit is find the key phrase with the right art and music. **********Coca-Cola, which spent $184.2 million for advertising all of its products in 1980, sank $37 million behind Coke itself, a drop of 11 percent from the previous year, according to Leading National Advertisers.

Changes Policy On Satellite Channels", "body_text": " **********In a change of policy, the Federal Communications Commission authorized the domestic satellite industry today to sell satellite channels as well as lease them. **********The decision, reached on a 6-to-1 vote, provides a satellite owner with an alternative to the requirement that all channels be leased on a first-come, first-served basis at rates set by the commission. **********The ruling is a victory for such concerns as Hughes Communications Inc., Western Union Telegraph, the Southern Pacific Communications Company and RCA American Communications Inc., all of which had requested authority to sell channels. **********Three Applications Approved **********As part of its new policy decision, the commission granted the specific applications of Hughes, Western Union and RCA to go ahead with already signed contracts covering the sale of channels on some of their satellites. In that sale, one channel sold for up to $14 million. Channel leasing brings in an average $100,000 a month. **********Under the agency's ruling, a concern that wants to build and launch a satellite must declare what type of service he intends to offer.  If he intends to provide service to any customer he can attract, he will continue to be classified as a so-called common carrier and must charge leasing rates that are approved by the F.C.C. **********If, however, the satellite builder decides there is only a limited number of potential customers with whom he wants to do business, he can escape the common carrier classification and sell a satellite channel, or transponder, at any rate he can negotiate. **********In no case, however, can the operator escape the requirement that he obtain F.C.C. permission to build and launch a satellite. The agency went out of its way today to stress it will review each satellite construction application individually, retaining the authority to reject an application for a communications satellite whose transponders are going to be sold if it thinks there is a shortage of channels for leasing. **********The agency's decision was described by several members as simply an acknowledgment that a competitive market is developing within the satellite industry for the sale of channels. **********The scarcity of channel space that has confronted customers for the last several years is being eased by the launch of new satellites, the F.C.C. said, and there is no reason to conclude that all satellite owners will want to sell channels as long as there continues to be a demand for leased channels. Those findings were challenged by Joseph R.

Several analysts, citing the recession, said they expected inflation to continue to slow this year. **********The seasonally adjusted June rise of 1 percent lifted the Producer Price Index for finished goods to a level only 3.5 percent higher than in June 1981, a comparison that Administration economists said was more meaningful than any one month's change from the preceding month. The index generally foreshadows price trends at the consumer level. **********The 1 percent figure was rounded off from an actual increase of 1.0104 percent, which results in a compound annual rate of 13.3 percent. **********Supporting the optimistic view that inflation will continue to slow were the modest changes in the indexes for prices of intermediate goods and for crude materials. For intermediate goods, such as flour, synthetic rubber and plumbing fixtures, the June rise was threetenths of 1 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.  For crude goods, such as green coffee, potash and iron ore, the index slipped by one-tenth of 1 percent, the eighth decline in 12 months. **********In the price index for finished goods, which are goods ready for sale by retailers, fuels rose by 4.1 percent and accounted for half the June rise, the report said. It noted that, because this component of the index comes in a month late, the prices used in the June index were for May, when a curtailment of crude oil production by Saudi Arabia and other exporters reversed some of the price declines of preceding months. **********Further increases in gasoline prices occurred in June, analysts said, and are likely to be reflected in the July index. But unless the renewed fighting between Iran and Iraq disrupts Persian Gulf production of crude oil, energy is unlikely to be an inflationary force in the second half of the year, Government officials said. **********The White House, going further, expressed hope for a resumption of the earlier downward trend. ''We're looking at world oil prices which have declined considerably in recent weeks so that out in the coming months we can probably see a decline in the cost of energy,'' said Larry Speakes, the deputy press secretary. **********Even with the June rise, wholesale energy prices remained 7.9 percent below the levels of a year earlier. Apart from energy, prices for other finished goods showed a rise of 4.9 percent for the 12 months. 1.9 Percent Rise for Cars **********Also pushing up the June index was a rise of 1.9 percent for new cars, compared with seven-tenths of 1 percent in May. John Steigmann, an economist at the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Mich., attributed the rise to the expiration of May rebates. ''May understated and June overstated'' what was happening to prices, he said. A new round of rebates took effect in July, Mr. Steigmann added, but they were smaller than the May concessions. **********More broadly, Mr. Steigmann said that the economy's ''core'' rate of inflation has declined to 6 percent and will fall further.  ''Inflation will continue to fall significantly, mainly reflecting the high and growing level of excess capacity,'' he added. **********Economists reckon that, with substantial idle factory capacity - the Federal Reserve reported today that factories were operating at only 69.8 percent of capacity - there is room for a post-recession recovery to occur without the rekindling of inflationary forces. **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reported that natural gas prices posted a substantial June rise of 2.9 percent, compared with 1.8 percent in May. However, these increases are unlikely to make much of a dent in consumer budgets until the next heating season. Coffee, Fruit and Eggs Up **********The index for foods ready for sale to consumers rose by fivetenths of 1 percent, a bit less than in May. Decreases occurred for roasted coffee, fresh fruits, eggs, pork and poultry. Prices rose for shortening and cooking oils, milled rice and flour-base mixes.  Moving up faster than in May were prices of beef and veal, fish, vegetables and refined sugar. **********Among other consumer goods, prices rose for boats, lawnmowers, tobacco products, leather footwear, toilet paper, household flatware and floor coverings. **********In the business equipment sector, prices rose by eight-tenths of 1 percent, the largest rise in eight months. Increases occurred for light trucks, farm machinery, office machines and other items. **********The index for finished goods stood at 279.9 for June on a 1967 base of 100. A bundle of goods that could have been purchased for $100 in 1967 would have cost $279.90 last month. For intermediate goods, the June index was 310. For crude materials, it was 325.7. **********The intermediate goods index was nine-tenths of 1 percent higher than a year ago.

But the size of the decline - just two-tenths of 1 percent from the April level - raised new hopes the recession may be easing. **********''The corner is here,'' declared Donald Straszheim, vice president of Wharton Econometrics. He asserted that industrial production is rising this month and will continue climbing ''for months to come.'' **********Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist, was more cautious. ''Apparently the recession continued in May,'' he said. But he characterized the May decline as ''kind of moderate,'' and added that an upturn is ''if not at hand, then close at hand.'' **********The small May decline reported by the Federal Reserve Board came after drops of eight-tenths of 1 percent in April from the March level and eight-tenths of 1 percent in March from the February level.  Consumer Durables Up 2.3% **********A surge in auto production pushed factory production of consumer durable goods up 2.3 percent from April, but output of business equipment fell 1.6 percent and production of basic metals fell seventenths of 1 percent. All consumer goods production rose eight-tenths of 1 percent after having risen by the same amount in April, the Federal Reserve said. **********In later economic data reported today, new car sales by the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the June 1-10 period, marking the fourth consecutive period of positive sales results.  (Page D3.) **********The overall decline in industrial production in May meant the factory utilization for the nation's manufacturers also dropped - probably under 71 percent of capacity for the first time during this recession, analysts said. That was still above the 69 percent low of the 1974-75 recession. Factory utilization figures are to be released Wednesday. **********For months, production has been held down as the nation's businesses sold off inventory rather than increase production to meet demand. During that period of inventory liquidation, production cutbacks contributed to an unemployment rate of 9.5 percent, the highest in 41 years. Inventory Liquidation Slowing **********But Government figures have shown the inventory liquidation slowing, a development reflected in the May industrial production figure. Nevertheless, Mr. Ortner cautioned that ''manufacturers still seem intent on cutting back inventories some more.'' But he added that ''if we get a sustained pickup in retail sales, then production can follow.'' **********Details of the Federal Reserve's May production report showed these developments: **********- Production of consumer durable goods - relatively expensive and long-lasting items - increased 2.3 percent, ''reflecting a sharp rise in automotive products and little change in home goods output.'' Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 5.6 million units, up about 10 percent from April. **********- Output of business equipment -mainly heavy machinery - ''was reduced 1.6 percent further in May, following cutbacks totaling more than 10 percent over the nine preceding months. Large declines occurred in May in output of building and mining and of manufacturing equipment. **********- Military equipment production rose six-tenths of 1 percent. **********- Output of construction supplies increased four-tenths of 1 percent after sharp declines in March and April.  Breaking down the overall figure, the report said that output of factory products dropped one-tenth of 1 percent in May while production of materials fell seven-tenths of 1 percent. Output declined one-tenth of 1 percent for manufacturing and 2.4 percent for mining. **********All of the figures were adjusted for normal seasonal variations.  At 140.3 percent of the 1967 average - a benchmark year used only for measuring future changes - the industrial production index was 8.8 percent below its July 1981 level."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/20/business/lifemark-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIFEMARK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "LIFEMARK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/29/business/jamesbury-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-9.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAMESBURY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 9", "print_headline": "JAMESBURY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 9", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/03/world/around-the-world-egypt-says-its-border-with-libya-is-still-closed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Egypt Says Its Border With Libya Is Still Closed", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Egypt Says Its Border With Libya Is Still Closed", "body_text": " **********Egypt said today that it would keep its border with Libya closed and that the crossing of the frontier Monday by 27 Egyptians and their families was an exception to the policy. **********''The facilities extended to 27 Egyptian teachers and their families that allowed them to cross the border are restricted to this group only due to their special circumstances,'' a Government spokesman said. **********''The measures which were previously in force will continue.'' **********The Libyan Government of Col.

It said the plan had a surprising resemblance to a 1979 book by Gen. Sir John Hackett of Britain and other NATO generals, called ''The Third World War,'' which it said spoke of plans for an insurrection in Poland. **********''In these plans, special roles were assigned in advance to people from the Confederation of Independent Poland, the Committee for Social Self-Defense, extremist Solidarity militants and some Zionist quarters bent on antagonizing Polish society,'' the paper said, listing Polish dissident groups. **********It said these forces wanted either to oust Communism and restore capitalism, or pave the way for ''Soviet military intervention in Poland regardless of the victims.'' **********This, the paper said, was part of American policy aimed at using Poland to antagonize the Soviet Union. ---- Trial of Walesa Ruled Out **********LONDON, Feb. 23 (AP) - Mieczyslaw Rakowski, a Polish Deputy Prime Minister, was quoted by The Times of London today as having said that Lech Walesa was in fine condition in a villa outside Warsaw and would not be brought to trial. **********Mr. Rakowski said that the Solidarity chairman might no longer be an effective union leader, that some leaders of the Roman Catholic Church were ''kind of tired'' of him, and that there were rumors that the church might dissociate itself from him. **********The church has been trying to mediate between the authorities and Solidarity and to defuse the tense situation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/19/business/investing-strategies-for-the-corporate-brass.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Bleakley", "pub_date": "1982-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRATEGIES FOR THE CORPORATE BRASS", "print_headline": "INVESTING; STRATEGIES FOR THE CORPORATE BRASS", "body_text": " **********AMERICA'S top business executives are delighted these days that the s tock market's burst of enthusiasm has added millions of dollars in v alue to their corporate pension funds and that it may not be long b efore they can float a new stock offering. **********But when it comes to their own personal portfolios, many of them are less eager to participate at present. That's because two of the largest firms that provide personal financial counseling to corporate brass are waving the flag of caution. **********At Heublein Inc. last Tuesday, for instance, Guy Palmer, senior vice president of the Ayco Corporation, told senior executives, including the president, Hicks Waldron, that if they still had any money in short-term debt they should keep it there. ''Normally, we don't get that cute with market timing,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''But the magnitude and speed of the rally in stocks and bonds tempered the enthusiasm I had this summer. I expect to pull back in the next few weeks.'' **********Another adviser to corporate chieftains who is bearish on the immediate outlook for stocks is Hamilton Gregg of the firm that bears his name in Falls Village, Conn. He is advising chairmen such as John Hall of Ashland Oil, James Ferguson of General Foods, Harry Gray of United Technologies and William Anderson of NCR. to keep two-thirds of their money invested primarily in medium-term Government bonds, except for isolated special situation stocks. ''Almost any buying panic sells off to where it started,'' he said, expecting that the current rally will soon do the same. **********Ayco and Hamilton Gregg & Company are among only a handful of firms that offer major corportions a complete package of personal financial planning services, including real estate, tax and fringe-benefit planning, for their top executives. Ayco is the largest, with about 1,800 clients at 60 companies, most of which, such as Eastman Kodak, Westinghouse, A.T.& T. and General Electric, are among the largest corporations in the country. Gregg counsels 300 executives at 25 major corporations and also manages money, through subsidiaries, for wealthy individuals and pension clients. **********Other firms in the executive counseling field are the United States Trust Company, which is conducting seminars for executives at seven major corporations such as Exxon and Cigna, the giant insurance company whose individual financial services division will broaden its base from small-business owners to Fortune 500 corporations in January. **********The biggest shift in investment strategy that the counselors have called for over the past year has affected their clients' life styles as much as it has their net worth. They have been making the point that in a disinflationary environment investments in real estate and collectibles are no longer likely, as they were in the 1970's, to out-perform stocks and bonds. Said Mr. Palmer, who runs Ayco's capital planning division in Stamford, Conn., ''Since February we have been urging our clients to avoid or sell tangibles which have been grossly overbid and put their money into intangible assets. You might enjoy walking on that oriental rug and looking at that antique Connecticut highboy piece of furniture. But that's the only reason to hold on to them.'' **********Similarly, Mr. Gregg has been telling his clients to sell the condominiums they bought for investments unless they also use them regularly for second or third homes. As he explains it, ''Two years ago, it didn't cost anything to borrow at 18 percent to buy a condo.  That was 9 percent after tax and real estate was appreciating at the then double-digit rate of inflation. Now, there's a real interest rate charge because of the continued high rates and much lower inflation rate.'' MUNICIPAL bonds, on the other hand, remain a favorite of the a dvisers for high tax bracket clients. But maturity preferences d iffer. Edward Guay, chief economist of Cigna, says declining rates a nd rising prices in long-term bonds offer the best opportunities fora nother six to 12 months. Frederick Taylor, senior vice president of U .S. Trust's Personal Investment department, prefers high-quality b onds of the five- to seven-year average maturity range. He also b elieves deep discount bonds, older bonds selling well below their o riginal issue prices, are appropriate for estate planning. That way a grandparent can leave the interest portion of a bond to a son or d aughter and the principal portion, with its strong price a ppreciation at maturity, to a grandchild. **********Mr. Palmer takes the middle road on bond maturities. He prefers the 8- to 12-year range because the risk of going out longer is not worth the benefit of slightly higher rates. For the present though, he is waving clients off new bond purchases until prices settle back a bit. **********Despite the hesitancy to add further to stock positions now, most of the advisers have been bullish since before the late-August rally began. Mr. Taylor is recommending reasonably aggressive investors to put 65 percent of their discretionary assets into stocks. Some of his favorites include Abbott Labs, Dow Jones & Company, Commerce Clearing House, Teradyne, General Instrument and Superior Oil. Mr. Palmer sees a rally coming soon in the stocks of emerging growth companies because ''that's where institutions like to be.'' He leaves stock selections to the money managers that his firm recommends. **********Mr. Gregg, however, does not expect a further upward surge in stocks until bond rates move down on a broad front. Meanwhile, he believes investment portfolios should be only one-third in stocks.  Those he likes include computer technology issues such as Verbatim and Mitel, and M.C.A., primarily because of its vast real estate holdings and motion picture library. **********But one might ask, are the executives listening to their advisers?  Mr. Taylor of U.S. Trust says that they are ''less inclined'' to hold cash and have become somewhat more aggressive in the stock market as he has been suggesting. But, he adds, he doesn't presume that such a high-powered group would follow his stock picks verbatin. **********In fact, he sees a parallel in the way executives are managing their corportions these days and how they are investing. In disinflationary times, he notes, they realize that they have to run their companies with tighter cost controls and rely less on raising prices. Similarly these executives want to own stocks that can grow in a slow-growth environment. ''If we suggest the stock of a technology company, our corporate clients like it only if they view it as a productivity enhancer,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Sometimes I wonder whether we or our customers come up with the better ideas. We have to listen to them as well.''  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Fred R.

Tied to Cost of Oil **********And the way the price has been calculated - by referring to the costs of crude oil - conflicts with United States Government policy.  Thus there is a feeling that Federal regulators might quash the new deal with Algeria. **********''You can be darn sure these imports are going to get some very close scrutiny at a time when large parts of the U.S. natural gas industry find it hard to absorb and market all the natural gas they're entitled to,'' said David J. Bardin, a Washington laywer and former Energy Department official. **********Last week, the Houston-based Panhandle Eastern Corporation announced that it would begin receiving liquefied gas from Algeria, with the first ship loading on Sept. 11. Contract Signed in 1975 **********Panhandle had signed its original contract with Sonatrach, Algeria's state oil and gas company, in 1975, when the United States was still mindful of the first oil embargo and determined to secure long-term supplies of substitutes. Counting on the gas shipments to begin in the autumn of 1981, Panhandle put $567 million into a terminal to reconvert the liquefied product to its gaseous state at Lake Charles, La., and another $80 million into a partnership owning two tankers. **********But Sonatrach did not deliver. The problem was price.  Algeria, whose gas reserves are among the world's largest, insisted on parity between oil and gas prices, based on their energy equivalents, and made its demands clear in April 1980. It suspended gas deliveries to its two major customers, France and the Houstonbased El Paso Company, which was the carrier for three pipeline systems in the eastern United States. At the time, Algeria accounted for 8 percent of gas consumption in France and 2 percent in the United States. **********The Carter Administration tried to mediate for the American companies, but El Paso ultimately wrote off $375 million in tankers and facilities. The three pipeline companies that El Paso served are still talking to the Algerians, but few analysts expect an agreement soon. 21 Percent Higher to French **********Last February, the French announced an agreement under which they would pay 21 percent more for the Algerian gas and buy larger quantities in exchange for stepped-up orders of machinery and goods from Algeria. **********Panhandle, saddled with its unproductive investment, took a tougher tack. In July, the company invoked a clause of its contract with Sonatrach and sought arbitration. The new agreement followed a month later. **********Under the agreement, Panhandle will seek permission from the Economic Regulatory Administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, both under the Department of Energy, to adjust prices quarterly and in relation to the official posted export prices of five foreign crude oils, instead of the market price of two refined oils. **********''They certainly came a long way,'' said a State Department official who asked not to be named, referring to the Algerians.  ''That escalator tied to crude had been their objective. They did not achieve their price parity, but under this market, they couldn't have.'' 'Backing Down' Seen **********However, John Treat, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a former Energy Department official, noted that the price would not be tied solely to Algeria's high quality crude, as originally demanded. ''That represents a backing down in Algeria's position,'' he said. **********Panhandle will begin buying gas from Sonatrach at $3.92 per million British thermal units - way below the $6.12 that would approximate in energy-equivalent terms the posted price of $35.50 a barrel for Algerian crude oil. Panhandle plans to buy 165 billion cubic feet a year for 20 years, less than half of what the El Paso group had contracted for. **********One other American company has also been importing Algerian gas: The Distrigas Corporation of Boston buys 43 billion cubic feet a year, and recently finished its first quadrennial contract review with Sonatrach. Distrigas would not disclose the details last week, but speculation is that the terms are similar to Panhandle's. **********And it is those terms - tying gas prices to crude prices - that has some analysts wondering whether the Government will approve.  ''They just don't like deals tied to crude oil because in effect you'd never have one fuel displacing another,'' said Edward L.  Morse, a Phillips Petroleum Company official formerly in the State Department. Approval Not Needed for Months **********Panhandle, acknowledging the possible objections, noted that it did not have to seek official approval for four to six months. It also expressed hope that the Algerians would continue deliveries and be open to further negotiation if the Government ultimately rejected the new terms. **********Of more immediate concern to some of Panhandle's 130 customers - utilities that resell 6 percent of the nation's natural gas to 3 million households and businesses in the Middle West - is the forthcoming price increase. By the time Panhandle transports and reconverts the gas, it will go into the company's two pipeline systems - subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval - at $7.18 per million British thermal units. **********The result will be a 10 percent to 40 percent increase in Panhandle's prices - and possibly a drop in the business for the utilities. With gas losing its price advantage over oil, many industrial users might make the easy switch back to oil. **********Even if the Energy Department sides with Panhandle, it could face trouble in court. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to which the Economic Regulatory Agency's decisions can be appealed, recently overturned a ruling that pipeline companies could raise prices to make up for increases imposed on the El Paso group. The court ruled that there was no need to use this specific gas, and the Government has not filed an appeal. **********Panhandle's main argument is that it is being farsighted. ''Our framework is 20 years,'' said Stanford A. Wallace, a company spokesman. ''There's no question that, right now, there's gas production to be bought in the U.S., but it's not a substitute for an assured long-term volume.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/08/business/dataspeed-radio-linkup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dataspeed Radio Linkup", "print_headline": "Dataspeed Radio Linkup", "body_text": " **********Dataspeed Inc. and National Public Radio have announced their intention to join in a nationwide portable information service. **********The new telecommunications service will use National Public Radio's satellite-linked network across the nation.

Meetings with each group of creditors are to be held during the next month. **********As a result, for the first time in more than two years, confidence is beginning to stir in the depressed Costa Rican economy. Recovery of traditional growth rates may not come before 1985 or 1986, but there is a widespread sense of relief in business circles that the Government is beginning to tackle the crisis. Currency Recovering **********When President Luis Alberto Monge took office last May, the country had suspended all repayment on its $3.1 billion public foreign debt, the highest per capita in the world, and its currency was falling.  But since then, some interest payments have resumed and the colon has steadily regained ground against the dollar. **********To achieve this and the I.M.F. agreement, however, the new Government has sharply raised electricity, gasoline, water and telephone rates and it has promised to cut spending, decree new taxes and increase domestic interest rates. This year, while inflation has exceeded 100 percent, economic activity has fallen by almost 6 percent. **********''The Government concluded that it had no choice,'' one foreign diplomat here said, ''but at least it has had the courage to go through with austerity. The question is whether it will keep a tight rein - and social peace - in 1983.'' **********Before it can plan resumption of economic growth, however, Costa Rica still faces the major hurdle of its debt renegotiation, not only with 12 governments but also with a 12-bank steering committee that represents 150 private creditors. **********Although Costa Rica is only one of many developing countries seriously affected by high oil prices and low commodity prices, its financial problems were aggravated when the administration of former President Rodrigo Carazo Odio twice refused to carry out the terms of an agreement with the I.M.F. Payments Suspended **********Instead, in August 1981, with its foreign exchange reserves exhausted, the Government suspended payment of both principal and interest on its foreign debt, and then left the problem to the Monge administration. **********Last June, the new administration's economic experts met with the 12-bank steering committee, which is headed by the Chase Manhattan Bank, and offered to resume ''symbolic'' interest payments as a sign of good will, with the understanding that renegotiation would follow an agreement with the I.M.F. **********Thus during the second half of this year, Costa Rica has repaid $41.5 million in interest. But arrears in interest have still risen to $260 million, and the country must cover an additional $355 million in interest and $115 million in amortization of debts to multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank, in 1983. **********At a meeting in Washington last Nov. 23, Costa Rican officials explained to the steering committee that they could put $470 million to debt servicing next year. Excluding repayment of any principal, however, there would still be a shortfall of some $260 million. **********Earlier in the year, Costa Rica had suggested that interest arrears be included in the general debt renegotiation, but this was rejected by the banks. At the recent Washington meeting, however, Costa Rica proposed that it would repay more than $470 million if exports or other foreign exchange earnings were higher than projected. **********In response, according to officials here, the banks said they would prefer to offer a ''revolving trade facility'' -similar to a plan used with Poland earlier this year - to cover half the interest arrears, although this would still leave a shortfall of some $130 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/24/business/nuclear-medical-systems-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NUCLEAR MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "NUCLEAR MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/28/business/advertising-breaking-magazines-rate-cards.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1982-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Breaking Magazines' Rate Cards", "print_headline": "Advertising; Breaking Magazines' Rate Cards", "body_text": " **********In an attempt to stay alive in a down economy, more and more magazines are ignoring their once-inviolate rate cards and are offering individual deals to advertisers, a top New York agency executive said here today at the closing session of the 1982 Magazine Publishers Association conference. **********Kenneth E. Caffrey, senior vice president and exective director of media operations for Ogilvy & Mather, had just stepped down from the dais where he had been one of a panel that had taken a look at the magazine business from the advertiser's perspective. He had urged that ''this assembled group come forward and end the practice now, before it spreads.'' **********He voiced his agency's concern that magazines, like broadcast, were becoming a negotiated medium.  ''No one wants to be an ex-publisher or advertising director, but there have to be editorial or tactical ways to attract business besides rate manipulation, for once it begins it's like a cancer,'' he said. **********Charges of magazines ''going off'' their advertising rate cards, or using creative interpretions of the same, are not new. But Mr.  Caffrey said the practice had never been as rampant as it is today.  The practice can be found not only throughout the magazine industry, but in every medium but newspapers, he said. **********At Ogilvy, Mr. Caffrey said, it is assumed that a magazine is basing its rates on the cost of doing business, plus a modest profit to bring in a reasonable return on investment. But by settling for less for a short-term gain, he said, publishers are penalizing the magazine's long-term development. So the publisher loses and the advertising community ultimately loses. **********Mr. Caffrey explained that although the agency opposed the practice, it must, as the client's adviser, take advantage of good offers and tell other clients about them. So the practice spreads. **********And, if the practice continues to grow, his agency will have to restructure its media department and put in a negotiating team for magazines as it has for broadcast, he said. **********His remarks obviously hit home, judging from the number of questions that followed. One questioner suggested agency culpability when he asked, ''Aren't the agency's television-oriented media departments the ones that initiate the rate breaking?'' **********Mr. Caffrey turned out to be well worth the effort it took to get him to this sunny island. He was full of good advice. Before he ever got to rate cards, he was warning publishers against inflated circulation rate bases that included large numbers of disinterested subscribers obtained at above-average cost. A cost, incidentally, that is passed on to the advertiser. **********''What I'm suggesting is that publishers large and small seriously review their rate base to eliminate the least desirable subscribers,'' he said. ''If necessary from an income basis, raise subscription prices and maintain or, if you must, raise cost-perthousand, but reduce the absolute out-of-pocket cost to advertisers. We need better readers, not just more.'' **********Mr. Caffrey's fellow panelists were Alvin Hampel, chairman/New York of D'Arcy-MacManus & Masius, and Philip J. Naquin, vice president/advertising for Chanel. **********Mr. Hampel, who came up on the creative side as a copywriter, discussed the difficulty that agencies are encountering in getting top people involved in print ads. He spoke of some agencies in Chicago, where he recently did time, in which print advertising was relegated to the position of supplementary advertising, or reminder advertising, keyed to TV commercials. **********He suggested that magazines try to get closer to the agency creative people who can frequently generate print advertising for an account when no one else working on it is thinking print. And, he wondered, what about working for a closer relationship between magazines, the editorial people and agency creative folks? Or even job exchanges between the two groups?

Fedders, the commission's chief enforcement official, will neither confirm nor deny the reports, he says that the agency is making considerable progress on this issue. **********Until recently, the Swiss have bristled at any attempts by foreigners to challenge their durable and highly lucrative ways of doing business. Perhaps most vexing to United States officials is the fact that insider trading - trading in stock to make a profit or limit losses on the basis of information not available to the public - is not illegal in Switzerland. **********But the bilateral talks and a spate of recent court decisions here and abroad appear to have pierced Switzerland's seemingly impregnable bank secrecy laws. **********Earlier this year, the Swiss finance ministry endorsed a proposal to make insider trading a criminal offense. If enacted into law, Swiss banks would be free under the terms of the Swiss-American Treaty on Criminal Matters to divulge information about clients being investigated by American regulatory authorities. The reason is that the treaty requires Swiss banks to surrender information when the activities being investigated would be illegal in both countries. **********''Our recent court victories, together with our negotiations with the Swiss authorities, have made the chances of getting caught using these accounts for illegal purposes much higher,'' says Barbara S.  Thomas, an S.E.C. commissioner. Fewer Interstate Bank Mergers **********Banking officials are taking a second look at the recently issued Federal Reserve guidelines for interstate bank mergers and are a great deal less enthusiastic about what they now see. **********In its ruling last month, the Federal Reserve indicated that the key issue is not ownership itself, but whether the acquiring bank could exert control over the bank being acquired. **********The Fed thus laid out guidelines to prevent that from happening, while allowing a bank holding company to acquire up to 4.9 percent of the voting shares and far larger proportions of nonvoting shares in out-of-state banks. **********Initial reaction from bank officials was favorable. ''We're ecstatic,'' said an official with the Chemical New York Corporation, the parent of Chemical Bank. Chemical plans to merge with Florida National Banks of Florida Inc., should interstate banking become legal. The Southeast Banking Corporation of Miami also wants to acquire Florida National. **********But industry analysts are no longer so sure that the ruling will lead to a flood of proposals for interstate mergers. A recent study by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., specialists in banking, said: ''The thrust of those guidelines, however, suggests to us that potential cross-border acquirers will proceed slowly, and with caution.'' **********The Fed's apparent tolerance of interstate agreements, Keefe said, ''has been sharply hedged by restrictions to avoid de facto control, thereby removing much of the incentive for those agreements in the first place.'' **********This view is shared by James Bell, general counsel of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, who said that the number of such new agreements that were expected to be announced have dropped substantially in recent weeks. **********''The large banks that were involved had more or less claimed that the Fed's guidelines constituted some sort of victory or blueprint as to how one should set about trying to have an interstate acquisition,'' Mr. Bell said. ''This has been, to put it rather mildly, somewhat of an overstatement on the part of these banks.'' Reporting to Shareholders **********It probably comes as no surprise to shareholders of R.J.

STOCK", "print_headline": "SELLING OPTIONS ON YOUR I.R.A. STOCK", "body_text": " **********SELLING options on stock in an Individual Retirement Account is b ecoming an increasingly popular strategy. To be sure, it's not for i nvestors who need every penny squirreled away in their I.R.A.'s or t hose who don't have stock in them. But for investors who understand t he strategy, some brokers say, it could help beef up an I.R.A.  p ortfolio's return while sheltering that income. **********Most brokerage houses now allow the use of options in I.R.A.'s.  Some, like Hutton, even allow the buying of options, even though most experts consider this dangerously speculative in an I.R.A. Other firms, such as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, only allow I.R.A. investors to sell (write) options on shares they hold in their I.R.A.'s. **********''We point out to our customers that it's a retirement account and the goal is to have that money there at retirement,'' said Don Underwood, vice president and manager of retirement plans at Merrill. The brokerage house would not allow ''the proverbial little old lady from Dubuque,'' who may need every penny she has in the I.R.A., to use options, even in a conservative option selling program, he added. It is unlikely, he said, that such an unsophisticated investor would spend the time needed in managing the account. **********An option is a contract that gives a person the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 100 shares of stock at a set price (strike price) during a limited period of time, not to exceed nine months.  The seller of the option - in other words, the owner of the stock - gets money (a premium) from the buyer of the option. That premium is the stockholder's to keep whether the option expires or is exercised. In normal option trading, the premium can substantially increase the return on a stock and its dividends, but is treated, for tax purposes, as short-term income. Sheltered within an I.R.A., however, that option income is untaxed until the I.R.A. is drawn against in retirement, when the taxpayer's bracket is presumably lower. **********Let's say that an investor has had an I.R.A. for five years, and now has $15,000 worth of stock in it. One of his positions is the XYZ Corporation, which is now selling for $28 a share, and it is a stock on which there are listed options. He could sell a three-month option on 100 of his XYZ shares at a $30 strike price, for a $2-a-share premium, or $200. A six-month option might bring $300 and a ninemonth option, $400. **********If the seller of the option opts for the six-month option, the $300 premium is his to keep, as are all the dividends given off by the stock during that period. If the stock is yielding 10 percent, that $300 will substantially increase the return on his shares. If the option is not exercised, he can sell another option against the same shares. **********Should the stock rise past 30, he will have to sell the shares at 30, and will get $3,000 on top of the $300 premium that he has already received. If the stock stays below 30, the first option will expire and another option may be written. If the stock falls dramatically, say to 23, at least the investor can write more options, if not for the $30 striking price, then for $25. **********Thus, for shareholders, options present the opportunity to increase income from a stock, and also provide a buffer when stock prices decline. That is why so-called covered writing is considered a conservative strategy by many brokers. It is called ''covered'' because the investor owns the stock, as opposed to very risky ''naked'' writing, where the investor sells options without even owning stock. **********Selling options, is ''less aggressive than buying stocks,'' said Robert Schulman, director of leveraged equity at E.F. Hutton. If stocks are an appropriate investment for an investor, then writing options is a conservative way to increase an I.R.A.'s return. But investors who shouldn't be in stocks at all, or only in other income-oriented issues, should@n't go out of their way to buy stocks just so they can write options. **********Option writing can also come in handy for an investor who is looking for a way to unload some ''dogs'' in an I.R.A. portfolio.  Because investors occasionally want to switch from one stock to another, but dread the thought of selling at a loss, an option can ease the pain. **********Option writing is not without risk. ''If an investor's I.R.A. funds are the last cent he has, then we won't allow it,'' Mr. Schulman said. And there is always the chance that an investor will forfeit participation in a stock rise. That possibility is what prompts many people to ''buy back'' the options they have sold against their stock when the shares appear to be rising.IN a volatile market, the temptation to chase stocks up by buying b ack options can be almost irresistible. Caution should be the w atchword, lest the original objective - increasing return - be f orgotten. **********Suppose, for example, that the XYZ Corporation headed up past 30 and gave every indication of going to 40 and beyond. An investor might be tempted to buy back the option he sold for $300 and take his chances on the stock. If the option can be bought back for less than the $300 the investor got originally, all well and good. But sometimes the going price of options is inflated by stock action, and the investor may have to buy back the option for a lot more money, and actually lose ground on the deal. If an investor does this regularly, he can actually reduce the return in his I.R.A. **********Mr. Schulman's advice: If there is enough cash in the account and the stock is ''fundamentally good,'' buy back the option. Again, the suitability of the stock for the investor's portfolio is crucial. If there is no free money in the I.R.A. to buy back the option, Mr.  Schulman recommends against doing it because that would mean selling off part of the I.R.A. position; investors cannot add money to their I.R.A. after the annual contribution. **********There are other dangers in writing options. Specialists and other big traders who pay minuscule, if any, commissions often exercise options just to get a stock by its record date - the date that gives them possession in time to get the dividends. While specialists and big institutions deal in thousands of anonymous shares - to them - that are matched by the option exchanges, your 100- or 200-share position could be among those option positions that are exercised.  You presumably won't lose any money on the deal, but if you were counting on the dividend yourself, it may affect your return and compromise a well-thought-out option writing plan. Your broker can find out what the chances are of your option being exercised. **********I.R.A. customers who write options should also realize that commission costs are relatively steep, often amounting to 10 percent of the option premium, and can mount up in an active program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/03/business/at-t-s-net-is-world-record.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 539, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T. & T.'S NET IS WORLD RECORD", "print_headline": "A.T. & T.'S NET IS WORLD RECORD", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company reported yesterday that its net income for the year rose 13.7 percent, to $6.89 billion, or $8.55 a share, the highest profit ever reported by any company in the world. **********The increase, almost twice the 7.2 percent improvement that the phone company registered in 1980, came to a large extent as a result of higher phone rates. **********The 1981 profits compare with $6.06 billion, or $8.17 a share, earned in 1980. These numbers were restated slightly to reflect an accounting change. **********Revenues for the year climbed 14.3 percent, to a record $58.2 billion from $50.9 billion. Without rate increases, the phone company said that its revenues would have risen by 8.6 percent. **********The numbers were no surprise to the financial community, since the company recently reported the results for its corporate fourth quarter - for the three months ended Nov. 30. A.T.& T. keeps its accounts on a calendar-year basis but reports quarterly earnings for three-month periods ending in February, May, August and November, so that shareholders can review the numbers when they get their dividend checks.

Last month, it settled the Government antitrust case against it by agreeing to divest itself over 18 months of its 22 local operating companies, which provide customers with basic phone service. The settlement is now being reviewed in Federal court, where it must be approved **********Commenting on the Bell S ystem's performance in 1981, Charles L.

In 1980, volume rose 7.8 percent. A number of analysts who follow the phone company, however, are optimistic that long-distance volume will do better this year.

Bell said that it added 2.1 million lines in 1981, down romm an increase of 2.5 million in 1980. **********However, it was a big year for the phone company in the regulatory arena. A.T.& T. said that it received rate increases during the year from state and Federal regulators totaling $4.2 billion, compared with $2 billion the previous year. The bulk of the awards came in state-approved rate increases - a total of $3.2 billion in 45 states. **********A.T.& T.'s board will be meeting in two weeks to consider whether to adjust the quarterly dividend. It was last raised in February 1980, by 8 percent, to $1.35 a share from $1.25.

The spokesman said Ethiopian soldiers were using mortar shells loaded with nerve gas.  According to Mr. Gebrehewet, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front believes that the Ethiopian Government stockpiles nerve gas. ''They have decided they cannot win with troops,'' he said. **********Eritrea is a former Italian colony joined to Ethiopia as an autonomous federation by the United Nations in 1952.

Regan, criticizing the Federal Reserve Board's management of the money supply, told Congress today that lower interest rates are essential to a strong economic recovery and to the success of President Reagan's economic policies. **********In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, Secretary Regan predicted that rates would ''gradually recede'' in 1982, but he indicated some uncertainty about this forecast by emphasizing the Administration's view that the Federal Reserve must avoid ''erratic'' or ''volatile'' money growth. **********Mr. Regan went beyond previous Administration suggestions to the Federal Reserve - which have caused some people at the central bank to feel that its prized independence was being publicly compromised - by saying that the Administration wanted money growth in 1982 ''in the upper one-third of the Federal Reserve's tentative'' target range. For the basic money supply, that range is 2 1/2 percent to 5 1/2 percent. **********Intensification of a Debate **********The Secretary's extended discussion of his view of the Fed's shortcomings came in his prepared statement, in colloquy with committee members and later at a White House news conference. It intensified an emerging debate, if not a quarrel, between the central bank and the Administration. This afternoon Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to the President, endorsed Secretary Regan's advice to the Fed. ''We would certainly be in agreement - that's where the Fed should be,'' he told a reporter. **********Only yesterday Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, emphasized before the same committee his view that the prospect of large Federal budget deficits has been a driving force behind high interest rates. He delivered a similar message Monday to the National Association of Home Builders. **********By contrast, Secretary Regan, joined last week by President Reagan, has tied high interest rates to the Federal Reserve's management of the money supply. The Secretary has been hammering at the Fed for what he described today as ''volatile money growth,'' meaning that the money supply does not expand at a steady pace throughout the year. Federal Reserve officials have said that a smooth path, as advocated by the Treasury, is virtually impossible to follow except, perhaps, at the cost of far more volatile swings in interest rates.  Such swings, the Fed argues, would inhibit business activity. Secretary Cites Statistics **********Secretary Regan declared that the money supply grew at a 13 percent annual rate in November and December following seven months of no growth, which in turn followed three months of growth at a 13.3 percent rate. **********''Such volatile money growth has very damaging effects on the economy,'' he said in his opening statement to the committee. ''It destroys the credibility of long-run monetary controls, adds to uncertainty and risk and thereby helps keep interest rates high as lenders seek to protect their principal.'' **********Democratic members of the committee peppere d the Secretary with questions that implied the flavor of the comi ng election-year debate. Representative Frederick W. Richmond of Brooklyn challenged Mr. Regan to support his prediction that an e conomic recovery would begin as early as the second quarter of 1982.  The Secreta r y cited the10 percent tax cut that will occur July 1. **********With respect to prospective budget deficits, the Secretary found himself on the defensive in light of President Reagan's rejection of the advice of the Secretary and other economic advisers that he seek excise tax increases to shrink the deficits. ''There is no evidence that huge deficits, as a percent of the gross national product, cause high interest rates,'' Mr. Regan said. Hopes of a Balanced Budget **********To Representative Chalmers P. Wylie, Republican of Ohio, who said, ''I'm a balanced-budget devotee,'' Mr. Regan replied: ''That is still the goal of the President. As a matter of fact, he'd like to go beyond that and actually have a surplus and pay down some of the national debt.'' **********The Secretary gave no indication when the White House thought a balanced budget might be achieved.  Mr. Regan, rejecting complaints that the three-stage tax cut sponsored by the President is responsible for the prospect of large deficits, said the basic cause was ''the sluggish econmic performance of 1980-81'' as well as the ''continued rapid growth of Government spending,'' which the Administration has been trying to retard. **********The Secretary argued that the Administration could not be blamed for the recession. He said the spending cuts and tax cuts were enacted after the recession had already begun last July. **********When an Ohio Republican, Representative Clarence J. Brown, asked about the feasibility of the fine-tuning urged by Mr. Regan, the Secretary prefaced his answer with a disclaimer of expertise. He was, he said, ''speaking as a practicing financier, not a theoretical economist,'' and so it might seem, he continued, that ''my advice is gratuitous.'' He went on to say of the Federal Reserve, ''I do think they can have more precise controls.'' He added, ''They don't seem to be able to be very precise about what they are doing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/31/business/briefs-053012.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** B.O.C.

Marietta is free to buy control of Bendix after midnight on Sept. 22. **********Some professionals said, nevertheless, that this could happen and that United Technologies might then try to take over both or, possibly, wait for a more propitious time and try again to arrange a friendly deal. **********The United Technologies chairman told Mr. Agee that his proposal would enable Marietta to remain an independent company. All three corporations have substantial aerospace operations, but Mr. Gray said that ''with the cooperation of all three companies, there would be no antitrust issues and the merger of Bendix and United Technologies would be completed in a short period of time.'' **********Bendix said it would have no comment, but Wall Street professionals said they felt that while United Technologies' latest proposal might apply considerable pressure on Bendix to accept, they did not expect Bendix's response to be favorable - unless Mr. Agee and Mr. Gray, both exceptionally strong personalities, could find a way to resolve their individual needs. **********One leading professional said that while he had no direct information, he reasoned that Mr. Gray, who will be 63 in November, could be so eager to land Bendix that he might be willing to make a deal with Mr. Agee, who is only 44, for the Bendix chief to become an important executive in United Technologies and possibly even its head once Mr. Gray stepped down. Bendix Employee Stock **********In a related development, Marietta sued Bendix and Citibank in Federal court in Manhattan, contending that Bendix, with Citibank's cooperation, deprived some 15,000 Bendix employees in a company stock plan of an opportunity to tender their stock to Marietta at $75 a share. **********Bendix had told employees, who own about 4.6 million shares or 23 percent of Bendix's shares outstanding, that they could not withdraw the stock from the plan until Sept. 30, too late to be sent to Marietta. **********Bendix subsequently revised the rules so that individual employees could ask Citibank, as trustee for the employee stock plan, to tender their shares. It then adopted an order for Citibank to withdraw the 4.6 million shares it had tendered last week and not tender them without instructions from individual shareholders. Citibank is understood to have agreed to comply. Bendix then asked its employees not to tender their shares. **********Citibank said yesterday, however, that it had not yet been asked to withdraw the shares and had not withdrawn them. John J. Maloney, a spokesman for the bank, said the procedure Bendix proposed called for Citibank to withdraw the shares from Marietta by the Sept. 22 withdrawal deadline unless instructed otherwise by individual employees. Effect on Tender Response **********Thus, Marietta's Sept. 10 announcement that it had received 14.5 million Bendix shares in response to its tender offer for 11.9 million became somewhat clouded. If Bendix succeeds in exempting 4.6 million, Marietta might have substantially fewer than it sought - unless, as expected, it has received additional shares in the last week that have not yet been announced. If Marietta succeeds in keeping the shares, it would have far more than it currently wants. **********The issue could become moot if Marietta withdrew its bid for Bendix in the event United Technologies' proposal is accepted. But as of now, those who have tendered to Marietta would be able to sell 100 percent of their Bendix stock to Marietta at $75 a share if Citibank withdrew employee tenders. That is because they were tendered before the Sept. 9 proration deadline, which guarantees purchase in cash of all shares submitted so long as the shares do not exceed the 50.3 percent of Bendix stock sought by Marietta. **********If employees are allowed to tender and Marietta thus receives more shares than it sought, all of those who tendered by the proration deadline would be assured of selling only part of their shares for cash. The balance would be returned to be swapped later for stock. New Proposal Worth $67.50 **********Pending a reply to United Technologies' proposal, Marietta and United kept open their almost parallel offers to pay $75 a share for 51 percent of Bendix. In a second step to come later, United would swap one share of its stock for each of Bendix's, a phase of its offer unchanged in its $85-a-share proposal. Marietta would swap $55 in securities for each remaining Bendix share. **********Withdrawal date under United Technologies' first offer is Sept. 28. Analysts, who valued the first offer at $62.50 a share, said yesterday's proposal was worth $67.50. They valued the Marietta offer at $65 a share, but many professionals said that Marietta's apparent inability to get as many shares as it wanted by deadline would mean that they would be able to sell all of their stock at $75 a share, more than they could sell to United at $85, should the offer be accepted. Antitrust Trade-Offs **********Mr. Gray's proposal that all three companies work together to resolve antitrust problems implied that United Technologies' previously reported agreement with Marietta would remain in effect: Marietta would pay $600 million in cash to United in exchange for specific properties of Bendix that would create antitrust problems for United, and it would also be sold other Bendix properties that the Department of Justice might insist upon as a condition for permitting United to take over Bendix. Negotiations between United and the Justice Department have been under way since United made its first offer on Sept. 8. **********Marietta, to lessen confusion, stressed that the United Technologies proposal did not affect the $75-a-share offers from United or itself and said that should Bendix and United agree to merge, arrangements would be made for shareholders who have tendered to Marietta to switch to United. **********Bendix advanced $2.50 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $59.75, in cautiously light trading. Marietta advanced 12 1/2 cents, to $35.625, while United Technologies fell 75 cents, to $49.25."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/30/business/massey-ferguson-sees-a-gloomy-1982.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MASSEY-FERGUSON SEES A GLOOMY 1982", "print_headline": "MASSEY-FERGUSON SEES A GLOOMY 1982", "body_text": " **********Shareholders of ail ing Massey-Ferguson Ltd.were told today to expect another bad year.

Despairing of finding other accommodations, he set fire to himself and died. **********Three elderly people inhabiting a dilapidated and condemned building in a Cairo slum died recently when the building collapsed from sheer fatigue. **********Some time ago, a man who had just moved into a jerry-built but new building on the road to the Pyramids went out to buy a newspaper.  When he returned the structure had disappeared and his wife and son were killed. The building had collapsed because the owner skimped on structural and engineering standards. **********These are three of the grimmer realities about Cairo's, and Egypt's, desperate need for housing, a need that prompts owners to add stories to old buildings, frequently without consultation on whether the foundations can bear the added burden. Families, Chickens and Goats **********It is also a need that has forced Egyptians, by the hundreds of thousands, to erect makeshift dwellings on rooftops. Frequently in slum areas these tiny shelters contain large families as well as chickens and goats. **********It is a need that has forced hundreds of thousands to live in sepulchers in the city's vast necropolis, the city of the dead.  Poor people live in lean-tos along the banks of the Nile. Some make their homes on oversized rowboats, some families of construction workers live in incomplete buildings only to have to relocate when the buildings, usually of the luxury class, are completed. **********Lack of housing, a concomitant problem of Egypt's extraordinarily high birth rate of one million every 10 months, is one of the major problems facing President Hosni Mubarak as he attempts to revamp and revitalize the country's faltering economy. **********There is evidence of new high-rise construction everywhere in Cairo.  There are tall buildings destined to be hotels or office towers or apartments for the upper middle class and the rich. The noise of pile drivers is a commonplace addition to the city's normal din. 'The Fastest-Growing Segment' **********But the vast majority of the new building is not destined for the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians living marginal existences.  According to data compiled by the economic section of the United States Embassy here, ''the construction industry is the fastest-growing segment of the Egyptian economy.'' But the builders say there is no profit margin in erecting low-cost housing. **********It is not just a problem affecting the country's lowest income sector.  Many middle-class families, civil servants, teachers and the like whose marginal salaries prompt many of them to take second jobs, are packed into dwellings passed on to them by their parents.  For this sector, there is a crying need for more space and scant chance of getting it because of the skyrocketing costs of rentals and cooperatives here. **********Although the construction industry may be one of the more solid parts of the shaky Egyptian economy, experts here estimate that only about 130,000 new units are built each year.  This figure is estimated to be a sixth of the actual need. A Surge in Population **********In recent years, the greater Cairo metropolitan area has experienced a tremendous surge in population.  The United States Embassy puts the figure at about 14 million for a city whose 1930-ish foundation was designed to handle about 2 million. **********The migration from the countryside, along with the soaring birth rate, has sorely taxed this foundation and thousands of buildings have been put up by outflanking the officials and with little concern for providing appropriate sewer and power systems. **********A major example is the road leading from downtown Cairo to the Pyramids. A few years ago, the area was a combination of desert and farmland. Today it is an unplanned warren of apartment dwellings and the road is clotted with traffic and scurrying pedestrians. **********A form of rent control exists in Cairo's older apartment buildings, some of them fine examples of Art Deco. A family who moved in 30 years ago may well pay the same rent it did on moving day. This, say landlords, is a disincentive to maintain the buildings and accounts for the fact that while an individual apartment may be a splendid airy abode, the hallway and the front may be crumbling to pieces and filthy. Calls for a Permit System **********The situation is dire enough so that some editorial writers here have called for some sort of permit system to limit the number of people who can settle in the country's two major metropolitan areas, Cairo and Alexandria. **********But so far no attempts have been made to do this and people continue to flock to both places.The rapid rate of construction, while still not fast enough to keep up with demands, has created another problem besides unplanned urban sprawl. The building boom has used up considerable amounts of Egypt's limited agricultural lands, a circumstance that further increases the nation's enormous dependence on foreign food imports.  Mr. Mubarak, like President Anwar el-Sadat, has called for greater selfsufficiency in producing Egypt's food requirements. But only 4 percent of the country, the land along the Nile, is arable. Parks and Villas Disappear **********The craving for dwellings has also been merciless on the oases of green that used to lend Cairo a certain grace. Many parks and villas with gardens and grounds have been replaced by high rises. There is much talk of land reclamation projects here - programs that combine the creation of new dwellings with the cultivation of desert lands. The few projects that do exist have been enormously expensive, and the Government's present fiscal state does not bode well for major new initiatives in the near future. **********One such project in the desert outside Cairo is called Salhiya, an ambitious private venture being erected with borrowed Government funds. **********The plan is to replace the sandy wastes with 50,000 acres of farmland, enough to provide food for 1.2 million people, according to the project director, Ismail Osman. **********Mr. Osman says Salhiya is destined to have a population of 100,000 some day. Buildings to house 6,000 families are nearly completed. A Reluctance to Forsake the City **********One of the problems facing the planners anxious to develop projects away from Cairo and the narrow overpopulated strip along the Nile has been a reluctance by Egyptians to forsake either the city or the ancient farmlands along the river. **********In places like the Kharga Oasis in the vast Western Desert bordering on Libya, large pools of underground water have been found. The area is remote and most Egyptians have never heard of it, much less seen it. Those who do live there raise bumper crops and have livestock and, in general, live a life that is more comfortable than the Cairene's. But efforts to spur a large migration to places like Kharga have met with little success. **********In a recent article in an issue of The Journal of Arab Affairs, written by Prof. Malcolm H. Kerr, an authority on Egypt, tried to assess the Cairo of the year 2000 based on what is - or is not - happening today. **********In a section related to housing, Professor Kerr wrote of ''a deepening gulf between a large, increasingly cosmopolitan and affluent business-based upper and upper-middle class, inhabiting a smart, new, well-paved cleaned-up downtown Cairo with a skyline of hotels and office skycrapers, and an ever-growing mass of underemployed and disaffected wretches inhabiting one of the world's largest slums, watched carefully by the police and the army.'' **********This sobering assessment is shared by others here as Mr. Mubarak's Government, faced with formidable obstacles blocking a stable economy, attempts to implement his pledge for a greater and more equitable distribution of the nation's resources."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/27/business/anderson-greenwood-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANDERSON GREENWOOD & CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "ANDERSON GREENWOOD & CO reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/02/business/key-rates-250112.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/21/business/gifford-hill-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GIFFORD-HILL & CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "GIFFORD-HILL & CO reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/13/world/around-the-world-british-rail-strikers-ignore-work-appeal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Rail Strikers Ignore Work Appeal", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; British Rail Strikers Ignore Work Appeal", "body_text": " **********Striking train engineers today ignored a final appeal by British Rail to return to work, forcing management to consider shutting the national network and dismissing the strikers. **********Only 718 of British Rail's 17,000 daily trains ran by noon today, the ninth day of the strike, which is costing the state-run railroad $14 million a day. **********''These figures are certainly not enough to justify keeping the network open next week,'' a British Rail spokesman said.

''It was either them or us,'' he said. **********As a man with a guitar and a song of lost love strolled past, Luisa Parra, whose family has owned the oyster stand for seven decades, heartily concurred. ''The Argentines are never satisfied with what they have - they always want another bite, another bite, another bite,'' she said. **********The exchange symbolizes the thinking of both leaders and citizens of this nation. They believe, first, that Argentina's action to take the Falklands from the British was part of a broader plan calling for a subsequent assault on Chile's Beagle Islands; the Falklands were attacked first only because stiff British resistance seemed doubtful. **********Second, Chileans are deeply worried that Argentina may still have violent designs on the Beagle Islands, a remote group of rocky islands populated by a handful of fishermen, sheepherders and kelpers, particularly if Buenos Aires emerges from defeat feeling humiliated and vengeful. 'Only the Beginning' **********''The situation is very dangerous,'' a well-placed Chilean Government official said. ''What happens after capitulation?'' Indications of an ominous answer are plentiful. After Argentine troops moved on the Falklands, President Leopoldo Galtieri gave an emotional midnight speech claiming, ''This is only the beginning of the reaffirmation of Argentina's right to assert territories.'' Chilean officials have no doubt about his implication. **********Moreover, Argentina over the past year has been regularly sending its ships into Chile's South Atlantic waters without asking permission, spurring Santiago to lodge two or three diplomatic protests a month, officials here say. Also, Buenos Aires in January renounced a treaty between the two countries requiring them to use peaceful means, such as arbitration, to settle disputes. **********This follows Argentina's refusal to abide by the results of binding arbitration of the territorial dispute five years ago and its decision thus far not to accept suggestions made by Pope John Paul II 18 months ago for solving the issue. Four years ago, the countries came close to war over the Beagles before the Pope stepped in to mediate. Refurbishing Argentina's Image **********Much will obviously depend on the nature of postwar Argentina. A Western political analyst suggests that while defeat might be ''a sobering experience'' for Buenos Aires, it will more likely result in ''a wounded Galtieri, a new Galtieri or a new Peron - none of whom are likely to be more rational or accommodating toward Chile.'' **********Accordingly, the expert predicts ''a wounded Argentina on the prowl for any opportunity to refurbish its image.'' A major consequence has been repetition by policy makers here of the hard-line policy toward Argentine attacks. Chile explicitly says that it will treat any aggression as complete war, and will retaliate by sea, ground and air anywhere along the country's 2,000-mile border, as well as anywhere else in Argentina. **********''That's the only deterrent we have -our willingness to go to total war,'' a Chilean Government analyst said. ''So, the cost to Argentina will be a very high one.'' **********The cost of war to Chile - currently mired in a severe recession - would also be huge. All three of Chiles's three neighbors, Argentina, Peru and Bolivia, harbor revanchist designs on Chilean land. Additionally, Peru and Argentina, which have been cooperating more and more closely as the Falklands war progressed, have bigger and more advanced armed forces, military experts say. Air Setback Temporary **********Moreover, Argentina's large loss of aircraft and pilots over the Falklands, while clearly advantageous for Santiago, is generally thought to be temporary. A particular nightmare in this fiercely anti-Communist country is that Argentina will turn to Moscow for aircraft and other weapons. Peru already possesses $1 billion in sophisticated Soviet arms acquired by the previous Government.Deepening the problem has been Washington's reluctance to move ahead with weapons sales to Santiago when it has banned such sales to rival Buenos Aires. **********Perhaps as a result, there is a marked reluctance to upset the Argentines. Government officials categorically deny reports that they are cooperating with London, or even that they have been asked to do so. Foreign intelligence officials tend to believe them, with the possible, but largely unsubstantiated, exception of the occasional passing on of military intelligence by telephone. **********''If Argentina had factual proof that this Government is helping the British, it would make life hell for years and years,'' a foreign expert pointed out. The sensitivity of the issue was apparent several weeks ago when a British Sky King helicopter crashed on Chilean territory, sparking widespread speculation that it was part of a commando operation aimed at Argentina's military bases on the mainland. **********London's rather facile explanation, made in the face of repeated reports in the British press that commandos had conducted raids on the Argentine mainland, that the helicopter was an errant intelligence aircraft was immediately accepted by embarrassed Chilean officials. Strict Neutrality Avowed **********Chile's avowed position on the war is one of strict neutrality, although officials concede they would have liked to be more pro-Argentine, particularly to avoid ostracism by the vast majority of South American nations, who favor Buenos Aires. Santiago has helped its neighbor in such humanitarian ways as providing a ship to rescue Argentine crewmen from the sunken cruiser Belgrano, and in such nonmilitary ways as providing access to its civilian ports. **********A widely circulated rumor here is that Santiago offered to support Buenos Aires totally if it would accept the Pope's mediation of the Beagles issue. **********The results of that mediation, announced in 1980, have been accepted by Chile, but virtually ignored by Argentina. The findings, widely known although not formally released, support Chile's right to the Beagles, as well as the channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific. **********Buenos Aires in the past several years has developed a new justification for its position, which it maintains is based on century-old treaties and understandings. In what has become an immensely tangled legal dispute, the Argentines have formulated a policy they call ''the bi-oceanic principle,'' under which they now contend they should be sovereign over all territory on the Atlantic side of the Strait of Magellan and Cape Horn, while Chile would maintain control over the Pacific side."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/world/indian-police-hold-3-leaders-of-opposition-political-group.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Indian Police Hold 3 Leaders Of Opposition Political Group", "print_headline": "Indian Police Hold 3 Leaders Of Opposition Political Group", "body_text": " **********The police today detained three senior officials of a political organization headed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's estranged daughter-in-law, Maneka Gandhi, the Press Trust of India news agency said. **********The three men were arrested in connection with the murder of a party worker six days ago and are being held for criminal conspiracy and the destruction of evidence, the agency reported."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/30/world/the-un-today-march-30-1982-security-council.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

CHIEF ACKNOWLEDGES FAILURE IN ATTEMPT TO WIN FALKLAND TRUCE", "body_text": " **********Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar acknowledged to the Security Council today that he had again failed to win a cease-fire between Argentina and Britain in the Falkland war. **********His report to the Security Council was his second admission of failure in 12 days. In his latest report, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he would continue his efforts, but he offered no sign of hope. **********''It is my considered judgment that the positions of the two parties do not offer the possibility of developing at this time terms for a cease-fire which would be mutually acceptable,'' the Secretary General said. ''I shall nevertheless maintain close contact with the parties in the event an opportunity can be found in which the exercise of my good offices can contribute to bringing this tragic crisis to an end.'' **********His effort last month came close to bridging the gap, but then, he said, both sides hardened their positions and the attempt failed.  That precipitated the British landing on East Falkland Island. **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar did not describe the positions of the two sides or what he had proposed. But it is known that he has been urging the British to slow their advance on Stanley, the islands' capital, enabling the Argentine troops to evacuate with their weapons. **********The British say Argentina has not responded to his proposal.  And in Washington, Reagan Administration officials, in an attempt to persuade Argentina to withdraw its troops at once, said there was no reason for Britain to accept a cease-fire until Argentina agreed to that condition. (Page A14.) **********In any event, it is unclear whether London would break off a final offensive. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has reportedly been told by military advisers that any slowdown in the advance could imperil the lives of British soldiers. U.N. Role Is Considered **********Diplomats here believe that diplomacy has been sidelined and must await the events on the ground. The prevailing view is that Britain will take Stanley in a few days. **********If this happens, or if Argentine resistance stiffens and the British become bogged down, the way would again be clear for diplomatic action. Mr. Perez de Cuellar has begun considering what role the United Nations can play in providing peacekeeping forces and administrators if Britain retakes the islands. **********After his peacemaking efforts collapsed last month, Mr. Perez de Cuellar was instructed by the Council to make another attempt. He agreed, but complained that the Council had given neither him nor the combatants guidelines specific enough to be useful. He predicted that, with the war in full swing, his task would be extremely difficult, a forecast that has proved correct. **********Enrique Ros, Argentina's Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, described the gap between the two sides to the Council this evening.  Argentina, its forces suffering from the British assault, wants an immediate cease-fire, Mr. Ros said. Then, he said, it proposes to negotiate a withdrawal by the forces of both sides. **********But Sir Anthony Parsons, the British delegate to the United Nations, has said that Britain would stop hostilities only when Argentina alone begins withdrawing its troops. Mr. Ros said the British had adhered to this stance in the private talks with the Secretary General and so Britain must ''bear the responsibiliy for continuation of the military action which is resulting in the loss of so many lives.'' **********Mr. Ros also confirmed the report Tuesday that Britain seeks to replace its troops with an international force that would include soldiers from the United States. The Argentine diplomat warned Washington that any such ''dangerous adventure'' would ''deepen the breach in the hemisphere.'' **********In London today, Prime Minister Thatcher said that Britain hoped ''to have a multinational force with us'' in the Falklands. ''You know,'' she added, ''when the Americans asked us to join them in a multinational force in Sinai, I said yes, because it helped peace in that area. And I'm sure we'd have just exactly the same response from them.'' **********After Mr. Ros's address, Spain and Panama promptly introduced a resolution tailored to Argentine needs. It calls on Britain and Argentina to establish an immediate cease-fire. **********Sir Anthony told the Council he would veto the document because it does not tie a cease-fire to the pullout of Argentine troops. The only resolution Britain could support, he said, is one that renews the Council's April 3 demand that Argentine forces leave and adds that ''watertight arrangements'' shall be made for their ''withdrawal with dignity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/12/business/briefs-214212.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Seating Co. said it had agreed to be acquired by Fuqua Industries, which already owns 39.8 percent of American's stock outstanding; American shareholders will receive 1.1 Fuqua common share for each American share. *********** Capitol Air announced that it would innaugurate the only service between New York and Aquadilla, Puerto Rico, on Dec. 15, for $169 each way. *********** Hart Schaffner & Marx said it had sold its J.P.

Though mired in the unprofitable color television market, Zenith is diversifying rapidly. The company is convincing fans that it will be important in some growing high-technology areas by the mid-1980's. **********That's the positive side of a story that has negative aspects today.  The situation is bad enough so that Zenith slipped into the red in the first quarter of 1982 -having failed to make its usual recession inroads against competitors in the color TV market. Zenith earned 82 cents a share in 1981 and is widely expected to earn 50 cents a share in all of 1982. **********Zenith still gets 62 percent of revenues from color television sets - down from 76 percent in 1978. Production costs, meantime, have risen steadily while prices have been essentially static since 1967.  In fact, some say profits on this key element of Zenith's business have dwindled to the vanishing point. William Nail, director of public relations for Zenith, says that is too strong but adds that profits are ''inadequate.'' **********For years Zenith has complained about Japanese competition. In 1971, the United States International Trade Commission ruled that Japanese companies had ''dumped'' their color television sets in the American market - selling them at substantially lower prices here than in Japan. **********Dumping penalties were set, but little has been collected, according to Mr. Nail. He added that Zenith was trying to prevent a settlement of 10 cents on the dollar on some $600 million in penalties. **********Regardless of the future of the market for color television sets, Zenith has moved forward in other markets and with impressive results. Last month, Zenith made its entry into the budding component television market. Component television offers high-fidelity stereo systems - a video version of radio systems made up of separate speakers, amplifiers and tuners. **********Many believe component television will be a $100 million market by the mid-1980's. One Zenith booster, an account executive at a leading brokerage firm with many clients in the shares, argues that component television will be less subject to discounting than are television sets. Customers for stereo systems use components to get better performance, he argues, and will thus pay more. Others do not agree. **********James Magid follows Zenith for L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin.  He stresses another aspect of components. Zenith's equipment - like that of the competition - will allow users to display computer data on separately mounted television screens. **********Mr. Magid said that the high point of Zenith's component television is the controller that manages input from a videotape recorder, personal computer, games, and so forth - ''a masterpiece of design.'' He is also impressed with Zenith's new Z100 microcomputer, which uses advanced microprocessors and offers more computing power than many competitors. The result, Mr. Magid added, is an impressive and flexible machine with color capability. One model in particular can store the equivalent of 1.000 single-spaced pages. **********Mr. Magid, who likes Zenith in the long term, is cool to Zenith's stock at present prices. In the last 12 months, it has traded as high as 20 1/2 but recently has fallen into the 11 range on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet patient investors may be rewarded through high-technology businesses, he said. He noted that Zenith's computer business had revenues of $71 million in 1981 and he looks for $120 million this year. **********Mr. Magid added that the company is a leader in ''addressable decoders'' that allow cable subscribers to add or drop services without a visit by service personnel, a formidable advantage over competitors. **********Like others, Mr. Magid discounts talk of a possible takeover."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/13/world/around-the-world-women-in-england-rally-against-missiles.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Women in England Rally Against Missiles", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Women in England Rally Against Missiles", "body_text": " **********Thousands of women linked arms today to form an unbroken nine-mile chain around a British air base to protest plans to site 96 cruise nuclear missiles there. **********The unused Greenham Common base being taken over by 1,300 United States servicemen has been chosen as the site for 96 of the 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles to be deployed in Western Europe by NATO starting in December 1983. **********In West Germany, thousands of antinuclear demonstrators held protest rallies throughout the country and blocked the gates of about 20 United States and Canadian military bases.

Judge Carl Rubin of United States District Court in Cincinnati is reviewing 11 class-action suits by Marathon stockholders, including the Dreyfus Fund, which controls 700,000 shares, seeking to block the meeting on the ground that the merger terms are too low. Whether Judge Rubin will hold up the meeting is still in doubt. **********Morgan Guaranty's Position **********The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, which holds some 1.3 million shares of Marathon for clients, has reached what it called a ''tentative conclusion'' to vote its shares against the merger. **********Sedco Inc., the big Texas oil services company, with some 2 million Marathon shares, has decided to vote its block of stock in favor of the merger. Other large stockholders are believed to include the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh, the Provident National Bank of Philadelphia and the National City Bank of Cleveland. **********For the last month, dissident holders, led by what is known as the Marathon Shareholders Committee, have staged a strong campaign to defeat the merger. It has already held information meetings for stockholders in Boston, New York, Fort Lauderdale, Houston and Los Angeles. **********Last night, in addition to a meet-ing in New York, where 25 shareholders gathered, the committee was scheduled to meet in Robinson, Ill., the site of a Marathon refinery. Today, it will meet in Cleveland and again tomorrow in Findlay. **********At the New York meeting, Frances A. Armstrong of Washington, D.C., who owns 200 shares and is acting chairman of the committee, said that it had received ''in excess of 100,000'' votes in opposition to the merger and that there was ''a high probability'' that the merger would proceed. **********As a result, she said, the committee was urging shareholders to vote against the merger or to abstain to qualify for appraisal rights for their stock if the merger is approved. Under complex Ohio law, shareholders who object to the terms of a merger can go to court to seek fair market value. **********Yolanda Collinson of Cliffside Park, N.J., who said she owned 133 Marathon shares, asked, ''If you wage this appraisal battle, how long will it take and if you do, what makes you think we'll be successful in getting more for our stock?'' **********Miss Armstrong, a Government lawyer, replied, ''While we can't promise success in the face of little success in the past in appraisal suits, we feel that the court has wide latitude in determining what fair cash value is and we think it's worth a shot.''  Fair Price at Issue **********At issue is whether the second half of U.S. Steel's controversial merger plan will give Marathon's stockholders a fair price for their shares. **********Last November, after the Mobil Corporation made a hostile offer to buy Marathon for $85 a share, Marathon's executives accepted a friendly deal offered by U.S. Steel to buy 51 percent of the company for $125 a share and the rest for 12 1/2 percent notes then valued at about $86 each. **********Viewed in its entirety, the offer was valued at $106 a share, more than double the $45 price of Marathon before takeover fever pushed it to $64 last fall and just before Mobil made its unwelcome bid of $85. In fact, $106 a share is what Marathon officers will get for their shares in the company, if the merger is approved. **********As a consequence, U.S. Steel's $125 price for the first half of the deal won overwhelming reception, so much so that to be fair to all of the stockholders wanting to sell, it accepted only about 56 of each 100 shares offered, returning the rest so that they could be swapped later for U.S. Steel's notes. Stronger Bond Market **********Before long, however, interest rates began rising and U.S. Steel's 12 1/2 percent notes plunged to about $75 each, prompting some stockholders to file suit. The bond market has strengthened somewhat in the meantime, however, and if it continues to improve, U.S.  Steel's notes, now valued about $78, may look more attractive.  Marathon stock pays only $2 a year in dividends while U.S. Steel's notes yield $12.50 annually in interest. **********U.S. Steel's offer to stockholders, Dreyfus charged in its suit, ''falsely represents that the terms of the merger are fair to the shareholders.'' It said, ''In truth, Marathon and U.S. Steel know full well that the value of the notes to be received by shareholders in exchange for each share of Marathon common stock is less than the true value of Marathon's stock and is grossly inadequate.'' **********Moreover, Dreyfus maintained, U.S. Steel's offer was ''false and misleading'' in calling the proposal fair because the basis for that assertion was in considering both parts of the offer as one when, according to Dreyfus, such was not the case. **********Nearly two weeks ago, David M. Roderick, chairman of U.S. Steel, said that the company ''will not alter the terms'' of its offer and warned that if the merger were defeated, U.S. Steel might go into the open market and buy enough additional Marathon stock to force a merger. 9 Million More Shares Needed **********U.S. Steel already owns 30 million shares, or 51 percent, of the stock, which it will vote for itself. It needs two-thirds of the 58.7 million shares outstanding to get approval to merge, or roughly 9 million additional shares. The opposition, however, needs some 17 million votes to deprive U.S. Steel of enough votes to win. **********Wall Street arbitragers, who control about 3 million shares, are expected to vote in favor of the deal, fearing that defeat could make Marathon shares plummet to somewhere near $50 a share. **********Stanley Schiff, senior vice president and chief arbitrager of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has a ''several-million-dollar position'' in Marathon, said he would vote for the merger and that those that do not ''will rue the day'' because the stock ''will sell considerably lower than now if the deal is defeated.'' **********If the meeting proceeds - unless the vote is overwhelmingly one way or the other on Thursday, a circumstance viewed as unlikely - Marathon's management is expected to adjourn the proceedings without announcing the outcome so that election inspectors can authenticate each ballot and eliminate duplicate votes. Fiduciary Responsibility **********Some investors may have a problem in deciding how to vote, particularly those with fiduciary responsibility on behalf of shareholders they represent. For example, Fayez Sarofim, president of the investment advisory firm bearing his name, had said in Houston earlier that he intended to vote an estimated $35 million position against the deal but did not return repeated telephone calls to confirm Wall Street reports that he had changed sides. **********With the merger vote only 48 hours away, Sedco has given no indication that it might change its vote but Morgan Guaranty said it was ''continuing to review'' its position. **********Indeed, with Marathon, U.S. Steel and a dissident stockholders' committee all soliciting votes for their case, a spot-check of some of the biggest Marathon stockholders showed that many were not expected to decide how to vote until just before 10 A.M. Thursday, when - unless the court decides otherwise - the meeting will convene. **********And, based on experience, many small stockholders have probably voted several times on both sides of the question. In such cases, the most recently dated vote is the one that counts. **********If the merger is eventually approved, as many Wall Street analysts expect, those who object to the terms can sue for better ones although the procedure is regarded as long and difficult. If the merger is defeated, as U.S. Steel reiterated in recent full-page ads, not only would it not improve the terms but it also might wait for the right time and then buy the stock it needs to force a merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/30/business/stock-group-trading-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Group Trading Plan", "print_headline": "Stock Group Trading Plan", "body_text": " **********The Midwest Stock Exchange said today that it had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to become the first exchange to trade industry stock groups as a unit. **********Kenneth Rosenblum, executive vice president and general counsel of the exchange, said exchange officials mailed the proposed rules change on Friday. **********The exchange's proposal would allow an investor to buy a unit consisting of stock of several companies in the same industry, such as computers, chemicals or oils. **********Mr. Rosenblum said the proposed trading was a ''companion'' to proposals made by options exchanges that they be allowed to trade in options on industry stock groups.

Such efforts have bemused British officials accustomed to a far more modest level of preparations, even for their sovereign. **********570 in Reagan Entourage **********The British leaders, who travel in small planes or in a motorcade of just a few cars, were astonished to learn that the Reagan entourage would include 4 large planes, 6 helicopters, 2 armored cars, 200 aides, 220 journalists and 150 Secret Service agents. **********The size of the entourage was eventually accepted but several White House requests were turned down by Buckingham Palace officials.  Efforts to include the President's food coordinators were rebuffed with the comment that if the castle kitchens were suitable for Queen Elizabeth, then they should be suitable for President Reagan, as one British official recounted the incident. **********At another point, American planners suggested that the President and the Queen be accompanied on their horseback ride in the private, 740-acre Windsor Home Park by other senior American officials and that the Queen and the President set off toward the camera positions. Buckingham Palace rebuffed both requests. Castle Built About 1070 **********In staying with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor, Mr. Reagan will be visiting what is among the monarchy's most venerable sites and a residence with far more history than its in-town counterpart, Buckingham Palace. The largest inhabited castle in the world, Windsor Castle itself covers about 24 acres, on a hill overlooking the River Thames. **********The original castle - a fortified earthwork surrounded by a moat - was probably built around 1070 but this structure was largely replaced and extended by later sovereigns. It was from Windsor Castle that Richard the LionHearted rode out to the Crusades and from Windsor that King John, his brother and successor, went to nearby Runnymede to sign Magna Carta in 1215. **********Outside, the castle presents an almost seamless medieval facade; inside, the rooms are a mixture of styles and periods that reflect the frequent alterations. While some parts, such as the Grand Staircase, continue a Gothic motif, others such as the Waterloo Chamber, the imposing banquet hall, have been imbued with gilded opulence. An Infatuation With Horses **********In the horseback riding as well as in the visit to Windsor, President Reagan will be participating in a royal tradition. Horses, and dogs, have always played a central role in the British royal family, much the way the animals are revered members of British society as a whole. **********Within the family of the current sovereign, the infatuation with horses is particularly prominent. In addition to riding for fun and on ceremonial occasions, the Queen owns horses that are raced and are entered in cross-country competitions, often by her daughter, Princess Anne. **********The Queen's husband, Prince Philip, played polo until about 10 years ago and now drives horses in competition. The son and heir, Prince Charles, has continued the polo tradition and is also an avid fox hunter. Only the Princess of Wales has an aversion to horses. **********The Queen and her family use Windsor Castle for weekends and they normally stay for all of April, as well as for a week in June at the time of the Royal Meeting at Ascot Race Course."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/23/world/soviet-builds-bridge-quickly-on-the-afghan-border.html": {"writer_name": "Theodore Shabad", "pub_date": "1982-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET BUILDS BRIDGE QUICKLY ON THE AFGHAN BORDER", "print_headline": "SOVIET BUILDS BRIDGE QUICKLY ON THE AFGHAN BORDER", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has strengthened supply lines to its forces in Afghanistan by rushing to completion the first rail and road bridge across the broad river separating the two countries. **********The bridge across the Amu Darya, opened to traffic after two and a half years of construction, eliminates a bottleneck in provisioning the approximately 90,000 Soviet troops operating with Afghan Government forces against Islamic insurgents. It will ease traffic especially to the forces stationed in eastern Afghanistan, including Kabul, the capital, and the Pakistani border zone. **********In the past, supplies had to be ferried with some difficulty across the Amu Darya, a rapidly flowing, sediment-laden river made treacherous by shifting channels. With its headstream, the Panj, the Amu Darya forms some 600 miles of the Soviet-Afghan border. **********The new bridge carries a single railroad track embedded in a twolane roadway so that motor traffic must wait when a train crosses.  The urgency of the bridge project was pointed up by President Babrak Karmal of Afghanistan, who presided over the inaugural ceremony on May 12 with Sharaf R. Rashidov, the chief of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan, one of the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics bordering on Afghanistan. Bridge Will Help Trade, Too **********Apparently alluding to the military aid from Moscow, Mr. Karmal said, ''The construction of the bridge and its completion a whole year ahead of schedule are a reflection of the genuinely internationalist policy of the Soviet state.'' **********Although military requirements were behind the project, the bridge will also speed the flow of Soviet-Afghan trade, which has tripled since the Communists seized power in Afghanistan in April 1978. The Soviet Union supplies the Afghans with industrial equipment, trucks and oil products, and receive, in addition to the pipeline transmission of natural gas, substantial cotton, wool, hides and raisins. **********The Soviet press, in contrast to its reticence about military activities in Afghanistan, has given wide publicity to the bridge.  Its length has not been disclosed but is believed to be close to a mile. **********Work started about the time the first Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan in December 1979. The Uzbekistan newspaper Pravda Vostoka of Tashkent, without mentioning the military intervention, said this month that construction began ''at the end of 1979.'' The Speed of Construction **********Under normal conditions, the paper said, it would have taken four and a half years to complete such a project. President Karmal's remark suggested that initial plans allotted three and a half years.  A second year was evidently saved in the actual construction. **********The bridge links the city of Termez, on the Soviet side of the river, with a new Afghan town whose name is given as Khairaton in the Soviet press and as Jeyretan on American maps. **********Termez, a railhead with a population of 60,000 and reputedly a place where some of the the highest summer temperatures in the Soviet Union are recorded, has become a key base for military operations in Afghanistan. **********Except for priority equipment airlifted directly to Kabul and other Soviet-held airfields in Afghanistan, much of the materiel destined for Soviet forces has been transferred from the railroad at Termez to barges and ferried either directly across to Khairaton or some 100 miles upstream to another river landing, at Shir Khan. From Shir Khan, a modern highway leads through the Soviet-built Salang Tunnel in the Hindu Kush mountain range to Kabul. **********The bridge enables the Soviet Union to deliver goods either by truck or by rail directly to the Khairaton terminal on the Afghan bank. **********A rail siding has been in operation for some years in northwest Afghanistan, at Turagundi, also spelled Towraghondi, just across the land border from the Soviet railhead of Kushka. Except for these two short extensions of the Soviet rail system, there are no railroads in Afghanistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/30/business/finance-briefs-065412.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Federal National Mortgage Association announced that it would sell $1.2 billion of new debentures on Wednesday - $800 million due in 1986 and $400 million due in 1989. *********** Fleming Cos. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an offering of 1.25 million common shares, through Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets Group. *********** General Motors Acceptance Corp. filed with the S.E.C. $325 million of deferred interest debentures, due in 2012, and $373.8 million of deferred interest debentures, due in 2014; the debentures will be exchanged for an unspecified amount of outstanding debentures held by Morgan Stanley & Co. *********** National Steel Corp.'s FN Financial Corp. subsidiary filed an offering of three million common shares, through First Boston Corp. *********** Philip Morris International Capital N.V. will issue in the Eurobond market 100 million Deutsche marks of 7 1/2 percent bearer bonds, due in 1990, at 99 1/2, through Dresdner Bank."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/business/hubbel-harvey-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HUBBEL, HARVEY, INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "HUBBEL, HARVEY, INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/04/business/equifax-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EQUIFAX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "EQUIFAX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/26/business/times-co-net-up-4-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 417, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIMES CO.

''The quarter's gains from operations were almost entirely offset by a decline in the equity in earnings of our associated forestproducts companies,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer. ''The decline in the equity earnings was due to several factors, among them sharply lower investment tax credits.'' **********Mr. Sulzberger said that the recession is affecting some areas of business - such as advertising in the newspaper group - and added that the company's rate of growth for the remainder of the year may continue to be slower than in the first half. **********''Nevertheless,'' he added, ''I am confident that 1982 will be our year of highest earnings.'' Gains Led by Newspaper Group **********The quarter's operating gains were led by the newspaper group, which consists of The New York Times and 18 newspapers in small cities in the Southeast. Increased advertising rates and circulation volume, coupled with lower costs, led to the group's $14 million operating profit for the quarter, a 48 percent gain from the same period last year. **********During the period, the company announced agreements in principle to acquire 12 more newspapers, including The Sarasota (Fla.) Herald Tribune, the largest acquisition. **********The magazine group's operating profit rose 22 percent in the third quarter, to $5.6 million, led by Golf Digest and Tennis.  The books, information and education group recorded an operating profit of $1.5 million for the quarter, against a loss of $325,000 in the same quarter last year, when costs were incurred in the reduction and change of operations at Arno Press. Arno's assets since have been sold. **********The broadcasting/cable television group showed a drop in operating profits, to $203,000 from $630,000 in the 1981 quarter. At the end of September, the company's cable television system in southern New Jersey had 95,000 basic subscribers, a gain of 20 percent from 79,000 in September 1981. **********For the six months ended Sept. 30, the company said, the average circulation of The New York Times was 905,700 copies weekdays and 1,498,900 copies Sundays, a gain of 18,500 copies and 37,200 copies, respectively, from the corresponding period of 1981."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/18/business/may-department-stores-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1982-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MAY DEPARTMENT STORES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "print_headline": "MAY DEPARTMENT STORES CO reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "body_text": ""}}
