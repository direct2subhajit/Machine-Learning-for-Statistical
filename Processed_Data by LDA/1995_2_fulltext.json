A plane was due today from Belgrade carrying Russian peacekeepers who will operate in the American zone, but it did not make it because they were not enough landing slots. **********Sliding down the back ramps from the bellies of the American planes were the  supplies -- including one pallet of bottled water and another of rations -- and  equipment that will allow the Americans to begin establishing their base here. Two of the first four planes also delivered two more American network crews and  other journalists, who appear to continue to outnumber the American troops here. **********Some 150 American soldiers made it today, including 60 paratroopers. They will provide security for the airfield, which has been secured by United Nations forces for the last year. **********It is still not clear when the American troops will deploy along the confrontation line, where they are to keep the peace. **********\"I honestly don't know,\" Brig. Gen. Stanley F. Cherrie, commander of the American base here, said in a brief meeting with reporters at the airfield. Much about the American operation is as hard to penetrate as the fog. The United Nations is scheduled to turn over command of this sector to the Americans on Wednesday. **********American commanders said that while they were behind schedule, it was not a matter of great concern. **********\"There is no reason to rush,\" said Col. Bob Gaylord. \"We're being deliberate.\" He added that the increase in the number of troops would be \"gradual.\" **********General Cherrie said he had attended a meeting today between Gen. Hagrup Haukland of Norway, the commander of the United Nations peacekeepers here, and local commanders of the Bosnian Serb Army, the Bosnian Croat Army and the Bosnian Government Army. **********He described their attitude as \"genuinely agreeable\" and said they would allow the Americans to send reconnaissance patrols along the routes the Americans are to use in entering Bosnia. The routes pass through the Posavina corridor, which has been bitterly contested by the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Government, and where both still have forces. **********General Cherrie said nothing further about the meeting. **********He said that the deployment of American troops along the confrontation line was \"on schedule,\" but he did not say what that schedule was. **********Other officers said that no date had been set for when the American troops would actually be deployed beyond the air base, where they are confined at the moment, not even being allowed to venture into Tuzla. But they said it would probably not be for at least a week. **********American officers have not yet begun the preparatory meeting with officials in the towns and villages where the Americans will deploy. **********British troops, who are based in Gornji Vakuf, roughly 80 miles southwest of  here, have already begun establishing outposts in contested areas and will begin a major deployment to the confrontation line on Wednesday. **********Colonel Gaylord declined to comment on why the British had been able to move  more rapidly. **********The British have one distinct advantage in that most of their troops were in  country well before the Dayton agreement, either as members of the United Nations peacekeeping force or of the rapid reaction force. In recent days, they  have been repainting their white United Nations vehicles camouflage green. **********And the British have relied on land and sea, more than air, to bring in additional troops along with heavy weapons and equipment. **********Much of the heavy American equipment is to come into Bosnia over a pontoon bridge that American engineers are erecting across the Sava River, which divides Croatia from northern Bosnia, at a point about 30 miles north of Tuzla. **********The bridge should be ready within 10 days, American officers said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/22/world/bagamoyo-journal-an-arts-school-in-search-of-a-soul.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1995-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bagamoyo Journal;An Arts School in Search of a Soul", "print_headline": "Bagamoyo Journal;An Arts School in Search of a Soul", "body_text": " **********Music class here is in the shade of a tree just a stone's throw from the Indian Ocean. The dozen students sit on cement blocks, rocks or rusty chairs, playing their cowhide drums and wooden marimbas. **********In a building nearby, three men practice handstands and dance steps undisturbed by a couple playing the guitar and rehearsing the same song over and over. In the thatched-roof theater, mime students perform for their teacher. **********Only 10 students a year are accepted to the three-year program at the School of Art at Bagamoyo, one of the few national art schools in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the few of those devoted expressly to preserving traditional cultures. **********The 30 full-time students who study here, many without previous artistic training, take courses in traditional music, dance, theater and acrobatics, as well as costume design, lighting, English and Swahili. **********\"Our country is so big that the aim of being here is to learn something about our other traditions,\" said Joyce Hagu, 27, a student here who is a teacher from the northeastern coastal region. **********In many ways, the school is the legacy of two decades of socialism and a Government policy aimed at overcoming ethnic divisions and creating a shared sense of national identity. The dance and art studied here reflect Tanzania's 120 ethnic groups and many languages. **********After graduation, many students want to return to their home regions to perform or teach. But now, like Tanzania itself, which has just held its first multiparty elections, the school is trying to redefine its role and cope financially in a post-socialist state. **********Until a couple of years ago, the school's graduates were employed by the Government as performers, but now they are struggling to find jobs on their own, sometimes in cultural offices or as members of their own performance groups in a country where traditional music, as opposed to modern Zairian or Western, is difficult to market to local audiences. **********\"If a nation does not have a cultural identity, it is a nation without a spirit,\" said Penina Mlama, professor of theater and art and the chief academic  officer at the University of Dar es Salaam. \"Bagamoyo is very unique. In Africa  you have the problem that artists don't have schools for practical training.\" **********\"Now, more than ever before, it is important to assert Tanzanian identity,\" Professor Mlama said. \"We need to come up with deliberate policies or we will end up as a nation all over the place. At the moment, I don't see a cultural direction.\" **********The school was founded in 1981 at this fishing hamlet about 80 miles north of the capital, Dar es Salaam. Bagamoyo -- the name in Swahili means \"lay down your heart\" -- was infamous as the assembly point on the east African mainland for slaves before they were shipped to the slave market in Zanzibar. **********Even before independence from Britain in 1961, traditional art was used for political mobilization by nationalist groups. By 1967, specific policies were adopted by the new socialist Government to use art as political propaganda and to suppress ethnic differences. **********The School of Art was founded as a training ground for a national performance troupe, Professor Mlama said. Its mission soon expanded to include the promotion of Tanzanian culture by preparing teachers in the arts. **********But Government policies to advance a national culture, like the institution of Swahili as a national language, have also had the effect of effacing many indigenous traditions, said Rashid Masimbi, the Bagamoyo school's founder and principal. Students sent away to boarding schools for their secondary education  are cut off from their local ways. **********\"Fifty percent of the students when they come cannot seriously sing us a song from home or dance a dance,\" Mr. Rashid said. \"Our philosophy is that we'd like  to develop a performance more suited to our own people. Everything we learn is based on what it is like in our own traditions. But we then develop and bring it into the present tense.\" **********But the future for the school and for these young men and women is uncertain  at best. In the past, the Government paid 90 percent of the roughly $400 annual  tuition fee. But the new Government -- the governing party's presidential candidate, Benjamim Mkapa, is to be sworn in on Nov. 23 -- is inheriting empty coffers. **********This year, all the school's graduates have had to market themselves. Some have given up performing and taken ministry office jobs. As for theater, music and dance groups others form, they spring up for a few months in Dar es Salaam and then go broke and disappear, Professor Mlama said. **********But the students at Bagamoyo say the future does not intimidate them. At a music class continually interrupted by laughter and teasing, they rehearsed a southern coastal song of celebration and then picked a particular rhythm and began to improvise. **********\"This makes me feel so joyful,\" said Victor Mutalemwa, 26, who expects to return to primary school teaching after graduation. \"Here we learn music from all our traditions. We learn we are all the same -- we are all Tanzanians.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/11/business/pc-makers-are-focusing-on-finetuning-the-sound.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-11", "snippet": "The personal computer, which is swiftly evolving into an all-purpose home entertainment and work center, has lagged behind in a sound-technology backwater.

While you can listen to National Public Radio on the Internet or slide Beethoven into your CD-ROM player, the sound wafting from the PC has the crackly ring of grandpa's radio -- the one he retired to the attic long ago. **********But this \"incredible magnet\" of tasks and entertainment -- as Robert W. Stearns, vice president of technology and corporate development at the Compaq Computer Corporation, called the PC -- might finally be ready to deliver sound quality on a par with its number-crunching skills. Compaq, the Hewlett-Packard Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and other PC manufacturers are making an aggressive effort to refine PC sound. **********The main obstacle, said Tommy Freadman, a loudspeaker designer, has been sound cards designed by digital whizzes who do not know how to refine the signal once the digital stream has been converted into the analog sound that you hear. **********Another problem, added Mr. Stearns at Compaq, is overtaxed microprocessors. \"There is a tremendous amount of processing going on for full-motion video and high-quality sound,\" he said. **********A conventional high-fidelity system threads a digital signal through a CD player's digital-to-analog converter then to an amplifier and then the loudspeakers. In a PC, the digital-audio signal from a floppy disk, CD-ROM or Internet site passes through a sound card containing a digital-to-analog converter and amplifier. **********While some PC sources offer potentially excellent sound, radio on the World Wide Web is still fairly primitive. The amounts of data are too much for a microprocessor to handle smoothly and quickly. **********Manufacturers have been trying to find a cost-effective solution. Shifting the sonic burden from the microprocessor to a dedicated chip, for example, could produce excellent results but the cost of the chip and the added storage capacity would drive up the basic price of the PC. **********Manufacturers feared that consumers would balk at the built-in cost of better sound. The solution seemed to be in add-ons. **********Pentium processors operating at 75 megahertz and faster have opened the door  for better PC sound through a relatively new technology -- wave-table synthesis. It has been sold in computer sound cards for about a year and is coming in supplemental software. **********The wave-table is a bank of digitally synthesized musical sounds, for example, from a violin, trumpet or guitar. These stored sounds are drawn on and  blended, either by the musical instrument digital interface system, or M.I.D.I., used in computer sound cards or by a new generation of dedicated chips. **********\"The quality of sound you can get through the wave-table is astonishing,\" said Gerald W. Tschetter, an assistant general manager at the Yamaha Corporation of America, a unit of the Yamaha Corporation. \"For a few hundred dollars' worth  of add-ons, you can do things on your PC now that 10 years ago musicians in the  best studios in the world could not have done.\" **********Hewlett-Packard used the wave-table in its new Pavilion series of PC's, featuring loudspeakers from Altec Lansing Technologies, a unit of Mark IV Industries. **********\"In many ways, audio quality has become one of the more important aspects of  PC's in the home,\" said Webb McKinney, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's home products division. **********Consumer expectations for PC sound are likely to rise when the CD-size digital video disk, capable of holding an entire movie with spectacular audio, comes to market in late 1996 or early '97. **********While the sound available from PC program sources has improved, the mediocrity of sound cards must be addressed on two fronts: the quality of the digital-to-analog converter and the quality of the power amplifier. **********Mr. Tschetter at Yamaha said that the modest amplifiers built into sound cards were never expected to meet the demands of hi-fi quality loudspeakers and  the converted analog signal should be fed to an amplifier outside the PC. **********\"In most instances,\" said Mr. Tschetter, \"the amplifier provided in a sound card is the same used for the headphone output of a cassette deck; its power output amounts to a fraction of a watt.\" He said computer sound needs only 5 to  10 watts. **********Other engineers contended that the sound card had the potential to carry the  full load. **********Peter Theran, senior manager for multimedia products at the Bose Corporation, said, \"The reality is that PC companies haven't invested in putting high-quality sound in PC's. **********\"We've steadily improved sound in PC's, but it's still nowhere near on a par  with the average stereo system. For PC manufacturers, it's really a twofold investment -- the necessary electronics and the additional space required to accommodate them. The computer would have to be made larger.\" **********In its Pavilion Series, Hewlett-Packard provided for both options. Although amplifiers were installed in the Pavilion sound cards, HP recommended routing the unamplified signal from the sound card directly to hefty amplifiers, which are mounted on speakers provided with its 14- and 15-inch monitors. **********Tommy Freadman, chief engineer at Altec Lansing and designer of the H-P speakers, was one of the first engineers from the audio hi-fi world to examine the experience of listening to PC sound. He insisted the only thing that has held back computer audio is price. **********\"Everybody is driving the cost down,\" Mr. Freadman said. \"Everybody is trying to hit a very aggressive price point on the same Intel microprocessor. It's all  about packaging Intel and Microsoft. But we can create better audio.\" **********The price of the hardware to do so, he estimated, could be as low as $150; his ACS500 surround-speaker array, billed by Altec Lansing as the multimedia equivalent of the Dolby Surround sound in movie theaters, costs $450."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/09/business/worldbusiness/IHT-make-crisis-an-opportunity-taiwans-bank-chief-says.html": {"writer_name": "Kevin Murphy", "pub_date": "1995-08-09", "snippet": "As Taiwan's financial markets stabilized after an embarrassing week of instability, its central bank chief said the country should abandon its lax approach to regulation and require banks to have deposit insurance..Defending his efforts to stem a ...", "word_count": 3217, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Make Crisis an 'Opportunity,' Taiwan's Bank Chief Says", "print_headline": "Make Crisis an 'Opportunity,' Taiwan's Bank Chief Says", "body_text": " **********As Taiwan's financial markets stabilized after an embarrassing week of instability, its central bank chief said the country should abandon its lax approach to regulation and require banks to have deposit insurance. **********Defending his efforts to stem a bank run and rescue a finance company wounded by a 10 billion Taiwan dollar ($371.2 million) fraud, Sheu Yuan- dong said the two events would strengthen the hand of those who sought to clean up one of Asia's largest and most volatile financial markets. **********While Taiwan's government has made internationalization of its wealthy but isolated financial markets a priority, various constituencies disagree on the pace and breadth of change. **********Debates about liberalization often bring divergent responses from the central bank, the Finance Ministry, the Securities and Exchange Commission and legislators who have traditionally benefited from a cozy relationship between politicians and individual banks. **********\"This crisis, we can turn it into an opportunity,\" Mr. Sheu said Tuesday as the Central Bank of China injected 71.43 billion dollars into the banking system, the largest amount it had provided in five years. **********\"We can recheck, we can review, we can improve our system before this market becomes more internationalized and more liberalized,\" he said. **********Fewer than half of Taiwan's savings institutions have insurance, although several moved to join the national plan after customers withdrew almost 8 billion dollars from Fourth Credit Cooperative of Changhua last week and the run spread to eight other credit unions. **********\"I would like to force them all to join,\" Mr. Sheu said, \"and I keep asking those government-owned banks also to join the insurance scheme even though they are government-owned and there is no problem.

But as others gathered here to mourn the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, neither President Hosni Mubarak nor King Hussein saw reason any longer to stay away. **********For Mr. Mubarak, it was his first journey to Jerusalem ever. In the 14 years since he took office after the assassination of Mr. Sadat, Mr. Mubarak had upset Israeli officials by refusing many invitations to follow his predecessor's example and make a visit. **********For King Hussein, it was his first return in 28 years to a city whose eastern half he once governed. **********Wearing a red-and-white checked headdress and a look of deep sorrow, the Jordanian King made plain his own amazement at the spectacle as he stood beside  Mr. Rabin's coffin and declared that \"never in all my thoughts did it occur to me that my first visit to Jerusalem\" would come on such an occasion. **********\"He had courage, he had vision and he had a commitment to peace,\" King Hussein declared of Mr. Rabin. **********\"As long as I live, I'll be proud to have known him, to have worked with him, as a brother and as a friend and as a man, and the relationship of friendship that we had is something unique and I'm proud of that.\" **********The King and the Egyptian President joined their fellow world leaders here with deceptive nonchalance, although their words and demeanor made clear that they remain divided about how fast and far to go now in pursuit of a wider peace. King Hussein spoke with obvious emotion and at some length; Mr. Mubarak spoke more briefly and in guarded diplomatic language. **********Still, it was clear that the death of Mr. Rabin had jarred some old thinking. After shunning Israel since taking office, Mr. Mubarak said this morning that the strides toward peace that Mr. Rabin had taken meant that he had a duty to pay his final respects. **********\"He defied the prejudices of the past to tackle the most complicated of problems,\" Mr. Mubarak said in a eulogy of his own. \"These achievements have undoubtedly established him as a true hero of peace.\" **********In a pageant that would have been unthinkable when Mr. Rabin took office just three years ago, King Hussein and Mr. Mubarak were joined here by white-robed Government ministers from Oman and Qatar, their presence marking the first visit to Israel by any delegation from a Persian Gulf country. **********Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali of Morocco and members of the Palestinian Authority also attended the funeral at Mount Herzl cemetery, the burial place of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, which lies just a few miles away from one of Islam's holiest sites, Al Aksa Mosque. **********And even after a succession of White House ceremonies that has made joint gatherings of Arab and Israeli officials appear commonplace, today's gathering was remarked upon with wonder by ordinary Israelis. They recognized the fact that two Arab heads of state were finally standing in Jerusalem represented the  breaching of a formidable barrier. **********As Egypt's Vice President in 1978, Mr. Mubarak visited the Israeli town of Beersheeba with Mr. Sadat, but he did not accompany the Egyptian leader on his historic trip to Jerusalem that year. **********Mr. Mubarak sought first to mend the deep ruptures caused by his predecessor's decision to break with the rest of the Arab world and sign the Camp David accords. More recently he has appeared to hesitate about reaching out toward Israel because of opposition by Muslim militants who are waging a guerrilla war against his Government, in part because of their opposition to any peace with the Jewish state. **********But as the former Egyptian Air Force pilot took his place at the podium today, he spoke with unhesitating praise for Mr. Rabin, saying that the loss of  the Israeli leader had dealt \"a severe blow\" to efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace. **********\"Only through our unwavering commitment to this objective can we truly honor  the memory of this fallen hero of peace,\" Mr. Mubarak said. \"And I could say that the best memorial for Yitzhak Rabin is to continue what he started, which is the peace process.\" **********The joint appearance, however, left little doubt that King Hussein and Mr. Mubarak, whose Governments have been sniping at one another for months, still hold different views about the path ahead. **********King Hussein, whose Government reached peace with Israel just a year ago, spoke today as an unabashed champion of seizing the moment, urging others \"to come out openly\" on behalf of peace. **********\"This is where we stand,\" he said. \"This is our camp. Maybe God will bless you with the realization that you must join it, and we pray that you will, but otherwise we are not ashamed.\" **********By contrast, Mr. Mubarak, whose Government has criticized Jordan for being too quick to seize the benefits of peace, spoke in language that was careful and businesslike. He told reporters that he did not regard the trip as an official visit with political significance. **********And while King Hussein spoke with pride about his grandfather, King Abdullah, who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951 by Muslim extremists, Mr. Mubarak made no mention of Mr. Sadat. **********King Hussein's grandfather had made contacts with Israel in search of peace beginning soon after the 1948 war. The young Crown Prince was standing at his grandfather's side when Abdullah was slain in the Old City of Jerusalem, near Al Aksa Mosque. **********While the two countries have now reached separate peace accords with Israel,  the Jordanian King and the Egyptian President are still bound by what remains unanswered about the fate of Jerusalem and its Islamic holy sites. These include Al Aksa Mosque, to which Muslims around the world insist upon free access. **********The issues of Jersusalem and the custodianship of its holy sites are now scheduled to be taken up as part of the final settlement talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization beginning next spring. But the differences in manner that the two leaders displayed today reflected in part the debate about what should happen between now and then. **********King Hussein, who appears eager to persuade the West that he is the most reliable of Israel's former foes, has shown less and less regard for the sensibilities of other Arab countries, particularly Syria, whose absence today served as a reminder that a central element of the peace process remains unsettled. **********\"Let us not keep silent,\" the King said this afternoon. \"Let our voices rise  high to speak of our commitment of peace for all times to come.\" **********But Mr. Mubarak, while playing a behind-the-scenes role in brokering the latest accord between Israel and the P.L.O., has been more muted about urging swift action on others.  Mr. Mubarak has reached out to Syria in recent months as part of an effort to strengthen an old bond, and Egyptian officials have suggested that issues surrounding Jerusalem can be settled only as part of a final peace between Israel and all of its former foes. **********The Egyptian President must also still contend with Muslim militants at home, and his attempt today to play down the momentousness of his visit appeared aimed in part at a domestic audience. **********But if King Hussein was greeted in Jerusalem by Israeli officials today as if he were a member of the family, Mr. Mubarak also found an enthusiastic welcome. **********After the Egyptian President found himself in the rear at the final ceremony  at which Mr. Rabin was laid to rest, he was quickly escorted forward. In deference to Jewish tradition, which requires men to cover their heads at religious ceremonies, Mr. Mubarak returned the courtesy by donning a blue baseball cap given to him by Israeli officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/your-money/IHT-briefcase-central-asia-vehicle-aimsto-be-home-by-christmas.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-09", "snippet": "Investment house John Govett & Co. in London is marketing the Second Central Asian Investment Co., a closed-end fund investing in the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union and in Siberia.

But now Schwab is knocking heads with bruisers like American Express, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, and these rivals possess strengths that Schwab's current competition does not, from huge research staffs to access to public offerings to other lures for the advisers and clients using Schwab. **********This is the first time,\" said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston consultant, \"that Schwab has faced players of this magnitude.\" Merrill Lynch alone is four times Schwab's size. **********The baring of knuckles comes from several corners. For one, nobody gets as big as Schwab has without jostling someone formidable. \"The history of the business is you can always get a share\" of the market, said A. Michael Lipper, who heads his own research firm. But \"when you start impinging on others, the artillery starts coming out.\" Many industry developments -- such as the slow retreat from commissions to fee-based pay -- have also put Schwab in closer contention with others on Wall Street. **********Then there's Mr. Schwab's grand plan to grow. He already has 3.3 million clients with a collective $170 billion in assets, and took in $1.1 billion in revenue in 1994. But within 10 years he wants 10 million clients with a total of $1 trillion -- a feat that would require annual compounded growth of 20 percent. **********To get there, he has a variety of projects. He has begun to establish a service that refers his customers to independent financial advisers. He plans to get into the business of helping small companies set up and run 401(k) retirement plans for their employees. He expects to go further into managing other people's money by creating more Schwab mutual funds and maybe even gobbling up a mutual fund family. **********But to make all or even some of these moves means stepping on some big toes. **********Mr. Schwab, who is 58, is unflappably confident, however. \"We're beautifully  positioned\" for the future of financial services, he said, and he has lots of fellow optimists.  Schwab \"is doing very, very well,\" said Guy Moszkowski, a principal at Sanford C. Bernstein, the investment research firm. **********Customers of Schwab and investors in its stock, which has risen from $2 in 1990 to a close on Friday of $24.875, may still want to size up the budding rivalry seriously before taking the bulls at their word. When you go toe-to-toe  with titans, the outcome is never clear. **********To be fair, Mr. Schwab sure knows how to grow. Since he started the company in 1971, the San Francisco company has become the country's largest discount brokerage. Schwab has also captured about $47 billion in mutual fund assets, about half through its Onesource program, which allows investors to buy nearly 400 no-load mutual funds without a transaction fee. And the firm has roughly $30 billion parked in its own money market funds. **********Typically, the growth has rested on great insight. Take the Onesource strategy. \"Schwab redefined the landscape in the fund industry\" with that program, said Michael McCaffery, the president and chief executive of Robertson  Stephens & Company. In it, investors can buy funds from many fund families with  a single telephone call and get a single shareholder statement. The participating no-load funds, like Robertson Stephens, pay Schwab a part of their assets and give access to their shareholders' names in return for Schwab's distribution muscle. **********BUT the success of Onesource is now sparking imitation. True, Fidelity, which is already the nation's second-largest discount broker, started its own \"fund marketplace\" several years ago. But the list of competitors from all parts of Wall Street has now expanded greatly, endangering Schwab's lock on the business. Mutual funds like T. Rowe Price and Vanguard now peddle their own versions of Onesource, and brokerages like Waterhouse Securities and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette are moving in the same direction. Because investors seeking advice also want more investment choices, companies like American Express have expanded the  number of funds they offer, too, and Prudential, Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney  are examining the idea. **********Many of the fund families feel they have no choice. While some are content to let as much as half of their assets sit at Schwab, where they lose all touch with shareholders, others see the handwriting on the wall. Twentieth Century Mutual Funds is thinking about starting a fund marketplace sometime soon. \"I don't know how to avoid it,\" said W. Gordon Snyder, an executive vice president  there. The group has also resolved to have no more than 5 percent of its assets  in Onesource. **********And Fidelity has recently redoubled its efforts to build up its funds marketplace -- with some success.  Some fund families may have been wary of joining a competitor's program, but more than 200 have now hooked up with Fidelity. **********Schwab is also being pursued -- especially by the industry's big guns -- in the small but fast-growing slice of the market occupied by advisers who get paid a fee for their investment counsel. Of the $1.3 trillion in assets controlled by investment advisers who charge either by fee or by commission, as much as a quarter has been captured by the fee-paid ones, according to Mr. Cerulli. **********As with Onesource, Schwab got into this field early and smart, providing back-office and other services for advisers who now number 4,000 and bring in a  third of Schwab's assets. \"Schwab really beat the industry to the punch by offering many services that these advisers like,\" James Gately, a senior vice president at Vanguard, conceded. **********But again, success has spawned wannabes. Fidelity once took advisers for granted, but is now busy wooing them and is making headway. \"We're finally getting some respect,\" said Peggy Ruhlin, whose investment advisory firm in Columbus, Ohio, has about $200 million under management. \"When we used to try to get duplicate statements, they laughed in our faces.\" **********Fidelity acknowledges its new ardor. \"In any company, you can't do everything at once,\" said Roger Servison, a managing director.  \"Now we're turning our attention to the fee-only investment adviser.\" **********Mr. Schwab respects Fidelity's efforts. \"They are probably our best competitor,\" he said, citing the private company's freedom from shareholder pressures. **********But other courtiers are knocking on advisers' doors too, not only because the market will grow but also because the booming use of Schwab by advisers poses for them a particularly grave threat. These firms are huge and they offer stock  research and other capabilities very important to investment advisers. Morgan Stanley, for example, is seriously looking into the business, and while a spokesman for Goldman Sachs refuses to comment, some investment advisers say that brokerage firm has approached them about the same thing. **********Mr. Schwab doesn't think Goldman or Morgan will take the plunge and compete directly with his firm for these advisers. \"I don't know if it's a natural for them,\" he said, noting that it is hard to make money in this area and that the firms have high costs. But the attraction may be too strong to pass up. **********EITHER way, Mr. Schwab is not standing still. To strengthen Schwab's ties to  its advisers and to capture some of their fees, his firm has begun to refer to an adviser any customer with at least $100,000 to invest. **********The strategy is not without risks. By making the referral Schwab is implicitly standing behind the advisers' quality, and for that reason it imposes quality controls: referred advisers must have at least five years' experience, manage at least $10 million in assets and have a clear regulatory record. But Schwab makes no guarantees, and unhappy investors may still blame the firm. **********But retaliation by rivals may be the far bigger threat. Putting Goldman and Morgan Stanley aside, for example, American Express, another traditional investment advisory firm, has taken big swipes at Schwab. For an annual fee of a half-percent to 1.5 percent of assets, American Express advisers will select a portfolio of funds for investors. And the company is slowly expanding its fund offerings to include non-American Express funds, Mr. Lennick, an executive vice  president, said. The company is also beginning to market its services to its card members. **********As with Goldman and Morgan, Mr. Schwab plays down any competitive threat. \"They've awakened a large number of card members to the whole financial-services thing,\" Mr. Schwab said about the American Express moves. \"It expands the market for all of us.\" **********If Mr. Schwab is unwilling to acknowledge the power of the competition, he has at least apparent agreement from John Steffens, an executive vice president  of Merrill Lynch.  \"I frankly don't think we compete with Charles Schwab,\" Mr. Steffens said. But his firm is close to deciding to expand its Asset Power program in a way that sure sounds like a threat to Schwab's advisers: Investors  would pay a flat annual fee, possibly lower than the current 1.5 percent of assets, for advice and an investment menu that will include no-load mutual funds. **********Mr. Schwab's grand plan goes beyond alliances with advisers. He is bringing Schwab more into asset management, too -- and thus far beyond the middleman and  distributor roles that made Schwab a household name. He recently added three asset-allocation funds to the other proprietary funds he introduced five years ago, for example, and may add more mutual funds. He has also considered buying a mutual fund company, including the $5 billion Dimensional Fund Advisors. And he  is thinking about devising a fund of funds, in which Schwab would select a group of high-performing funds available through Onesource and offer them in one fund. **********Such ambitions can strain the loyalty of Schwab's advisers, who use its services precisely because it has no ties to in-house products. \"Then they'd be  like Fidelity, but less attractive, with less of a track record,\" said Jane King, an adviser in Boston. **********But the ambitions also jangle the nerves of fund groups. When Schwab hatches  or buys new funds, or picks a handful of promising ones for a fund of funds, it  is no longer just a middleman. It's a player. And that means greater suspicion and competition from the funds -- including those signed up for Onesource. **********Undeterred by these implications, Schwab also plans a push into the 401(k) market, where it will also compete directly with the fund companies and its affiliated advisers. Having made no headway in the market to serve large companies -- an area Fidelity dominates -- Schwab is aiming at the small outfits with as few as 10 employees -- for now. \"It's going to be a major thrust for the company in 1996 and 1997,\" Mr. Schwab said. The firm has already bought a company that develops recordkeeping software for the 401(k) market, and is interested in making more such acquisitions. **********To top it off, the financial-services industry is converging in many ways, and that means more rivals for Schwab -- whether or not it has grand plans. **********Consider the move by brokerage firms away from paying brokers on commissions. Mr. Steffens of Merrill Lynch, for example, expects that as much as 30 percent of Merrill Lynch's assets will be managed on a fee basis within 10 years, compared with just 6 percent today. That trend softens the distinction between fee-only investment advisers and brokers. **********FOR Schwab's advisers, many of whom have entered the business within the last five years, this is very bad news. After all, Merrill Lynch alone has 12,500 brokers, and Schwab's network of advisers must compete directly with them and others from large institutions. For Schwab it is bad news, too, because these advisers now account for a third of the firm's assets, up from 17 percent four years ago. Add some of Wall Street's other ventures into the advice trade -- Smith Barney plans to market its sizable research department, which already studies 800 money managers, for instance -- and things can look pretty grim. **********But Mr. Schwab never seems to sweat over any of this. \"I was sort of wonderfully surprised that Merrill Lynch recognized the good value on behalf of  its customers of no-load funds,\" he said in a typical remark. \"That will be much more competition for the world.\" **********Some people seem nervous, though, including Mr. Schwab's own troops. \"We can  play it safe and grow 10 to 12 pecent a year. We can't grow 20 percent if we play it safe,\" acknowledged David Pottruck, Schwab's president and chief operating officer. \"I worry sometimes, frankly. Can we, all of us, keep up with  the pace of change? There feels like there's no let-up, there's no end to the campaign.\" **********And there isn't, at least for Mr. Schwab."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/08/your-money/IHT-vacation-insurance-read-the-fine-print.html": {"writer_name": "Digby Larner", "pub_date": "1995-07-08", "snippet": "ANSWERING the call of nature is not what most holiday insurers call a high risk activity.

But on a skiing vacation earlier this yearone woman thought it easiest to slip behind a small hut on the piste. **********It was at this unguarded moment, with her one-piece ski outfitrolled around her boots, that her skis began to slide.The resulting descent took her backwards past an astonished ski class and into a tree several hundred meters downhill. **********\"She was badly concussed,\" said the insurer who dealt with her medical bill.\"Luckily she was insured for that.What we couldn't help with was her emotional trauma and loss of social standing.\" **********With the holiday season now in full swing, insurers are gearing up once more for a rush of claims that last year included anything from lost false teeth to attacks by enraged hippopotami. **********While industry practitioners say that most claims are relatively mundane, usually for lost property valued at less than $200, the main reason vacationers buy insurance is to cover themselves for medical treatment, insurers say. **********\"People are aware of how easy it is to run up huge medical bills if they become sick or have an accident abroad,\" said Ian Frater, a spokesman for the Travellers Insurance Association in London. But he is surprised at how little interestvacationers take in the type of policies they buy. **********\"I'd guess that more than 90 percent of policyholders have no idea what they are covered for,\" he said.\"They simply buy whatever their travel agent offers them without even reading through the policy document.\" **********One serious problem is the risk of being injured doing something specifically excluded by the policy.Dangerous sports such as hang-gliding or rock climbing are rarely included in basic travel insurance policies. **********Those planning to take part in all but the most sedate of sports should read their policies carefully to see if they are covered.If not, and provided the sport is not too outlandish, it's usually possible to have it included by paying an extra premium.Those who only decide to take part in a risky activity while they are away should telephone their insurer to find out if it is insured. **********Not all exclusions are as obvious as those for dangerous sports.Few insurers readily pay out for medical treatment as a consequence of alcohol or drug abuse, for example.Being ill or injured after an evening's overindulgence in the bar could result in a claim being turned down. **********There are many travel insurers worldwide, and the terms and cost of cover between policies are broadly similar.Typical cover includes high levels of emergency medical insurance of around $3 million and personal liability cover of about $1 million.Added to this is a range of cover forcancellations, delayed departures and personal goods amounting to several thousand dollars. **********The level of premium depends on where you are going, how long you plan to stay and where you live.For those living in Europe, the United States is one of the more expensive destinations, costing, on average, from around $50 for five days to $150 or more for a month. For Europeans traveling to neighboring countries that have reciprocal health plans or relatively low medical costs, premiums range from around $25 for five days to about $50 for a month. Despite agreements between European Union to recognize each other's health-care arrangements, \"about half the premium cost is for health cover,\" Mr. Frater said. **********HE added that apart from the fact that few insurers are prepared to separate their policies in that way, having private health care is often the best option. For U.S. citizens traveling abroad the picture is less clear.Some occupational health schemes include medical and repatriation expenses for those vacationing abroad.Before buying a separate policy, therefore, it's worth finding out from your employer whether you are already covered. **********Travel agents are the biggest sellers vacation insurance.Credit- and charge-card holders cansometimes take advantage of plans run by their card company, though this usually is a matter of convenience rather than cost, according to Carol Barnes, speaking for American Express in London. **********\"The real benefit for card holders is that we already have all their details on file,\" she said.\"All they have to do is phone us and we can arrange cover immediately and debit the payment.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/worldbusiness/IHT-banks-decry-gap-between-emu-and-actual-use-of.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "European bankers and industrialists increasingly fear that governments lack the political will to create a single currency by the end of the decade, despite signs that most European Union countries will be able to meet the economic criteria for do...", "word_count": 3449, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banks Decry Gap Between EMU and Actual Use of Money : A New Single-Currency Showdown", "print_headline": "Banks Decry Gap Between EMU and Actual Use of Money : A New Single-Currency Showdown", "body_text": " **********European bankers and industrialists increasingly fear that governments lack the political will to create a single currency by the end of the decade, despite signs that most European Union countries will be able to meet the economic criteria for doing so. **********The fear has been generated by planned delays between the beginning of monetary union, which is expected on Jan. 1, 1999, and the actual use of the new single currency by governments, banks and consumers. **********The delays, said the business and financial sectors, would hamper their ability to plan ahead, fan suspicion that governments may actually abandon the idea of a single currency and encourage speculation after exchange rates were fixed. **********But central bankers and finance ministers have defended the delays as necessary to mint new notes and coins and to allow banks and vending-machine operators to invest in new equipment and procedures. **********The biggest fears center on Germany and its willingness to give up the Deutsche mark, the powerful symbol of its postwar economic success. **********\"It's a political problem dressed up as a technical problem,\" said Graham Bishop, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London and a member of a private-sector panel that has urged a fast switch to a single currency. \"The German political class has not got to grips with the problem of telling their people what they've committed themselves to do.\" **********German reticence has surfaced in advance of the publication on Wednesday of the European Commission's blueprint for adopting a single currency. **********Draft versions of the paper suggested that it could take as long as five years after monetary union for a European central bank to get notes and coins in the new currency into circulation, according to officials who have seen the draft. **********To prevent such a delay from undermining the credibility of the single currency, the draft cited a need to quickly develop a critical mass of financial transactions in the new currency.

Perry and Secretary of State Warren Christopher left open the possibility that the mission could be longer. **********Asked on the NBC news program \"Meet the Press\" whether he could guarantee that the United States would stay in Bosnia only a year, Mr. Perry said: \"Not at this time. Certainly not until we see the peace agreement.\" **********Mr. Perry also acknowledged that the United States would not know its precise mission in Bosnia until a peace agreement is completed. \"We don't know in full detail what we're going to be asked to do,\" he said. \"And so, until we get that, we cannot commit to that one year.\" **********By contrast, when Senator Dirk Kempthorne, an Idaho Republican, asked Mr. Perry in a hearing last Tuesday for assurances that under no circumstances American troops would be in Bosnia for more than a year, Mr. Perry replied, \"I cannot conceive of the circumstances which would motivate me to come back and ask an extention of that time.\" **********Mr. Christopher, appearing today on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation,\" also declined to set one year as the fixed deadline for the American troop withdrawal. **********\"We're using a year as the approximate date,\" Mr. Christopher said. \"I think  a year is a solid estimate as to the amount of time that our military forces would be there.\" **********Asked what would happen if a year came and went and peace among the warring parties was still not certain, Mr. Christopher replied, \"We don't expect that to happen.\" **********As was the case with Mr. Perry, Mr. Christopher's remarks today contrasted with a more solid commitment he made at a Senate hearing last week. Asked then by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat, whether American troops \"will be out of there in one year,\" Mr. Christopher replied: \"The answer to that is yes.  But it is because we believe that that's an appropriate period of time, a reasonable period of time for them to have accomplished the necessary steps.\" **********President Clinton has pledged to send troops as part of a NATO-led force to guarantee an eventual peace in Bosnia. As early as May 1993, Mr. Christopher set the four criteria that must be met before American troops entered Bosnia: the goals must be clear and understandable to the American people; the chances for success must be high; the American people must support the effort, and an \"exit  strategy\" for getting out quickly must exist from the start. **********In launching its campaign last week to persuade Congress and the American people of the need to send troops to Bosnia now that a peace settlement appears  closer than at any other time during the war, the Administration found itself in a quandary. If it did not set a fixed deadline for the troop withdrawal, it opened itself up to criticism that the United States was getting involved in an  ill-defined, open-ended mission. **********General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made that  point to Congress last week. He said it was important to set a target date of one year and then bring the troops home, because \"in the absence of that, you find yourself staying there, and that's how very often mission creep comes in.\" **********But during the two days of marathon hearings before Senate and House committees, lawmakers from both parties charged that Presidential politics was involved in setting a one-year deadline, a charge that the witnesses denied, saying that the one-year deadline was based on purely military considerations. **********Both Democrats and Republicans also asked how the Administration could set a  deadline for a peacekeeping mission when when the warring parties still had fundamental differences over territory, the status of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and how Bosnia would function with an enemy \"Serb Republic\" within its  borders. **********In addition, some NATO allies are uneasy with the setting of an artificial deadline for the 60,000-troop mission in the absence of a peace agreement, senior Pentagon and NATO officials have said. **********That line of criticism continued today. Dick Cheney, a former Secretary of Defense, said on CBS, \"To talk about a timetable that we will be out within a year, when you don't know what the objective is, and haven't really developed a  plan for executing that, raises serious questions about the quality of the decision-making process within the Administration.\" **********The first suggestion that the yearlong deadline was not fixed came on Thursday, when President Clinton said that although his commanders believe that  the mission could be completed in a year, he wanted to reserve judgment until a  peace agreement is signed. \"I want to have a very high level of confidence that  I can make that commitment and keep it,\" Mr. Clinton said. He added, \"It looks like we're talking about a commitment in the nature -- in the range of -- a year.\" **********Indeed, during the hearings last week, Mr. Perry acknowledged that despite his recommendation that the United States should stick to a definite timetable,  the decision was ultimately a political one. \"I will not be the final decision maker,\" he said. **********In their television appearances today, both Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher acknowledged that the United States and its NATO allies had failed to resolve another important element of the peacekeeping operation: finding a formula for Russian participation, given the refusal of Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to put troops under NATO command. **********Mr. Yeltsin today added another condition, saying in a speech to the United Nations that Russia was ready to provide troops, \"but only under a strict mandate of the U.N. Security Council.\" **********The United States has insisted that Russian troops serve under NATO command or play a non-combat role like building roads and clearing mines. **********Mr. Christopher said today that he did not expect the issue to be resolved when Mr. Clinton meets Mr. Yeltsin in Hyde Park, N.Y., on Monday. During the hearings, Mr. Perry said that the divide is so great that it was \"questionable\"  whether Russian forces would take part."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/21/business/company-news-interco-agrees-to-buy-thomasville-furniture.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERCO AGREES TO BUY THOMASVILLE FURNITURE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERCO AGREES TO BUY THOMASVILLE FURNITURE", "body_text": " **********Interco Inc. agreed to buy the Thomasville Furniture Industries unit of Armstrong World Industries for $331 million, the companies said yesterday.

Unable or unwilling to gain European support for allowing Bosnia to defend itself, the Clinton Administration has offered American forces in support of a failed approach. Providing American ground forces is no substitute for providing American leadership. **********Instead of reinforcing a failed policy, the Administration should assert American leadership for a viable policy which would grant Bosnia the means to defend itself without American soldiers. Experience shows that we should not risk the lives of our brave fighting men and women without clearly defined military objectives; in the case of American policy toward Bosnia today, it is unclear what the objectives are or how they would be furthered by American ground troops. **********The President's willingness to respond to a request for deployment of U.S. armed forces to aid in \"reconfiguring\" Unprofor is a significant policy shift. It has occurred without consultation with the Republican leadership of Congress.

Labor foundations target such disparate lines of work as metalworking and farming, and they seek to prevent people who are going to lose their jobs because of regional structural change from joining the long-term unemployed. **********\"The foundation is the bridge between one job and the next, and underneath it lurks unemployment,\" said Herbert K\u00f6fler, head of the Open Labor Foundation in Steyr. **********Since it was founded in April 1993 as the result of intense industrial downsizing in the region, the Steyr Foundation has taken in around 350 people for intensive counseling, retraining or - as in Mr. Sengschmied's case - helping people start small businesses. **********While some 220 are still on its rolls - they have up to four years - a third of the Steyr Foundation's charges have already found new jobs. **********Throughout Austria, where some 30 foundations have been formed since 1987, the average participant leaves their supervision after 21 months. More than 90 percent either find new jobs or continue in vocational training programs. **********Participants collect unemployment benefits for as long as four years, as opposed to the usual one-year limit. But their counseling, retraining and project financing is ultimately paid for by employer-matched payroll deductions at seven of the region's biggest companies, which regard the foundation as a way of preventing labor from leaving the region. **********The first nationwide labor foundations, which are in the process of starting up, are designed to help people losing jobs in the country's customs inspection and foodstuffs industries as a result of Austria's entry into the European Union on Jan. 1. **********An official of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris who has studied Austrian labor market policies said the country's overall approach to resolving the problem of long-term unemployment contained valuable lessons for other countries. **********\"Before, they mostly tried to train people, but they realized that often wasn't what was needed. Rather, people faced a fundamental reorientation problem because they were looking for jobs in sectors that were hopeless or they became discouraged,\" the official said. **********Moreover, a 1994 OECD study on Austria's economic and employment development found the country's active labor market programs remarkably cost-efficient. Labor market spending consumes \"only a small amount\" of the national budget - about 2 percent - and less than 0.25 percent of the gross domestic product, one of the lowest expenditures among OECD countries, though Austria's unemployment rate is also among the group's lowest. **********In February, Austria's unemployment rate was 4.4 percent, with a quarter of those people unemployed for more than a year, while the averages for the European Union show more than 10 percent unemployed and 40 percent of those for more than a year. **********The Austrian government's role in the labor market is pervasive, and its none-too- scientific policy, according to the OECD study, \"essentially consists of trying everything that promises to work.\" **********\"Our main goal is to avoid the formation of an ever-growing class of long-term unemployed,\" said a spokesman for the Austrian labor and social affairs ministry in Vienna. \"We have problems, too, but in general it's better here than elsewhere.\" **********The ministry's philosophy is that the labor market functions well but that some people have psychological problems and outdated skills that must be dealt with before they can take advantage of it. **********Although labor foundations are playing an increasingly important role, Austria's main weapon against long-term unemployment is Aktion 8000, a program in which certain groups of people are counseled, retrained and put to work in public and private nonprofit organizations. **********Josef Furtlehner, an official of the Austrian Labor Market Service agency, said the Aktion 8000 programs had a 57 percent success rate nationwide. While expensive, they pay for themselves in increased tax and social security revenue and savings on unpaid unemployment benefits within 10 months of a participant's getting a job, he said, putting the number of participants in such programs last year at 4,700. **********Other equally successful programs, many of which are provided for the Labor Market Service under contract by private companies, focus on fast-track training for technical occupations and general counseling and coaching on how to write resum\u00e9s and comport oneself in a job interview. All involve full-day participation that mimics actual employment. **********Hardship cases - convicts, for example - become the responsibility of so-called \"socioeconomic projects\" such as Vienna's Team idee, a partly self-financing workshop program that teaches people practical skills such as painting, woodworking, repairing bicycles or cleaning up pollution. **********\"The most important thing is that people in these programs get used to working again,\" said Mr. Furtlehner, putting the current number of such programs, in which participants effectively work for one year under professional psychological supervision, at around 45. **********Because income from such hardship programs - there are 45 - covers at least 20 percent of their costs, such projects \"aren't any more expensive\" than paying unemployment, according to Mr. Furtlehner, \"but they're a lot smarter.\" **********The same rule applies to labor foundations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/business/investing-it-building-a-better-401-k.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1995-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2039, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING IT;Building a Better 401(k)", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT;Building a Better 401(k)", "body_text": " **********A TRILLION dollars. Now there's a figure that commands some respect. That's the amount that those retirement plans with the yawner name -- 401(k) -- will likely claim as their own in just three or four years. Nearly 18.5 million American workers have these tax-advantaged accounts, and many millions more will doubtless soon join them. For the 401(k) has been heralded by economists, politicians and investment advisers alike as a key to a comfortable retirement in the post-pension world. **********But the 401(k) idea has a flaw. No, not just the frequent lament that many eligible workers do not join the plans, or do not invest enough in them, or do not allocate their assets appropriately. This other problem centers not on the worker at all but on the company, not on an ill-informed investor but on a malformed plan. **********This is a story about how some workers who were enrolled in such unsatisfactory plans -- two San Francisco architects, a newspaper editor in Philadelphia, the treasurer of a parking-lot company and a whole set of workers  at a food company in upstate New York -- voiced their concerns and persuaded their companies to make the necessary changes. **********Unfortunately, such reformers are rare, even if the defects that roused them  are not. While companies generally follow Labor Department guidelines on the basic features of a good 401(k) plan, those minimums leave plenty of room for discretion. And, for a host of reasons, the executives who choose 401(k) plans for their companies are simply not the unerring judges that workers may assume. **********For many executives, the 401(k) question often yields to more pressing issues -- like meeting the competition. And even if the 401(k) gets their attention, it may be for naught. \"In many cases,\" said Daniel P. Wiener, publisher of the newsletter Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, the executive who does the choosing \"doesn't have a clue about investing.\" **********Even the pricing of such plans is not clear-cut. \"Many companies, and even benefits consultants, feel confused on pricing because it's all over the map,\" said Tom Johnson, vice president for marketing for Fed Services in Pittsburgh, which manages $80 billion in 401(k) money. **********And where knowledge is sketchy and prices fuzzy, social connections often become decisive. The choice of a corporate 401(k) plan, Mr. Wiener said, often hinges less on its merits than on \"the relationship between the person at the company who makes the decisions and a sales agent for a mutual fund company.\" Selecting a plan after a round of golf hosted by such agents, he said, \"is no way to design a plan.\" **********The results, the experts say, are plans with too few choices, arbitrarily set contribution limits, hidden fees, and other traits that can at best dampen the great promise of 401(k) plans and, at worst, seriously hobble workers' efforts to prepare for retirement. **********Here are the tales of those workers who have become Norma Rae's of the 401(k). They describe what weak spots they found, how they discovered the problems and what reform strategies they used -- from pushing for less costly changes on the theory the company is more receptive to them, to exploiting the investment savvy of in-house financial officers in mapping a new plan. **********For the rest of the 18.5 million 401(k) investors, the lesson these workers teach is that while your 401(k) may be far from perfect, it may also be far from written in stone. Now may be a particularly good time to explore both those questions, with plan vendors engaged in a fierce competition that means dirt-cheap prices for buyers. Indeed, delay may be dangerous. The tax breaks that make the plans so attractive to workers are also attracting the attention of Congressional budget-balancers. **********Yet assessing one's 401(k) plan is a long-term exercise, too. Just as today's workers must take charge of their own retirement investments, they also must scrutinize the contours of the plans. The stories below teach us to ask the critical, overarching questions: How good is my 401(k)? Are there hidden fees or costly features that serve little purpose? Do its mutual funds perform well, and are there enough of them? Asking these questions -- and pushing for change if the answers are unsatisfactory -- are critical chores for the workers who will be the pioneer retirees of the 21st century. **********Two Puzzled Architects **********In 1993, two young architects in San Francisco, Kevin Kennedy and Steve Jackson, noticed something odd about their 401(k) investments. The plan's no-load mutual funds reported returns in the newspaper that were much better than the returns they reported to the plan. **********Confused and worried, the men approached the owners of their firm, Gordon H.  Chong & Associates. The owners agreed to a 401(k) review, with the firm's 50 architects electing a four-member committee to perform it. **********The committee, which included Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson, was soon poring over the plan documents and unraveling the complexities of the 401(k). But it didn't take long for them to discover why their existing mutual fund options did so much better in the newspaper than on their plan's papers: buried in the pricing of their 401(k) documents was a 5 percent commission on purchases of these \"no load\" mutual funds. **********Naturally, the committee began to look elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, for example, used his personal computer to conduct a detailed performance analysis of various mutual funds over intervals ranging from three years to one month. **********The committee also interviewed mutual fund companies and other vendors of 401(k) plans, and became pretty smart shoppers. \"The really big guys in mutual funds offered very good service -- but you had to buy only their funds and that  put us off a little bit,\" Mr. Kennedy said. **********Given their past experience, they were acutely attuned to hard-to-detect fees. \"We also felt that they had some loads, some costs, that you don't necessarily see upfront,\" he said about some vendors. \"That made us a little leery because there were plenty of pure no-load funds out there.\" **********The committee worked for more than a year, eventually prompting the firm's owners to retain Schwab One, which allows workers to pick from six investment options offered by several different mutual funds and other money managers. And  the new plan reduced, from one year to several months, the waiting period before new employees could enroll. **********A Borrower and a Lender Be **********Jonathan Neumann, enterprise editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, mentioned  to one of his superiors in 1994 that he was planning to borrow some money. She suggested he take out a loan against his 401(k) savings. To Mr. Neumann, who had put away the maximum allowed since the plan began in 1989, the idea made great sense. He needn't worry about applying for a loan, and instead of paying interest to a bank he would be paying it to himself. **********But when Mr. Neumann asked for loan forms he got a shock. **********\"Much to my surprise,\" he said, \"I learned that the union employees were not  allowed to borrow, but people in management could.\" **********Mr. Neumann went right to the top, asking both the paper's publisher and the  president of his union, Local 10 of the Newspaper Guild, the whys and wherefores of the rule. \"Neither had any answers,\" he said. **********So Mr. Neumann and a colleague called R. Theodore Benna, a benefits consultant in Langhorne, Pa., who is widely credited with popularizing 401(k) plans. Mr. Benna said there was no legal reason such loans could not be made to  union employees, that the paperwork involved would cost less than $1,000 and that all other loan costs could be charged to borrowers. **********\"We went back to the publisher and the union president and they said, 'That's all it takes?' and in about two months it was done and I got my loan,\" Mr. Neumann said. **********Such \"self-lending\" is a big attraction of the 401(k) and its nonprofit cousin, the 403(b). About $17 billion of these assets have been borrowed, with an average loan balance of $6,200, according to Access Research, a market research firm in Windsor, Conn. Under Federal law these loans are limited to half of account balances, up to $50,000. **********Good Stuff Real Cheap **********Doug Bowlus was not too pleased with the performance of the money manager for his 401(k) plan at ABM Industries, a San Francisco company that runs parking lots and janitorial services across the country. **********\"Nobody was particularly happy with our investment manager,\" Mr. Bowlus, ABM's treasurer, said. \"I tracked their performance and came to the conclusion that we could do better.\" **********But Mr. Bowlus knew that he faced some constraints. \"We are not a high-margin company,\" he said, \"and so cost control and avoidance is a serious issue.\" **********So, with some colleagues, Mr. Bowlus focused on cheap ways to make ABM's 401(k) plan better. And he succeeded, ultimately persuading his superiors to switch investment managers, to change administrators to improve 401(k) record-keeping, and to provide additional features, such as two more investment  options. **********\"We got all of these improvements,\" said Mr. Bowlus, \"for virtually no additional cost to the company.\" In fact, he said, the switch to a new administrator should lower administrative costs. **********Equally important are the new plan's improvements in 401(k) communication and education. Employees can now get daily valuations from an 800 number, for instance, and each quarter they also receive reports on how each fund option did compared to all similar funds. **********\"We are also getting much more, and much more professional, educational materials,\" Mr. Bowlus said. \"It will help our employees understand the difference between savings and investment and what different options can mean to their retirement income, and to better understand that investment is a long-term process and not 'What did you do for me this quarter?' \" **********And in securing the new plan, Mr. Bowlus used a strategy that may prove useful to others. As ABM's treasurer, he is financially knowledgeable, and he relied as well on other ABM finance specialists in his efforts. **********Such specialists add needed investment acumen for 401(k) design, said Thomas  Schlossberg, president of Diversified Investment Advisors. While there has recently been a big shift of 401(k) responsibility to financial executives, \"About 60 percent of the time the benefits or human resources people, especially at smaller companies, decide on the 401(k) plan,\" he said. \"Better to get the chief financial officer's people involved, too.\" **********Everybody Into the Act **********At Curtice-Burns Foods in Rochester, N.Y., a battle over corporate ownership last fall had left many employees fretful about their future. To allay concerns  and show its benevolence, the company decided to greatly improve the retirement  plans of its 1,200 salaried workers. **********But first the company, which makes Comstock pie fillings and Nalley's chips,  surveyed its workers to find out their sentiments. What it learned was a surprise -- and led the company to change direction. **********\"We knew we needed to do something in the area of retirement,\" said Lois Warlick-Jarvie, vice president for human resources. \"We were looking at improving the defined benefit plan, but based on what we heard from our employees we decided to work on the defined contribution plan.\" In other words,  while the company was readying a plan to augment its pension, workers were pointing to their 401(k)'s instead. **********And improve them, it did. The company increased the plan's investment options from two to four and, while there was no company match before, Curtice-Burns offered a 50 percent match, up to 3 percent of pay. **********The lesson for workers is twofold: Speak up about changes you desire because  your company may have no clue about your preferences. And when you do speak up,  your company may well say yes. **********Congress first authorized the 401(k) plan in 1980. By the year 2000 -- a mere 20 years later -- the predictions are that 25 million American workers at 350,000 companies will have invested $1.175 trillion in such plans. **********That growth makes it critical for workers to realize that, in the world of the 401(k), intelligent investing means more than just mastering and following the rules of asset allocation, diversification and the like. It also means stepping back, scrutinizing the overall plan as vigorously as they scrutinize investments, and pushing for change if change is needed. For weak plans can make strong portfolios -- and a secure retirement -- impossible to achieve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/26/world/turkish-premier-resigns-after-losing-election-to-islamic-party.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkish Premier Resigns After Losing Election to Islamic Party", "print_headline": "Turkish Premier Resigns After Losing Election to Islamic Party", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of Turkey, defeated by an Islamic party in Sunday's general elections, resigned today and made overtures to a conservative  rival to keep the Islamic party out of power. **********A spokesman for President Suleyman Demirel said Mrs. Ciller had resigned, along with her Cabinet, but would stay in office until a new government was formed. **********If necessary, we will not be the ones to stand in the way of a coalition\" with the conservative Motherland Party, she said at a news conference before she resigned. **********The Welfare Party, the Islamic party, was confirmed as the winner of the elections, with 21 percent of the vote, the Government-run television said.

The early elections were called after Mrs. Ciller's coalition with the social democrats collapsed in September. **********Turkish markets fell today after the news of the Welfare victory, with the Istanbul stock index closing down 6.52 percent, after initially falling 9.4 percent in the morning session. **********The Welfare Party platform calls for a renegotiation of Turkey's customs union with the European Union, which is set to take effect at the start of the year, an end to the charging of interest and closer ties with Muslim nations. Mr. Erbakan also favors pulling Turkey out of NATO and forming an \"Islamic common market.\" **********\"They have talked about a lot of things, but even if Erbakan succeeds in forming a government it will be a coalition so he won't have the power to drastically change things,\" said Sami Kohen, foreign affairs columnist for the newspaper Milliyet. **********The Welfare Party victory was welcomed by Iran. Teheran's Government-run radio said it was likely to shift Turkish policies to a more pro-Islamic stand. **********The Welfare Party was aided by the failure of the Kurdish People's Democracy  Party to win 10 percent of the nationwide vote needed to qualify for Parliament.

For better or for worse, it turned television into the unstoppable financial and cultural force that it is today. **********True nationwide programming began on Nov. 18, 1951, when Edward R. Murrow, during the first broadcast of his \"See It Now\" series, gazed solemnly at a live  split-screen image of the Golden Gate and Brooklyn Bridges and said, \"We are impressed by a medium through which a man sitting in his living room has been able for the first time to look at two oceans at once.\" **********The East and West Coasts had just been linked by coaxial cable -- an unwieldy and inefficient method of long-distance transmission, as anyone who has ever lived too far from his cable company knows. Nevertheless, the final linkup was an event comparable in importance to the driving of the golden spike in the transcontinental railroad. **********Thus it was that in 1951 -- not coincidentally, the same year that a new comedy, \"I Love Lucy,\" became television's first true national hit -- the young  television networks, like their radio forebears (whose coast-to-coast audio signals had traveled comfortably via conventional phone lines) were able to offer the entire country the same programs simultaneously.    TV executives quickly realized that most of its newly served viewers in rural and suburban areas wanted to be soothed and amused rather than challenged or titillated. **********Before 1951, the airwaves were dominated by live shows: New York-based dramas and such raucous, vaudeville-like variety programs as Mr. Berle's \"Texaco Star Theater\" and Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's \"Admiral Broadway Revue.\" And the so-called golden age of live television drama, fueled by talented refugees from  the legitimate stage, lasted for the next few years. **********But after 1951, milder comedies and adventure shows, most of them produced in Hollywood, held sway. Desi Arnaz and others perfected the three-camera method of filming situation comedies in front of live audiences for later broadcast. It freed television from the tyranny of the stage's proscenium arch and allowed comedies to be \"sweetened\" with prerecorded laughter. The shows could also be quickly filmed and edited and rerun in perpetuity. **********The programs now had to be tailored for Middle American tastes. Milton Berle  and Sid Caesar gradually gave way to the likes of Red Skelton and Dinah Shore; golden-age figures like Paddy Chayevsky moved on to the movies. By taking the middle road, the networks stimulated sales of television sets and delivered huge audiences for advertisers -- charging sponsors princely sums for the privilege. **********Meanwhile, the Hollywood movie studios, whose theater audiences had been cut  in half by television, began to use their empty sets and sound stages to turn out cheap black-and-white westerns and police shows for the small screen. **********Television was one of those seemingly instant socioeconomic breakthroughs that in fact had been a long time coming. The basic technical research that led  to practical methods of sending pictures through the air had been largely completed by the mid-1920's. On July 21, 1931, an NBC-owned station in New York, W2XAB, began the nation's first regularly scheduled television broadcasts. **********Throughout the 1930's a few other quasi-commercial stations sprang up in big  cities. But prewar television sets had tiny, flickering screens -- and the slapdash programs being improvised by techies and true believers at the stations made no dent at all in radio's popularity. **********During World War II the technical kinks were worked out of television and the radio networks were prepared to make a big push into the new medium. The first televised World Series, the 1947 matchup that saw the Yankees beat the Dodgers in seven games, drew an estimated total of 3.9 million viewers -- 3.5 million of whom watched it in bars. **********In 1950, fewer than 10 percent of all households had a television set. By 1953, the figure was 40 percent, on its way to 90 percent by the end of the decade. **********The United States was truly becoming one nation. On Monday night, Jan. 19, 1953, 69 percent of all the sets in use were tuned to the episode of \"I Love Lucy\" in which Lucille Ball's character, Lucy Ricardo, gave birth to a son. **********That same week, Ms. Ball gave birth to her real son, Desi Arnaz Jr. His picture was published shortly afterward in the premiere issue of TV Guide, which would become the best-selling magazine in America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/18/business/international-briefs-air-new-zealand-moves-into-australian-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Air New Zealand Moves Into Australian Market", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Air New Zealand Moves Into Australian Market", "body_text": " **********Air New Zealand Ltd. has gained a foothold in the Australian aviation market  by buying a 25 percent stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd. from the Australian transportation company TNT Ltd. for $200 million (Australian), or $148 million (United States).

The trend has clearly gained further momentum during the 1990's. For instance, one survey now ranks Halloween as the  third most popular occasion for adult parties, behind only New Year's Eve and the Super Bowl. **********As the baby boomers have grown up, they've taken Halloween along with them,\" said Francine Katz, a vice president of the Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis.

At least 34 people were killed and more than 100 injured, the authorities said. **********At least eight people died in the collapse of the eight-story Costa Real, a beachside hotel in the resort city of Manzanillo, 524 miles west of Mexico City, and navy rescue crews were working with cranes to free others believed trapped under the wreckage. **********Some 50 people, including guests and workers, were in the hotel when it collapsed, and rescuers were listening for cries from the injured. **********\"When we hear any sound we order everybody to be quiet, but unfortunately the hotel is right on the ocean, and the waves are crashing,\" said Adm. Manuel Barron, the navy chief of staff in Manzanillo. \"We're still hoping that there are people in there alive.\" **********The quake, which struck at 9:40 A.M. local time, measured 7.6 on the open-ended Richter scale. The epicenter was 15 miles southeast of Manzanillo, in the state of Colima, said Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey's Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. **********Late today Government officials and the Televisa news program said 34 people  were confirmed dead. **********Many roads were blocked and telephone communication was cut to many parts of  Colima and Jalisco, another Pacific coast state, where the damage was most severe. During a day of considerable chaos, officials in the two states at first announced that at least 57 people had died, but hours later revised the death toll downward considerably. **********The Jalisco State government issued a communique anouncing that the Costa Grande, a large tourist hotel in San Patricio Melaque, about 30 miles to the northwest along the coast from Manzanillo, had also collapsed, killing 11 people. Later, however, Juan Maria Naveja, a spokesman for the Jalisco Governor, Alberto Cardenas, said that the report was mistaken. Mr. Naveja said he believed that the hotel had only been damaged and that he knew of no deaths there. **********The tremor rattled buildings and frightened people not only in Colima and Jalisco, but was also felt strongly in Mexico City and nine other Mexican states, stretching from San Luis Potosi in the north to Oaxaca in the south. **********In Mexico City, the 63-story glass and steel headquarters of Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil monopoly, swayed terrifyingly by a yard or more,  company officials said. **********Electricity and telephone service were briefly interrupted on the west side of Mexico City, and traders on Mexico's stock market halted operations for about 40 minutes. **********Michael Farley, an American who was on his yacht in the Manzanillo harbor, watched the Hotel Costa Real \"crumble right before my eyes,\" he said in an interview over short-wave radio and telephone. He was reached with the help of amateur radio operators at the United Nations headquarters in New York. **********\"Everybody was yelling and pointing at the hotel,\" Mr. Farley said. \"It looked like one of those films on TV, where the guys come in with dynamite and destroy the building. We watched it collapse into a pile of dust.\" **********Mr. Farley said that during the quake the waters of Manzanillo Bay dropped 10 feet and then roared back minutes later in a huge wave. \"It was just like somebody flushed the toilet,\" he said. **********Around the bay in Manzanillo, several floors collapsed at the local headquarters of the Colima State Judicial Police. The Secretary of Defense, Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, said that eight police officers and clerical workers  died there. **********Mr. Farley said the police headquarters was in the rear of a \"two-story building in an old shopping center, real old shoddy construction.\" Inside the building were a station house and a jail, he said. **********To the north in Jalisco, at least 10 people were killed and some 90 seriously injured, said Mr. Naveja, the Jalisco spokesman. Nine of the deaths came in Cihuatlan, a town about 20 miles northwest of Manzanillo, he said, and another person died in the nearby town of Mascota. Most of the dead were aparently killed by collapsing homes. **********Mr. Naveja estimated that 900 homes collapsed in various towns in Jalisco. **********Landslides blocked the highways between Melaque and Cihuatlan. Two bridges, spanning the Secco and Jualuco Rivers in Jalisco, collapsed, according to radio  reports. **********The quake hit just hours before President Ernesto Zedillo flew to the United  States for a state visit with President Clinton. Before his departure, Mr. Zedillo sent Secretary of Defense Cervantes and the Secretaries of Health and Social Development to Jalisco and Colima to coordinate relief efforts. **********\"This quake, as you know, was of high intensity,\" Mr. Zedillo said at a press conference. \"We have had to lament loss of human life, but fortunately, given the severity, the intensity of the tremor, the damages do not appear to be unmanageable.\" **********At the American Embassy in Mexico City, a spokesman, James Williams, said no  reports of Americans among the dead or injured had been received. **********On Sept. 14, a quake of similar force and duration rattled the state of Guerrero, on the Pacific coast due south of the capital.

It is increasingly a subcontractor on military orders, rather than a prime contractor. **********Neither company would comment on the talks, which were first reported today in The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that an outright merger of the  two companies was also being contemplated. **********The people with knowledge of the discussions said that a full merger of two of the most famous names in aviation was unlikely, in large part because the Government might determine that such an arrangement would create a powerhouse capable of crushing its competitors. **********But a combination of some sort had vocal support. \"Of all the deals, this one would make the most sense, especially as a merger,\" said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a specialist in military-industry  deals. \"For Douglas, this allows them to survive in the commercial-airline business. For Boeing, it stabilizes their place in the market.\" **********On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of McDonnell Douglas surged $4.375 today, to $90.625, and Boeing shares rose $1.875, to $75.875. **********\"There are synergies all over, almost in every one of their businesses,\" said Michael Goldberg, a partner in the military and aerospace business for the Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group. \"But when you start to talk about a total merger, attractive as it might seem, it would be pretty hard to get past the Department of Justice.\" **********Wolfgang Demisch, a military-industry analyst with BT Securities in New York, said: \"I think this deal would make sense in most dimensions. It would combine the leading combat-aircraft producer and the leading commercial-aircraft producer. There would be essentially one American producer to compete with the many start-ups in Asia and the existing Airbus consortium in Europe.\" **********He added, however, that he thought the chances of the Government's permitting such a combination were \"less than 10 percent.\" **********Many analysts suspect that a deal may be more likely now because McDonnell Douglas's chief executive is, for the first time, not a member of one of the founding families. He is Harry C. Stonecipher, 59, who was appointed to his job  a year ago. **********Mr. Stonecipher, regarded as a no-nonsense executive, made his mark turning around the Sundstrand Corporation, a maker of aerospace and industrial products, and as head of General Electric's jet-engine division. **********\"These two companies have been in communication on and off for years,\" Mr. Kutler said. \"But now that you have a C.E.O. not named Douglas or McDonnell, he's not going to be as concerned about the nameplate on the company. He's going to be more open to something.\" **********Boeing has more than 60 percent of the world market for commercial aircraft,  while McDonnell Douglas has a little more than 10 percent. The No. 2 manufacturer is Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. **********McDonnell Douglas did win a big order recently for the MD-95, its new 100-seat commercial jet, but it had to cut prices drastically to get the business. Some of its own subcontractors complained that it would be tough to make any money following that strategy. **********\"The price is really crazy,\" Yi Taek Shim, executive vice president of Korean Aerospace, a subcontractor, was quoted as saying in a recent issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine. \"It's hard to see how it will work.\" **********In addition to creating antitrust problems, a combination of the commercial-airline businesses could engender stiff resistance from unions. The machinists' union is currently on strike at Boeing, in part because the company is moving more of its work overseas, something that McDonnell Douglas has been doing as well. **********\"McDonnell has gone much farther down that road, been much more reckless with regard to technology exports,\" said Matt Bates, a union spokesman. \"It was not that long ago that they were offering themselves for sale to the Chinese.\" He was referring to unconfirmed reports that McDonnell Douglas was seeking to sell  an interest to Chinese companies. **********Mr. Goldberg of Deloitte & Touche said helicopter manufacturing was the most  obvious area for a combination. McDonnell Douglas makes the Apache helicopter for the military, while Boeing is one of the contractors on an innovative new tilt-rotor helicopter. This is another area where military orders are shrinking. **********\"There is excess capacity and insufficient demand,\" Mr. Goldberg said. \"It would make a lot of sense.\" **********He also said the space business of the companies, much of which is done for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, would also be good candidates for a combination of some kind."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/15/business/international-briefs-sony-in-venture-with-chinese-companies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Sony in Venture With Chinese Companies", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Sony in Venture With Chinese Companies", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation plans to invest $410 million in a joint venture with two Chinese companies to make Trinitron color televisions and computer displays.

All around the globe, the managing directors of Salomon Brothers Inc., Wall Street's bond-trading powerhouse, were  preparing to gather at the firm's headquarters in the World Trade Center for their annual meeting, scheduled for the third weekend in May. **********But Deryck C. Maughan, Salomon's chief executive, knew he could not have the  meeting without offering the 180 directors at least an outline of how he expected to deal with compensation, an incendiary issue ever since he announced  cutbacks late last year. **********If he wasn't willing to stand up and elucidate what the firm was going to do about pay this year and next, he might as well not stand up at all,\" said one director, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********So just two weeks before the planned gathering, Mr. Maughan put the meeting off until November, presumably in the hope that buoyant bond and equity markets  would allow him to talk about raises then. **********The threat of a showdown with the restive directors -- and the decision to sidestep one -- speaks volumes about Mr. Maughan's increasingly troubled reign at Salomon. Catapulted to the top nearly four years ago in the aftermath of the  Treasury bond scandal that threatened the firm's existence, Mr. Maughan is now on the defensive, if not quite on the ropes, because of a combination of painful market shifts and strategic blunders. And though the man who put him on top, Warren E. Buffett, Salomon's biggest shareholder, is still in his corner, time may no longer be on Mr. Maughan's side. **********Mr. Maughan was brought in by Mr. Buffett largely because of his reputation as a skilled manager of the firm's Tokyo office who had few ties to the old guard and its cowboy culture. But Mr. Maughan, who has made his share of missteps, has remained an outsider in New York. In a broader sense, the fact that Salomon is still floundering shows how resistant the firm has been to his efforts to effect change. Because it has continued to make big bets on market moves, rather than diversifying successfully into more stable businesses as other firms have, Salomon is much more at the mercy of outside forces it can't control. And that has left Mr. Maughan subject to inside forces he can't control. **********\"The people chemistry there is at least in part dysfunctional and is exacerbating an already difficult situation,\" said Samuel L. Hayes, a Harvard Business School professor who has written about Mr. Maughan and the firm. **********Indeed, while Mr. Maughan has been the consummate courtier outside Salomon -- calling on clients, cultivating Mr. Buffett and soothing regulators' ruffled feathers in the wake of the bond scandal, the result of one cowboy trader's phony bids -- he has been losing control of his own troops. **********His close ties to Mr. Buffett have only emphasized the rank-and-file's perception of Mr. Maughan -- who is British -- as an outsider, which makes him a convenient lightning rod for frustration over the firm's troubles. And there have been many troubles lately. **********He failed to deliver on a promise to build up the firm's client-driven businesses to even out the volatility of Salomon's earnings stream, which has relied heavily on risky profits generated by arbitrage. In fact, Salomon has been losing market share in such key client businesses as equity and debt underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Last year, in a performance Mr. Maughan himself described as \"appalling,\" it lost $963 million before taxes, thanks to sour market conditions and the discovery of a decade's worth of accounting errors. **********And the cut in compensation -- the bedrock of a Buffett-backed plan to restore profitability that was regarded by insiders as Mr. Maughan's ultimate act of disloyalty to them -- set off an exodus of talented traders, bankers and  other professionals. The directors kept heading for the door, taking some of the firm's business with them, even after Mr. Maughan restored part of the cuts in April. Late last month, Cox Communications Inc., the big media company, demoted  Salomon from its position as lead underwriter for a planned stock offering, citing personnel changes at the firm. **********All the while, there has been a steady departure of traders from the firm's vaunted arbitrage desk, courtesy of John Meriwether, the principal architect of  Salomon's proprietary trading operations who was forced to leave after the bond  scandal. Mr. Meriwether has attracted a dozen of the firm's star performers to his expanding hedge fund business in Greenwich, Conn. Some in the firm have faulted Mr. Maughan for not bringing Mr. Meriwether back. **********Things have gotten so tense that employees have begun sniping at Mr. Maughan  on a personal level for the first time. **********In the year after he took over, colleagues gushed about his integrity, intuitive skills and intelligence. Now, they complain that he has isolated himself in his 43d-floor office and they revel in gossip about his wife, Va, who has raised eyebrows because of her taste for luxury and a combative personality  that in one case nearly cost Salomon a major account. While finding fault with the chief executive's wife is something of a tradition at the firm -- the wife of Mr. Maughan's predecessor, John H. Gutfreund, was widely criticized for that  couple's lavish lifestyle -- there is an edge to the current gossip that sets it apart. **********\"He was voted in there by a bunch of worried people who are the first to turn when things go wrong,\" said Roger C. H. Luscombe, a friend from the early days of Mr. Maughan's career. **********Such upheaval at any other company would have led long ago to the creation of an office pool to bet on the timing of the chief executive's departure. But Mr.  Maughan wields a shield that most chieftains would envy: Mr. Buffett's support. **********Mr. Buffett has deep reserves of patience when it comes to the executives in  charge of his many investments. In a recent letter to shareholders, Robert E. Denham, Mr. Buffett's lawyer and chairman of Salomon's holding company, Salomon  Inc., extolled Mr. Maughan for dealing \"skillfully and honorably with the reversal of fortune in Salomon Brothers' client-driven business\" and for \"responding effectively\" to the firm's changed business environment. (Mr. Buffett and Mr. Denham declined to be interviewed.) **********But even Mr. Buffett can't stand idly by indefinitely if Salomon continues to implode. Already, the firm is moving to beef up its top management, retaining Thomas J. Neff, the executive recruiter who has rustled up turnaround engineers  for troubled companies like Eastman Kodak and Allied Signal. At Salomon, Mr. Neff is looking to land a strong No. 2 to serve as chief administrative officer under Mr. Maughan. The way such hirings often unfold, however, a strong  No. 2 often ends up as No. 1. **********Mr. Maughan says he has no such fears. The search was started at his behest,  he said, because he wants to devote more time to cultivating client relationships. He recently led the firm's pitch to Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and was persuasive enough to win Salomon the lead position for the secondary offering of 11.5 million shares of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc., a K.K.R. company. **********The firm's prospects for this year look good, Mr. Maughan says, thanks to improvements in the bond market and, to a lesser degree, in emerging market securities and derivatives. \"It looks as though it was a very short, very sharp  correction last year,\" he said. \"I don't mean to suggest that we're back to 1993 levels, but it's certainly not 1994.\" **********Despite the upbeat tone, Mr. Maughan bears the marks of a difficult period, often stopping himself midsentence to say, \"That will sound defensive.\" He is no longer the boyish-looking executive who took over four years ago. Now just 47, his hair has gone from dark brown to completely gray. **********Given his rapid rise to the top of Salomon, the last few years must have been a rude awakening indeed. **********A COAL miner's son, Mr. Maughan used a combination of intelligence and hard work to escape a hardscrabble life in the northeast of England. After graduating from the University of London, he landed a job in the British Treasury, working  for 10 years in international finance and government spending. **********In 1977, he took a year off to earn a master of science degree at Stanford University's graduate school of business. Back in London, he rejoined the Treasury, making calls on the likes of Morgan Stanley & Company and Goldman, Sachs & Company to enlist their help in selling Britain's securities. He did such a good job that Goldman offered him a spot in 1979 in its training program  in New York. **********After his training, it was back to London again where, after more than three  years of selling bonds, he caught the eye this time of Salomon. In 1983, he was  hired to sell international bonds in New York by James L. Massey, a legendary Salomon trader, who told friends at the firm he was mildly surprised by how involved Mr. Maughan's wife was in the negotiations leading up to his hiring. \"He described it as like a star who says, 'Talk to my agent,' \" said one former executive. **********It wasn't the last time Mrs. Maughan -- a native of Samoa who met Mr. Maughan when she was an airline reservation agent in London -- drove a hard bargain for  her husband. When the firm shipped him to Tokyo in 1986 to revive an office plagued by warfare between its investment bankers and traders, she insisted on a house with a swimming pool, of which there are few in a city where land is so valuable, according to former Salomon executives. **********The house they found, previously occupied by the Egyptian ambassador to Japan, cost the firm about $30,000 a month to rent -- and Salomon paid not only  to have it renovated but to put the Maughans up in a suite at Tokyo's five-star  Okura Hotel for several months while the work was completed. **********Mrs. Maughan, who became known inside Salomon as Lady Va, also had a company  car and driver at her disposal and traveled with her husband on business at the  company's expense, luxuries afforded to no other executive's wife. **********Years later, when Mr. Maughan was in charge of the firm in New York, Mrs. Maughan almost cost Salomon some business. **********At a soiree Salomon hosted at the Museum of Modern Art during its Matisse retrospective in the fall of 1992, several senior managing directors and their wives, clad in black tie and designer dresses, mingled with the firm's most important clients. **********The companion of a senior executive of one of the clients was wearing a pants suit that resembled pajamas. According to two people at the party, Mrs. Maughan  walked over to the woman and quietly but forcefully suggested that the outfit was inappropriate and she should leave. Failing to persuade the woman, Mrs. Maughan summoned a guard and had her evicted, according to people who were there. (Both of the Maughans declined to comment about the incident, as did the  firm.) **********The next morning, Mr. Maughan received a terse telephone call from the client suggesting that he call the woman and offer his apologies -- or forfeit its business. He made the call. **********In Tokyo, the high cost of maintaining the Maughans was considered well worth it by top Salomon managers, who use language bordering on the reverent to praise Mr. Maughan's efforts there. **********\"The office was disintegrating at an alarming rate,\" recalled Richard L. Grand-Jean, who went along as Mr. Maughan's deputy but left the firm last year. **********Within a year, Mr. Maughan had persuaded New York to commit $300 million in additional capital to the office, giving it more financial muscle than any other foreign firm. And he broke down the barriers between the trading desk and the investment banking unit by coaxing the traders to take Mr. Grand-Jean and his subordinates on sales calls. **********In short order, Mr. Maughan transformed the office from a backwater into a profit center that contributed as much as 15 percent of the firm's earnings and  was the fifth-largest securities business in Tokyo after Japan's Big Four firms. **********Tokyo fixed Mr. Maughan's star firmly in the Salomon firmament, and in 1991,  Mr. Gutfreund (pronounced GOOD-friend) brought him back to New York to become co-head of investment banking. **********But just a few months later, the firm faced disaster when regulators charged  Salomon with submitting false bids for auctions of Treasury bonds. Worse, Mr. Gutfreund knew about one of the bids but failed to alert authorities immediately. **********Mr. Gutfreund, who personified Salomon's gruff and aggressive ethos, was out, along with his two presumed heirs -- Thomas Strauss, the president, and Mr. Meriwether, head of proprietary trading. **********When Mr. Buffett arrived on the scene to rescue his $700 million investment in Salomon, he found a firm on the verge of collapse. Competitors had long carped about Salomon's lack of management depth, but it took the bond scandal to prove them right. Of the 12 senior managing directors under consideration, Mr. Maughan was the only one with broad experience across several business units and no particular turf allegiances in New York. **********After a 10-minute interview, Mr. Buffett named the affable Englishman chief operating officer, reserving for himself the titles of interim chairman and chief executive. It was the first time the two men had met. **********Mr. Maughan used the turmoil in the wake of the scandal to quietly ease out some of the firm's cowboys. And he set about the initial stages of rebuilding the firm's client-oriented businesses, including securities underwriting, institutional trading, equities research and mergers and acquisitions. These operations had always been treated as an afterthought in comparison to the proprietary trading units, which generated the bulk of the profits. **********In 1992, Mr. Buffett anointed Mr. Maughan chairman and chief executive, leaving behind Mr. Denham, his long-time confidant, to keep an eye out as head of the holding company. **********The following year, the firm posted record profits of $1.56 billion, with the client-driven businesses contributing almost 75 percent. **********Then the bubble burst. The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates rapidly, catching most securities firms off-guard. But Salomon, with its huge stockpiles of bonds and the gargantuan trading positions of its proprietary trading desks, was hit harder than its competitors. The client businesses that Mr. Maughan had so assiduously nurtured failed to provide a cushion against the  fall; in 1994, they lost $636 million. **********Toward the end of what was turning out to be a disastrous year, Mr. Maughan unveiled his pay scheme for 1995 and set off the furor that has yet to subside.  The plan, a product of board meetings led by Mr. Buffett, was an attempt to address a situation in which multimillion-dollar bonuses were paid out even though shareholder returns were dropping. But in tying compensation to profits,  the plan proved divisive because it set up a two-tier pay system that cut deepest into the checks of those in the client-driven businesses. **********Protests over the plan were still loud when auditors unearthed unreconciled balances in the London office that cost the firm $278 million before taxes. The  firm first announced it would take a $217 million pretax charge, and then had to come back a few weeks later to say it had missed one large trade that was going  to cost it an additional $61 million pretax, a slip-up that immensely embarrassed Mr. Maughan and Mr. Denham, who had sworn publicly that there were no more mistakes. Although Salomon insists the discrepancies were a result of antiquated accounting systems, many at the firm and outside it suspect that some executives must have had an inkling of the problem but didn't speak up because it in effect inflated the office's profits and thus their bonuses. The firm says that no one benefited from the mistakes. **********In mid-April, shortly after five investment bankers in the firm's top-notch financial services group marched en masse to UBS Securities Inc., taking a $2 billion merger deal with them, Mr. Maughan raised a tattered white flag. It took the form of $45 million earmarked for rewarding Salomon's superstars and coaxing pricey talent to join the firm. **********Mr. Maughan insists that his notion of linking compensation to shareholder returns is a good one. \"In terms of the objective, we have to stick to it,\" he said. \"It is difficult to maintain the Wall Street Entitlement Program, where everyone gets paid a million dollars just for coming in to work.\" **********Nonetheless, the revisions announced in April were a clear sign that the plan is slated for an overhaul. **********While most agree that the firm needs more austerity, Mr. Maughan's critics both inside and outside Salomon contend that he and Mr. Buffett are misjudging the money-for-talent culture of Wall Street. The most productive people can easily move to other firms to make much more money. **********At the firm's annual shareholders' meeting in April, one elderly investor drew the most applause with his rueful comments about the new Salomon. **********\"I had the impression, as many stockholders here do, that the previous management really knew how to make money,\" he said, referring to Mr. Gutfreund's buccaneering team. \"They didn't always play by the rules, but they did know how  to make money. My question is, can a bunch of nice guys like you make money?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/business/kmart-credit-rating-is-cut-by-moody-s.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kmart Credit Rating Is Cut by Moody's", "print_headline": "Kmart Credit Rating Is Cut by Moody's", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investors Service cut the Kmart Corporation's credit rating yesterday to the lowest investment grade because of the weak fourth-quarter retail market.

In addition, the ceiling on the Medicare payroll tax was eliminated, effectively raising the marginal tax rate by 2.9 percent for incomes over $135,000. **********By contrast, the levy on the merely affluent did not change. Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Feenberg suggest that this group offers a suitable control for a natural experiment in the effect of higher rates on tax revenue. **********If the adjusted gross income of the rich (here defined as those with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $200,000) had marched in lockstep with that of the upper middle class ($50,000 to $200,000), it would have grown by 2.9 percent. In fact, the taxable income of the $200,000-plus group fell short by $31 billion. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion in taxes from this group, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion. **********What's more, the higher tax rate widened the gap between what rich people earned and what they kept, supposedly inducing them to work less. Mr. Feldstein  and Mr. Feenberg estimate that the deadweight loss -- the income never earned that was not offset by the estimated value of the gain in leisure -- equaled $17 billion. Put it another way: in adding a dollar to tax revenues, the law reduced national income by $3. **********It is a plausible story, but is it true? One problem, Mr. Toder says, is that the estimate critically depends on the base year. If 1991 (rather than 1992) is  compared with 1993, there is no shortfall in expected income and thus no shortfall in revenue or loss in output. **********Another problem is the possibility of tax-shifting. President Clinton was elected in November 1992. If high income earners anticipated higher tax rates in 1993 as a consequence, they presumably would have tried to realize the income in 1992. And there is evidence they did. **********Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's business school, cites a New York State survey showing that two-thirds of Wall Street's year-end  bonuses were paid in December 1992, in contrast to the one-third typically paid  before the New Year. Mr. Toder adds that a heretofore obscure statistic from the Commerce Department's national income accounts suggests that, all told, $20 billion was shifted. **********By the Treasury's reckoning, then, most of the income that Mr. Feldstein and  Mr. Feenberg argue was effectively destroyed by higher tax rates was realized a  year early. The rest, Mr. Toder estimates, was transformed from ordinary income  to capital gains, which was excluded from the Feldstein-Feenberg calculation because the tax rate did not change. **********Mr. Feldstein is not about to pack up his computer files and abandon the fight. He argues that no one else has an adequate explanation for the interruption in 1993 of the trend toward ever-increasing income concentration. And he says that an another way of pinpointing income-shifting back to 1992 -- tracking changes in fourth-quarter estimated tax payments -- does not confirm the Commerce Department's results. **********Truth is, there is too much room for interpretation in studies of taxpayer behavior to change many minds. The original supply-side Pollyannas were almost certainly wrong: tax revenues never recovered after the cuts in the early 1980's. But economists still do not know what price America pays for sharply progressive income taxes in terms of distorted incentives and slower growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/world/mexico-said-to-balk-at-border-shooting-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Golden", "pub_date": "1995-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 505, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico Said to Balk at Border Shooting Inquiry", "print_headline": "Mexico Said to Balk at Border Shooting Inquiry", "body_text": " **********The shooting of a United States Border Patrol officer, apparently by local policemen from the Mexican city of Nogales, has brought complaints by some American officials that the Mexican authorities are failing to cooperate in the case. **********United States officials said the wounded American officer, Arthur G.

Most of the perennially hungry are in India and sub-Saharan Africa, Dr. Serageldin said. **********Although there have been large increases in crop yields over the last 25 years for many basic grain, root, fruit and legume crops, scientists have found that the per-capita output of food has leveled off or dropped in some critical regions of Africa and Asia, where the population growth is fastest. **********Countries with already unhealthy balance-of-payment gaps are having to import more food. Land has been degraded in many areas, often because of inefficient or poorly maintained irrigation systems.

He said that environmentalists traditionally thought of agriculture as \"the enemy\" because farmers chopped down forests and added pesticides and fertilizers to earth and water. **********\"They were right,\" he said, but he added that there is no way to protect the environment unless great strides are made in agriculture and farmers are able to grow more on the land they have or can reclaim. **********The World Bank's concern with stagnating or dwindling food production is shared by the independent Worldwatch Institute, based in Washington, which just published its 1995 State of the World report. **********\"In the mid-nineties,\" it said, \"evidence that the world is on an economic path that is environmentally unsustainable can be seen in shrinking fish catches, falling water tables, declining bird populations, record heat waves and dwindling grain stocks, to name just a few.\" **********Among the issues that scientists and public officials will consider at the meeting beginning Thursday in Lucerne, Switzerland will be the decline in aid money for agricultural research and development. In 1980, 20 percent of aid was devoted to agriculture. That dropped to 14 percent by 1990. Development experts said that investment in better farming is always more cost-effective and useful than giveaway food aid or repeated cycles of disaster relief. **********\"Future advances in agriculture require more than a one-time investment in research,\" a report prepared for the meeting says. \"Additional yield gains are more difficult to achieve as research is increasingly pushing against biological and environmental limits. Yield gains are constantly threatened by newly developing, more aggressive pests and plant diseases moving from continent to continent, as well as by environmental degradation, deforestation and loss of natural genetic diversity of crops and farm animals.\" **********According to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, production of rice, the most important food in developing countries, has stagnated in Asia, dropped sharply in Latin America and increased slowly in Africa, but only to a fraction of total demand. **********Wheat, the second-most important staple, has shown encouraging increases in yields almost everywhere except Africa, the research group says. But it adds that in all regions except Asia countries are supplementing domestic production with imports. Both wheat and maize production have grown rapidly in Asia and the Middle East. **********Advances in crop yield and resistance to pests are being made at a network of research centers around the world established by the Consultative Group.

But hopes for peace were tempered by conflicts over politics and land that have deepened even as the threat of new fighting has waned. **********Although the demands of the rebels range from economic support for poor farmers to the replacement of Mr. Zedillo's administration by a transitional Government, they said in a statement before the talks began that they would focus only on \"measures to defuse the hostile climate and distance the danger of armed clashes between the two armies.\" **********The chief mediator in the dialogue, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, said tonight that the two sides had held more than three hours of \"frank, sincere\" and \"intense\" discussions near the rebel capital of Guadalupe Tepeyac. He said the Government's three representatives were led by the Interior Minister, Esteban Moctezuma, while the Zapatista National Liberation Army delegation was headed by the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos. **********Bishop Ruiz declined to provide details beyond that, suggesting that the talks were still preliminary and saying the negotiators would report publicly on them on Monday. **********The meeting comes five months after elections that defrauded hopes for an easing of tensions in the state, giving way instead to further polarization. While Zapatistas have backed away recently from their threats to break a cease-fire that has held for the last year, the prospects for a lasting peace have appeared to grow steadily more remote. **********The paradox of Chiapas remains that, while support for the insurgents has waned elsewhere in Mexico, the tensions fed by their rebellion have spread steadily out from the rebels' strongholds in the Lacandon rain forest. **********The principal legacy of the election in August may in fact be that the forces on either side of the political divide are now more organized and militant than ever. Peasant groups and the Democratic Revolutionary Party are on the left, with big landholders and the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party on the right. **********Peasants who have seized tens of thousands of acres of land are digging in on their new holdings and vowing not to give up. In response, the conservative ranchers who have always held sway in the region are setting up new alliances, stockpiling arms, running off some invaders and threatening others. **********The state government that took office last month hoping to find a middle ground in the struggle has increasingly sided with the property owners, further alienating the peasants. A recent pledge by the Government to address the land problem in Chiapas by parceling out some larger holdings has seemed to have had almost no impact. **********Groups loyal to Amado Avendano, the rumpled former newspaper publisher who ran as the left's gubernatorial candidate in August, have seized or tried to seize dozens of town halls around the state. **********The situation has become so complicated that many political analysts say a settlement will be more difficult to fashion now than after the Zapatistas launched their war on Jan. 1, 1994. **********\"People are much more polarized now, and on both sides,\" a Government official said. \"If it was tough before, it is going to be harder now.\" **********The economic crisis set off by the sharp devaluation of the peso last month has done little to diminish the urgency. **********The Government's forced reduction in its dependence on short-term foreign capital should ultimately reduce the economy's vulnerability to political shocks like those produced by the Zapatistas. But Chiapas remains a focus of Mexican and foreign investors, who have come to doubt Mr. Zedillo's leadership. After months in which officials confidently dismissed the possibility that the conflict might spread beyond the state, the country's sudden impoverishment has also prompted at least some of them to think again. **********Shortly after the uprising began, peasants within the Zapatistas' area of influence seized thousands of acres of private land. But last summer the occupations began spreading to areas where the rebels have never been. **********Since August, for example, the ski masks made famous by the insurgents have become a fixture at a sprawling coffee farm called Liquidambar, worn there by members of a radical peasant group that takes its name not from the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, but from his northern counterpart, Francisco (Pancho) Villa. **********Peasants from a semi-communal farm nearby suggested that they had simply taken advantage of the breakdown of order to take lands that they had long claimed as their own. \"We have always thought that this land would be ours,\" one of the leaders of the group, Tomas Perez, said through his mask as he sat on the estate's veranda. \"But we gave thanks on that 1st of January.\" **********But it was the Villa group rather than the nearby farmers that organized the occupation, bringing in scores of families from outside to work the farm as a collective. **********Leaders of the occupation claimed they had documents attesting to their rightful ownership of the land, but they did not produce any. Nor did they see any possible solution to their situation in the recent pledge by Mr. Zedillo's Government to begin to apply land-reform laws more forcefully. **********\"This is not our Government; it is the Government of the rich,\" said another leader of the collective, Audelino Chavez, 43. \"What is there to talk about with them?\" **********Ranchers and farmers have begun organizing more vigorously, both to lobby for the return of their properties and, in some instances, to act against the invaders. **********The takeovers of town halls by leftist peasant and political groups have brought on similar confrontations. **********Some of these have appeared almost entirely spontaneous, inspired to some extent by the Zapatistas, but clearly driven by local disputes. In the town of Amatenango del Valle last week, peasants who took over the municipal offices agreed to accept the results of a traditional Mayan Indian plebiscite, in which each side gathers its supporters to be counted one by one. When the vote was held on Friday, the peasants won, 1,095 bodies to 892. **********But the tactic has increasingly been pushed by the self-styled \"Government in Rebellion\" that Mr. Avendano leads. **********The parallel administration has encouraged the takeovers for much the same reasons that the Democratic Revolutionary Party has used them in other states where it claimed to have lost elections by fraud. In pressing for the ouster of the new Governor, Eduardo Robledo Rincon, Mr. Avendano has tried to make Chiapas ungovernable. **********The party ordered at least a temporary end to the takeovers on Thursday, after a clash between peasants and police two days earlier in the town of Chicomuselo, near the border with Guatemala, that left at least six people dead. The episode made it evident, however, that the state's polarization was already well advanced. **********At about midday Thursday the state attorney general, Jorge Enrique Hernandez Aguilar, arrived on the scene by helicopter. Upon failing to persuade the peasants to negotiate, he stormed away in disgust, apparently leaving behind orders to clear the town plaza. Numerous telephone calls requesting comment from him on the incident were not returned. **********Moments later, witnesses said, the local and state police, backed up by heavily armed ranchers, began the violence again. **********Mr. Hernandez blamed the violence squarely on Mr. Avendano, contending that he had ordered the takeover, and Mr. Avendano blamed the attorney general. **********The two men know one another well: Mr. Hernandez, a lawyer and former leader of the state's corn farmers, once helped Mr. Avendano edit one of his rabble-rousing newspapers. When Mr. Hernandez was jailed for two years in the late 1980's for leading protests by the farmers, Mr. Avendano was a spearhead of his defense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/business/mutual-funds-cold-comes-too-late-for-energy.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Middleton", "pub_date": "1995-02-12", "snippet": "PLAGUED by too many warm winter days, the companies that produce natural gas are getting the cold shoulder from Wall Street.

The cold that finally bundled up many areas of this country last week has come too late, experts say, to have much of an impact now. **********Indeed, the strongest segment of the energy sector currently is represented by the giant companies like Exxon and Unocal, and not because energy prices are expected to jump but because the big integrated companies have been cutting back costs. That situation, rather than higher revenues, has increased profits and allowed the giants to pump up their payouts. **********\"They are supported primarily by their high dividend yields,\" noted Steve Pfeifer, oil analyst for C. J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities. **********In the main, however, the portfolios of energy investors have lost a lot of steam. The average natural resources fund shed 8.4 percent of its value in the 12 months ended Feb. 3, according to Morningstar. **********Most of those with the heaviest concentration in energy did even worse. Three of the five with more than 75 percent of their assets in the sector are down in double digits. The managers of the other two, the Energy and Energy Services portfolios from Fidelity, can't take credit for doing better because each has been in place only a few months. **********The $35 million portfolio run by Daniel Rice of State Street Research Global Energy Fund is down even more than Vanguard's -- more than 16 percent for the A shares in the last 12 months. That is largely because, like Mr. von Metzsch, Mr. Rice foresees higher energy prices and is stressing the purest plays: independent exploration and production companies, as well as oil services companies like those that supply drilling rigs. **********\"We have good demand for oil, and the supply is being constrained,\" he said. \"The rig count is declining, capital budgets are being curtailed and people are shutting-in production.\" **********This is despite the fact that oil prices are $3 a barrel above their level of a year ago and worldwide economic growth promises to keep prices at least at their current level. **********As long as Iraq remains a pariah, Mr. Rice said, demand will quickly outstrip declining production. \"Our model suggests that Iraqi crude is necessary to keep oil prices below $20 a barrel by mid-1996,\" he added. **********One of the strongest arguments against a revival in energy stocks is that the price of oil is one of the targets of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate assault against inflation. It was, of course, the Arab oil embargo of 1973 that precipitated the worst post-war recession in the United States and led to nearly a decade of double-digit increases in consumer prices. **********But Mr. Rice countered: \"The key question is whether the Fed's monetary policy is going to impact demand in the fast-growing countries of the Far East, and I would guess not.\" It is in the Pacific Rim that oil consumption is rising most sharply. **********Natural-gas suppliers, on the other hand, will enter the spring with their inventories bulging, even if the weather now stays cold through the rest of the winter, and it will take six months after that for the surplus to be absorbed, Mr. von Metzsch said. **********\"But in the meantime,\" he added, \"capacity to produce gas in North America is not keeping up.\" So, probably by next winter, he said, the price will top $2 a thousand cubic feet, \"and a lot of people will become interested in the sector again.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/21/business/the-pitfalls-of-a-balanced-budget.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1995-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; Economic Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget", "print_headline": "The Pitfalls of a Balanced Budget", "body_text": " **********The unemployment rate, which peaked at 7.7 percent after the last recession, could have reached 9 percent if a balanced budget had been required, Government and private economists estimate. And a laid-off worker who collected $12,000 in unemployment pay might have received only $7,000 or so. **********Such estimates of the potential economic impact are not emphasized very much, however, in the debate over the balanced budget amendment. So far, the battle has focused on its value as a tool to shrink government or to discipline spending. But if the amendment is enacted, the side effect would be huge: a system that has softened recessions since the 1930's would be dismantled. **********\"There are risks associated with a balanced budget, and I don't think anyone should deny them,\" said William Hoagland, the Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee. \"Nevertheless, the debate on the floor has been dominated by what we must do to get the budget in balance, not what the risks of a balanced budget amendment might be.\" **********Mr. Hoagland expressed surprise that the biggest risk -- deeper, more painful recessions -- had not figured significantly in the debate, although Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, had called attention to this risk in several floor speeches. \"The reason must be that the advocates of a balanced budget see the benefits to the economy as far outweighing the negatives associated with cyclical downturns,\" Mr. Hoagland said. \"That must be what is going on.\" **********No benefit seems to hold more sway than the view that the amendment would shrink the Federal Government by restricting its power to tax and to spend. A dollar not collected and spent by the Government is a dollar left in the hands of the private sector. And the private sector invariably invests money more efficiently than the Government, this view holds. **********\"The people have spoken clearly that government is too big and we need to do something about it,\" said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist who favors smaller government. \"The problem is that the balanced budget amendment is a heavy-handed solution and risky.\" **********The biggest risk is to the nation's \"automatic stabilizers,\" which have made recessions less severe than they were in the century before World War II. The stabilizers, an outgrowth of Keynesian economics, work this way: When the economy weakens, outlays automatically rise for unemployment pay, food stamps, welfare and Medicaid. Simultaneously, as incomes fall, so do corporate and individual income tax payments. Both elements make more money available for spending, thus helping to pull the economy out of its slump. **********The problem, of course, is that the stabilizers make the deficit shoot up -- by roughly $65 billion as a result of the 1990-1991 recession, according to the Treasury Department. Under the balanced budget amendment, Congress and the Administration would be required to get the budget quickly back into balance, through spending cuts, higher tax rates, or a combination of the two -- perhaps even in the midst of a recession. **********\"The Government would become, almost inevitably, a destabilizer of the economy rather than a stabilizer,\" said Joseph Stiglitz, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Many economists share that view. **********Absent the stabilizers, every 73-cent drop in national income in the last recession would have become a $1 drop, said Bradford DeLong, deputy assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who as a Harvard economist studied this dynamic and recently updated his research. Of the 27 cents in cushioning, 20 cents came from falling tax revenue and 7 cents from the higher spending. **********Economists outside the Government offer similar estimates. Ray Fair of Yale University, for example, said for every $10 billion decline in national income during a recession, the deficit rises by $2 billion, as the stabilizers kick in with their higher spending and lower tax revenue. **********\"We ought not to give up the stabilizers,\" Professor Fair said. \"That would be very Draconian.\" **********Nearly every economist agrees that the American economy requires, if not stabilizers, some substitute method for offsetting recessions in an era of balanced budgets. And those who favor the amendment are no exception. **********\"It would be a disaster to lose the stabilizers,\" said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, who endorses the amendment as a necessary step if the nation is to afford the high cost of Social Security and Medicare for the baby boom generation, which reaches retirement age early in the next century. **********Mr. Bergsten notes that the amendment, as now worded, would permit Congress to bring back the stabilizers by a three-fifths vote in both houses. The vote would permit the necessary deficit spending to finance the stabilizers. **********While a three-fifths vote is a big hurdle, Mr. Bergsten and others argue that Congress would get used to authorizing the necessary deficits during recessions. Nevertheless, he would prefer a different solution. Once through the painful process of balancing the budget by 2002, as required by the amendment, then the Government should run budget surpluses in years of strong economic growth and full employment, Mr. Bergsten said. **********The surpluses would cover the rising costs of the stabilizers during recessions. \"You could go down to a balanced budget in the hard years, and still give the economy a little stimulus,\" he said. **********The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the surplus needed to pay for the stabilizers during a recession as severe as that of 1981-1982, the worst since World War II, would be 1 percent of the national income during robust periods of full employment, and perhaps as much as 1.5 percent. **********That would mean an annual surplus in today's dollars of $70 billion to $100 billion, rather than the nearly $200 billion of so in annual deficits expected under current policy. Most of the $200 billion is to help pay for programs like highway construction and new weaponry that have fixed costs and do not fluctuate with the ups and downs of the economy, as unemployment pay, food stamps, tax revenues and the other stabilizers do. **********Some economists -- including Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics who is with the Hoover Institute -- hold that the stabilizers, despite the ballyhoo, are no longer so important. The Federal Reserve, through monetary policy, can more than offset their disappearance by lowering interest rates an extra notch or two to give the economy an additional stimulus in hard times. **********\"I have looked at many episodes in the world in which monetary policy went one way and fiscal policy the other, and I have never found a case in which monetary policy did not dominate,\" Mr. Friedman said. He favors a balanced budget amendment that would shrink the Federal Government by putting a ceiling on the tax increases that could be enacted to balance the budget. **********But the Clinton Administration and even Federal Reserve officials question whether monetary policy could alone handle the task of reviving an economy in recession. The stabilizers, they note, kick in automatically -- before the Federal Reserve and most economists often realize that the economy is falling toward recession. **********A recession might be well along and getting deeper before the Fed recognized the problem and began to drop rates. The lower rates, in turn, would not be felt in the economy for a year to 18 months, the traditional lag. And even if the Fed acted quickly enough, the economy would behave in new and different ways without the stabilizers. **********\"My guess is that we would get it wrong the first time we went into recession, making that recession much deeper than it should be,\" said a Federal Reserve official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. \"But we would learn from that experience and do a better job thereafter.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/business/business-digest-210095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Bank of Tokyo to Merge With Mitsubishi Bank **********The Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank have agreed to a merge that would create the world's largest bank, with $819 billion in assets.

It would also rank among the two or three largest deals to date in any industry, behind the $30 billion merger of R. J. Reynolds and Nabisco completed in 1989 and neck-and-neck with the $14 billion combination of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990. **********Together, the companies would have $12.2 billion in worldwide sales, and would dominate the treatment of ulcers, AIDS and herpes. Their combined worldwide market share would be 5.3 percent, Glaxo said, compared with 3.9 percent for the current leader, Merck & Company. **********Wellcome, the world's 20th-largest drug company, has long emphasized its desire to remain independent, and said today that it would study the Glaxo offer and consider possible alternatives. **********But Glaxo, already the world's second-largest drug company after Merck, clearly has the upper hand, having made an offer that analysts described as being at the top end of the industry valuations. It also won a commitment from Wellcome's largest shareholder, the Wellcome Trust, an independent charity, to sell its 39.5 percent. **********Indeed, analysts said a Glaxo-Wellcome merger would deal with a hard reality: Every day, it gets more difficult for the companies to stay single.  [ Page D6. ] **********Glaxo said it was offering $:10.25 -- about $16.20 -- for each Wellcome share in cash and Glaxo stock, which is 49 percent higher than the closing price of Wellcome's stock on Friday. **********In London, shares of Wellcome closed today at $:9.61. Shares of Glaxo tumbled 44.5 pence, to $:5.99. The drop reflected the concern among investors about the high price being offered by Glaxo and the possibility that the earnings per share of a combined Glaxo-Wellcome could fall, at least in the short run, as it absorbed the costs of the merger. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, the American depository receipts of Wellcome rose $4.375, to $15.125, while the Glaxo A.D.R.'s fell $1.375, to $19.125. **********Glaxo struck at a time when Wellcome's shares had been pushed down by a decision earlier this month by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Two committees of the agency voted not to recommend approval for over-the-counter versions of Wellcome's biggest-selling drug, Zovirax, a treatment for herpes, which will lose its patent protection in two years. **********Glaxo said it had been developing a strategy to deal with the industry's consolidation for a year, and had evaluated a wide range of possible takeover targets. **********Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, said Wellcome was attractive because it had relatively few products that overlapped with Glaxo's and because it was as big a company as Glaxo could easily absorb. **********Sir Richard said he believed the combined companies could be more competitive by cutting duplicated costs for administration, sales and research and development. Drug companies are under intense pressure from governments, hospitals, doctors and other health care providers to hold down prices in the United States, Europe and around the world. **********\"We don't want to sit around and be carried along by consolidation,\" Sir Richard said at a news conference here. \"We wish to be leaders in the process.\" **********A Glaxo-Wellcome deal would bring together companies that have strong reputations for scientific research as well as looming business challenges. Glaxo is the maker of the world's best-selling drug, the ulcer treatment Zantac. But it will lose the patent protection on Zantac in the coming years and faces increasing competition from low-cost generic alternatives. **********Wellcome is best known as the producer of the anti-AIDS drug AZT, though Zovirax, its herpes treatment, is far bigger, accounting for a third of the company's sales and nearly half of operating profits. Studies in the last year have suggested that AZT is less effective in the early treatment of AIDS than previously believed, leading to a sharp drop in the drug's sales. **********The companies have been working closely in the development of AIDS treatment based on combinations of drugs. The most promising combinations involve Wellcome's AZT and 3TC, an anti-viral drug licensed by Glaxo from Biochem Pharma. **********Both companies have been trying to expand their over-the-counter, or nonprescription, drug businesses. Both have joint ventures with the Warner-Lambert Company to help them distribute nonprescription versions of their drugs. **********The rumors of Glaxo's interest in Wellcome were widespread on the London Stock Exchange on Friday. But Glaxo still managed to put Wellcome on the defensive by clinching a deal late Sunday with the Wellcome Trust, which had owned 100 percent of Wellcome until it began selling its stake through public offerings in 1986. **********The trust had always been seen as an ally of Wellcome in any hostile takeover situation, despite having no formal links to the company other than the stake it owned. The trust can back out of its deal with Glaxo under certain conditions, including the emergence of a higher offer or failure to win court approval. The trust can also back out before Thursday night if the Wellcome board can convince it to do so. **********It was unclear whether Wellcome knew that the trust had begun negotiating with Glaxo last week. The chief executive of Wellcome, John W. Robb, who learned about the bid in an early-morning telephone call from his counterpart at Glaxo, Sir Richard, immediately conferred with his board. Mr. Robb later released a statement saying that Wellcome's directors were \"evaluating all available options for the company and its shareholders.\" **********Analysts said Mr. Robb had little chance of averting a takeover, given the rich price offered by Glaxo. The only realistic alternative to Glaxo's deal would be a higher offer from another company, and there are relatively few drug makers that could afford the $15 billion it would take to win Wellcome. **********Analysts said it was possible that American companies like Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb or Pfizer might take a hard look at Wellcome. European companies like Ciba-Geigy or Hoechst are also possible suitors, analysts said. **********Glaxo valued its offer at 23 times Wellcome's earnings last year, at the high end of what had been paid for drug companies in recent years, said Paul Diggle, an analyst at SGST Securities in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/mesa-board-backs-pickens-vs-dissidents.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1995-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mesa Board Backs Pickens Vs.

Boone Pickens. It refused to make more than minor revisions in a plan to fend off takeovers. The so-called poison-pill plan prevents hostile investors from raising their combined stake past 10 percent by giving other shareholders the right to buy more stock at a 50 percent discount when the 10 percent threshold is reached. The board also heard investment bankers describe plans for the company's whole or partial sale. **********The board ignored demands by David Batchelder and another board member who represented the hostile shareholders that the board abandon the takeover defenses and plot the company's future independently of Mr. Pickens. **********As Mr. Batchelder finds himself mired in a Mesa lawsuit and apparently daunted by the poison pill, Mesa is speeding its efforts to revive its stock price and avoid defaulting on debts due next year. In a statement after today's meeting, Mr. Pickens, without mentioning the Batchelder group, stressed his urgency. **********\"We've clearly placed the pursuit of sale, merger and restructuring alternatives on the fast track,\" Mr. Pickens said. **********Mr. Batchelder wants to call a special shareholders meeting to unseat the board, but the poison-pill plan requires him to formally solicit the votes of other shareholders to do so. **********Mr. Batchelder represents Marvin Davis, the Beverly Hills billionaire who owns 3.9 percent of Mesa's stock, and Dennis R. Washington, the Montana investor who owns 5.5 percent. **********Mesa has sued them, accusing them of failing to meet disclosure requirements after they began accumulating shares last year. Fighting the suit has required the Batchelder group to produce piles of documents and prepare to give detailed depositions. In a sign that Mesa has slowed the investors' advance, they recently agreed to extend Mr. Batchelder's profit-sharing arrangement, due to expire at the end of 1995, to the end of 1996. **********As a result, Mesa, which is based in Irving, a Dallas suburb, has apparently secured enough time to sort through its options instead of immediately meeting investors' demands. Its investment bankers, from Lehman Brothers, presented some of those options today, with a list of dozens of national and international oil and natural gas companies that might want to buy the company or some of its properties. **********The board lowered its takeover defenses just a few inches today by deciding that anyone bidding for its shares would have to buy 51 percent, down from 75 percent, to avoid generating the issue of discounted stock. The board also clarified that while a purchaser must line up financing for the company's shares, advance commitments were not necessary to assume Mesa's $1.2 billion in debts.

The previous high was 3.1 percent, recorded in May 1987 during an economic slowdown caused by the sharp appreciation of the yen after the 1985 Plaza Accord. **********Economists said the jobless rate was likely to increase further in the coming months because the recent surge of the yen had once again weakened an economy that a few months ago seemed on the verge of recovering from a three-year slump. **********\"This is the beginning of a new era, of a new cycle,\" said Jesper Koll, chief economist for J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. He predicted unemployment would reach 4.3 percent in about a year. **********To be sure, Japan's jobless rate is minuscule compared with the 5.8 percent recorded in the United States in April and European rates that range from 8 to 12 percent or even higher. And a rise from 3 percent to 4 percent is not likely to tear apart Japan's strong social fabric. **********Still, an increase would be a psychological blow to a country that has prided itself on providing near full employment. Japan's Government and its leading companies have \"sort of been committing ourselves to defending the 3 percent unemployment rate with honor,\" Hiroshi Okuda, an executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, said recently. **********Rising joblessness could bring added pressure on Japan's already unpopular and fragile coalition Government, which is hobbled by internal fighting and a lack of strong leadership from Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. **********Economists say Japan's unemployment figures are understated. Anyone who works an hour in the final week of a month is considered fully employed that month. The figures do not count jobless women who return to being housewives rather than looking for new employment. Women, who are often restricted to clerical work and serving tea anyway, are usually not entitled to lifetime employment. **********The jobless situation is hitting young workers the hardest. Among people aged 15 to 24, the unemployment rate is 6.4 percent for men and 6.8 percent among women. **********That is because Japan's lifetime employment system preserves jobs for those who already have them, forcing companies to cut costs by curtailing hiring of graduating students. April is the time when graduating students enter the work force, but this year, about 160,000 could not find jobs. **********Some commentators have suggested that the trouble young people have been having finding jobs might have contributed to the spread of religious cults like Aum Shinrikyo, which the police say is responsible for the poison gas attack in the Tokyo subways in March. **********The fear of spreading unemployment is one factor behind Japan's hard-line stance in automobile trade talks with the United States. Japanese auto companies are reluctant to buy more American parts because that could hurt the already struggling Japanese parts suppliers. (On the other hand, if Washington places 100 percent tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars, that too will lead to job losses in Japan.) **********A big question is whether the need for new cost cutting to cope with the strong yen will mean the end of the lifetime employment system, in which major companies go out of their way to avoid dismissing full-time male employees. Some analysts say lifetime employment may fray but will probably not break, in that there will not be huge dismissals of employees. **********\"There has consistently been erosion of lifetime employment,\" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. \"I don't think there will be a big bang and it will suddenly be ended.\" **********The rise in unemployment has been caused by a decline in manufacturing jobs, as the high yen reduces production in Japan or forces Japanese companies to relocate overseas. In April, manufacturing employment was down 3.6 percent, or 550,000 jobs, from a year earlier. **********Until now, the workers who left manufacturing have been finding jobs in the service sector.

Terpil. **********The Government has hired lawyers to see if it could work out a deal with the families of the victims of the Pan Am bombing. All these measures have failed to shake the resolve of the United Nations, which demands that the two suspects be extradited to Britain or the United States for trial. **********Colonel Qaddafi, calling himself a \"scapegoat,\" now says he will live within the confines of the sanctions, defy them when he can and count on the instability in the region to prevent further measures, like an embargo on oil sales. **********\"The feeling in Europe is that we can't destabilize another country in North Africa,\" a European ambassador said. \"Whatever Qaddafi is, he provides a measure of calm. He helps protect the Algerian and Egyptian regimes by cooperating with their security forces. There is no real successor to Qaddafi. It would be a big and dangerous illusion to think one could back outside forces to take over from him.\" **********United Nations sanctions were imposed on Libya in 1992 after it refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died. The sanctions include an arms, trade and travel embargo. **********Colonel Qaddafi has recently sidelined his regular army units, on which he spent more than $20 billion on mainly Soviet-made armaments over the last 20 years, with new structures he calls \"armed people.\" And longtime associates, like Abdussalam Jalloud, who was his chief lieutenant, have disappeared from public view. **********\"He appears to have neutralized any opposition that might come from within the army,\" the ambassador said. \"His army has little role now, and most the military hardware he bought is rusting in the desert.\" **********When 26-year-old Captain Qaddafi took power in a bloodless coup in 1969, he and his fellow officers promised an Arab renaissance that called for defiance of the West and the liberation of Palestine. He challenged major Western companies over oil pricing and won, inspiring other Arab states to begin the 1973 oil price explosion. **********Libya became a port of call for everyone from the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal and guerrilla groups in Africa to leaders of the American Indian movement and Marxist revolutionaries from Central America. Hundreds of millions of dollars were doled out by Libya.  And Libyan intelligence agents were repeatedly linked to terrorist attacks, including the 1989 bombing of a French DC-10 airliner in which 171 people died. **********The oil wealth, which at one point reached $23 billion a year, financed one disastrous scheme after another, from the attempt to create an army of a million people out of a population of five million, to the expenditure of some $20 billion to build a huge irrigation project, still under construction, that few experts expect to work. **********But little more than the frequent calls for holy war and Colonel Qaddafi's self-proclaimed desert socialism remains. **********With the fall of oil prices, income barely covers the country's imports. The adventurism appears to have ceased. **********And both Colonel Qaddafi and the country he governs appear more intent on economic survival. **********Wages have been frozen for 15 years, and prices for basic goods have risen by as much as sevenfold over the last two years.

At the same time, Mr. Greenspan said nothing to disabuse Wall Street of that notion. In comments that echoed those of other Federal Reserve officials in recent days, he clearly implied that the economy remained too robust to count higher inflation out. **********Tightness in the labor market and other strains on the economy could \"lead to some deterioration in the price picture in the near term,\" Mr. Greenspan said, \"but any such deterioration should be contained if the Federal Reserve remains vigilant.\" **********Still, the financial markets saw glimmers of hope in his testimony that next week's expected increase could be the last for a while. Stock and bond prices rose. **********The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last February in its effort to prevent what it views as a runaway economic expansion in excess of 4 percent annual growth from causing prices to accelerate. By gradually raising rates, the central bank hopes to squeeze consumer and business borrowing enough to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace of roughly 2.5 percent. **********But the danger -- which economists at the Chrysler Corporation and other industrial companies are increasingly worried about -- is that the Federal Reserve may be overreacting and could topple the economy into another recession by tightening its monetary grip too much. **********Even though inflation has been running at less than 3 percent for three straight years -- the best record since the early 1960's -- the Federal Reserve is worried that the economy has been too strong recently for its own good. **********\"I see it as crucial that we extend the recent trend of low and, hopefully, declining inflation in the years ahead,\" Mr. Greenspan added. While the prospects are \"fundamentally good,\" there are grounds for \"some concern.\" Mr. Greenspan cited, for example, the fact that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.4 percent, in contrast to that of the late 1980's \"when wages and prices accelerated appreciably.\" While consumer prices and the prices of goods going out the factory door have barely budged, he said, the costs of parts and supplies at earlier stages of production were starting to accelerate. **********Mr. Greenspan also used the occasion to lecture Congress about the risks of widening the Federal budget gap. With both Republicans and Democrats proposing tax cuts this year, Mr. Greenspan contended in response to questions that the budget deficit was the nation's No. 1 economic problem. He urged lawmakers not to make it worse, insisting that any revenue loss should be minimal and, in any case, should be made up by equal or greater spending cuts. **********\"We're going to have chronic fiscal problems if we don't cut spending,\" Mr. Greenspan said, declaring tax cuts to be of low priority and best accomplished by lowering tax rates. By contrast, the current proposals, from both Republicans and from President Clinton, rely primarily on tax credits that would do nothing to lower rates in ways that might provide greater incentives for work and savings. **********Mr. Greenspan also said he was \"a little chagrined\" that the findings of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform were not taken more seriously. The 32-member commission, headed by Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, found that spending on Social Security and other Federal benefit programs were rising at unsustainable rates. But the commission disbanded at year's end after failing to agree on a remedy it could recommend to the President. **********Mr. Greenspan said much of the so-called inflation premium in rates on long-term bonds would simply evaporate if action were taken on this front and would result in lower interest rates. **********Returning to a theme he expounded earlier this month, to the delight of Republicans looking to free up money for tax cuts, Mr. Greenspan said that the deficit could be narrowed simply by eliminating the bias in the Consumer Price Index that causes overpayment of entitlement benefits and an excessive inflation adjustment in tax rates. **********Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed believed the index overstated inflation from 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points, recommended today that Congress specify a commitment to maintain the purchasing power of retirees while eliminating the bias that overpays them. **********Mr. Greenspan also recommended that the retirement age be moved back to reflect changes in life expectancy. **********In commenting on the risks of inflation, Mr. Greenspan pointed out that more companies were buying materials in advance because they thought they might become more expensive or in short supply. Reports of worker shortages have become \"more common,\" he said. These are all signs pointing to the prospect of greater price increases. **********On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan said, \"trends in money and credit expansion have remained subdued\" and have not yet become the financial tinder needed to kindle higher inflation. **********Committee members made little effort to dissuade the Fed from pushing rates up again despite pleas from auto makers and some other industries that the cumulative restraint -- much of which has yet to be fully felt -- could prove too much. **********An exception was Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, who said that higher rates would make it even harder for Mexico to resolve its financial crisis. Mr. Greenspan responded by saying that Mexico would benefit from the Fed's proper focus, the long-term growth of the United States economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/24/business/company-news-unitel-communications-to-cut-950-jobs-this-year.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITEL COMMUNICATIONS TO CUT 950 JOBS THIS YEAR", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; UNITEL COMMUNICATIONS TO CUT 950 JOBS THIS YEAR", "body_text": " **********Unitel Communications Inc., the ailing Canadian long-distance telephone company, said yesterday that it would eliminate 950 jobs this year as part of a restructuring designed to cut costs.

Nowadays, the five major powers seem to spend more energy quarreling among themselves about Bosnia than exerting pressure on the Muslims, Serbs and Croats. **********In the type of understatement diplomats are known for, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Frasure, the chief American representative to the group, said, \"I would be misleading you if I tried to convince you that the contact group as an organization is working with perfection and smoothness right now.\" **********There are as many differences within the group as there are members.

But Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, told President Milosevic last month to grant recognition only after sanctions were removed. **********\"The idea for the contact group was we were going to come up with a position, stick to it and use our leverage to make it happen,\" one American diplomat said. \"The contact group has stumbled badly, primarily because Russia has often gone off on its own. The Russians have used the group as a means to advance the Serbs' agenda, rather than to impose the contact group's position.\" **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew to Europe today to meet with the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, and to meet with Mr. Kozyrev on Wednesday and Thursday in Geneva. **********Aides accompanying Mr. Christopher said one purpose of the trip is to revive the contact group and push the stalled peace negotiations forward.

It helped persuade Mr. Milosevic to close Serbia's border with Bosnian Serbs, a closing that American officials say is full of holes. In perhaps its most important accomplishment, it put together a peace plan that would give Bosnia's Government 51 percent of Bosnia's territory and the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent. **********Bosnia's Government has accepted the plan, while Mr. Milosevic has given it his grudging, partial blessing. But the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia's land, have rejected it. **********Bosnian officials have repeatedly criticized the contact group for creeping appeasement of the Serbs. They note that the contact group at first said Bosnian Serbs must accept the group's peace plan, but then it said they need only accept it in principle as a point of departure for negotiations in which the Muslims and Serbs might swap some land. **********The best way to reinvigorate the contact group, some diplomats say, would be to have the foreign ministers of the five countries meet regularly, a move that could increase the group's visibility and press members to thrash out their differences."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/business/translating-a-solution.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Translating a Solution", "print_headline": "Translating a Solution", "body_text": " **********The damage of a falling dollar to the economy may seem negligible.

This morning, a similar aircraft was hit as it approached the airfield on a flight from a military base in the city of Anuradhapura. The plane crashed, killing all 52 people aboard, including three Sri Lankan journalists. **********At first, Sri Lankan military officials had said the crash on Friday could have been caused by an electrical storm that was sweeping the air base.

The crippled aircraft attempted to reach the airfield but crashed a mile short of the runway, the statement said. \"The aircraft was completely destroyed and all passengers, including the crew, killed,\" it said. **********The two incidents appeared to confirm that the Tamil rebels have acquired ground-to-air missiles for the first time in the 12-year-old war. If so, Government forces may face much greater difficulties in maintaining bases in areas of rebel military predominance, particularly in the Jaffna region, which have relied heavily on resupply by air. **********The naval wing of the rebel force has also shown greater strength and mobility, threatening the Sri Lankan Navy's ability to maintain its dominance off the coast. **********But the military implications were compounded by the sharpening political quandary facing the President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who won two quick elections last year -- an August parliamentary vote and a presidential contest in November -- on a promise to seek peace. **********Fighting stopped soon after the August vote, and a formal cease-fire was declared in January. The truce was abruptly broken 11 days ago by the rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who began one of their most ambitious offensives of the war. **********Although the truce agreement specified that neither side would go back to war without giving 72 hours' notice, the first attack came less than two hours after the leader of the Tigers, Vellupillai Prabakharan, notified Mrs. Kumaratunga of the rebels' intention to break the truce. **********The sinking of two Government gunboats in Trincomalee harbor by Tiger saboteurs, which killed 12 Sri Lankan sailors and 4 of the attackers, was followed by attacks on Government military bases in contested areas along the northern and eastern coasts that killed more than 120 Government soldiers and rebel fighters. **********With Government losses mounting, Mrs. Kumaratunga has come under growing pressure from within her coalition Government and from right-wing opposition leaders to mount a counteroffensive. Mrs. Kumaratunga, in Paris for a World Bank meeting, left for home immediately after receiving news of the second plane attack today, and went directly to an emergency meeting of her security council. **********On Friday, however, she appeared to oppose any harsh response. \"We only think this is a temporary setback,\" she said. \"We are trying very hard to contain the situation from spilling over into a war, another war.\" **********Mrs. Kumaratunga has proposed that the conflict, which has resulted in more than 30,000 deaths since 1983, be ended by a new power-sharing arrangement under which Tamils, accounting for about a sixth of the population of 18 million people, would gain control of a semiautonomous region covering wide areas of northern Sri Lanka and parts of the eastern coast. **********But the Tiger leadership has refused to discuss a political settlement, insisting on prior military concessions. **********The latest attacks appear to make Government military concessions improbable, particularly the one Mr. Prabakharan cited in breaking the cease-fire: the dismantling of the Pooneryn base that controls sea approaches to the city of Jaffna, which is controlled by the rebels. Mr. Prabakharan appears to be gambling that by inflicting a series of costly losses on Government forces, he can force Mrs. Kumaratunga's hand. **********But growing unease among some of the Sri Lankan leader's senior ministers at the apparent inflexibility of the Tiger leadership may force Mrs. Kumaratunga to take a harder line. **********One step that is said to have been discussed among Sri Lankan military leaders, but resisted by the Government, is an appeal to India, which has the largest military force in the region. **********India could be asked to impose a naval quarantine on the sea approaches to Jaffna in an attempt to cut off military supplies that reach the Tigers across the narrow Palk Strait, which separates Jaffna from the coastline of Tamil Nadu, the Tamil-dominated state in southern India."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/business/new-ibm-chip-for-digital-video-images.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New I.B.M.

Scott Fitzgerald had it only partly right. The rich are different from you and me. But it's the rich corporate insiders who are the most different of all. **********Any doubters should look at what's going on at a real estate investment trust called MIP Properties. Right now, the company's board is pushing a deal that treats executives who managed MIP into the ground too kindly and allows a former director to purchase company properties at bargain prices. As for the investors? Many of them -- particularly those poor souls who bought shares at the offering 10 years ago -- will be saddled with huge losses. **********To understand the full story, start at the beginning. When MIP -- then known as Mortgage Investments Plus -- came public in 1985, it appeared to have a lot going for it. It had organized a small but diversified portfolio of properties in California that seemed healthy. **********Better still, it had a corporate relationship with the Weyerhaeuser Company, the respected timber products concern in Tacoma, Wash., that was looking to diversify. A number of MIP's directors hailed from Weyerhaeuser, including John W. Creighton Jr., the timber giant's president. That connection proved helpful in selling the deal to small investors in Washington state, who were among the heaviest buyers. **********But all the promise disappeared. After starting to trade at $10 a share, MIP's stock fell as fast as you can say, \"Timber!\" Within a year, it had lost about 25 percent of its value -- quite a feat, since real estate prices were still rising. Apparently, the market believed that, regardless of the quality of the property, it was not being managed effectively. **********The stock fell to as low as 50 cents a share in the early 1990's. A new strategic plan was adopted in 1991; by 12 months ago, MIP's stock were trading at more than a dollar a share. Still, a 90 percent wipe-out for investors was hardly something for management to strut about. So, in April 1994, MIP put itself up for sale. **********After one potential deal fell apart, a bid came across the transom in December from Stephen C. Markoff, a real estate investor who was both a company director and its largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake. In his bid, Mr. Markoff offered to pay $2.525 a share in cash and notes. **********While that offer was being considered, another arrived: JER Partners, an arm of a Virginia-based real estate concern, proposed an all-cash offer that the company said was close in price to the Markoff proposal, subject to certain conditions. **********The MIP directors selected JER over Mr. Markoff in February, having decided that the all-cash deal from an independent bidder was preferable. The decision left Mr. Markoff unhappy, and he resigned from the board and all its committees. **********Suddenly, the hopes for a sale looked bleak. Under its corporate charter, MIP could only be sold if a sale were approved by 80 percent or more of the outstanding shares. And now, without the support of Mr. Markoff, the company's largest shareholder, JER would have trouble securing the necessary votes. **********Here's where things get dicey: In March and April, MIP Properties continued negotiating the terms of a deal with JER. At the same time, JER began its own separate talks with Mr. Markoff to find out what would make him happy. **********In May, everything came together. The board of MIP approved a deal with JER for $2.475 a share. At almost the same time, Mr. Markoff and JER struck a side deal: He would vote in favor of the sale if JER sold him a number of properties MIP owned. Under the agreement, the sale of the properties would take place immediately after the acquisition of MIP was completed. **********What about a simple real estate purchase was enough to get Mr. Markoff to vote for the JER deal? Big potential profits. JER has agreed to sell the properties for significantly less than their stated value. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Markoff will pay about $1.8 million for the properties -- even though MIP says that the net book value of that real estate, as far as its auditors are concerned, is $3.3 million. **********In other words, to keep a former MIP director from blocking the transaction, JER is willing to give him a benefit that isn't being offered to any other shareholder. Meanwhile, the shareholders are seeing their property valued at a price that is arguably far less than they might receive in a totally arms-length transaction. In its filings, MIP contends that the value of those parcels on the company's books might not be equivalent to what they can fetch on the market. But the fact is, no one will ever know. **********\"This is clearly not fair,\" said John Hinson, the president of North Bay Group, a real estate and investment firm that owns about two percent of MIP Properties. \"All of us shareholders who aren't being offered this preferred deal are harmed by virtue of getting a lower price for our shares.\" **********MIP characterizes its deal with JER as a merger, but Mr. Hinson says it is nothing more than a cash tender offer for shares. And, on the face of it, he appears to be right -- investors get no stake in the merged company, but are simply paid to cash in their shares. **********That's important, because a tender offer must follow rules that insure every investor receive the same consideration. Mr. Hinson has argued in a suit filed weeks ago that the transaction with Mr. Markoff has made the JER deal a two-tiered tender offer, with special benefits going to a single shareholder. **********Telephone calls to Carl Gregory, MIP's chairman and chief executive, were not returned. But in a statement on Thursday, MIP said that the company did not believe that Mr. Hinson's lawsuit had any merit. **********Still, making the proposed deal more suspect is the fact that a number of senior managers pushing the deal will do nicely when it's finished. For example, Mr. Gregory will receive a bonus and other cash benefits totalling almost $180,000 when the merger is completed. Directors and executives who had been awarded shares as deferred compensation will be able to cash out. **********So now, the shareholders have to decide whether to approve JER's bid of $2.475 a share at a meeting called for Sept. 27. **********It's a tough dilemma: With nothing else on the table, shareholders may feel they have no choice but to hold their noses and vote for the deal, with the full knowledge that they might have gotten more. Then, they can hope that Mr. Hinson's lawsuit becomes a class action and is successful. **********Of course, there are sure to be shareholders who believe that the MIP directors picked the best possible deal, and will gladly vote their shares in favor. After all, even though Fitzgerald was only partly right, P.T.

J. Simpson is not a household name in France.  Here, it is the trial of Bernard Tapie, a French Socialist politician, that has the country enthralled. **********Mr. Tapie, a former Urban Affairs Minister, is accused of fixing a match involving the Marseilles soccer club he owned in 1993. More to the point, he is accused of lying to cover it up, a charge he hardly bothers to deny. **********\"I have lied in good faith,\" he told the judge as his trial continued Monday after his alibi, provided by a fellow Socialist, Jacques Mellick, crumbled. **********That was because Mr. Mellick, who is a Member of Parliament and also a former Government minister, admitted Friday night that he had lied under oath about being somewhere else with Mr. Tapie when the fix was allegedly put in. Mr. Mellick has been in jail since the weekend. **********The prosecutor asked for an 18-month sentence for Mr. Tapie. **********It was just one more episode in an unending drama of political corruption, bribery and attempts to manipulate justice that is gripping France even more than the campaign to elect a successor to the Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand. **********Whoever of the three leading candidates is elected -- the front-runner, the conservative Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, his fellow conservative, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, or the Socialist, Lionel Jospin -- will face a growing crisis of confidence in the credibility and integrity of the French political process, for no party is untouched. **********Concern about where this will lead does not stop at the French border. \"Is France headed into an Italian-style political crisis?\" a German policy maker said recently. **********Thierry Jean-Pierre, a former investigating judge, does not think France is about to throw away its political system the way Italy did after its established parties were discredited by links to organized crime. **********\"The level of overall corruption is lower than in Italy, and we don't have the Mafia based here,\" said Mr. Jean-Pierre, the investigating magistrate in a scandal about alleged kickbacks to a consulting firm whose sole function turned out to be financing the Socialist Party. **********\"But the general setup is the same, all the big companies and all the political parties are involved in it, and everybody has gotten used to thinking of corruption as being normal,\" he said. **********Until the past year or two, it was also considered normal for French politicians to approve periodic amnesty laws letting themselves off the hook. They approved one in 1988 and another in 1990 as an amendment to a law reforming the system of financing political parties. **********For Mr. Jean-Pierre and some of his fellow investigating magistrates, that was the last straw. \"We were shocked that Government ministers could use the law this brazenly to escape prosecution,\" Mr. Jean-Pierre said. **********Initially, the Socialists of President Mitterrand seemed the most deeply implicated, and in parliamentary elections in March 1993 a center-right coalition under Prime Minister Balladur swept to victory. But the conservatives are now just as much under fire as the Socialists, with three former ministers of the current Government forced into resignation last year under clouds of suspicion. **********At center stage in alleged wrongdoing by the Socialist Party is a consulting firm called Urba. Until it was exposed and forced to stop its operations in 1990, Urba was the indispensable key for concerns hoping to land public works contracts in Socialist-run regions of France. **********\"The consultancy firms kept books listing all the companies in every area, and if any of them wanted to bid on a major public contract, they had to pay money to be considered,\" Mr. Jean-Pierre said. \"Then the company that got the contract had to kick back 3 to 4 percent of it to the consultancy firm.\" **********Urba was hardly unique in the French party political system -- it was just among the first corruption cases to be uncovered. **********This month, at Saint-Brieuc in Brittany, the Socialist Party chairman, Henri Emmanuelli, and 16 other defendants were tried for illegal financing practices from 1988 to 1991, when Mr. Emmanuelli was party treasurer. **********Mr. Emmanuelli said that he had met Urba's chairman, Gerard Monate, two or three times a year to discuss the party budget, but denied that he knew the details about how the firm came up with the money. **********Yves Boivin, the prosecutor in the case, said: \"Of course you knew very well how Urba worked. As party treasurer, you made the decisions.\" He asked the court to impose a two-year suspended sentence on Mr. Emmanuelli. The verdict will be rendered after the decisive second round of the presidential elections on May 7. **********The Socialist candidate, Mr. Jospin, a former Education Minister, has not been personally tainted. **********Neither have the two conservatives in the race, Mayor Chirac and Prime Minister Balladur, but their Rally for the Republic Party has been as deeply implicated in sleazy dealings as the Socialists. **********A former conservative Internal Security Minister, Robert Pandraud, was accused this month of being involved in siphoning money for the party from the public housing authority of the Paris region while he was Mayor Chirac's chief of staff from 1983 to 1986. **********Prosecutors say the setup was for companies allowed to do work for the housing authority to submit inflated bills so they could make kickbacks to the party functionaries who had made the contracts possible. **********Mr. Pandraud denied knowing any such thing, but another former close aide of Mayor Chirac, Michel Roussin, was forced last year to resign as Foreign Aid Minister in Mr. Balladur's Cabinet after his initials were found next to a receipt for $52,000 on a list of such payments. **********Mayor Chirac has not been charged with involvement in such payments, which also used party consultancy firms as conduits. **********Mr. Chirac's poll ratings have risen to the point where he is now favored to win in both rounds of the election, on April 23 and May 7, no matter who else runs. His fellow conservative, Prime Minister Balladur, has seen his ratings steadily fall, partly because of the corruption scandals. **********Mr. Balladur and his chief Cabinet supporter, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, were accused late last year of trying to remove Eric Halphen, the energetic chief investigating judge in the cases involving the conservative party. **********The removal of the judge was suggested after his father-in-law, Dr. Jean-Pierre Marechal, was arrested in December after accepting a bag containing $200,000 at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris from Didier Schuller, a conservative member of Parliament the judge was investigating. **********The police said Dr. Marechal had asked for the money in return for getting his son-in-law, the judge, not to investigate Mr. Schuller. \"He insisted on coming to see me at the airport,\" Dr. Marechal said later.  \"He gave me a blue duty-free bag with a box inside. I thought it was cigars.\" **********In February, the Paris Court of Appeals found that the arrest had been tantamount to entrapment of Dr. Marechal by Mr. Schuller and the police. The case collapsed after the court ordered the transcripts destroyed. **********Other scandals have involved the French Communist Party, which is accused of having its own consulting firm to provide finances, and one of the current Government's coalition partners, the Republican Party, has been reportedly implicated in illict financing by the electronic giant Alcatel-C.I.T., despite denials by all concerned. **********\"We have just begun to scratch the surface,\" Mr. Jean-Pierre said.  \"All the biggest industrial groups in France have been involved, and there is corruption in every economic sector.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/15/business/company-reports-profit-fell-58-at-toys-r-us-in-2d-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 432, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profit Fell 58% At Toys 'R' Us In 2d Quarter", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS; Profit Fell 58% At Toys 'R' Us In 2d Quarter", "body_text": " **********Toys \"R\" Us said today that its earnings fell 58 percent in its second quarter amid declining sales of video-game software and a lack of hit products like last year's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. **********The company, a retailer of children's clothing as well as toys, said net income fell to $15.8 million, or 6 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 29, from $38 million, or 13 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.

And as Mexico struggles to lure back investors, a movement to back out of the American aid commitment has erupted in Congress. **********Already the cash-starved Mexican Government has used $13 billion of a total $50 billion aid package, including more than $5 billion from the United States Treasury, to pay off billions in debts it ran up in a risky financial strategy that collapsed in December. Most of those investors -- a mix of rich Mexicans, Americans and other foreigners -- have swept up their hefty profits and immediately transferred their money out of the country. **********But for the first time since the peso crisis began on Dec. 20, anecdotal evidence suggests that a tiny trickle of private investment has begun to flow back into the country -- a trickle that both governments acknowledge must turn into a river if the American bailout package stands a chance of working. **********In the last few days senior American and Mexican officials have seized on a modest upturn in the stock market and some signs that the peso is stabilizing to argue that their strategy for restoring confidence is succeeding. Many others say that the small recovery may only mark a brief reprieve before the country begins to pay the price for soaring unemployment, inflation and consumer interest rates that have topped 100 percent. **********\"In the past week we've developed a more positive feel,\" Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the chief architect of the plan, said in an interview Friday. \"There are no guarantees in life, but the evidence has become more encouraging.\" **********No one has more at stake in making the bailout work than President Clinton. By circumventing Congress and using the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to issue the loans -- a highly unusual use of money normally intended to stabilize the dollar -- Mr. Clinton alone will be blamed if the rescue effort falls apart. Already the Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole, who is seeking the Republican nomination for President, has backpedaled from his early support for the bailout. And if Mexico's economic downturn results in a flood of goods or illegal immigrants into Texas and California, two key states in next year's election, Mr. Clinton will likely pay the price. **********Moreover, Mr. Rubin and other members of the Administration are scrambling to cut off a surprise attack by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who tied up the Senate for most of Thursday with an amendment that would have prevented the Administration from dispersing anything beyond the $5.2 billion that Washington has already sent. He has promised to take the matter up again on Monday, and perhaps force a vote this week. **********\"Mexico has collapsed already,\" Mr. D'Amato argued in a telephone interview on Friday. \"The rescue plan has failed. And we are just perpetuating a myth if we think we are helping anyone except rich investors, who the United States has saved while everyone else in Mexico starves.\" **********Many in Congress were relieved when President Clinton acted alone two months ago, alleviating them of an unhappy choice between voting for a deeply unpopular plan and letting Mexico descend into financial ruin. As a result, Mr. D'Amato concedes that he probably does not have the votes to kill the aid package, at least this time. But he has successfully revived the continuing argument over whether the Administration's plan can work, and whether the White House erred in designing a bailout package that clearly benefits rich investors, in the optimistic hope that they can be convinced to keep their much-needed capital in the country. **********Moreover, Mr. D'Amato, who is also the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, knows he does not have to pass his bill to seriously wound the Administration's effort. Even a close vote will send a signal to the markets that Mr. Clinton will have to be extraordinarily cautious in committing more American funds to Mexico. **********With considerable political theater, Mr. D'Amato has also been leading an investigation that has come to be called: \"Who lost Mexico?\" For weeks he has been arguing with the Administration over demands for thousands of pages of classified documents on everything from the drug connections of Mexican officials to the Treasury Department's warnings to Mexico last year that financial disaster was looming. An agreement has been reached, but it is a sensitive issue at the White House, because many of the warnings came in the weeks before President Clinton publicly hailed Mexico as a \"model\" for emerging markets around the world. **********On Wednesday, a day before he began his effort to scuttle the aid package, Mr. D'Amato and other Republicans clashed at a closed hearing with Lawrence Summers, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, arguing that the Administration misled Congress and the public last year about the depth of Mexico's troubles and the risks of the bailout plan. For the first time, Mr. Summers provided a detailed account of his contacts with Mexico -- something he has declined to do in public -- and defended the Administration's failure to issue its warnings about Mexico in public. To do so, Mr. Summers has argued, would have touched off exactly the kind of market run on Mexico he was trying to prevent. **********At the same classified briefing, the Central Intelligence Agency also told the committee that Mexico's oil exports, which it put up as the collateral for the $20 billion from Washington, will drop off significantly in the next five years, leaving little to secure the American loans. That runs contrary to assurances given by Mexican officials as recently as two weeks ago. **********Treasury officials decline to discuss the details of the classified assessment, but one senior official said he was convinced that \"there will be sufficient revenue stream\" from Mexico's oil exports to insure that American taxpayers will be paid back if the country defaults. **********Apart from the maneuvering for political advantage, two questions lie at the core of the argument under way in Congress: Is the rescue package achieving its primary goal, which is to bring foreign investment -- and thus stability -- back to the country? Is the austerity plan that the United States insisted on likely to trigger social or political turmoil? **********For the Administration, the answer to the first question is disappointing. Even after the signing of the loan package Feb. 21, foreign investors seemed to be more nervous than before -- in part because of the soaring interest rates that were intended to attract them. Most foreign investors who hold maturing tesobonos -- high-yield, short-term Government bonds that Mexico issued in enormous numbers last year to cover its trade deficit -- simply cash them in and get out of town, taking their money with them. **********But the Mexican Government has already paid off $13 billion of the $29 billion in outstanding tesobonos, and there are indications that some Mexican investors have started to use that money to buy other types of Government debt, including treasury certificates and bonds called \"ajustabonos\" that are adjusted to Mexico's soaring inflation rate. **********\"There's no new money going in,\" said one investment fund manager in New York who did not want to be identified. \"The spigot that was turned off is still off.\" **********But Luis R. Luis, the head of research for emerging market debt at Scudder, Stevens and Clark, an investment manager in Boston, notes that the Mexican stock market fell so low and interest rates on bonds rose so high that \"some of the assets are now attractive.\" With the devalued peso making imports far more expensive than they were in December, Mexico has also begun to run up a trade surplus, largely at the expense of the United States. A massive surplus, which reduces the need to import foreign capital, is a key to the recovery plan. **********The Mexican Government, trying to put the best light on a bad situation, insists that the program is beginning to work. **********But the turnaround is a race against time, with the Government gambling that things will look better before it feels the consequences of homeowners who cannot pay their mortgages and workers who are laid off. \"There is this enormous explosion that everyone is worried about,\" said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, where Mr. Rubin spent most of his career. **********Unemployment in January was more than twice the level of Government estimates. Inflation is steadily rising and could soar this month, as huge increases in the cost of gasoline and electricity are passed on to consumers. For the year, inflation will likely run above 50 percent. **********Today the Government also increased its national sales tax to 15 percent on a broad range of goods, an increase that hurts the poor more than anyone else. **********Remarkably, there has been no explosion of social unrest, although people are in the street protesting the Government's economic policies. Labor unions have grumbled loudly that the devaluation of the peso has hurt workers, but most have agreed to the salary increases offered by the Government or individual employers -- knowing that the only alternative is layoffs. That is a particular hardship in Mexico where there is no unemployment insurance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/business/company-news-northwest-air-and-airtran-settle-a-long-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTHWEST AIR AND AIRTRAN SETTLE A LONG DISPUTE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NORTHWEST AIR AND AIRTRAN SETTLE A LONG DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Northwest Airlines Inc. and the Airtran Corporation tentatively settled an eight-month dispute yesterday that stemmed from Airtran's foray into jet passenger service.

She has no job, and five children under the age of 6. They share an unheated upper room with 10 other people, sleeping on mats spread out on the bare concrete floor. **********At lunchtime the other day, Mrs. Gul had other indignities on her mind. From shortly after dawn, she had been out begging, part of an army of indigent war widows who are a common sight in most villages and towns in Afghanistan. **********Dressed in sky-blue and faded orange burkas, the cloaklike garments that cover many of Afghanistan's conservative Muslim women from head to toe, the widows make wraithlike figures as they move with cupped hands through the bazaars. **********Six years ago, after a decade of Soviet occupation, Afghanistan had sunk close to the bottom of most tables that international relief agencies keep to measure human distress. Since then, the Communist Government has collapsed, giving way to a civil war among the Muslim rebel groups that had fought Soviet troops. **********For many Afghan civilians who thought that the Soviet period was as bad as things could get, the civil war has been misery compounded. Before the Soviet troops left, estimates of the war dead were above one million. This figure has risen sharply. One measure is the number of people admitted to Kabul hospitals during the shelling that destroyed much of the city last year. **********From experience elsewhere, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which sustains many of the Kabul hospitals with medical workers and supplies, estimates that 8,000 to 9,000 died, about one for every three wounded people who were admitted to the hospitals. **********These figures suggest that Kabul suffered about as badly from the shelling in 1994 as Sarajevo did in 1992, the first year of the siege there, when about 10,000 people died. But the 600,000 people who remained in Kabul during the shelling did so without a United Nations peacekeeping force of the kind that buffered Sarajevo's miseries. Instead, all United Nations relief agencies pulled their foreign staff workers out of the Afghan capital when the shelling began, and ended their operations. **********Even before the United Nations shutdown, many of the governments and private fund-raising groups that made Afghanistan a priority at an earlier stage of the war had shifted priorities elsewhere. The United States ended all of its direct aid operations in Afghanistan last fall, in part because of Washington's diminished interest there after the Soviet troop withdrawal in 1989. A United Nations appeal for $106 million last fall -- for food aid, mine clearance, refugee programs and health projects -- has drawn less than $30 million from United Nations members as of this February. **********Private relief agencies have played a major role in the Afghan conflict, but they, too, have been forced to limit operations, partly because of the fighting, more so because of the difficulties of sustaining operations in areas devastated by the war. Journeys that once took a few hours now take days because roads have been reduced to backbreaking washboards and bridges have been blown away. With armed gangs controlling most roads, robbery is common. **********About 120 of the 150 private agencies working in Afghanistan restrict their operations to a thin sliver of territory along the eastern border with Pakistan. Agencies that venture farther bring back tales of a society that barely functions. Because of the war, a generation of young Afghans have missed all their schooling, raising illiteracy levels above 75 percent. **********The Afghan Red Crescent Society, equivalent of the Red Cross, estimates that about one person in every three remaining in the country is a refugee, driven from his or her own area by the war. That would amount to between three million and four million refugees. **********As in Kabul, many beg. Cries of \"Baksheesh? Baksheesh?\" -- meaning \"gift\" -- are heard everywhere. Doctors for the Afghan Red Crescent Society say surveys in some remote areas show that 50 percent of the people are suffering from malnutrition. Even in Kabul, where food supplies have been better than in many areas, small children are brought to clinics with kwashiorkor, the acute form of malnutrition, common in Africa but relatively rare in Asia, that manifests itself in extended bellies. **********Tuberculosis has reached epidemic levels. A Red Crescent survey among 500,000 people in the Samangan region, in northeastern Afghanistan, showed that 80 percent of families had at least one member with the disease. Skin diseases are also rampant. With only one functioning hospital for every 500,000 people in some areas, many sufferers go without treatment. Because of the frequent hijacking of relief convoys, medical supplies are in short supply. **********Attempts to revive normal life in the countryside have been complicated by undiscovered mines, as many as 10 million according to United Nations estimates. **********Although the United Nations and several private agencies have mine-clearing operations, it will be years before most areas are cleared. In the meantime, dozens of new mine victims arrive at Kabul hospitals every week, often with legs blown off. In the capital, men and boys moving on crutches, with stumps and no artificial limbs, are a common sight. **********Mrs. Gul, the war widow who spends her days begging through the bazaars, had nothing to show for her pleas after five hours. **********\"It is because of the war,\" she said, her moist eyes just visible through the mesh gauze set into the face of her burka. \"The war has taken our homes and our husbands and our food.

C. Pheil the 21 miles across the bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa in a two-seat Benoist at an altitude of 15 feet. These days the average trip is 983 miles, and last year United States carriers flew more than 1.4 million passengers, 48 percent of whom were business travelers. **********In fact, air travel is so much a part of the fabric of American life that sometime next week -- no one knows exactly when -- the 10 billionth passenger will fly on a United States plane, according to Government and industry records, as well as traffic projections by the Air Transport Association. And that two-seat Benoist, which flew without instruments, has given way to such improvements as jet aircraft, pressurized cabins, high-tech instrument panels and aircraft that -- like the 292-seat Boeing 777, which begins commercial service today on UAL's United Airlines flight UA921 from London to Washington -- carry price tags of $120 million. **********To celebrate the industry's 10 billionth passenger, the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, will be host to airline chief executives at a Capitol Hill ceremony tomorrow to be attended by three grandchildren of the pioneering Mr. Pheil, a former mayor of St. Petersburg.

For example, to celebrate last week's alliance between the frequent-flier programs of Marriott and United Airlines, the two companies are running a sweepstakes open to anyone. First prize in the random drawing is 25,000 miles of travel a year for life on United, plus 14 complimentary nights a year at any Marriott hotel, resort or suite worldwide. **********And yesterday, Cathay Pacific announced a contest with a grand prize of one million frequent-flier miles with its United States partner, AMR's American Airlines. This is equivalent to six trips around the world or 25 round trips to Europe.

But they can now, ever since the Piedmont began the 175-mile run between the two cities on May 26. What's more, the Piedmont was bought by the state, which arranged for Amtrak to operate it. **********\"North Carolina realized we can't build highways fast enough to accommodate our growth,\" said Patrick Simmons, director of the rail division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation. \"We need alternates for business and leisure travelers.\" **********When Amtrak did not have enough equipment to start a new service, North Carolina officials bought five used rail cars from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company for $217,000, then spent an additional $2.2 million to have them refurbished. It bought two refurbished locomotives for $1 million each, then built a turnaround track in Charlotte and a maintenance facility at Raleigh. **********Now the Piedmont's air-conditioned passenger cars and a food service car depart Raleigh at 7:10 each morning and arrive in Charlotte less than four hours later after stops in seven other cities. Each evening the Piedmont departs Charlotte at 5:45 and returns to Raleigh by 9:30. The goal is to trim running time by 30 minutes within two years and to cut it to two hours in five years. **********\"It's true that right now you can drive that corridor faster than the time the train takes,\" Mr. Simmons said. \"But you can't drive it and have someone serve you food, or sit at tables with electrical outlets and phone service so you can get some work done along the way.\" Going Cellular in Europe **********Global Cellular Rental, which leases cellular telephones for use in Europe, has a toll-free number: 800 699-6861.

Because the index found that the 3 percent drop in overall satisfaction with the service sector is almost entirely the result of a 2.7 percent drop in satisfaction with hotels and motels.

Dudayev, have abandoned their last two urban bases -- Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, 25 miles east of the capital, Grozny; and Shali, 15 miles southeast of Grozny, which fell today. **********In both cases, Chechen forces withdrew after heavy artillery and air bombardment from encircling Russian forces. By withdrawing, the Chechens have preserved what remains of their fighting forces, ammunition and other materiel. **********Chechen fighters will now regroup in the Caucasus mountains to the south and try to fight a guerrilla war of harassment and terror against superior Russian forces. **********In the mountains, the Russians will find it harder to maneuver and will be unable to use tanks and other heavily armored vehicles. The mountains, however, provide little ground cover against Russian aircraft, and the Chechens lack antiaircraft weapons. **********Russian commanders say they will seek to control the major towns and the roads and railways between them, while trying to convince Chechen villagers to force out the fighters and submit to Russian authority. **********A Russian First Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg N. Soskovets, said today that \"active combat actions on the territory of the Chechen republic would be over\" after the seizure of Shali. It was difficult to know what Mr. Soskovets meant, since most of the original 15,000 or so Chechen fighters still form a cohesive combat force. **********In an interview last week in the Russian military headquarters at Mozdok, the Russian commander in Chechnya, Gen. Anatoly S. Kulikov, said that he hoped to control two-thirds of the breakaway republic by early summer, and that significant resistance remained around key road and rail points. **********Russian politicians have routinely been overly optimistic about events in Chechnya, and clearly want the the heavy visible fighting finished by May 9, when President Clinton comes to Moscow for a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin. **********That is the day when -- only a few miles from where Mr. Clinton will stand in Red Square watching a subdued march of veterans -- Russia will celebrate the victory over Nazism with a large military parade, including heavy armor, rockets and troops from Chechnya. **********Moscow is now expected to try to seal off the mountains and prevent Chechen fighters from crossing Russian lines to carry out guerrilla attacks. While still a difficult task, it will mean far fewer casualties and visible warfare than the long effort to take Grozny, which was essentially destroyed by shelling, bombs and finally house-to-house fighting. **********In other places, the Russians have threatened -- and used -- major force if villages and towns did not expel Chechen fighters. **********Argun, another small urban center abandoned last week, is as thoroughly destroyed as Grozny. The fighting there has caused a new flow of 30,000 refugees from villages in the south, according to relief agencies, who complain that Russian forces have hindered their ability to provide food and medical assistance in southern Chechnya. **********The Russians will now work to seize arms larger than private hunting rifles or pistols from towns and villages, and to set up their own militia in Chechnya. They also hope to write a new constitution placing Chechnya firmly inside the Russian Federation, then hold new elections in the next six months to replace Mr. Dudayev's government. **********Many Chechens have no great love for Mr. Dudayev but were pushed to support him by Russia's military intervention, which began Dec. 11, and by the seemingly indiscriminate destruction of Grozny and other towns by the Russian forces. **********General Kulikov admits that the Chechens have fought extremely well, helped by some 30,000 partly trained local militia. But Russian commanders say that after a horrible beginning and over 1,400 Russian combat deaths -- an official figure that some believe is too low and that does not count those still missing in action -- the hardest part of the Chechen war is over. **********The Russian commanders believe, according to Pavel Y. Felgengauer, the defense expert for the newspaper Sevodnya, that the Chechens will have a hard time supporting a modern partisan army in the mountains, at least without aid from abroad. **********This is one reason, Mr. Felgengauer said, that Moscow is eager to help Iran, which \"could help mute support for Muslim guerrillas both in Tajikistan and in Chechnya.\" **********While Mr. Clinton would like Moscow to cancel its planned sale of light-water nuclear reactors to Iran, Mr. Felgengauer suggests that Chechnya is another reason why Moscow will go ahead with the sale.

Yeltsin, who was hospitalized on Tuesday with acute chest pain, said today that he had canceled a trip to Norway and all engagements until Monday, July 24, prompting renewed speculation about the state of his health. **********It was a sharp change from the announcements of the last few days, which said that Mr. Yeltsin's health was improving, and that he was in charge, at work and keeping control of the nuclear button. Depending on the specific diagnosis and the serious of his condition, the doctors may be urging him to rest, and they may be acting cautiously. **********On Thursday, aides said Mr. Yeltsin, who is 64, would probably be discharged on Monday from the Central Clinic in the Kremlin and go as scheduled on Wednesday to Murmansk and Norway. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the constitutional successor should Mr. Yeltsin die or become incapacitated, spoke with him this morning on the telephone and then left, as planned, for eastern Siberia; he is to return on Saturday. **********Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, who visited him this morning, criticized press speculation about him as \"verbal sadism\" and said he was working at a desk. \"I can calm the Russians,\" she said. \"Boris Yeltsin's health is fine.\" **********And it was announced that Mr. Yeltsin had signed a decree proclaiming Dec. 17 as the date of planned parliamentary elections. **********But this afternoon, Kremlin aides told the official Itar-Tass news agency that the Norway trip was off. Three hours later, they said that the entire week's schedule had been scrapped on doctor's orders and that Mr. Yeltsin would probably remain in the hospital for most of that period, then go to his country home. **********Viktor V. Ilyushin, a Yeltsin confidante who controls his schedule, confirmed the news on national television tonight, but said the President's condition had not worsened since he entered the hospital. **********The presidential spokesman, Sergei K. Medvedev, said in a statement that Mr. Yeltsin's doctors did not want him to fly just yet. **********Mrs. Yeltsin said: \"The doctors demand that the President should finish his treatment, preferably in the hospital. This treatment should not be hurried.\" But few people know what the treatment is. **********According to the Kremlin, Mr. Yeltsin's problem is ischemia, which means the heart muscle is not getting all the oxygen it needs, usually because of a blocked or constricted artery. **********Western doctors say that the condition is common, and that the Kremlin has given little indication of how serious Mr. Yeltsin's condition is. Bad cases can lead to serious heart attacks, or can be treated with drugs, bypass operations or angioplasty, to open up clogged arteries. **********Mr. Yeltsin has had heart problems before. He has high blood pressure and back pain, has been known to drink very heavily and has a high-stress job. When he entered the hospital last December, on the eve of the Russian invasion of Chechnya, the stated reason was a nose operation for a deviated septum, but he remained in the hospital for over a week and in seclusion for another. **********In a country used to dark speculations about the health of its leaders, even the Kremlin's apparent efforts to deal relatively openly and quickly with Mr. Yeltsin's problems were seen as a move to put a brighter spin on bad news. **********Russians are comparing Mr. Yeltsin to former party leaders, Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. Chernenko, whose public frailties during their final years in power made a mockery of their office. But today, there is a constitutional succession should Mr. Yeltsin suddenly die, with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin -- 57 and apparently vigorous -- to take over and then to call new presidential elections within three months. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has become a serious public and political figure in his own right in the last few months, is regarded by Western Governments as preferable to most of the other possible presidential candidates. That is the prime reason that Mr. Yeltsin's latest health scare has not yet caused much anxiety among Western diplomats or on financial markets. **********\"In this country of instability, there is a general disbelief in official information,\" Aleksandr Minkin wrote in Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"If he has recuperated so quickly, why hasn't even a single television journalist been able to see the President after his heart trouble -- at least for the sake of the nation's peace of mind?\" **********Mr. Minkin's newspaper infuriated Mrs. Yeltsin by implying that her husband's heart pain was linked to a party the night before for the birthday of an aide. \"The post of the President is a heavy burden,\" Mrs. Yeltsin said. \"It demands much energy and health and it should be treated with understanding.\" **********But the heart problems have already made Mr. Yeltsin seem even more unlikely to run again for the presidency in June 1996, or to win if he runs. **********\"One doesn't have to be a doctor to remember how vigorous Boris Nikolayevich looked four years ago,\" said the weekly Obshchaya Gazeta, \"and to imagine what kind of leader we might see on television sometime in the year 2000.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/30/world/clinton-promises-full-effort-to-account-for-mia-s.html": {"writer_name": "Todd Purdum", "pub_date": "1995-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Promises Full Effort to Account for M.I.A.'s", "print_headline": "Clinton Promises Full Effort to Account for M.I.A.'s", "body_text": " **********Honoring veterans in Memorial Day ceremonies, President Clinton promised today to \"leave no stone unturned\" in accounting for prisoners of war and troops missing in action in Vietnam, and he praised Hanoi for cooperating in such efforts more \"than ever before.\" **********The President's remarks amounted to some of his most detailed -- and conciliatory -- comments on Vietnam, as his advisers debate whether the United States should establish full diplomatic ties with its former enemy as the next step in accounting for missing troops and pursuing trade and economic opportunities in Southeast Asia. **********\"We have worked hard and made good progress,\" Mr. Clinton told veterans gathered in a tent on the South Lawn of the White House for the unveiling of a new first-class postage stamp honoring P.O.W.'s and those missing in action. \"We have put the issue of M.I.A. cases ahead of all others in our dealings with Vietnam, and today I am proud to say we are receiving more cooperation from Hanoi than ever before.\" **********The President did not mention the issue of recognition of Hanoi, and aides said later that they did not expect any immediate decision. Some of Mr. Clinton's diplomatic and economic advisers are pressing strongly to establish full diplomatic ties, arguing that recent disclosures of documents by Hanoi meet the criteria the Government has laid out during the last four years for normalization.

If he does attempt to shape those businesses, they asked, how will the strong executives already there respond? **********Or will Mr. Turner now ease back and let others run the empire -- something no one expects him to do? **********Along with the question of possible instability at Warner Brothers, many people here were concerned that the the growing concentration of power could make it harder to produce quirky, unusual or daring films or television programs.

Compared with keeping rice warm in a rice-cooker, this saves about eight cents a meal. **********Mrs. Sakurai also keeps a thermos of iced tea on the counter in the summer, so her children will not keep opening the refrigerator. And when a sale comes, she buys a year's worth of clothing for them **********It's not that Mrs. Sakurai has suddenly become poor, but that she worries she could. Just a few years ago, Japan was a country so dedicated to extravagance that some restaurants even offered meals topped with gold dust, a tribute to corporate expense accounts, and executives were picking up Armani suits and patches of American real estate as if they were stuffing a gift bag with baubles. National spending soared. **********But now, after several years of near-zero growth, many Japanese are increasingly anxious about their future. The response: cut costs and sock away money once again. **********\"I turn off all the lights when I go out,\" Mrs. Sakurai said. \"I also use the leftover bath water for the laundry, pour it into the plants or splash it on the garden.\" **********Frugality is sweeping the society. Magazines compete to offer suggestions for saving, telling readers that microwave cooking is half the cost of gas-burner cooking, or recommending baths rather than showers, or using large cooking pans (boiling water in a 9 1/2-inch pan costs 3.9 cents, compared with 4.5 cents for a 6 1/4-inch pan), or using a smaller television (the cost of electricity for a 14-inch television is half that for a 25-inch one). **********As people save money -- in ways as minimal as reheating rice, as substantial as delaying construction of a new house -- those yen are adding up, reversing a downward trend in savings here. Household savings now total $480 billion a year, about two and a half times the amount that Americans save a year, and household spending is at a 20-year low. **********The eight cents saved by reheating rice does not always end up in the bank account. But such cost-cutting tends to increase savings, and household savings rates are rising in Japan, even though they are still lower than they were decades ago. **********This year, they have climbed to 21 percent of disposable income, from about 18.5 percent four years ago, compared with under 5 percent in the United States. It is a habit of parsimony that will help fortify the Japanese economy in the long run because those billions are recycled into money-making investment projects throughout the international economy. **********Savings also cut domestic consumption and thus help drive the trade surplus, and so the more cash Japanese stash in their accounts, the more persistent the trade surplus is likely to be with America. **********In Japan, women often control the household purse strings, and one sign of the times is the dwindling allowances that wives give their husbands. **********Takashi Nishimura, a 43-year-old stockbroker, saw his salary fall this year, and his wife took drastic measures. She cut his allowance from $520 to $208 a month to help pay the mortgage, and this forced him to curb his lavish ways. **********\"I used to get 50,000 yen a month last year, but now she gives me only 20,000 yen,\" Mr. Nishimura said. \"Instead of eating traditional Japanese meals at Ginza, I eat meat kebabs at cheaper places in Shimbashi.\" **********Such money monopolization in the home often leaves 47-year-old Ishii Tsutomu with hardly any change to spare. As he took his wife and their two daughters shopping at a discount store in Urawa, it was clear who had control. **********Mr. Tsutomu had only 2,000 yen, or about $20 in his wallet. His wife, Sumie, makes him a lunch box every day and gives him about $100 a month to spend, with an extra $1,000 at the end of the year for holiday parties. **********Mrs. Tsutomu also deposits some savings at a local department store which gives her interest in return for her purchasing her children's school uniforms there every year. **********Of course, the sacrifice goes only so far. The Tsutomus leave their air conditioners on at night, and Mrs. Tsutomu still boils her potatoes on a gas stove. **********For 47-year-old Tetsuo Senmyo, a salaryman in the road-building business, saving means spending $350 on a golfing-and-drinking session only once a month, instead of twice. While he still goes on drinking outings with his friends, he has cut down, partly to offset a decline in his overtime income. **********\"I take my allowance only sparingly,\" said Mr. Senmyo, as he eyed a shiny new golf club on sale in a store. \"I hold back because my income is lower, and I give it all to my wife.\" **********Not all men are so generous. Mutako Kikuki, a 55-year-old cafeteria worker, saves by giving her unwanted leftovers to her neighbor, who reciprocates. Mrs. Kikuki's husband, a construction worker, lost his bonus and she can barely meet their daily living expenses on his salary. **********She would like to cut his $300-a-month allowance to zero, but hell would break loose if she did. **********\"It's unthinkable that he would save any of that!\" she said in disgust. \"He has no intention whatsoever to save.

Senior religious leaders and politicians from the Christian Social Union, the heavily Catholic party that dominates Bavarian politics, are expected to attend. **********The party chairman, Finance Minister Theo Waigel, has already declared himself \"horrified and astonished\" by the decision. Chancellor Helmut Kohl also criticized it. **********\"The crucifix as a symbol of Christian belief harms no one,\" Mr. Kohl said in a statement. \"After this century's bitter experience with anti-Christian ideologies and their awful and inhuman effects, we feel a special obligation to pass these values on to future generations.\" **********Educational policy in Germany, like most domestic policy, is shaped principally by the states. Bavaria, which with 11 million inhabitants is Germany's second most populous state, is the only one that requires religious symbols in classrooms. Other states ban them or leave the decision to local communities. **********Politicians from Germany's left-oriented Social Democratic and Green parties welcomed the court's decision.

Governor Edmund Stoiber said he would not order the removal of crucifixes \"for the time being,\" and asserted that he was under no obligation to remove them in schools where parents unanimously opposed such action. **********Friedrich Cardinal Wetter of Munich, the Bavarian capital, said parents alone should have the power to decide whether crucifixes should hang in classrooms. **********\"We guarantee tolerance for people who think differently from us, and we demand in return that same tolerance,\" Cardinal Wetter told pilgrims in the Bavarian town of Altotting last week. He declared, \"Insist on your right and you will not err.\" **********The court decision was on a case brought 10 years ago by Ernst Seler, a Bavarian artist and composer who did not want to send his three children to schools where the \"image of a bleeding, half-naked male corpse\" was displayed.

R. Grace & Company thought they were putting the past behind them when they released a cryptic statement announcing the unexpected resignation of J. P. Bolduc, the chief executive, on March 2, they have had a rude awakening. **********Yesterday, the company was forced to admit that Mr. Bolduc was let go after longstanding allegations of sexual harassment had come to the attention of the board. With that, what was already one of the most bizarre corporate dramas in memory got worse. Grace now must answer questions about its past management practices, its future leadership, its legal liabilities, the candor of its directors and its ability to satisfy the powerful institutional investors who hold the bulk of its stock. **********Shareholders are clearly skittish about the outcome. Grace's stock dropped yesterday to $53.75, down 75 cents a share. **********Beyond the sexual harassment charges, the disputes that have thrown the venerable chemical and health services company into turmoil center on the size of Mr. Bolduc's severance package and the board's handling of his departure. Directors must also prove to both stockholders and regulators that they have fairly handled and fully disclosed the company's dealings with J. Peter Grace Jr., who agreed this month to resign as the company's chairman at its annual meeting in early May. **********The toughest job of all will be recruiting a new chief executive willing to take on these problems. \"It will be a difficult search,\" E. Pendleton James, an executive recruiter, said. \"Talent in that industry is thin, and most players would not want to be associated with Grace.\" **********Indeed, the challenge of finding a new chief executive to put Grace back on track, difficult in ordinary times, may have been aggravated by the board's blunders. Yet directors are working against a tight deadline. A chief executive must be found and many of these issues must be resolved before the board meets shareholders at the May meeting. **********The upheaval comes at a critical time for Grace. Long a lackluster performer, the company's stock climbed from $35.25 in early December to $45.375 in early March, partly thanks to Mr. Bolduc's efforts to focus the company on its core businesses. But while the company fortunes seemed to be improving, a behind-the-scenes dispute had arisen over company-paid perquisites given to Mr. Grace and over company dealings with his son, J. Peter Grace 3d. Although substantial, Grace had not made disclosures about them in company filings. **********Problems began when the elder Mr. Grace, the company and the board all sought legal counsel on the disclosure issue. During heated discussions among lawyers and directors, allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Bolduc arose in the board room. On Feb. 28, former Federal Judge Harold R. Tyler, who was asked to investigate the charges, told the board privately that \"grounds existed to find that Mr. Bolduc has sexually harassed certain employees of the company.\" The board soon asked for Mr. Bolduc's resignation. **********But Mr. Bolduc's restructuring job was hardly finished. When news of his resignation broke, institutions that knew nothing about the harassment charges rose to his support. Fearing that the restructuring would be derailed, shareholders demanded that Mr. Bolduc be considered again for the job of chief executive. **********Pressure from shareholders also led the elder Mr. Grace and several directors to agree on March 17 to resign, effective at the annual meeting, clearing the way for an overhaul of the board. **********So far, only one person seems to want Mr. Bolduc's old job. Constantine Hampers, head of Grace's National Medical Care division, has thrown his hat in the ring. However, he is unacceptable to some shareholders, who say he is beholden to the Grace family, an allegation he has denied. **********Whoever takes up the Grace challenge faces several potential legal problems. First, there's the problem of the Graces. There was a difference of legal opinion over what the company was required to disclose about its dealings with the Grace family, but Mr. Tyler ultimately advised the board to disclose everything about them. **********Then there is the question of the board's candor. The company first attributed Mr. Bolduc's departure to vague philosophical differences, and then publicly denied that allegations of misconduct were involved. Not until yesterday did the company finally confirm that allegations of sexual harassment had figured in the resignation. **********Giving one explanation to the media and another to the Securities and Exchange Commission may be securities fraud, according to lawyers. While declining to comment on the Grace case in particular, Harvey L. Pitt, a securities lawyer at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Washington, said: \"If you use a different standard for a press release than what you put in a proxy statement, that's a very risky situation. You've got to tell the same story about the same subject to all audiences.\" **********Grace also faces the possibility of litigation by Mr. Bolduc himself, who has vigorously denied any misconduct. Gerald Walpin, a lawyer for the former chief executive, would not rule out a lawsuit. \"All possible avenues and alternatives remain open,\" Mr. Walpin said yesterday. **********And the sexual harassment charges against Mr. Bolduc may expose Grace to additional liability. Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law Center in Washington, noted that Mr. Bolduc's vigorous denial of the allegations \"makes it very hard to assess the company's liability.\" But, she added, \"The fact that an outsider, a well-respected former judge, says that this was serious, means that this may be something that could very well produce a complaint against the company.\" **********Shareholders are caught in these crosscurrents. But Claire Sheahan, spokeswoman for College Retirement Equities Fund, the company's second-largest shareholder, said that C.R.E.F. intended to keep up the pressure. \"From the beginning C.R.E.F.'s initiative focused on the need for major corporate governance changes and new leadership at W. R. Grace. This remains our goal.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/18/world/un-won-t-say-which-side-killed-peacekeeper-in-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Won't Say Which Side Killed Peacekeeper in Bosnia", "body_text": " **********The United Nations, apparently seeking to avoid confrontation with the Serbs, said today that it was unclear who killed a French soldier here on Saturday. **********Lieut. Col. Gary Coward, the military spokesman for the United Nations peacekeeping force, said a first bullet fired at Cpl. Eric Hardoin unquestionably came from a Serbian position. But, he added, a second shot fired just three seconds later might conceivably have come from the Bosnian Government side. **********Because the shots came one after the other, it has been generally assumed that they were fired by the same person, or at least from the same position. But Colonel Coward said the second shot, which killed the French soldier, was a 5.56-millimeter bullet, whereas the first, which pierced the windshield of his vehicle, appeared to be 7.62 millimeters. **********\"The possibility therefore exists that the second shot may have come from Government positions,\" Colonel Coward said. **********This possibility would of course require that a Serbian sniper fire at the French soldier and then, immediately afterward and presumably without coordination, a Bosnian Government sniper joined in the attack. **********\"It's a very slender thread,\" Colonel Coward conceded, adding that there is no evidence that Muslim-led Government forces use 5.56-millimeter bullets more than the Serbs. **********The United Nations account of the incident, which was in line with a policy that has tended to avoid placing blame on either side for sniping and shelling in Sarajevo, appeared in this instance to defy common sense. **********\"This attempt at an explanation is not only bizarre, it's third-rate,\" said the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. **********The French soldier, whose filmed death has caused outrage in France, was killed as he completed work on a new anti-sniping barrier outside the Holiday Inn in central Sarajevo. The area is notorious for Serbian sniping at civilians. **********The confusion was enough, once again, to allow the United Nations to avoid placing blame squarely on any one party, thus avoiding any confrontation that might further complicate its role as a peacekeeper in the midst of a war. An investigation into the killing the previous day of Sgt. Ralph Gunther, another French soldier, has also been inconclusive. **********In the case of Sergeant Gunther, initial evidence appeared to suggest that the shot had come from a Bosnian Government position. But since then, United Nations officials have said he was killed at a place also exposed to a Serbian line of fire. **********The strong whiff of obfuscation surrounding these incidents has underscored the uneasy position of the 24,000 United Nations soldiers in Bosnia. They have become symbols of the growing helplessness of the world before a deepening conflict. **********In France, the killing of two soldiers in two days has produced talk of a withdrawal of United Nations troops. But the comments have appeared contradictory. Francois Leotard, the Defense Minister, suggested that he blamed Bosnian Government forces for the incidents, even as French officers here were saying quite clearly that the second shooting was the work of the Serbs. **********Confusion also reigned at Sarajevo airport, which has been closed for more than a week because of Serbian threats. The United Nations resumed flights today but abruptly barred journalists from the flights. **********Colonel Coward said the decision had been made because flights were resumed on a trial basis and soldiers were better able to face being shot at than journalists. **********But Michael Williams, the departing chief civilian spokesman, said journalists had been barred because the Serbs insisted that only United Nations personnel travel on the flights. **********\"A deal has been cut with the Serbs,\" Mr. Williams said. \"No non-United Nations personnel on the flights, at least for now.\" **********The Serbs have been pressing for such an arrangement mainly to stop Bosnian Government officials from traveling on the flights. But any such accord between the United Nations and the Serbs would amount to the United Nations bending to Serbian pressure under the threat of having its flights fired at. **********\"The United Nations should not even talk to the Serbs about such issues,\" Mr. Silajdzic said. \"When the United Nations talks about arrangements at the airport, I believe it should talk to the legal Government of this country.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/14/business/6-tips-on-how-to-earn-52-million-by-age-24.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1995-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 883, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 Tips on How to Earn $52 Million by Age 24", "print_headline": "6 Tips on How to Earn $52 Million by Age 24", "body_text": " **********Meet Marc L. Andreessen, the newest member of Silicon Valley's instant millionaires club. **********On Wednesday, on the strength of a phenomenal opening day of stock trading for the Netscape Communications Corporation, Mr. Andreessen, the company's 24-year-old co-founder, became worth more than $58 million -- on paper, at least. **********But paper wealth in the high-technology heartland can come and go in a nanosecond. There are no guarantees that his personal worth will not slide significantly in the six months that he is legally bound to hold onto his one million shares (not counting stock options) before he can consider selling any of them. By the end of trading on Friday, in fact, Netscape's stock had already fallen from Wednesday's close of $58.25 to end the week at $52 a share. **********That dropped Mr. Andreessen's 2.6 percent stake in the company to a value of $52 million. If he is nervous, he is not saying: the rules of the public offering forbid any of Netscape's executives from talking about the stock for another month. This quiet period, as it is known, also applies to the 50-year-old chairman, James H. Clark, and the 52-year-old president and chief executive, James L. Barksdale. **********There are no guarantees that Mr. Andreessen, Netscape's vice president of technology, will be able to retain his position among the Valley's very wealthy. Netscape has yet to see any profits from its hot product -- a software program that permits easy retrieval of text, images and sound through the Internet's World Wide Web. **********The software, called Netscape Navigator, is derived from the Mosaic program that Mr. Andreessen conceived while an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,while working part time at the university's National Center for Supercomputer Applications. But while Netscape so far is the most popular Web browser, the university has licensed the underlying Mosaic technology to other companies, including Spyglass. **********Spyglass so far ranks far behind Netscape in the Web-browser market. But that could quickly change.  Spyglass's browser will be included in the Windows 95 operating system that the Microsoft Corporation plans to release on Aug. 24. The new Microsoft Network, which goes on line the same day, is configured to work with the Spyglass browser. **********For the moment, Mr. Andreessen is riding high. Others may wish to consider some hints on how to be the next Silicon Valley wunderkind. 1. START EARLY Marc Andreessen was 21 and an undergraduate in Illinois when he sat down to write Mosaic on a $6.85-an-hour student's salary at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In Silicon Valley years he was almost too old by then. Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., began building computers in high school, and William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, dropped out of Harvard as a 19-year-old freshman. 2. GIVE AWAY YOUR SOFTWARE While Mr. Gates built his business on a freely shared commodity -- the BASIC programming language -- and turned it into a PC operating system with a price tag, Mr. Andreessen helped build a multibillion-dollar company that makes its most popular product available free for personal use. The profit is supposed to come from selling Netscape software for corporate use. 3. AVOID ADULT SUPERVISION While working as a student programmer, Mr. Andreessen was supposed to be writing three-dimensional scientific visualization software to run on his employer's Thinking Machines supercomputer. Instead, he decided it would be more fun to work up a quick software \"hack\" to make the World Wide Web easier to use. Mr. Andreessen's boss, Larry Smarr, did not learn about the program until it was being demonstrated to the Government. But he quickly saw the Web browser's potential to unlock the power of the Internet, and it became an official project of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. 4. FIND YOUR OWN WOZNIAK For every platoon leader or visionary there is the guy down in the trenches who does the real dirty work. Apple Computer's Steve Jobs had Mr. Wozniak and Mr. Gates had Paul Allen. Mr. Andreessen's trench man was his fellow student, Eric Bina, a consummate computer hacker. The two worked at the supercomputing center when they began writing the code for Mosaic in December 1992. Mr. Bina now works for Netscape, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., but telecommutes from Illinois. 5. GET YOUR HEAD HUNTED After Mr. Andreessen left Illinois in late 1993 he came first to a small Palo Alto, Calif., start-up company called Enterprise Integration Technologies and went to work as a junior programmer helping to build a Web server. Then he received E-mail from Mr. Clark, who had recently retired as the chairman (and founder) of Silicon Graphics, the leading maker of 3-D work stations. Soon the two were hatching plans for their new company on Mr. Clark's yacht or over glasses of fine red wine in Mr. Clark's Atherton, Calif., home. 6. STAY A STEP AHEAD OF BILL GATES There are lots of other Silicon Valley companies that have started with nearly as much flash as Netscape, but ended up as smoking craters -- frequently as victims of Microsoft's scorched-earth marketing strategy. The challenge Mr. Andreessen faces now is to keep a safe distance ahead of Microsoft in the Web-browser market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/world/world-news-briefs-un-team-says-iraq-filed-incomplete-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; U.N.

But the Dow continued to fall another 30 points. **********Before yesterday the Dow had risen more than 15 percent -- or 584 points -- this year, and some market-leading stocks like Microsoft had risen more than 40 percent. **********\"A drop like today changes your complacent attitude toward the market,\" said Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading for Oppenheimer & Company. \"It's a very spooky market when the Dow gets this high.\" **********A few traders cited familiar reasons for the big move, pointing to a report on the rising trade deficit with Japan and fears that a decline in borrowing costs was coming to an end. Indeed, bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose somewhat. **********But there were also indications that after the nearly seven-month surge of the market, with the Dow hitting six new highs in a row recently, many traders were simply poised to jump out of stocks and take their profits at the first sign of a pullback. **********Adding a large measure of selling pressure is the expiration today of two kinds of stock options, an event known as \"double witching,\" which often leads to a large run-up in trading volume and wide swings in price. **********Technical analysts also say that it is normal for stock prices to rise sharply for a period and then fall as much as one-third to one-half of the advance. Only when prices fall further do market analysts start talking seriously about a bear market. **********\"You have to keep this in statistical perspective,\" said David Holt, vice president of research and strategy for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. \"You have to take today's drop of 82 points and compare it to the almost 750-point rise from Nov. 23, when this latest rally started.\" **********Because stock prices have risen so far and so fast, the moves by the component stocks of the Dow tend to be magnified, both up and down. In 1993, for example, a one-point change in a Dow component stock would make the Dow change about two points. Now, a one-point change would move the Dow about 2.8 points. **********Still, the decline yesterday was the biggest fall in blue-chip stock prices since the Dow dropped nearly 47 points on Jan. 19, and almost equaled the fall of more than 91 points last Nov. 22. **********The 82-point drop of the Dow was a decline of 1.85 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 7.49 points, or 1.42 percent, to 519.58, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.87 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 864.06. **********The Dow is now below 4,400, the level crossed by the market only seven sessions ago, on May 10. It had broken through 4,300 only 19 sessions ago, on April 24. **********Despite the fall, there were some signs of strength in the market, said Alan B. Bond, president of Bond, Procope Capital Management. High-technology stocks like Microsoft, Oracle Systems and Cisco Systems all traded higher than or near their opening prices until the last half-hour, indicating options-related trading. At the close of Nasdaq trading, Microsoft was down 1 3/8, to 84 5/8; Oracle was down 1 1/8, to 33 3/8, and Cisco was down 1 3/8, to 44. **********High-technology stocks have often been the top performers in recent sessions. Even after the decline yesterday, the American Stock Exchange computer technology index was still up more than 30 percent this year. **********\"What we saw today was that the tech stocks' leadership is not faltering,\" Mr. Bond said. **********Moreover, because economic conditions are favorable, with interest rates stable and inflation low, stock prices might rebound as early as this morning, said Edward Laux, senior managing director for equity trading at the Chicago Corporation.  \"The drop in the Dow might scare some weak players,\" he said. \"But given the overall market outlook, we're more likely to have a technical snapback.\" **********The market headed down after the Commerce Department reported that the overall trade deficit narrowed in March, while the deficit with Japan widened. **********The narrowing of the overall deficit might have contributed to the fall in prices because it suggested that the economy was not slowing as much as had been anticipated. That would also suggest that inflation was still a threat, casting doubt that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in the second half of the year, as a growing number of market analysts have told their clients. **********The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was higher than normal, at 351.9 million shares, about 5 percent higher than the daily average of 335 million shares this year. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.72 points, to 279.80, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 552 to 1,780.

Modest salary, but substantial power, prestige and perks. Ability to stay awake at long meetings a must. **********The White House thought it had come up with an ideal candidate for the current opening on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors. She is Alicia H. Munnell, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, who had earlier worked her way up the through the ranks to become a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. **********But for reasons not entirely clear, torpedoing the appointment is becoming a right-wing cause. The question now is whether President Clinton will actually submit her name. Or he may duck another confirmation fight where, in the words of Herb Stein, an economic adviser to President Richard M. Nixon (and no liberal), \"the opposition is based on irrelevancies\" **********Ms. Munnell is no shrinking violet, but she has not been particularly controversy-prone. After earning a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1973, her public face has largely consisted of scholarly books and articles about retirement policy, tax reform and investment in public works. **********Once in Washington, she dutifully adopted the Treasury's traditional role of prudent parent to the unruly adolescents making waves at Federal agencies with their own special-interest constituencies. She fought environmental hard-liners on Superfund, arguing for streamlined procedures to clean up toxic wastes. She beat back apparatchiks in the Labor Department who wanted private pension funds to make \"socially useful investment.\" Most important in the context of the Fed job, she helped mute White House criticism of the central bank's anti-inflation policy. **********Nonetheless, Paul Craig Roberts, a syndicated columnist who briefly led the \"supply-siders\" in the Reagan Administration, began crusading against her last fall, choosing to make Ms. Munnell the Clinton Administration's poster girl for Big Government. And last week a Wall Street Journal editorial denounced her as \"an economist with ideas on the fiscal fringe.\" **********Since then, 10 Republican Senators, including Phil Gramm, a Presidential contender, wrote to Mr. Clinton. They urged him to give the Fed job to someone with \"a keen eye toward the stability of our currency and the importance of keeping our capital markets free from burdensome regulations, taxes and mandates.\" If there was any doubt what they meant, Senator Connie Mack of Florida sent along a press release alluding to Ms. Munnell's alleged heresies. **********What is going on here? The Wall Street Journal editorial lumped her with liberals who want to tap pension cash for low-income housing and regional development. In fact, her own analysis of social investing -- published in the New England Economic Review -- concluded that this approach to investing was \"alarming\" because pensioners would bear the risk. **********Another beef with Ms. Munnell's views concerns the tax treatment of pensions. She noted in an article in the National Tax Journal that deferral of taxes on employer-sponsored pensions cost the Treasury $51 billion in revenues in 1992. Yet only half the population benefits, with much of the break going to upper-income families. And in Ms. Munnell's reading of the numbers, the net addition to private savings is offset by the negative impact on public savings through the Federal budget. Her suggestion: tax the income accruing in sheltered pension funds. **********That recommendation may be anathema to members of Congress who have never met a tax expenditure they didn't like. But in Mr. Stein's view, it is an \"entirely reasonable point\" to weigh the adverse impact on income distribution against the positive incentives to save. And, while controversial, it is hardly radical economics. **********What, then, is really eating Ms. Munnell's critics? Probably not her attitude toward the Fed's core task of sustaining a healthy, low-inflation economy. For one thing, there is no hint that she disagrees with the semitough approach to monetary policy now in place. For another, her most vociferous critics are supply-siders who think the Fed is already too tough on inflation. **********A more plausible explanation is that the banking industry still quietly blames her for the Boston Fed's study finding racial discrimination in lending. If that is the case, however, the bankers may be directing their ire at the wrong target. Indeed, while the Justice Department is trying to use civil rights laws to force banks to set up branches in poor neighborhoods where blacks are concentrated, the Boston Fed merely called for vigilance and better training for loan officers. **********The very idea that a candidate with Ms. Munnell's credentials is fodder for a fight suggests just how vulnerable President Clinton must appear to Republicans. It may behoove him to fight, if only to demonstrate that appearances deceive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/business/time-warner-seeks-to-sell-stake-in-gangsta-rap-label.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner Seeks to Sell Stake in Gangsta Rap Label", "print_headline": "Time Warner Seeks to Sell Stake in Gangsta Rap Label", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc. is negotiating to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the music label whose gangsta rap performers landed the company in a politically charged controversy three months ago. **********Executives at Interscope, which is based in Los Angeles, said they had been in discussions with Michael J. Fuchs, the chairman of the Warner Music Group, for three weeks about buying back the stake. The two companies came close to a deal late last week, the executives said, but the talks have since bogged down. **********Were Time Warner to sever its ties with Interscope, it would represent a major concession to critics who have argued that the company should not distribute gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. **********Time Warner bought its stake in Interscope for $100 million in two installments, one of $20 million in 1992, and the other of $80 million earlier this year. Executives at Interscope said the companies were negotiating how much Time Warner would receive for its stake, plus the working capital it has put into the label. **********\"We don't have a deal yet,\" an executive at Interscope said. \"Could we have a deal later this week? Maybe.\" **********A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment on the negotiations. But an executive at Warner Music cautioned that the talks would not necessarily result in Time Warner severing its ties. **********The executive, who asked not to be identified, noted that Interscope has been a profitable investment for Time Warner. It is one of the fastest-growing labels in the music industry. And though it is best known for hard-edged gangsta rappers like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur, it also has mainstream performers like the crooner Tom Jones. **********Still, Time Warner endured weeks of criticism for its association with Interscope from Republican politicians like Senator Bob Dole and William J. Bennett, a former Education Secretary in the Reagan Administration. And the company seemed headed for another showdown with Interscope later this month over a new album by one of its acts, Tha Dogg Pound. **********Tha Dogg Pound has not yet delivered the album, which is called Dogg Food. But based on comments a band member made in a recent article in The Los Angeles Times, executives at Interscope said the album could provoke further criticism from Mr. Bennett and others, including C. DeLores Tucker, the chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black Women. **********Mr. Fuchs was traveling from Los Angeles to New York last night and could not be reached for comment. Executives said he has conducted his negotiations with Ted Field, the co-head of Interscope. Mr. Field, who is an investor, owns the remaining 50 percent of the label with Jimmy Iovine, a record executive who manages the label on a daily basis. **********Executives familiar with Warner Music said the two companies were simply too far apart in their attitudes toward provocative music. Executives at Interscope said they were obligated to distribute albums like Dogg Food, while those at Time Warner contend the company should have a right to veto material it deemed unsuitable. **********In response to the outcry over gangsta rap, Mr. Fuchs had said he would work with other record companies to develop more stringent standards for labeling music with violent or sexually explicit lyrics. The Recording Industry Association of America, which has been coordinating the industry discussions, said it would deliver recommendations by the end of the summer. **********Mr. Fuchs, who became the chairman of Warner Music in May after a protracted period of turmoil, has moved rapidly to consolidate his control over the division. In June, he dismissed Doug Morris, the chief executive of Warner's domestic record labels. **********Mr. Morris was a strong backer of Time Warner's involvement in gangsta rap, and he pushed Time Warner's investment in Interscope. Mr. Fuchs had accused Mr. Morris of leading a campaign to destabilize Warner Music while it was facing political pressure over rap lyrics. **********Mr. Morris, who recently started a record label backed by MCA, which is owned by the Seagram Company, is suing Time Warner for $50 million, contending breach of contract. **********Last week, Mr. Fuchs dismissed Melvyn R. Lewinter, the president of Warner U.S. and Mr. Morris's former deputy. And executives familiar with the division said Mr. Fuchs was negotiating to settle the contract of another key Morris ally, Ina Meibach, a senior vice president of Warner Music. **********Mr. Fuchs was also negotiating the departure of Danny Goldberg as chairman of Warner Brothers Records, the group's flagship label, according to these executives.

The market, they said, was weighed down yesterday by a poor response to an auction of 10-year notes and by a Federal Reserve survey of business activity that was not as weak as had been hoped. Market participants were also hesitant to buy ahead of reports on producer prices today and consumer prices tomorrow, they said. **********The price of the 30-year bond fell 22/32, to 107 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7 percent, from 6.94 percent on Tuesday. Still, the yield is at its lowest point in more than a year. **********Yesterday's auction of new 10-year notes \"was one of the worst auctions in 10-year note history,\" said Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. **********The average yield at the auction was 6.60 percent, down from 7.54 percent in February and the lowest since Feb. 9, 1994, when the yield was 5.92 percent. **********But Mr. Ake cautioned against reading too much into the poor institutional and retail demand for the notes, noting that many dealers did not have customers lined up ahead of the auction. **********\"Prices have changed so rapidly over the past several days; few had bothered to book, or line up, customers for the 10-year auction,\" he said. **********\"The dealers have been fighting this market,\" Mr. Ake added. \"The last thing they want to do is load up the boat and buy a bunch of securities ahead of important numbers,\" he said, referring to the producer prices and consumer prices data as well as today's report on April retail sales. **********Some traders were also concerned that prices might have peaked, a view that was reinforced by a report that showed some pickup amid an otherwise sluggish economy. The Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of regional business activity, known as the beige book, largely confirmed a widespread slowdown although it did find some gains in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis areas. **********Recent data showing that the economy is slowing at a pace that can stifle inflation, which erodes the value of bonds, has driven a powerful rally in the market. On Tuesday, rates fell below 7 percent for the first time in 14 months, and some traders and analysts expect the rally to resume soon. **********\"I don't think we have broken the market's bullish psychology today,\" Mr. Ake of Kemper Securities said. \"There is still a positive spin on the data, so the funademental factors are still in play. **********Some fund managers also noted that the bond rally was also feeding itself as declining interest rates prompted managers of portfolios with mortgage-backed bonds to buy long-term government debt. As a result of lower rates, more homeowners are expected to refinance their mortgages, which means there will be an increase in the number of redemptions of mortgages backing bonds. To offset the redemptions, the portfolio managers are buying Treasury bonds to maintain their presence in long maturities until the mortgage market settles down. **********The market turns its attention today to the April Producer Price Index, which is exepcted to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent and a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in its core rate, which excludes food and energy, according to Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.219  Average Yield . . . 6.608%  Low Price . . . 98.702  High Yield . . . 6.680%  High Price . . . 99.449  Low Yield . . . 6.576%  Accepted at low price . . . 92%  Total applied for . . . $20,931,252  Accepted . . . $12,503,227  Noncompetitive . . . $368,000  Interest set at . . . 6 1/2%  The 10-year notes mature on May 15, 2005."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/14/business/when-the-pen-is-truly-mighty.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1995-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When the Pen Is Truly Mighty", "print_headline": "When the Pen Is Truly Mighty", "body_text": " **********Cal Ripken Jr., less than two months from breaking Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games, is famous for his endurance on the baseball field. For a less celebrated example of his stamina, consider the more than 10,000 autographs he will sign this year. **********The vast majority will not be the old-fashioned face-to-face kind. Rather, Ripken signs balls by the boxload, hundreds at a time, in his hotel room or at home, to be sold at a big profit. A trained observer from the merchandising company makes sure there is a comfortable chair or practical table. He lays out the proper pen. Then, as with all athletes, he hovers, quickly checking every signature to insure that the autograph is in the \"sweet spot\" (where the stitching arcs together), that the ink is clear and even and that it dries properly. **********For each of his autographs Ripken will be paid about $20 (about $7,200 an hour, assuming each takes 10 seconds), much of which he contributes to charity. And he's not the only one to profit. By the time a Ripken fan orders the souvenir out of, say, an upscale catalogue, the $6.50 baseball will sell for as much as $80. **********Ten years ago, mass-autographed merchandise was a rarity. Today, these balls, helmets, jerseys and athletic shoes are a $500 million industry, according to at least two estimates, sold by home-shopping television channels, catalogue companies, sports mail-order houses, sports-memorabilia dealers who sell at trade shows, and independent hobby stores. **********\"Manufactured memorabilia\" is what Joshua Leland Evans, a New York dealer in sports antiques and artifacts, calls autographed paraphernalia \"created for the sole purpose of being sold.\" **********Among the athletes with the biggest business in autographed merchandise are Mickey Mantle, who was reportedly paid $2.75 million to autograph 20,000 baseballs and make personal appearances in 1992. That same year, the baseball star Reggie Jackson earned $1 million for 30,000 autographs and 20 appearances, the basketball star Magic Johnson got $1 million for 12,000 autographs, and the hockey star Wayne Gretzky was paid $500,000 for 12,000 signatures. **********Their signing sessions are, well, efficient. Nolan Ryan, who in his last few years of pitching made more than $1 million from signings, likes to conduct business on a speaker phone while he signs. The football legend Joe Montana once autographed 2,000 pieces of football gear arrayed on 10 tables in a banquet hall, scooting along in a rolling chair and barely touching the equipment. It still took all day. Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball star who earns more than $1 million a year from signings, often signs in the wee hours while watching music videos. **********Many of the deals are brokered by companies like the Score Board Inc. of Cherry Hill, N.J. The merchandiser has 350 athletes under contract, including baseball stars like Ripken, Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds; football greats like Troy Aikman and Steve Young, and basketball standouts like O'Neal, Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon. **********\"We cut contracts with a minimum number of autographs and an option to keep going\" if the merchandise sells well, said Ken Goldin, who founded Score Board with his father in 1988. As an example, he said, a player might get $100,000 for 10,000 autographs ($10 each), and $20,000 for each appearance on a television shopping show or in a shopping mall. **********Once signed, the merchandise is prepared for sale. Take Ripken's autographed ball, which is mounted on a wood stand or in a Plexiglas case. A \"certificate of authenticity\" is added. Then the ensemble is sold to a retailer -- most often a television shopping outlet like QVC and Home Shopping Network. Most of the merchandising deals call for athletes to appear on television or at stores to help sell what they signed. **********The merchandise -- baseballs are the most popular -- is finally sold to people \"who can't afford $10,000 for a mint-condition Babe Ruth baseball, but want something,\" Mr. Evans, the dealer, said. **********For the merchandisers and retailers in on the action, the potential profits are significant. **********A merchandiser that typically pays $20 to a player for a signature and $10 for licensing fees, the ball and other supplies can then sell the ball to a retailer for about $45, making a $15 profit. The retailer can then sell the ball for as much as $80 on television, through an upscale catalogue like Sharper Image or Hammacher Schlemmer, or through a store. **********The markup to $80 includes the catalogue company's overhead, of course, but that still leaves room for plenty of profit all around. **********But for the buyer who might regard such a purchase as a good investment in a collectible that appreciates over time, the potential for profit is much smaller. In the long run, mass-autographed collectibles will probably not command the price that the genuine article will fetch. Dealers like Mr. Evans say they can distinguish between the two because mass-autographed balls are so uniform -- the same pristine ball and the same signature size and placement. **********\"The stuff that's created to be worth something from the beginning is the stuff that will not retain its value,\" Mr. Evans said. \"The stuff that's free is the best deal and ultimately the most coveted. The cardboard sign in a shoe store advertising Shaquille O'Neal wearing Reeboks will be the thing to keep, not the basketball he signed to sell for $300.\" **********Indeed, Mr. Evans divides sports collectibles into two groups. The first he calls \"vintage\" memorabilia. That is anything genuinely used by an athlete or a team, like equipment or uniforms, or anything used in connection with a sport, like advertising, stadium signs, old souvenirs, ticket stubs or sports jewelry. It also includes athletes' autographs snagged free by fans on photos, programs or gear. A decade ago, vintage items made up about 1 percent of the market for sports memorabilia, he said; the rest was sports cards, like baseball cards. Today it has grown to about 10 percent. **********The second group Mr. Evans calls \"created\" memorabilia -- the mass-autographed items -- which accounts for about 15 percent of the sports-memorabilia market. **********Sometimes, that second kind of merchandise can be advertised as more valuable than it really is. For example, in 1993, the baseball star Johnny Bench paid a $5,000 fine to the New York Department of Consumer Affairs for saying on a television shopping show that though baseballs signed by him were worth $129, he was selling them for a mere $50. It turned out that dealers valued his autograph at around $35. **********Counterfeit memorabilia is a continuing problem as well. New York recently passed a law requiring dealers to issue a written certificate of authenticity with each autograph. That certificate would give collectors some proof that the dealer was promising them the real thing should a question of authenticity arise. **********Other athletes and their agents have been investigated for not paying taxes on the cash they were paid for signing autographs at sports and baseball card conventions. **********On the other hand, many players and teams are looking beyond their own personal benefit. Realizing the value of their autographs on merchandise, some are auctioning their own memorabilia to raise money for charity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/01/business/international-briefs-coles-myer-ge-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Coles Myer-G.E.

It offered to pay $250 million for a 50 percent stake in a new company that would jointly own the mortgage along with the existing shareholders of the current mortgage holder, Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. **********The two offers signaled the start of what may become a battle royal for control of Rockefeller Center, which until Wednesday seemed a cherished but cumbersome pile of bricks and mortar mired in a tepid real estate market. Its owners have argued that its value is far less than the $1.3 billion mortgage implies, but several potential buyers have expressed an interest in the property since its owners filed for bankruptcy protection in May. **********The Tishman Speyer deal takes a two-part approach to gaining control of the property. As head of an investor group that is likely to include the Crown family of Chicago, Tishman Speyer would buy a substantial stake in one of the partnerships that owns substantially all of Rockefeller Center, in essence becoming its partner. And it would pay $975 million to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. to buy the mortgage and give the trust's shareholders a 21 percent stake in a new company that would be set up to hold the mortgage. **********The deal would be part of a plan to bring the two partnerships that own Rockefeller Center out of bankruptcy protection. **********In Federal bankruptcy court yesterday, where news of the Tishman Speyer proposal emerged, lawyers for the partnerships said they planned to file a reorganization plan by Sept. 12, when their exclusive right to propose a plan is scheduled to expire. **********\"We're coming in to acquire a large interest in the real estate as well as a large interest in the mortgage,\" said Jerry I. Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., the general partner of Tishman Speyer Properties L.P. \"We're bringing with us, too, the capital with which to carry this property and do the things that have to be done to maintain it as a world-class property.\" **********Tishman Speyer has yet to get binding commitments for financing from other investors, but Mr. Speyer said he was confident that financing would be in place by Sept. 12. He declined to identify other potential investors, but noted that the Crown family had invested in many of Tishman Speyer's American partnerships. **********Stephanie Leggett-Young, spokeswoman for the real estate trust, said the trust's board would review the Tishman Speyer proposal, but added, \"We are moving forward toward a definitive agreement with the Zell investment group.\" **********Mr. Zell, head of Equity Group Investments Inc., said he did not consider the competing offer a threat to his proposal. \"I think the transaction we have entered into is a superior transaction for the shareholders because they will have a better opportunity to share in the upside of their investment,\" he said. **********Mr. Zell's offer threw a lifeline to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., which has received no payments on the mortgage since the center's owners filed for bankruptcy protection in May. The mortgage is the trust's only source of income, and as a result it is facing its own financial difficulties. **********But Tishman Speyer's alliance with the owners of the property may give it a leg up, analysts said. The owner has one significant advantage, which is that it has the exclusive right to offer a plan of reorganization at least until Sept. 12. **********\"There may be a little more leverage in being on the owner's side,\" said Arnold Kastenbaum, an analyst at M. J. Whitman Inc., an investment firm that specializes in distressed companies. **********Mr. Speyer declined to say how much Tishman Speyer would pay the Rockefeller Group Inc. for a \"substantial\" stake in Rockefeller Center Properties, one of the partnerships that owns Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller Group Inc., which is owned 80 percent by the Mitsubishi Estate Company and 20 percent by the Rockefeller family trusts, owns both of the bankrupt partnerships. **********Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefeller family trusts, whose unwillingness to continue covering cash shortages at the property threw the partnerships into bankruptcy protection, would retain a small stake in Rockefeller Center Properties. **********Tishman Speyer values the rest of the deal at $1.235 billion -- consisting of $975 million to buy the mortgage from the real estate trust, a 21 percent stake for the trust's shareholders in the new mortgage holder, and cash that Rockefeller Center Properties can use to pay for operations of the center after bankruptcy. **********But Tishman Speyer refused to place a value on the equity stake it is offering the trust's shareholders or to specify the amount of cash available for financing operations. **********Its unwillingness to lay out those numbers raised questions among some of the trust's big shareholders and creditors, who said the shareholders might get less than current market value for their holdings under the Tishman Speyer proposal. **********Mr. Kastenbaum at M. J. Whitman estimated that under the proposed deal, shareholders would receive $7.38 a share in cash and new equity on a fully diluted basis for each share of Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. they now hold. Yesterday, the shares closed at $7.625. **********Shareholders in the trust would not get a stake in the property itself, meaning that they could not participate in any appreciation in its value, a chance they have under the current terms of the mortgage and would have if the Zell investment group got control of the property through foreclosure. Many real estate experts estimate that Rockefeller Center would be far more more valuable than $1.3 billion if it were broken up and sold in pieces. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Speyer contended that his deal was the best one for the trust's shareholders. \"They're getting cash sans any risk, which is significant,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/us-widening-inquiry-into-microsoft-s-on-line-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1995-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Widening Inquiry Into Microsoft's On-Line Plans", "print_headline": "U.S. Widening Inquiry Into Microsoft's On-Line Plans", "body_text": " **********The Justice Department has broadened its investigation of the Microsoft Corporation's plans for its new on-line network, issuing subpoenas this week to publishers, broadcasters and others who have signed up to be on it. **********The requests for documents from the information suppliers of the on-line service, Microsoft Network, signal a second step in the investigation. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department issued civil investigative demands -- the equivalent of subpoenas -- to Microsoft's rivals in the on-line business, including America Online Inc., H & R Block's Compuserve and Prodigy Services, the joint venture by I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company. **********In the new round of requests, the information suppliers for Microsoft Network are being asked for any documents received after July 1993, written by either suppliers or by Microsoft, that relate to estimates of how many people will sign up for Microsoft Network. **********Microsoft intends to place the access software for its on-line service on the company's new operating system, Windows 95, which is scheduled to go on sale in August. The Justice Department is looking into whether this practice, called bundling, gives Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals in the small but fast-growing market for on-line services. **********The Justice Department seems to seek documents that might show Microsoft plans to use its dominance of the operating-system market -- roughly 85 percent of personal computers run its software -- to dominate the on-line business as well. **********The civilian investigative demand, which one recipient company made available to The New York Times, states that \"because of the urgency of this investigation, the C.I.D. sets a return date for this information of Friday, June 23.\" That is an extremely short timetable to respond to such a request, lawyers said. **********Among other things, the Justice Department demand seeks estimates of how many people will sign up for Microsoft Network for each year from 1995 through 1998 and its expected impact on rival on-line services. **********The on-line business is the third Government investigation of Microsoft. Last year, the company reached a consent agreement with the Government, after conceding to make some changes in how it licenses its software. Last month, Microsoft abandoned an acquisition of Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal-finance software, after a Justice Department challenge. **********But some antitrust experts suggest the Government may well be reluctant to bring another antitrust case against Microsoft, unless it uncovers quite damaging material. **********\"The Justice Department will have a hard time proving that Microsoft is abusing its dominant power in an area in which it doesn't even have a business yet,\" said Charles F. Rule, a partner at Covington & Burling in Washington. **********Still, the company is moving into the on-line business with a formidable head of steam. It has already signed 150 American and 75 foreign companies to supply content for Microsoft Network. **********The main reason that the Justice Department is trying to gather industry data is to determine whether Microsoft will bring new competition to the on-line field or devastate it. The country's largest on-line service is America Online with an estimated 2.2 million subscribers. **********Industry analysts estimate that Windows 95 may sell 30 million copies in its first four months. Microsoft's critics argue that free distribution of its access software on the Microsoft operating system is a huge and unfair advantage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/24/business/seeking-joy-and-crowds-in-mudville-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Sandomir", "pub_date": "1995-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seeking Joy (and Crowds) in Mudville Inc.", "print_headline": "Seeking Joy (and Crowds) in Mudville Inc.", "body_text": " **********After an eight-month absence, major league baseball returns this week, hoping all is forgiven. But just in case it isn't, the 28 teams are offering mea culpas, cut-rate tickets, free yearbooks, snappy slogans, car giveaways and European vacations. **********All this largesse -- a virtual crazy-quilt of promotion -- is intended to win back disgruntled fans and revive ticket sales that have been hammered by the 234-day players' strike, the longest in sports labor history. **********\"I don't think we can do enough,\" said Wayne Long, the vice president for marketing of the Atlanta Braves. **********However baseball reintroduces itself to a wary public, the goal is to increase interest in a season that officially begins tomorrow night when the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Florida Marlins in Miami. On Wednesday there will be a full slate of games, but in contrast to previous seasons, a good number of them will not be sold out. In fact, only the five teams with new ball parks -- Cleveland, Denver, Toronto, Baltimore and Texas -- have been successful in dealing with strike-induced apathy. **********The players' strike virtually halted ticket sales, which usually begin during the winter. Then, when games played by replacements appeared increasingly possible, teams sold cut-rate tickets that went widely unsold. The replacements were sent packing in early April when the players called off their strike, but with barely three weeks to crank up sales, the teams are struggling at the box office. **********Stan Caputo, who bought discount Mets' tickets at Shea Stadium last week, said: \"I don't think I'll go to as many games this year. I gave up my Sunday ticket plan here, but I kept my Yankees' plan.\" **********Mark Bingham, the Mets' vice president of marketing, said: \"It's still too early to say how far off we are in single-ticket sales, but our season-ticket sales are off 10 to 15 percent. We have to get beyond the negatives of the last eight months. People are upset with the sport.\" **********David Sussman, the Yankees' general counsel, said the team's sales perked up with the acquisition of the reliever John Wetteland from the Montreal Expos, and increased a bit more with a cut-rate offer announced Wednesday. **********But thus far, the strike-shortened 144-game season has presented a far-from-normal sales environment in the Bronx. \"We're not expecting a sellout for opening day,\" a feat that the Yankees did achieve last year, Mr. Sussman said. **********The news is no better in San Francisco, where Giant ticket sales are off 30 percent, said Pat Gallagher, a senior vice president. And in Kansas City, the Royals expect no more than 30,000 fans for opening day, nearly 9,000 less than last year. \"Giving up key players like David Cone has turned people off,\" said Steve Sink, a team spokesman. **********One remedy for all this is to find renewed common ground with the fans. And one way to do it is to make gestures that carry an undertone of contrition. **********The Mets have bought full-page newspaper ads with a cartoon fan saying, \"I missed you guys,\" to which the team replies: \"We missed you, too.\" **********The Yankees are apologetic enough to offer 4,500 free bleacher seats for each game during the first week of May. The stubs for those games can be used to buy one ticket and get a second free for any other game during the season. **********The Mets have a more expansive program: all tickets for the April 29 and April 30 games against the St. Louis Cardinals will cost $1. Tickets previously sold at full price for those games can be redeemed for refunds. And throughout May, all food and drink -- except beer -- will be sold at half price. Finally, ticket stubs in May can be redeemed for free reserved seats for any future game, subject to availability. **********The Pittsburgh Pirates are offering half-price tickets for all games through May 11, with 25 percent discounts on parking and concessions. Dodger Stadium opening-day tickets cost the same as they did in 1958 -- $1.50 and $3.50 -- while during the season, Dodgers fans will be eligible to win cars and European trips. **********The Montreal Expos will hold an open practice at Olympic Stadium on May 1 with no charge for admission, then charge half price for general admission to the games on May 6 and 7. The California Angels' opening-day tickets will cost $1, and season-ticket holders will get in free. In Kansas City, there will be 5,000 free seats for each of the first four home games, and free hot dogs and sodas as well. In Milwaukee, where the owner, Bud Selig, is the acting commissioner of baseball, 60 young Brewers fans will line up opposite the players on opening day and receive autographed baseballs from them. **********In Philadelphia, games through May 21 are discounted $3, to $5. \"Even if we lose money on that, we hope it shows people we're thinking of them,\" said Dave Montgomery, the Phillies' executive vice president. **********The Phillies have to hope so. Their season-ticket sales are down to 18,000, from 21,000 last year. Dennis Mannion, the Phillies' vice president of marketing, said: \"At this time last year we were selling 100,000 tickets a week. Now it's 25,000.\" **********The same lament is heard on the other end of Pennsylvania. Last year, with the All-Star Game to serve as a marketing lure, the Pirates saw season-ticket sales rise to 13,000. Now they're down 30 percent and the team is 18,000 seats short of an opening-day sellout. **********\"We're the epitome of what's wrong with baseball,\" said Steve Greenberg, the Pirates' chief marketer. \"We had the best team in baseball from 1990 to 1992, and then we were ripped apart by our financial problems. Now fans see the strike is settled, but there's no agreement. They thought a new collective bargaining agreement would fix our problems. That hasn't happened.\" **********Even a successful team like the Atlanta Braves has seen slow times: fans have renewed only 85 percent of last year's season-ticket sales. **********\"Like any personal relationship, ours with the fans has to be resolved before the love affair can continue,\" said Mr. Long, the team's marking director. **********Still, the suffering isn't universal. In Denver, for instance, season-ticket sales are considered disappointing because they are at 32,800 for brand-new Coors Field, not the 35,000 they were last season at Mile High Stadium. **********\"People have only had baseball for two years and then an eight-month strike,\" said Mike Swanson, a Colorado Rockies spokesman, who sounded low that the team might not sell all 3.6 million seats available during the 72-game season. **********\"Maybe 3.4 million, 3.5 million,\" Mr. Swanson said. **********Like the Rockies, the Baltimore Orioles are not planning any discount ticket promotions for popular Camden Yards, which has essentially been filled to capacity since it opened in 1992. \"Of 3.3 million tickets available, we have commitments for 2.87 million,\" said Joe Foss, the Orioles' vice chairman. Season-ticket sales of 27,500 are \"slightly off,\" but we don't need any specific ticket program to stimulate sales,\" he said. **********But for every Camden Yards, there are two or three Shea Stadiums. And out in Flushing, Queens, last week, fans were taking the Mets up on their offer. \"I was not ready to pay full price for the tickets,\" said Glenn Ackerman of Queens, who was clutching a stack of $1 tickets. \"But for a dollar, it can't be beat. If not for that, I would not be here.\" **********Mark Bingham, the Mets' marketing director, said various price-cutting plans were suggested before the team settled on the \"Baseball for a Buck\" promotion. \"To go to $3 or $4 wouldn't be substantive enough, and we didn't think free made sense,\" he said, \"but at $1 we felt people would use them.\" **********Major League Baseball has no director of marketing -- despite the apparent need for one -- and there is no guarantee that all the clubs will run the \"Welcome to the Show\" commercials on local baseball telecasts. In fact, announcement of the marketing campaign came almost as an afterthought: no news conference, no fanfare, no conference call, just a one-page news release. **********In effect, the teams, and the players, have been left to their own devices in wooing back a discontented public. Which means cheap seats and free food and, in the home of the Padres, the return of the San Diego Chicken. **********\"We're redoubling what we've done in the past,\" said Barry Stockhamer, the Dodgers' vice president of marketing. \"This has been our wake-up call.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/05/business/amylin-plans-to-sell-stock-to-public.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amylin Plans to Sell Stock to Public", "print_headline": "Amylin Plans to Sell Stock to Public", "body_text": " **********Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 2.5 million shares to the public and about 1.27 million shares to Johnson & Johnson. **********Amylin, a biotechnology company based here, said on Friday that the proceeds from the sales would be used to finance the last of three human tests of the company's diabetes product, pramlintide. **********After the sale, Amylin will have about 28 million shares outstanding. **********On June 21, Amylin said that Johnson & Johnson had made an equity investment of about $5 million and said it was committed to buying an additional $10 million to develop pramlintide.

Recently, Wilshire Associates Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif., published a study for institutional investors showing that over the past 21 years the very smallest of 2,500 United States stocks it tracks returned an average of 17 percent a year, while the very largest stocks in this universe returned an average of 11.5 percent a year. (The stocks are ranked in size based on market capitalization, which is the price of the stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.) **********But now some researchers and money managers are questioning this conventional wisdom. The reason: it costs a lot of money to buy and sell small stocks, and those costs can wipe out small stocks' extra gains versus large stocks. **********Small stocks \"are expensive to trade, and when you look at the return differential, this starts to eat up a lot of it,\" said Donald B. Keim, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. **********Mr. Keim and Ananth Madhavan of the University of Southern California have analyzed $85 billion of trades by 21 professional investors, like mutual funds, between January 1991 and March 1993. **********They looked not just at the commissions these investors paid, but also at what is called market impact. Not surprisingly, trying to buy shares can drive their prices up, while trying to sell them can drive the prices down. The bigger the amount you want to buy or sell and the faster you try to do it, the bigger the market impact. **********The professors found that for the very largest trades, buying a large-cap stock costs about 0.16 percent of the total an investor spends, including commissions. But for smaller stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, the same size trade would cost 2.35 percent. And on Nasdaq, that trade would cost 3.34 percent. **********For the smallest purchases, the effect was far less pronounced; big stocks cost 0.31 percent while small stocks cost 0.39 percent on the exchanges. On Nasdaq, where the majority of the tiny stocks trade, small trades in small stocks remain very expensive, at 1.75 percent. **********Similar results come from the Plexus Group, which tracks trading costs for institutional investors (see chart). **********\"What really makes a difference is just that there are fewer people trading\" in small stocks, said Wayne H. Wagner, a partner at Plexus in Santa Monica, Calif. \"At any point in time, it's hard to find the other side of a trade, so you usually need a dealer.\" And dealers want to get paid for the risks of holding these stocks while they are looking for someone else to buy or sell them. **********Of course, most amateur investors are not trading huge amounts of stocks and moving markets. But that does not mean that their costs are lower than those of institutions, said Theodore R. Aronson, a partner at the money-management firm Aronson & Fogler in Philadelphia. \"What rears its ugly head is higher commissions\" that individual investors pay, he said. So the total costs end up being very similar to those incurred by institutions. **********And many individual investors use mutual funds, which in effect turns amateurs into professionals, at least in terms of costs. **********Savvy investors try to keep trading costs down by avoiding the stocks that are hardest -- and most expensive -- to buy, and by trading carefully in small amounts. **********But there is a risk that by sticking with the stocks that trade the most, you lose the benefits of investing in little stocks, concedes George U. Sauter, who manages index funds for the Vanguard Group. **********Another cost-cutting strategy, which amateur investors can easily use, is to trade as little as possible. Unfortunately, most mutual funds that invest in small stocks tend to do a great deal of trading. And buying and holding small stocks can be risky unless you own a very large variety, since little stocks are more likely than big ones to plunge all the way to zero. **********Because investors need to be compensated for that risk, many analysts still assert, small stocks do return more than their larger counterparts. But once you adjust for risk, any advantage small stocks have may indeed be devoured by higher trading costs, said Derek Sasveld, a consultant with Ibbotson Associates in Chicago. **********\"As an asset class, they are still pretty attractive,\" he said. \"You are just not getting anything extra.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/business/into-the-woods-in-asia-myanmar-north-korea-no-sweat-for-hong-kong-firm.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1995-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Into the Woods in Asia; Myanmar?

And the country was overwhelmed by poverty. **********\"Clearly, their economy was a catastrophe,\" Mr. Pike recalled. \"There really was no economic life there.\" **********It was, in short, the sort of place that Peregrine found appealing. For North Korea had one huge asset: opportunity. \"They clearly gave the indication that things were going to change,\" he said. \"I think they're expecting us to be able to bring in capital, companies and clients.\" **********Since that trip, Peregrine has formed a joint banking venture with the Daeson Group, which is controlled by the North Korean Government. And while Peregrine remains the only outside investment firm active in the country, it is also doing business with other countries where many investment banks may tread warily, or not at all. **********It was the first investment bank to move into Myanmar, formerly Burma, ruled by a military dictatorship. It was one of the first to go to Communist-ruled Vietnam. And, when other companies and banks stepped back after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989, the newly created Peregrine only accelerated its activities in China. **********Such willingness to take gambles, combined with a talent for making friends in high places, has helped Peregrine grow from a start-up with $38 million to spend into a regional powerhouse in a little more than six years. But its willingness to strike alliances with some of Asia's more unsavory regimes, and accusations of unethical behavior ranging from market manipulation to plagiarism, have created a serious image problem for the bank. **********Its ties with the Myanmar Government, which crushed civil unrest in the late 1980's and continues to imprison the leader of the country's democratic opposition, have soured some of its investors, for example. The Quantum Fund N.V., run by the American financier George Soros, recently divested itself of 10,000 shares of Peregrine stock. **********While other Western companies have footholds in China and Vietnam, some human-rights advocates dislike what they regard as Peregrine's unapologetic embrace of dictatorial regimes. \"We're strongly opposed to any business going into a country like North Korea or Burma or even China unless it is willing to press for human rights and a greater respect for the rule of law,\" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia in New York. **********The Economist magazine noted recently that while other banks did business in China, \"the difference is that Peregrine does not even affect to hold its nose.\" **********None of this fazes Philip L. Tose, Peregrine's chairman and co-founder, who contends that a dismal political or human-rights record of a regime is no reason to avoid a lucrative market. \"Yes, there had been a very unfortunate incident which had a lot of coverage, shocked a lot of people,\" Mr. Tose said of the Tiananmen Square killings. \"But underneath all that, nothing really had changed in terms of the fundamentals that had made people originally want to invest in those areas. **********\"Our view,\" Mr. Tose said, \"and it's a very controversial view, is that countries develop through economic dialogue. Simply introducing political democracy is not necessarily the first step that should be taken. It is better to increase the standard of living of the people, which in turn will lead over time to social change, political change, etc.\" **********Francis Leung Pak To, Peregrine's managing director and Mr. Tose's partner, said the bank had come to the conclusion \"that these events were just a hiccup.\" **********\"We decided we wanted to take advantage of depressed market conditions at the time,\" he said. Peregrine rapidly bought control of two companies which it used to expand its asset base and to raise capital. **********Mr. Tose also brushes aside ethical lapses by his bank. In 1993, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong reprimanded Peregrine for engaging in \"trading activity which was, or was likely to be, prejudicial to the interests of the investing public\" by buying back shares that it had previously sold in an effort to disguise the real market for those shares. **********\"It happened at a time we were growing very fast and frankly we didn't have the right systems in place of checks and balances,\" Mr. Tose said. \"We have now. I think a recurrence of something like that would be difficult.\" **********But tripping over the line of the permissible did not end there. Earlier this year, Peregrine published a long research report on the economic prospects of Myanmar. The report was intended to promote the group's own access to the military regime and the country's business community; the problem, however, was that the contents of the report were plagiarized from a report on Myanmar written by a smaller Hong Kong securities firm, Kerry Securities. **********Mr. Leung blamed the Myanmar office for the plagiarism, and said the office was not closely supervised. \"That was an example of growing pains,\" he said. **********Whatever its public image, Peregrine has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Asian banking. It was founded in late 1988 by Mr. Tose, who had previously headed a Citicorp venture in Hong Kong, and by Mr. Leung, one of his rising stars there. The two men cobbled together $38 million (United States) from some of Hong Kong's wealthiest business leaders. Though the founders wanted to call their new firm Falcon, they could not obtain rights to the name, Mr. Tose said, so they chose Peregrine, a breed of the same bird of prey. \"We like it because it's an aggressive bird,\" Mr. Tose said. \"It typifies what we are.\" **********Since then, the capital base of Peregrine has soared to $550 million, which would put it at the lower end of the top 20 investment banks in the United States. It had revenue of $3.74 billion last year, up from $233 million in 1989. And while profit fell last year, to $82.5 million from $112 million in 1993, Mr. Tose said the results were not \"nearly as bad as many of the international investment banking houses.\" Peregrine also managed to tighten its grip on the market for initial public offerings in China and Hong Kong, increasing its share to 75 percent from 60 percent in 1993. **********Analysts attribute much of the success of Peregrine to the founders' brilliant choice of investors. They include Li Ka-shing, one of the world's richest men, who made much of his fortune in Hong Kong's property market; Gordon Wu, a property developer, and Larry Yung, head of the Hong Kong branch of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the mainland's principal investment bank. **********Peregrine has also built an impressive list of high-level contacts across Asia, where it has opened 25 offices in 14 countries, both its admirers and competitors say. **********Mr. Li, whose vast business empire includes ports in Hong Kong and China, hotels, telecommunications ventures, satellite services and electric power projects, made no bones about the importance of knowing the right people. And in Asia, he said, that usually means having influence with the right families. **********\"If you were working in Europe or America at the turn of the century, your connections were vital,\" Mr. Li said. \"Without them, you were dead. Asia is to a degree at that stage of development today. It's not quite, because everyone has moved on a little bit. But business, industry, government to a degree, are controlled by families just the way they were in the West at the turn of the century.\" **********Mr. Tose said he would like to reduce Peregrine's reliance on China and Hong Kong to half its business from the current 80 percent. As a result, the bank keeps pushing into other parts of Asia. **********Today, for example, it has 250 employees in the three major cities of South Korea and is the only foreign company with a seat on the Seoul stock exchange. In Myanmar, it has opened Peregrine Capital Myanmar Ltd., which among other things has invested in a shrimp-processing plant. **********For some people, sniping at Peregrine for its supposed cozying up to dictatorships smacks of sour grapes. \"The success of Peregrine is a measure of the failure of competitors to take advantage of market conditions,\" said a Hong Kong banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"The market here needed a local investment bank more in tune with their needs, particularly smaller companies that want to come to the market.\" **********A European banker here, who has watched Peregrine's march through Asia with some admiration, said he had one major concern -- that the expansion had gone too fast. \"The jury is well and truly out,\" the banker said. \"Management there is very thin. For a company that size it is surprising that decisions are made by three or four people. Clearly there is a lot of skepticism about whether they can manage a business of that size.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/business-digest-861095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Stocks Continue Surge As News Cheers Traders  The stock market roared into record territory once again, led by a friendly bond market, good corporate earnings and new signs of a cooling economy. **********The Dow industrials surged 44.27 points, to 4,373.15, and other indexes followed. \"This was a beautiful day,\" one analyst said.

It ended in shooting that left six bodyguards dead and a half-brother of President Hussein, Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti, seriously injured, according to a front-page account today in Asharq al-Awsat, a Saudi newspaper. **********The Saudi paper said that the discussion erupted into a shouting match in which Mr. Tikriti, who was relieved of his job as Interior Minister on May 22, urged President Hussein to curtail the authority of his elder son, Uday, and his son-in- law, Lieut.

The Northeast, in particular, is seen by analysts as ripe for a wave of mergers because the big New York City banks have been preoccupied with recovering from their bad real estate loans and have not been actively buying smaller banks.  [ Page D4. ] **********The merger announced yesterday \"will change the landscape in the Northeast,\" said Milton Berlinsky, an investment banker with Goldman, Sachs & Company who represented First Fidelity. \"The New York banks will wake up and find a major force with $13 billion in market capitalization on their doorstep.\" **********First Union, the nation's ninth-largest banking company, will be acquiring a banking company that has already been rapidly buying other institutions in the New York market. First Union itself has grown tenfold in the last decade through a marathon of 55 acquisitions. And Edward E. Crutchfield, First Union's chairman, said yesterday that he planned to use First Fidelity as a beachhead to make other acquisitions in the Northeast. **********Mr. Crutchfield said there were 888 banks and savings and loan associations with assets of less than $1 billion in the six states in which First Fidelity does business. And there are 83 larger banks. That represents far more potential fish to catch than are left in the South. **********\"The consolidation game is largely over in the South,\" he said. **********For New Jersey, the deal ends the independence of the state's largest bank. But the impact on First Fidelity employees and bank customers will be moderate. Since the two banks have no overlapping operations, there will be no additional branch closing as a result of the deal. And the banks said they would trim expenses by a modest 5 percent, mainly in computer operations and corporate staff areas. **********After the deal, First Union will be the country's sixth-largest bank, with 2,000 branches -- more than any other bank -- in 13 Eastern and Southern states. It will have assets of $124 billion and serve 10.5 million customers. **********The announcement represents the end of a frenzied month of negotiations in which First Fidelity was close to a merger with the Bank of Boston. That deal was abandoned, and the bank sought an offer from First Union under pressure from Banco Santander, the Spanish bank that owns 30 percent of First Fidelity's stock, investment bankers said. **********Santander preferred selling First Fidelity to First Union because that bank would offer a premium above First Fidelity's market price. In the deal announced yesterday, First Union will exchange 1.35 of its shares, worth $64.29, based on Friday's close, for each First Fidelity share. That represents a 32 percent premium over First Fidelity's close last week of $48.75. **********First Fidelity's stock closed up $10.25 yesterday, to $59, on the New York Stock Exchange. First Union's shares declined $1.75, to $45.875. **********Mr. Crutchfield of First Union said that he had been seeking to buy First Fidelity for three years. In banking there are many growing companies that want to buy other banks. Deals occur when bank executives decide it is time to sell. **********Anthony P. Terracciano, First Fidelity's chairman, was said to prefer the deal with the Bank of Boston because he would become chief executive of the combined institution, investment bankers said. Ira Stepanian, Bank of Boston's chairman, would have kept that title for several years, but would give up the chief executive title. **********Under the deal with First Union, Mr. Terracciano, 56, will become president of First Union. Nationsbank, First Union's rival in Charlotte, expressed interest in First Fidelity, investment bankers said, but it offered less money and did not offer a senior management role for Mr. Terracciano. **********This deal represents the third time that the Bank of Boston has been stood up at the altar in a major merger deal. Earlier this year, it had been negotiating a merger with the Fleet Financial Group, when that Providence-based bank decided instead to buy the Shawmut National Corporation in Hartford. And a few years before that, the Bank of Boston was close to a deal with Shawmut. **********A Bank of Boston spokesman said the bank did not comment on merger negotiations. **********At a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, Mr. Terracciano said that First Fidelity had been in negotiation with several banks, but he declined to identify them. **********A spokesman for Banco Santander declined to comment other than to say it held only 2 of the 28 seats on First Fidelity's board and was obligated to vote with management and the majority of the board. People familiar with the transaction said that the Spanish bank could have found other ways to put pressure on the board to go with First Union. When the deal is consummated at the end of this year, Banco Santander will end up owing 11.4 percent of First Union's stock. **********At the news conference, Mr. Terracciano was upbeat over the prospects of the combined banks. He said that First Union offered investments like mutual funds and investment banking for medium-sized companies that could be offered at First Fidelity branches. **********\"We have worked for almost five years in fixing the franchise we had,\" Mr. Terracciano said. \"What we need to get full value from that is a massive infusion of new products.\" **********Analysts do give credit to Mr. Terracciano, a former top executive of the Mellon Bank Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, for working through the bank's severe loan problems and substantially cutting its costs. They have criticized him, however, for being so focused on cost control that he did not find ways to increase the bank's revenue. **********At First Union, Mr. Terracciano will remain in Newark and run the merged bank's operations in the North, its future acquisitions and its growing investment banking activities. John R. Georgius, 50, who had been First Union's president, becomes its vice chairman looking after banks in the South and various staff functions. These two executives, along with Mr. Crutchfield, will form an office of the chairman. **********For many bank customers who have only recently found their bank purchased by First Fidelity, the deal means getting used to yet another name on their checks and yet a new set of products and policies. First Fidelity has been actively buying banks in the New York suburbs, acquiring among others Union Trust in Connecticut and the People's Westchester Bank in New York. **********First Union is paying a high price for First Fidelity -- 1.92 times its book value -- especially in light of the fact that there are few opportunities to save money from overlapping operations. **********\"What sets this transaction apart from others is its dependence on their needing to get incremental revenue for it to be a good deal for shareholders,\" said Sandra J.

Richardson, 58, who will remain as chairman. **********David Nash, 54, Burger King's chairman and chief executive of food operations for Grand Metrpolitan P.L.C., the chain's British parent, was named to replace Mr. Adamson on an interim basis. **********In making the announcement, Mr. Richardson, a former wide receiver for the Baltimore Colts and co-owner of the new Carolina Panthers professional football franchise, said the demands of preparing for the Panthers' first season in the National Football League required increasing amounts of his time. **********Wall Street analysts said the timing was right for other reasons as well. **********Over the last few years, Mr. Richardson has been forced to cope with the more than $2 billion in debt the company incurred in 1989, when Coniston Partners acquired what was then the TW Corporation in a leveraged buyout. **********He has also had to deal with the impact of accusations that Denny's restraurants discriminated against black customers. In May, the company paid $54 million to settle two Federal class-action lawsuits contending racial bias. **********And over the last year and a half, he has been moving vigorously to strengthen Flagstar's operating divisions by hiring experienced outside managers. During that period, new executives have been hired to run Denny's, which accounts for roughly 40 pecent of Flagstar's revenues, as well as the company's El Pollo Loco and Hardee's chains. Mr. Adamson's appointment is the capstone. **********Mr. Richardson said yesterday that negotiations with Mr. Adamson began about a month ago. **********\"The thing that attracted us, and me personally, is that he has experience in dealing with food service, with investment bankers and he brings great marketing skills to the company.\" **********During his tenure as Burger King's chief executive, a post he has held since July 1993, Mr. Adamson sharply narrowed the focus of the chain's menus, shored up relationships with Burger King's franchisees and carried out a number of successful marketing campaigns, most recently one featuring Disney's hit movie \"The Lion King.\" **********Mr. Adamson joined Burger King in 1991 as president of the company's retail division. Previously, he served as executive vice president at Revco Inc., the retail drugstore chain. . **********\"The main thing he did at Burger King was to get the company focused on what it is: burgers, fries and Cokes,\" said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montogmery Securities in San Francisco.. **********\"For the last six months to nine months Burger King has been achieving very strong same store sales growth, and that has affected others in the industry.\" **********While the news came as a shock to Burger King, investors did not seem terribly impressed with Mr. Adamson's move.

Reach Accord on Pullout and Election", "body_text": " **********After months of failure and frustration, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization outlined an agreement today on Israeli Army withdrawals in the West Bank that set the stage for Palestinian elections and expanded self-rule. **********The two sides fixed July 25 for signing a completed deal. But there was no guarantee they would meet that target because many details must still be worked out, including arrangements for West Bank troop movements, elections, transfers of civil authority and releases of Palestinians from Israeli jails. **********A senior Palestinian official, Faisal al-Husseini, said the signing ceremony would be held in Washington, an echo of the agreement and handshaking at the White House in September 1993 that capped a mutual recognition by Israel and the P.L.O. **********But there was no formal announcement about Washington, and on both sides other officials declined to discuss the location. A Clinton Administration official said that a White House ceremony was possible but that uncertainties remained. **********If the choice is Washington, it adds credibility to the July 25 date, an important issue in negotiations that have seen many lapsed deadlines, including a July 1 target that had become an important symbol. **********In a statement after two hours of talks today in Gaza City, the two sides said that \"understandings have been reached on main aspects of the interim agreement,\" with details to be worked out over the next three weeks. **********\"We have agreed on the principles, but to write it down takes a long time,\" said Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, who had met in Gaza with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman. **********Mr. Arafat said, \"We hope that we have achieved something concrete in our hand so that we can have, very soon, the agreement and the redeployment and after that the elections.\" **********For the last 14 months, under the 1993 accord, the Palestinians have governed themselves in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho, with an understanding that in short order their authority is to be extended throughout the West Bank. By next May, the parties are supposed to move on to negotiate thorny issues like the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, with the territories' so-called final status to be resolved by early May 1999. **********Little has happened in short order, however. **********Under the original timetable, for example, Palestinian elections and Israeli troop redeployments in the West Bank were to have taken place a full year ago. But all schedules were knocked out of kilter by complex security problems in the West Bank created by the intertwining of Israeli settlements and Palestinian towns -- concerns that became more vivid than ever for Israelis after a series of Islamic suicide bombings. **********So, while critical details are still unresolved, the agreement in principle reached by Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres today was an important breakthrough. It reflects, an Israeli official said, a realization that \"we can't go on like this and need to put an end to it.\" **********The Israelis say they are prepared to pull their forces out of all major Palestinian cities in the West Bank except Hebron, a perennially troubled town and the only one in the territories where Arabs and Jews live directly alongside one another. **********On Monday, Mr. Peres said that withdrawals would also take place in most of the hundreds of Arab villages except those along the West Bank border with Israel and on roads to Jerusalem. The Army, he and other officials said, would retain exclusive control over the 125 or so Israeli settlements in the West Bank and on access roads used primarily by the 135,000 settlers there. **********The main point of contention seems to concern villages and open areas lying between the major Palestinian cities and the settlements -- places where Mr. Arafat's desire for territorial control collides with Israel's insistence on tight security measures. **********Although officials on both sides said little, Israeli television reported tonight that these areas would be governed by a patchwork system. Under it, Palestinians would have full civil authority in some places and limited control in others. Some areas may be patrolled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian forces and others only by the Israeli Army. **********No dates were mentioned for the likely start of Israeli withdrawals or Palestinian elections. **********The key, said Uri Savir, a senior Israeli negotiator, is that any transfer of security responsibilities from Israel to the Palestinians will be gradual. Possibly as early as Wednesday, Mr. Savir is to begin fleshing out the details with his counterpart, Ahmed Khoury, with whom he negotiated the original 1993 agreement. **********\"For us it is important that in the first stage we will control the main part of the territory, which will be under exclusive Army control,\" he said. **********Israel Television quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as saying that the P.L.O. had committed itself to follow through on a longstanding but unfulfilled promise to eliminate clauses of its charter calling for Israel's destruction. If those changes do not occur a few months after Palestinian elections are held, possibly in the fall, Israel will slow its Army redeployments, Mr. Rabin supposedly said. **********In addition, Israel Television reported that the transfer of security responsibility to the Palestinians in villages and open areas would stretch into mid-1997. **********If true, that is a significant point. It means that it would fall to a new Israeli Government to complete the arrangements since Israel must hold elections by November 1996. And the rightist opposition says that if it wins next year, it will not feel obligated to continue Mr. Rabin's policies on this score. **********Mr. Husseini, the Palestinian official, said the first Army withdrawals would take place in and around Jenin, the northernmost city in the West Bank. Other places targeted for full Palestinian control are Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah and Bethlehem. But Mr. Rabin said on Monday that redeployments in Ramallah and Bethlehem, both near Jerusalem, would be gradual, the pace depending on the construction of bypass roads for settlers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/world/us-allies-press-russia-for-chechnya-peace-settlement-kohl-cautions-yeltsin.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Allies to Press Russia for Chechnya Peace Settlement; Kohl Cautions Yeltsin", "print_headline": "U.S. and Allies to Press Russia for Chechnya Peace Settlement; Kohl Cautions Yeltsin", "body_text": " **********Under increasing pressure to take a stronger position against the Russian assault on the secessionist region of Chechnya, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that he had told President Boris N.

You didn't buy McDonald's, whose shares have jumped nearly 40 percent since last summer. And you missed out on Micron Technology, whose stock has more than doubled in six months. And now with the market so toppy, finding stocks with \"oomph\" left just got harder. **********There is hope for last-minute shoppers, especially among the neglected stocks of smaller companies. With the exception of technology stocks, these shares have lagged the market as anxious investors have rushed into the arms of their old favorite consumer growth companies. \"People get too enamored with the consumer names of the 1980's,\" said Charles Mayer, a portfolio manager for the Invesco Industrial Income Fund. \"They're the only growth stocks they know.\" **********But there are plenty of other fast-growing companies that deserve recognition. To find them, we asked Claudia Mott, an analyst who tracks small and medium-sized companies for Prudential Securities, to comb a data base of public companies for bargains. The analysis focused on 859 medium-sized companies, those with market values of $750 million to $4 billion, because they offer much of the stability of large companies, their shares usually trade on the New York Stock Exchange and they are often ignored by Wall Street. \"The values really are in the smaller stocks,\" said David Klaskin, president of Oak Ridge Investments, a Chicago money management firm. **********By choosing only companies with consistent profit growth, a cheap price, and safe levels of debt, a final list of 10 potential picks emerged. To get there, companies had to average annual earnings growth of at least 20 percent in each of the last three quarters. Companies with down quarters or slowing earnings in the last nine months were eliminated, along with companies with annual losses during the last three years. **********But because a company's future is more important than its past, the analysis also tried to find company's where the good times would continue to roll. Only companies whose annual earnings are expected by analysts to grow in the double digits during the next few years were included. **********To make sure these stocks had not already run up in price, the list was restricted to underachievers that had not recently visited their 52-week highs. Any stock that was trading at an excessive multiple over current earnings or over its projected growth rate was dismissed. **********FOR example, Solectron, a circuit board maker that fell off the list, trades at about 18 times what analysts think it will earn this year, compared with the 13 times that companies its size average. **********Not that all the companies that made the list are screaming buys. Take International Game Technology. Once a darling of investors, because its earnings per share have risen more than 60 percent three times from one quarter to the next, the company has run into slowing demand for its gaming machines.  First-quarter earnings were down 16 percent, compared with the previous quarter, and Wall Street has punished it: The stock has plummeted from a high of $33.25 to $13.50 recently. \"There's a lot of questions surrounding their earnings,\" said Mr. Klaskin of Oak Ridge. He sold his shares on concerns about the company's prospects. **********That's not to say there aren't other down-and-outers among the list to consider, including EMC of Hopkinton, Mass., a maker of storage devices for large computers. Investors fled because they were afraid that the company, which has only $1.4 billion in sales, would be squashed by the much larger International Business Machines. Insiders have also been selling. **********\"I think they're going to pull through and that there's no evidence that those fears are being materialized,\" said Rodney Linafelter, a portfolio manager for the Berger Funds. And the company has managed to wrest away market share from I.B.M. and has more than 25 percent of the data-storage market, according to Value Line. At its current price of $16.75, the stock is selling at a multiple of 11 -- less than half its expected long-term growth rate of 25 percent. **********There are also plenty of stocks in businesses that Wall Street shuns, whether it is selling women's apparel, like Nordstrom, or making anti-lock braking systems for General Motors and Ford, like Varity. **********Nordstrom, the retailer in Seattle, \"is an out-of-favor stock in an out-of-favor group,\" said Richard Lazarchic, a portfolio manager for the IDS Funds. While consumers seem to be dressing down, some managers say it is only a matter of time before people replace the tired stuff in their closets. People have already bought cars and redecorated their houses.  Profits are already improving and analysts say earnings should grow 14 percent in the coming years. **********And if you think people will continue to feather their nests, there are some other stocks on the list worth noting: Leggett & Platt, which makes the springs for mattresses and upholstered sofas, and Helig-Meyers, a purveyor of furniture and appliances.

But among the big power leaders only the Canadians were enthusiastic, and all the Group of Seven agreed to do was study the proposition. No surprise there: radical change rarely occurs without a catalyst. But this is one area where the Group of Seven, if it were prepared to move faster, would find that a little advance planning goes a long way toward delivering a big payoff. **********The Mexican debacle was a warning that sovereign borrowers live on a knife edge. For while the Mexican Government lacked the cash to redeem its debts, almost everyone agreed that it was not insolvent. Mexico had plenty of income from export earnings to service the interest on its dollar-denominated debt, but nonetheless lost the confidence of private lenders. **********In the end the Clinton Administration scrounged the $50 billion that Mexico needed to roll over the debt and halt the flight of capital, but it was a near thing. Old-line Democrats in Congress turned their backs on the President, while the new Republican majority took the occasion to reaffirm that politics does not stop at the water's edge. **********This explains the White House's support for the much more modest Halifax plan, which would help take the United States off the hook but not go as far as the bankruptcy approach. That idea is to give the I.M.F. greater authority to act as a lender-of-last-resort. And best of all, from the White House viewpoint, would be if Saudi Arabia, Scandinavia and other deep foreign pockets ponied up the cash for the new operation. But none of them are very enthusiastic, which is one reason, among others, why creating a kind of bankruptcy judge for the global economy could be a much better alternative. **********Consider some basics. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, American-style, accomplishes three things for a corporation lacking the cash to pay its creditors. **********First, the law creates a time-out during which creditors cannot force the debtors to liquidate assets at a fire sale. Second, it allows a bankrupt company to borrow funds on a priority basis to keep the business going. Third, it empowers the judge to impose a settlement when the business is healthy enough to operate but lacks the assets to pay the creditors 100 cents on the dollar. **********Sovereign governments aren't corporations, Mr. Sachs acknowledges, but a distressed government shares many of the problems of a distressed corporation. Suppose the I.M.F. had the authority to suspend a country's obligations to service foreign debt. That would prevent, say, a creditor in New York from seizing the aircraft of its national airline, just as bankruptcy protection prevents a disorderly liquidation of corporate assets. **********By the same token, if the I.M.F. had the authority to put new creditors at the head of the line, it would allow countries to borrow in private capital markets to meet vital needs. That alone would probably have ended Mexico's financial crisis. **********After all, that's essentially what the Clinton Administration did, in an ad hoc fashion. The $50 billion line of credit is collateralized by Mexico's revenues from oil exports -- a claim that effectively supersedes the claims of Mexico's other creditors. **********So why not formalize it? **********Where governments are insolvent in the sense that they cannot realistically be asked to repay all their old debts, the I.M.F. could force creditors to settle. This would prevent the sort of debt gridlock that left much of the third world and its private creditors in limbo for much of the 1980's. **********There are problems, of course. John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is skeptical of the bankruptcy approach. \"It would transform the I.M.F. into a legal institution,\" he says. Such a transformation might fit its charter, but that doesn't mean it would be easily accepted by private creditors with political muscle in their home countries. And with the I.M.F. caught between creditors and debtors, he expects it would only be able to force settlements if it also brought along money to \"sweeten the pot.\" **********Mr. Sachs acknowledges the I.M.F. would remain a creature of international politics that could not rule without collective consent. But he is convinced that a formal bankruptcy mechanism would be so superior to informal rescue operations that once in place it would win the needed support. **********Turning the I.M.F. into a bankruptcy court \"would take an act of imagination,\" Mr. Sachs argues. And like most big changes, he suggests, \"it seems impossible until you try it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/spending-it-here-s-a-course-in-personal-finance-101-the-hard-way.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bryce", "pub_date": "1995-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Here's a Course in Personal Finance 101, the Hard Way", "print_headline": "SPENDING IT; Here's a Course in Personal Finance 101, the Hard Way", "body_text": " **********NICOLE WALTERS, a 20-year-old junior at the University of Texas, carries two Visa cards, two Mastercards, two department store credit cards -- and two part-time jobs to dig herself out of debt. **********\"I was buying things here and there and all of a sudden, $4,000 later, those little things added up,\" Ms. Walters said. She recalls buying a $600 car stereo, some clothes and gas for her car, but nothing else major. **********Just a few hours on the university campus here turned up nearly a dozen students with similar tales of woe: a 19-year-old freshman with five cards said he owed $2,200, a 22-year-old senior acknowledged running up $8,000 on eight cards and a 26-year-old senior described $9,000 in bills on eight cards. The spending sprees weren't for school-related essentials, but for personal items and luxuries. For the card holders who graduate with thousands of dollars in student loans, too, managing the debt may amount to a crash course in personal finance. **********Credit counselors in college towns across the country say students with large card debts are increasingly common. \"Five years ago, we weren't seeing anybody still in college with as much debt as we are seeing now,\" said Candace Acevedo of the San Francisco office of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a nonprofit group providing financial education and debt advice.  Five percent of the clients in her debt management program are students with at least $5,000 in credit card debt, she said. And the group's other offices in big college towns like Austin, Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia, Mo., report similar figures. **********Although some students reach out to credit counseling agencies for help when their card bills become overwhelming, many resort to the most reliable creditors of all: Mom and Dad. Thus, parents paying for books, tuition and housing may also wind up paying their son's or daughter's Visa and American Express bills. If they don't pick it up before, parents may be tempted to pay off card debt at college graduation so their children can embark on their working lives without a burden. **********\"I think it's the parents who really take the brunt of this,\" said Irene Leech, a credit counselor and assistant professor of consumer studies at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. \"Parents want their child to have the best, so they do all they can to help their children deal with these debts.\" **********For a student, a credit card is as readily available as a class syllabus. Card applications are found in bookstores, campus publications and student mailboxes. To attract students, card issuers offer free concerts, plane tickets, T-shirts, even candy. According to Roper College Track, a research division of Roper Starch Worldwide, more than half of the 5.1 million full-time undergraduate students at four-year universities in the United States now have at least one major credit card. Mastercard International estimates that 80 percent of all college students carry a credit card by their senior year. **********In 1994, Americans used more than 350 million major credit cards -- Visa, Discover, Mastercard and American Express -- to purchase more than half a trillion dollars of goods and services. With that much plastic money coursing through the system, why are issuers bothering with relatively poor college students? **********For one, they want to build loyal customers at an early age. A study several years ago by Marketing Week magazine showed that 75 percent of college students keep their first card for 15 years, and 60 percent keep that card for life. Furthermore, college students are not entirely without money. Roper says the average student has an annual income of $4,000. **********But if a student owes $2,000 on a credit card, repaying the debt can take years, especially when interest rates rise. The recent increase in rates caught Kevin LeBlanc by surprise. Mr. LeBlanc, a senior at the University of Texas, has two major credit cards with $500 credit lines, both of which are at their limit. \"I just got a letter that said, 'We are changing your interest rate from 14.9 percent to 18.9 percent' and you can't do anything about it,\" he said. **********Before the rate increase, Mr. LeBlanc said, his minimum payment \"used to pay off a little bit of the balance.\" Now, he said, \"all it does is pay my interest.\" **********Overall delinquency rates on credit cards have been declining since 1989, when nearly 5 percent of card holders were behind in their payments. Last year, the delinquent portion fell to about 3 percent, but it has risen recently. **********Although no statistics are available on late card payments by students, who now account for less than 3 percent of the domestic credit card business, counselors suggest that the group may be having more trouble than other borrowers. \"I think it's a much bigger problem than is being recognized,\" said Allen Clary, a credit counselor in Raleigh, who figures that the average student in his program has $10,000 in card debt. **********If students were falling hopelessly behind on their debts and refusing to pay, card issuers would undoubtedly stop lending to them. James Daly, editor of Credit Card News, a newsletter published in Chicago, says the parental safety net may keep that from happening. As credit risks, college students look no worse than the rest of the population, he said. But he added, \"My impression is that a lot of them are getting help from their parents.\" **********Critics say the card issuers have courted collegians too aggressively. Last year, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the Massachusetts Democrat, threatened to introduce legislation that would limit the ability of issuers to provide credit cards to students. Mr. Kennedy also conducted a hearing of the House Banking subcommittee on consumer credit and insurance to hear complaints from students and parents about the industry. **********RUTH E. SUSSWEIN, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer advocacy group based in Salem, Va., testified at the hearing. In a recent interview, she said students \"are being encouraged to put all these things on plastic\" -- things like vacations. **********Rus Maxham, a sophomore engineering student from Dallas, owes $2,200 on his credit cards, mostly because of a skiing trip to Lake Tahoe for spring break. Are credit cards too easy to get? \"Yes,\" Mr. Maxham said. \"A Visa card came in the mail, and I didn't even ask for it. It said, 'Just call this number to activate it.' It's like they're saying, 'Here's some rope, kid. Go hang yourself.' \" **********For several years, Ms. Susswein has been pushing credit card companies to help educate their young clients. The issuers have responded. American Express has distributed 10,000 personal finance education packets to high school teachers across the country. In 1991, Visa developed a personal finance program that is now used in 10,000 high schools, said Susan Murdy, a spokeswoman for Visa. In 1993, Mastercard created a video program on personal finance, which it has distributed for free to 18,000 high schools. **********In general, high schools spend little time teaching students about budgeting and banking. \"I think schools are doing a better job on sex education than they are on financial education,\" said Steve Apesos, a spokesman for Mastercard. \"In a survey we did two years ago of 400 high school students, 96 percent of them said they don't get any personal finance education in school.\" **********Some students have gotten the message, whether from their parents or their teachers, and use their credit cards strictly for convenience, fastidiously paying off the balances every month. **********Larry Sacks, a senior at the University of Texas majoring in history, carries a Visa and a Mastercard but says he stopped short of taking an American Express card. He says he does not overdo the card purchases. \"Who can afford to charge the maximum on them?\" asked Mr. Sacks, who comes from St. Louis. \"I think they are a dangerous thing, so I pay mine off every month.\" **********What's a student to do if he flunks the credit card test the first time? **********Consolidating the bills into student loans at interest rates of 7 to 9 percent may be a less painful way to pay off the cards, most of which charge interest rates of 15 to 20 percent. **********Eva Hensley, director of the credit counseling office in Columbia, considers that preferable to a parental rescue. \"It doesn't teach the students any responsibility if every time they get into a difficult situation they have their parents bail them out,\" she said, noting that 26 percent of the clients of her office are students and that their average card debt is $7,500. **********Ms. Walters, the University of Texas junior, has not hidden her problem from her parents. During the school year, she has been working about 30 hours a week, on weekend days as a sales clerk and on weekend nights as a restaurant hostess. While she is making progress, she plans to \"work a whole lot\" this summer to get her debt firmly under control. She has decided not to get any more cards, even though the applications keep rolling in, and she has cut up the ones she had. **********\"We pay all of her college expenses and insurance for her car, so her only expenses are for clothes and makeup,\" said Nicole's mother, Anita Walters. Although she and her husband, Bill, a sales manager for a large electronics concern, could easily pay off Nicole's bills, she said they had decided against it. \"She has to learn in this day and age that you can't do that,\" Mrs. Walters said. \"Mom and Dad aren't going to be here forever.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-a-bozell-office-gets-new-owners.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Bozell Office Gets New Owners", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; A Bozell Office Gets New Owners", "body_text": " **********Two top executives of the Washington office of Bozell Worldwide along with an executive of Pitney Bowes Inc. have acquired that Bozell office and renamed it Laughlin, Marinaccio & Owens.

His arms hung bare from the shoulders of his plaid shirt, for he had ripped off the sleeves to wrap around his badly swollen feet. **********He and thousands of other men had been on the run from the Serbian Army since the Serbs captured the United Nations-designated \"safe area\" at Srebrenica two weeks ago. They gave their accounts today, and they and United Nations officials said there had been signs -- though no firm evidence -- that soldiers from the regular Yugoslav Army had joined Bosnian Serbs in the attack. **********\"They hunted us like rabbits,\" Mr. Hasamovic said. He added that the fleeing columns had been bombarded by rockets and mortars, and that at one point a Bosnian Serb unit had fired on them from 20 yards away. **********Along the way, one man pulled the pin on a grenade, killing himself and three other men, Mr. Hasamovic said. Another man hanged himself from a tree with his belt, he said. **********\"They didn't want to be captured,\" Mr. Hasamovic said. There have been scores of accounts of the Serbs torturing and killing people captured at Srebrenica, and the refugees gave more accounts of atrocities today, though their stories have been impossible to verify. The Serbs have denied committing atrocities. **********Mr. Hasamovic, his 18-year-old son and 10 other men, some in their 50's, reached the refugee camp here today, telling tales of survival in the mountainous terrain that would impress the toughest and best-trained marines. Several thousand men are still believed to be in the forest. **********In a nearby tent in the refugee village set up at the airport here, Nedad Handzic was writing his account of the fall of Srebrenica, where he had been working as an interpreter for a Swedish relief agency. **********Some of the information in his account, as well as those of other refugees and the United Nations, indicated that the army of the rump Yugoslavia may have been involved in seizing Srebrenica. **********His account and those of other refugees say that soldiers forced Dutch peacekeepers to give up their uniforms and took at least one of their armored personnel carriers, then lured men from the forest by broadcasting over a megaphone that they were United Nations peacekeepers and would protect them. Mr. Handzic said he would turn his account over to the United Nations here this afternoon. **********A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Fernando del Mundo, said refugees had stated that in one instance about 30 women and children had surrendered to what they thought was a group of United Nations peacekeepers only to be lined up and killed with machine guns. **********For at least one family from Srebrenica, there were tears of joy today, when 19-year-old Ramiz Alic showed up at the refugee camp. He had walked through the mountains for seven days without food, he said, before being rescued and taken to a hospital where he was treated for a bullet wound in the arm. **********Lying in a tent dressed in a pair of bright surfer trunks, Mr. Alic said that he had seen regular Yugoslav Army soldiers during the fighting. \"That's the army that attacked us,\" he said. **********Asked how he knew that they were Yugoslav soldiers rather than Bosnian Serbs, he said he could tell because of their accents, because they were wearing regular army uniforms, and because they were young and clean-shaven. **********Though this would not prove positively that they were Yugoslav Serbs, and not Bosnian Serbs, a United Nations military officer here said that the Bosnian Serb Army tended to be \"scruffy and older.\" **********United Nations officials said that other indications of participation by Yugoslavian Serbs in the taking of Srebrenica came from the Dutch peacekeepers. Before they were captured, the Dutch troops had reported that T-82 tanks, which belong to the Yugoslav Army, were used in the attack, United Nations officials said. **********As Mr. Alic spoke, his mother sat at his side. \"Even now, I don't believe he is alive,\" she said. **********But her joy was tempered because she does not know the fate of her husband and two other sons. She had last seen them at Potocari, which was the base for the Dutch peacekeepers, north of the town of Srebrenica, until it was overrun by the Serbs. **********When Srebrenica came under attack, thousands of residents of the town sought safety at the United Nations base, which proved futile after the Dutch were seized. At one point the Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, showed up, said Mrs. Alic, and several other refugees, interviewed separately. **********One woman, Sija Malkic, said that after General Mladic left, the males over age 15 were separated from the others and taken away. One group of about 50 was taken to a nearby house. \"They were as close as that tent over there,\" she said pointing to a tent 10 yards away. She said she heard cries from the men and the firing of automatic weapons. **********The 68-year-old Mrs. Malkic said that a 16-year-old boy was killed in front of his mother, who was then forced to drink his blood. It was an account impossible to confirm, but other refugees told similar stories. **********Interviewed separately, Mrs. Alic said that she had seen a woman all bloody, and that the woman had said, \"They forced me to drink his blood.\" **********From Potocari, the Serbs took the men, women and children to Bratunac, where the men were detained, before the women and children were taken in vehicles to Tuzla. **********The men who escaped into the mountains were sure they would die, some of the survivors said today. \"I signed myself off at the very beginning,\" said 20-year-old Mohammed Alic, no relation to Ramiz, who arrived here today with Mr. Hasamovic. **********Mr. Hasamovic said that while fleeing, the men had no idea in what direction they were headed but that late yesterday they had stumbled upon a Bosnian Government Army unit that was engaged in a firefight with the Serbs. **********\"God and luck brought us here,\" Mr. Hasamovic said.

Kudlow, the former Wall Street economist, went to Minneapolis yesterday to check into a long-term, residential drug treatment program at Hazelden Foundation, his wife, Judith, said. **********Mr. Kudlow, 47, agreed to undergo the six-month Hazelden program, where Kitty Dukakis, Eric Clapton and other well-known people have sought help, after three shorter treatments in the last two and half years for cocaine and alcohol habits, his wife said yesterday. **********Fifteen months ago, Mr. Kudlow made a highly public confession of his drug problem shortly after he was forced to resign as chief economist at Bear Stearns. He also made a fresh career start as a conservative political commentator for television and magazines and said he believed that he had overcome his addiction. **********But over the weekend, court papers filed by Mrs. Kudlow indicated that he may have lost his battle against cocaine. In a filing on Thursday, she petitioned the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan for a divorce and an order to prevent Mr. Kudlow from tapping their Bear Stearn's retirement account to pay for a weeks-long cocaine binge. \"The defendant will use such money to buy cocaine,\" she stated in an affidavit, \"and in so doing will likely suffer a fatal overdose and will dissipate the only remaining liquid marital assets.\" **********Mr. Kudlow could not be reached for comment yesterday. A Hazelden spokesman said the treatment center could not say whether or not a patient had checked in because of Federal regulations. **********Mr. Kudlow's apparent setback comes a time when he appeared to have turned his career around. After losing his $800,000-a-year Wall Street job, Mr. Kudlow landed quickly on his feet. His disclosure of cocaine problems in an interview with The New York Times prompted an outpouring of sympathy. He landed a consulting position at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. **********And Mr. Kudlow, who was President Ronald Reagan's budget director and considered one of the brighter lights in the New York Republican Party, regained his political footing. He became economics editor of the conservative magazine National Review and started dispensing political advice again, sharing a platform with Gov. Christine Whitman of New Jersey. Indeed, Mr. Kudlow had urged her to cut taxes sharply, an issue that helped sweep her into office. **********As recently as several weeks ago, Mr. Kudlow seemed to have regained his former professional stature. He shared a dais last month with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, when he addressed New York's financial elite. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Kudlow was appointed by Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing under President George Bush, to a commission to study how best to cut taxes. Always immaculately dressed and ready with a clever line, Mr. Kudlow seemed always to be racing between television studios and from speech to speech. **********There were occasional signs of stress: the client presentation at Montgomery Securities that he missed or missed deadlines at the National Review. In the end, the occasional slip turned into something far more frightening. **********\"He had slips but he was sober for big intervals,\" Mrs. Kudlow said in a telephone interview. \"He was doing everything. He was going to A.A. He was going to church. He was seeing his counselor. He was determined to overcome this, but it just overpowered him.\" **********According to Mrs. Kudlow, her husband initially resisted the idea of long-term treatment, which is expensive, disruptive and almost impossible to hide, even though two monthlong and one weeklong treatment program had not been enough. Instead, he turned more to drugs. **********In the end, she said she decided to act. Mrs. Kudlow, a former press secretary for the Department of Justice and now a painter, said she did not intend to end her marriage to Mr. Kudlow. The divorce action, she said, was a legal device to keep him from using the money to buy more cocaine. As it turned out, she added, it also helped convince Mr. Kudlow that he had to take drastic measures. **********\"It came down to saving his life,\" she said. \"I have no intention of divorcing him, but I had to take a hard line.\" **********What happens now? Mrs. Kudlow said she looks forward to life together with him but a very different one from the fast-paced, high profile existence the couple shared in Manhattan. She said in the affidavit that she planned to sell their apartments to pay for Mr. Kudlow's treatment and to begin a new life outside of New York City with her husband."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/world/bowing-to-imf-yeltsin-takes-new-steps-to-fight-spending-and-corruption.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1995-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 659, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bowing to I.M.F., Yeltsin Takes New Steps to Fight Spending and Corruption", "print_headline": "Bowing to I.M.F., Yeltsin Takes New Steps to Fight Spending and Corruption", "body_text": " **********In a concession to the International Monetary Fund, President Boris N. Yeltsin has signed a series of decrees intended to increase fiscal discipline and reduce widespread corruption, Russian officials said today. **********The monetary fund is in the last stage of negotiating a $6.2 billion standby loan that is contingent on Moscow's commitment to stabilize its economy and keep its budget deficit within agreed limits in an effort to cut inflation here. **********Because Russia's 1995 budget hinges on the loan, the fund and economic reformers within the Government have unusual leverage over policy. Even once the loan is granted the fund will insist on disbursing the money in installments -- the first of which could arrive in April -- and tying them to Moscow's performance, Western diplomats said. **********The decrees give Mr. Yeltsin unprecedented control over Government spending and tax exemptions, suggesting a new commitment to self-discipline by the President, who in the past has signed budget-busting decrees favoring special interests. **********Now much will depend on the degree of compliance with Mr. Yeltsin's decrees, on the ability of Government reformers to influence Mr. Yeltsin over time, and on Mr. Yeltsin's own ability to say no to powerful friends and lobbies. **********The decrees are intended to help Russia keep its budget deficit to less than 8 percent of its gross domestic product. The swelling of the deficit in 1994, when the Government broke its promises to restrain spending, produced inflation this January alone of 17.8 percent. **********Reduced spending in the last months of 1994 has led to an estimated inflation rate in February of 13 percent, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, the Government's senior reformer, said today. Inflation is expected to drop again in March and April, but to remain far above the 3 percent a month goal that the Government had promised to reach by the end of 1994. **********The decrees, as announced today by Mr. Chubais and Aleksandr Y. Livshits, a presidential adviser, affect all spending not mandated in the 1995 budget passed by Parliament. In effect, the decrees will allow Mr. Yeltsin and a credit commission that includes Mr. Chubais to oversee spending decisions made by other parts of the Government like the Security Council -- expenditures that often come as unpleasant surprises to the Finance Ministry. **********The decrees should also help undercut, though by no means eliminate, the rampant favoritism, corruption and heavy lobbying by interest groups that have distorted governance here. One decree restricts to Mr. Yeltsin's control widespread special tax and customs exemptions, which have been a major source of corruption. **********An earlier presidential decree, for instance, had exempted the National Sports Fund from paying customs duties, excise taxes and value-added tax on all goods that helped athletes participate internationally. The sports fund used that exemption to import alcohol and tobacco products, which normally face the highest duties, concluding deals that Izvestia reported were worth $3.3 billion. **********In another sign of new resolve, the decrees give Mr. Chubais and the Government two weeks to propose which existing presidential decrees and Government decisions on spending and tax exemptions ought to be canceled. **********The decrees also order the Government to further reduce the number of prices regulated by the state, a source of easy corruption. Mr. Chubais said the amount of gross domestic product subject to state prices should drop from the current 24 percent to about 16 percent. The idea is to regulate those prices set mostly by state monopolies, to prevent them from making unjustified price rises. **********Taken together, the decrees go some distance to reassuring the monetary fund that this time Russia will keep its spending promises. The fund has argued that no loan will be enough if Moscow does not get its economy in order and begin to pull in a bigger share of potential revenues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/business/scandal-besets-chinese-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1995-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Scandal Besets Chinese Markets", "print_headline": "Scandal Besets Chinese Markets", "body_text": " **********China's emerging securities markets are mired in their worst financial scandal since the Communists reopened a stock market here in 1990, weakening the markets at a time when the country badly needs them to raise capital. **********In a trading disaster that bears some eerie similarities to the collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C., China's biggest and most prestigious securities firm made a huge gamble in the bond market late last month and lost. It pushed the firm, Shanghai International Securities, to the brink of bankruptcy in a single day. **********But traders at Shanghai International apparently took its misadventure one step further and tried to manipulate the market by orchestrating a mass of sell orders 10 minutes before closing. That led the authorities to suspend all trading last week in bond futures, the only lively market in China in recent months, while they investigate Shanghai International's actions. **********The clampdown has drawn attention to how fragile the markets are here, surviving under a Government that is still uncomfortable with letting a market decide who makes money. It has also pointed to how weak supervision is, with several securities firms flagrantly violating trading limits, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange unable to do anything about it. **********And for Western companies, several of which have discussed joint-venture possibilities with Shanghai International, the whole affair is a sharp reminder of the uncertainty of doing business in China. **********As with Barings, Shanghai International bet on a large number of high-risk futures contracts, expecting prices in the bond-futures market to fall. When they rose sharply instead, the firm, with just $120 million in registered capital, was hit with losses that outsiders estimated at $80 million to $150 million. **********To make matters even more complicated, Shanghai International -- which likes to compare itself not with Barings but with Merrill Lynch -- is accusing another firm of profiting by using inside information to trade on large accounts. **********The bond market crisis has followed a familiar pattern in China's financial markets: a new avenue for raising capital is created, initial indifference gives way to active trading and eventually to a frenzy of speculation, and finally the authorities intervene with strong measures that stop excesses as well as any active trading. **********\"The central Government is afraid of crisis,\" said Yan Yunlong, deputy general manager at Guotai Securities, a competitor of Shanghai International. \"They'd rather see a far smaller trading volume than a crisis. We think stricter management is needed, but we're concerned that they may be overreacting.\" **********Mr. Yan and others expect the bond futures market to reopen within weeks, but with a tough new set of regulations, including a margin requirement of 10 percent instead of the current range of 1 to 2.5 percent. And that is likely to limit enthusiasm among the 250 institutions and the few thousand individuals with enough cash to trade bond futures. **********Many of those individuals are now upset. One of them is Zhang Yanfa, who goes to Guotai Securities each day to sit in a secluded room with half a dozen sofas and computer screens where he and 10 other \"da hu\" -- big customers -- monitor the markets while sipping tea, gossiping and giving buy or sell orders to a woman who sits by a phone. **********Mr. Zhang, a former banker, is angry that trading in his favorite holdings, bond futures that skyrocketed in value last month, has been halted. \"It's completely unfair,\" he said, his voice rising with indignation. \"They'll close the market to protect a big company, but they never think about us.\" **********His disgruntlement bodes ill for the Government's efforts to spread the market gospel among the masses to help finance the country's enormous economic growth. China relies heavily on Government bonds to finance its deficits and try to control inflation, which hit 24 percent in 1994. **********The bond market in Shanghai came alive only in October, when the Government started adding a premium to interest rates on bonds to make them attractive. The premium was linked to inflation, currently about 24 percent, and speculation over the size of the premium fueled futures trading. **********Daily volume surged from $1 billion a year ago to $6 billion in January. Then on Feb. 23, when a newspaper reported that a new premium would be higher than expected, trading exploded to $102 billion, more than four times the previous high. **********That is when Shanghai International made its ill-fated bet that prices would fall. Instead, they rose, sharply and relentlessly. But in the final minutes of trading, they suddenly dropped like a stone, when a blizzard of sell orders hit the market. Brokers, monitoring the trades electronically, could see that they came overwhelmingly from Shanghai International, apparently trying to obliterate its steep losses by driving the price down. **********The following morning, the stock exchange canceled the final eight minutes of trades, worth about $37 billion. Last Monday, it formally suspended futures trading, and on Tuesday it instructed anyone with a remaining contract to settle it privately or be forced to accept a lower price ordered by the exchange. **********David Wei, a senior executive at Shanghai International, conceded that \"some traders\" might have violated exchange rules by knowingly exceeding the number of futures contracts the firm was allowed to trade. He would not discuss the estimated losses or the number of traders involved. The Shanghai Stock Exchange refused to answer any questions. **********Mr. Wei described Shanghai International as a victim, and took the highly unusual step of accusing another firm of insider trading. Because of its close ties to a ministry in Beijing, Mr. Wei said, the firm apparently had early information on a plan to raise the premium on bonds. **********Zhong Ming, a senior executive at the accused firm, the China Economic Trust and Investment Development Corporation, responded: \"Some company violated trading regulations. Why are they accusing us of breaking the rules?\" **********An executive at another firm said that China Economic was the biggest winner in the bond futures frenzy, while Shanghai International was the biggest loser. Noting that every securities firm in China is onwed by some government, and essentially trading government money, the trader said that one firm was backed by the Ministry of Finance in Beijing, while the other was supported by the Shanghai municipal government. **********\"In the end, there are two organizations discussing how they are going to divide up government money,\" said the executive, Chang Yongtao. **********Huan Guocang, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Asia, said that one reason the Shanghai market was highly speculative was that the securities houses did not risk their own money. **********\"Whatever they make, they keep,\" Mr. Huan said. \"Whatever they lose, the Government takes care of.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/24/world/capitol-sketchbook-latest-taiwan-uproar-brings-back-old-hand.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1995-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Latest Taiwan Uproar Brings Back Old Hand", "print_headline": "CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK; Latest Taiwan Uproar Brings Back Old Hand", "body_text": " **********\"I thought she was dead,\" said the old Flying Tiger veteran, devoted five-decades-strong to Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, the intriguing, articulate dowager from the World War II era who is still hovering about the politics of China and America. **********\"But she is alive -- a great lady, a hell of a politician and a rousing speaker,\" exulted Myron D.

It was a staple of partisan American politics that lately, like Mrs. Chiang, has shown signs of revisiting the scene to intrigue a new generation of politicians. **********Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, recently endorsed the idea of recognizing Taiwan, but soon retreated as friends reminded him of the larger realpolitik importance of the People's Republic of China. **********Senator Bob Dole, majority leader and Republican candidate for President, has done no such controversial thing.

Large poster photos of the younger, world-traveling Mrs. Chiang -- known popularly then as Madame Chiang -- will embellish her return. **********\"We're trying to low-key the political side of this, so far with some success,\" said Senator Simon, who politely informed the White House of the invitation in May without asking for approval. \"She is the only major figure left from World War II, and this is a touch of history plus a gesture of friendship to the Chinese people.\" **********Senator Dole's office carefully echoed this, saying no large policy initiatives should be ferreted out of the ceremony, in which the two Senators and Mrs. Chiang will say a few words. **********Mrs. Chiang, the daughter of a Chinese stowaway to America, has a fine command of English that she does not hesitate to put to blunt and splendid effect before politicians. Long suspect in her devotion to democracy, she once summarized American politics as an affair of \"clodhopping boorishness and uncivilized geste.\" **********Smart, stylish and above all resolved, Mrs. Chiang used a Wellesley College education brilliantly to become a principal in the war, serving as her husband's adviser, confidante, ambassador and English translator. After his death in 1975, she fed the fervor of the Nationalist Party, which was defeated on the mainland but vowed to rise up one day from Taiwan. **********\"It was an up-and-down thing, and I'm not trying to rewrite history,\" said Senator Simon of Generalissimo Chiang's rule, marked by terror and corruption. \"I'm simply recognizing here was some woman who played a very prominent role in the victory of World War II.\" **********The Senator, the son of American missionaries who served in China, met the Chiangs in 1959 when he was a freelance journalist visiting Taiwan. **********\"Partially to their credit,\" he said, \"the country of Taiwan has moved in the direction that pleases us: multiparty system, a free press, freely held elections.\" He noted that he had long been a two-China man -- \"a position that has never been very acceptable to either China.\" **********Mrs. Chiang, who left Taiwan after her husband died and has been living on Long Island, is now frail and hard of hearing but reportedly still articulate and opinionated. **********\"I can ask the American people for nothing more,\" she declared bitterly 45 years ago when a second mission of appeal to the United States for help against the Communists ended in failure and she receded into history. \"It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.\" **********As Mrs. Chiang comes forth once more for Senator Simon's gentle curtain call, Mr. Levy and several other Flying Tigers will be at the reception to escort and toast her."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/25/business/oil-giants-register-big-first-quarter-profit-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1995-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Giants Register Big First-Quarter Profit Gains", "print_headline": "Oil Giants Register Big First-Quarter Profit Gains", "body_text": " **********The nation's largest oil companies, buoyed by rising oil prices and big upturns in their chemical businesses, surprised analysts and delighted Wall Street yesterday by reporting higher-than-expected profits. **********Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Amoco and ARCO all registered upturns in their first-quarter earnings. **********\"What this means is that analysts will be upgrading their forecasts for the year,\" said Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for NatWest Securities. \"It certainly paints an attractive picture.\" **********He said that the biggest surprise for the first quarter was the sharp jump in the foreign exploration and production end of the business, which benefited from a rise of more than $3 a barrel in crude oil prices in the quarter. **********But that was not the whole explanation, he said.

Perry, who was traveling in the region. **********Mr. Perry told reporters that the size of Iran's military deployment on three disputed islands at the mouth of the gulf was \"far beyond any reasonable defense requirements that Iran has.\" He said it \"can only be regarded, I believe, as a potential threat to shipping\" in the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway that handles 20 percent of the world's oil production. **********Senior military officials said last month that Iran had placed Hawk anti-aircraft missiles on one of the three islands, and that a buildup that began last fall also included SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, 155-millimeter artillery and 4,000 troops. But Administration officials said today that since then they had seen evidence of a substantial further troop increase and that intelligence analysts had concluded that the arsenal included chemical weapons. **********Iran has made no threats against shipping or its neighbors. The islands being fortified are Abu Musa and the Tumb islands, which the United Arab Emirates also claims, and one possible explanation for the buildup is that it is intended to dissuade any attack. **********But Administration officials say the buildup on the islands is out of proportion to any threat. They say they believe that Iran is intent on exerting greater influence and the the size of the deployment have added to the Pentagon's concerns. **********In issuing the strong warning today, Secretary Perry said that \"if Iran uses those weapons to interfere with shipping then it becomes not just a matter of the U.A.E. but it becomes a regional and indeed a world problem.\" **********Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said later that the Administration did not have any evidence that the Iranian deployment was anything but defensive. But Mr. McCurry said at his daily briefing that there was \"a high degree of concern\" within the Administration about Iran's intentions. **********A senior Administration official said Mr. Perry's decision to call renewed attention to the Iranian buildup was driven in part by his gulf agenda. The Defense Secretary is trying to persuade the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors to devote more money to military spending and to allow the United States to preposition more equipment. **********Teheran is also in the midst of a campaign to acquire not only conventional military equipment, like three Russian-made diesel submarines, but also long-range missiles and nuclear reactors, a quest worrying the American Administration. **********When they first noticed the Iranian buildup on the three Persian Gulf islands last October, Administration officials concluded that it was probably a response to the American deployment of thousands of troops in Kuwait to check an Iraqi advance. **********But the fact that it has continued has caused American analysts to question that judgment. Together with Chinese-made Seersucker antiship missiles and two other Iranian islands, they say it has given Iran the ability to cut off oil shipping in the strategic waterway. **********A senior Administration official said the chemical weapons had been moved to the island of Abu Musa, but the official would not say if they were artillery shells or whatever."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/world/opening-vietnam-overview-us-grants-vietnam-full-ties-time-for-healing-clinton.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Mitchell", "pub_date": "1995-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS", "print_headline": "OPENING TO VIETNAM: THE OVERVIEW; U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS", "body_text": " **********Saying the time was at hand to \"bind up our own wounds,\" President Clinton today extended full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam 22 years after the American withdrawal from a bitterly divisive war that still scars the national psyche. **********Mr. Clinton, the one-time student protester who avoided serving in a war he once said he \"opposed and despised,\" announced the normalization of relations in a brief ceremony in the East Room attended by military figures, the families of those still missing in action and members of Congress who were veterans of the war and prisoners of the Vietnamese. **********\"This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds,\" the President said, evoking words used by Lincoln at the end of the Civil War. \"They have resisted time for too long. We can now move onto common ground.\" **********\"Let this moment,\" he said, \"in the words of the Scripture, be a time to heal and a time to build.\"  [ Excerpts, page A9. ] **********But the decision drew criticism as well as support from legislators, veterans' groups and families of missing servicemen. **********Mr. Clinton said the United States would continue to press Vietnam for a full accounting for the 2,202 United States service personnel officially listed as missing in Southeast Asia. He said that in the months since he lifted the United States trade embargo on Vietnam in February 1994, the remains of 29 more missing Americans had been identified and Hanoi had turned over hundreds of pages of documents. **********\"We will keep working until we get all the answers we can,\" Mr. Clinton said. \"Our strategy is working.\" **********Vietnam's Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet, responded positively to Mr. Clinton's decision in a statement broadcast Wednesday morning, Hanoi time. He pledged to continue Vietnam's cooperation in helping to account for missing Americans. **********Mr. Clinton's announcement of full diplomatic relations completed a process begun by the Bush Administration in 1991 when Washington and Hanoi agreed on a detailed series of steps that would lead to recognition. Recognition was sought as eagerly by American business groups as it was bitterly opposed by the American Legion and some relatives of Americans missing in the war. **********But the move was particularly risky for a President whose efforts as a young man to avoid military service in Vietnam became a campaign issue in 1992, and who faces an electorate still sharply divided over the unpopular war that took 58,000 American lives. **********The often loquacious Mr. Clinton spoke somberly for just under 10 minutes, ending with \"God bless America.\" Several Congressional veterans of the war stood by his side as he made his announcement; Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who spent more than five years as a Vietnamese prisoner of war, was closest. Afterward, Mr. McCain praised Mr. Clinton for an \"act that required some courage.\" **********Yet 20 years after the last helicopter rising from the roof of the United States Embassy in Saigon became an indelible image of American defeat, Congress was as bitterly divided over Mr. Clinton's move as it once was over the war itself. **********Senator Bob Dole, a veteran of World War II whose right arm remains withered from his wounds, denounced Mr. Clinton's decision from the Senate floor, saying the President had not addressed the \"central question\" of whether Vietnam is continuing to withhold information and remains that could be easily provided. **********\"The President ignored this question in announcing his decision for the very good reason that all signs point to Vietnam willfully withholding information which could resolve the fate of many Americans lost in the war,\" said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader and the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination. **********Mr. Dole said the lawmakers would monitor the progress of relations with Vietnam, and he warned that Congress must approve funds for any diplomatic operations in Vietnam and that the Senate must confirm any ambassador. **********Senator Trent Lott, the majority whip from Mississippi, said he would support efforts to amend appropriations legislation to stop the opening of a United States Embassy in Vietnam. \"What's the reason for doing this?\" he asked. \"How do you justify recognizing Vietnam and not recognizing Taiwan?\" **********But Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who attended the White House ceremony, vowed to fight efforts to block embassy funding. \"It's a total mistake,\" he said. \"It's wallowing in the past.\" Mr. Kerrey, who lost part of one leg and won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, added that if Mr. Dole or others tried to make political gain by blocking embassy funding, they would \"face people like me who say, 'Shame on you.\"' **********Veterans were also divided. John Sommer, the executive director of the more than 3 million member American Legion -- the nation's largest veterans group -- condemned the move, saying that normalization of relations left the Administration with little leverage to extract more information about the missing. But a group calling itself the Vietnam Veterans for Reconciliation handed out leaflets supporting the President on the White House lawn after the ceremony. **********Mr. Clinton's decision to recognize Vietnam had been endorsed by all of his senior advisers, according to Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. Mr. Lake said Gen. John Shalikashvili had polled the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the weekend and had found unanimous support. **********Aides said the President's decision stemmed, in part, from a desire to act now, before the 1996 campaign moves into full gear. It was also partly dictated by Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher's trip to Asia at the end of this month to meet with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian nations. **********The President announced that Mr. Christopher will now visit Vietnam early next month, which will make him the first Secretary of State to visit the country since the American-backed Government in Saigon fell to Communist forces in 1975. **********While in Hanoi, Mr. Christopher will negotiate the details of the restoration of diplomatic relations. **********Resumed ties to Vietnam could give the Administration an important Asian ally at a time when relations with China have become more tense, although officials denied today that the policy change was in any way related to China. **********In Beijing, a Chinese Government spokesman welcomed the news. \"The Chinese Government has always stood for improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam,\" said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Shen Guofang. **********In his broadcast statement, Mr. Kiet said Vietnam would negotiate with the United States \"to set up a new framework for the relationship between the two countries on the basis of respect, independence, and mutual benefit of the two countries in harmony with the rule of international law.\" **********The Administration was silent today on who would become the ambassador to Vietnam, an appointment that could be fraught with symbolism. Officials said the Administration wanted a distinguished appointee, perhaps a veteran, who would face no trouble in a confirmation hearing. Among names under discussion are Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff; Frank G. Wisner, the Ambassador to India, or Mr. Lake himself. All three made their names in Vietnam. **********Administration officials said they had now set up interagency groups to examine such questions as trade, investment and tax treaties, all of which are of interest to American companies that were allowed to begin doing business in Vietnam in February 1994, when the President lifted the trade embargo. **********By some estimates, Vietnam will spend $7 billion during the next seven years on roads, ports and a modern telecommunications system. **********Willard A. Workman, vice president of the international division of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said businesses hoped that the announcement would clear the way for crucial United States agencies, including the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to help American companies in Vietnam. **********Businesses are also eager for Vietnam to receive most favored nation trade status, which would drastically reduce tariffs between the two nations. Such status must be negotiated and approved by Congress. In addition, in order to normalize trade with Vietnam fully President Clinton must issue a finding that Vietnam allows free and open emigration or issue a waiver of that requirement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/world/christopher-confers-with-saudi-king-on-aid-and-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1995-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Christopher Confers With Saudi King On Aid and Arms", "print_headline": "Christopher Confers With Saudi King On Aid and Arms", "body_text": " **********King Fahd was polite but noncommittal tonight when Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked the Saudi ruler to support a proposed development bank for the Middle East, earmark some of his country's aid to the Palestinians for their day-to-day operations and support the indefinite extension of the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. **********The King did not say yes and he did not say no. **********\"It may just be the King's style,\" a senior State Department official told reporters. \"I wouldn't read too much into it.\" **********Aides to Mr. Christopher also tried not to read too much into the fact that the King kept his guest waiting for more than six hours before receiving him shortly before 10 P.M.

Others are taking deposits but restricting withdrawals. And nearly all Argentine banks are restricting or eliminating borrower credit. **********The crisis threatens to undo what President Carlos Saul Menem has called \"the Argentine miracle,\" which has brought economic stability to the country's 33.5 million people after years of the special uncertainty that hyperinflation brings. **********Since taking office in 1989, Mr. Menem and his economic team have instituted changes, including selling state-run businesses and linking the Argentine peso to the dollar, that have opened the economy to foreign investment and international competition. The results have been striking: inflation has declined to less than 4 percent annually from more than 5,000 percent in 1989, and economic growth of roughly 7 percent a year for the last four years has been one of the highest in the world. **********The banking crisis developed when foreign investors and local depositors, fearing that Argentina would follow Mexico and devalue its currency, began pulling their money out of banks and stashing it in Uruguay, long considered a haven for Argentine money because of the country's banking-secrecy laws, and safe-deposit boxes at home or under the mattress. Many Argentines, remembering too well that the Government had frozen bank accounts in an earlier crisis, grabbed their money, worried that the Government might not hesitate to do it again. **********As deposits shrank lending was curtailed, leaving big companies without the money needed for production or expansion. Now, many of these companies are asking customers to pay more quickly and they are delaying payments to their suppliers while trying to raise cash. **********Some small and medium-sized businesses have told employees times are so hard that they cannot afford to pay wages now because the available funds are being used to keep the company afloat. **********\"A lot of small firms will not be able to survive this crisis,\" said Juan Luis Bour, chief economist at the Latin American Economic Research Foundation here. \"What we are starting to see are the long-term effects of the Mexico crisis in Argentina. It's not over yet.\" **********Economic and financial experts predict that unemployment, now at a record 12.2 percent, will increase this year as more small businesses go bankrupt, and that tax revenue, already declining, will drop further. These experts also said there would be an overall reduction in wages, as workers accepted lower salaries rather than no jobs at all. **********The Government maintains that the crisis will resolve itself in a few weeks, largely because of a deposit-insurance program that went into effect last week. **********There is also hope that the recent rebound of Argentine stocks, which had dropped nearly 40 percent after the Mexican devaluation on Dec. 20, bodes well for an eventual return of investors to the banking sector. **********The benchmark Merval stock index here is down almost 15 percent so far this year, though it recouped 2.5 percentage points in April. Brokers and officials of the stock exchange said bargain hunters and a return of some local and foreign investors had helped lately. **********With national elections scheduled May 14, when President Menem is expected to win a second term, \"there seems to be a mixture of local and foreign money that is pushing the rally,\" said Matthew Doman, an analyst for Interaction Global Inc., a Buenos Aires investment bank. \"There is a bit of confidence that Menem will win the election and that fallout from Mexico has been left behind. But there are still a lot of problems in the banking system and a lot of fear that will continue to have a negative impact on the economy and the financial markets.\" **********Before the Mexican crisis foreign investors held about one-third of Argentine stocks, market officials said. \"We know through conversations with brokers and agents that we are starting to receive more foreign orders,\" said Francisco Susmel, vice chairman of the Argentine stock market, \"and in absolute terms the number of foreign investors investing in capital instruments has not changed since the Mexican crisis. Very few investors did away with all their Argentine holdings.\" **********Yet Argentine bankers, though they have gone to great lengths to convince Wall Street money managers that their country will not follow Mexico into a severe recession, are not making commercial and personal loans. There is uncertainty, even a measure of panic, in this country. **********Many large businesses that used to extend credit to customers by allowing them to pay their bills within 90 days now require payment in 30 days. Other large companies have notified their small suppliers that they will need credit extensions because they cannot pay them on time. **********Some big businesses have taken extraordinary steps like demanding cash on delivery and refusing to accept checks written on accounts at banks rumored to be weak. **********Executives at 3M S.A., the Argentine subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, said the credit crisis had forced them to crack down on its 3,000 customers, many of whom are in financial distress and have not been paying their bills on time. **********Guillermo D'Andrea, a professor at the Institute of Higher Business Studies and a consultant to industry, said: \"The entire business cycle is feeling the heat of this liquidity crisis, which effects everyone from the corporation president to the assembly worker. Companies are afraid of giving credit to their buyers because you just don't know who's going to be around a month from now.\" **********Economists and financial analysts say that as a consequence of the liquidity crisis, Argentina is headed for a recession and will record no economic growth this year. Indeed, more than 30,000 Argentine businesses closed in the first three months of the year, and commercial sales dropped 35 percent, according to an industry group representing mercantile companies. **********Intersoft S.A., a Buenos Aires-based computer-software maker, grew so rapidly in 1994 -- 80 percent -- that its bank had said it would triple the company's credit line to allow it to buy equipment and open a new office floor. But with the Mexican crisis, the bank told Intersoft that its credit line would in fact be reduced. **********That forced Intersoft to delay its expansion plans and to press its customers to settle accounts, many of which were six months' overdue. **********\"Do you think they paid us? No, they haven't, and in this business you can't just cut off customers who you have a relationship with. Too much time and effort has been invested,\" said Emilio Lopez Cabeitas, an Intersoft vice president. **********Mr. Lopez said that to make ends meet, Intersoft has laid off 7 of its 200 employees and sharply cut costs. He added that the company expected a drop in its domestic revenue in the first half of the year, but that it hoped its growing foreign operations would make up for some of that. **********Economists and bankers said the Government had acted quickly and responsibly to shore up the banking system and avert a bank run, which many economists think would force Argentina to abandon its convertibility plan. Under that, every peso in circulation is backed by a United States dollar on deposit in the nation's central bank. **********The week before last, the Government announced a system of deposit guarantees aimed at rebuilding confidence in Argentina's financial system. Argentine banks will be levied a charge ranging from 0.03 percent to 0.06 percent of their deposits to set up a $2 billion fund that would cover deposits up to $10,000, or $20,000 for those held longer than 90 days. Under a separate trustee fund, the central bank will transfer the assets of troubled institutions, including accounts and deposits, to healthier banks. **********The Argentine central bank recently suspended five banks, giving them 30 days to regain liquidity or face closing. But Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said there were no more banks facing suspension. Although some banks are having problems repaying investors, Mr. Cavallo said he thought that they would be able to solve their problems with the help of the new guarantee funds. **********Economists and Argentine finance officials said the credit crisis had uncovered the inefficiencies in the Argentine banking system, which they said was surely headed for a major consolidation in which the larger, old-line institutions gobbled up smaller, weaker newcomers. Among big banks expected to benefit in the consolidation are Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires, Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata, Banco Rio de la Plata and Banco del Sud. **********\"Some banks have been severely weakened by this crisis and will not survive alone: they will have to merge or disappear,\" said Manuel Sacerdote, president of the Bank of Boston subsidiary here. \"What we are waiting for is a wide-scale return of depositors to the system, and I am confident that will happen.\" **********Many Argentine banking executives and financial analysts are optimistic that the Government's latest moves will entice investors and depositors back into the financial system, but they do not expect to see large amounts of capital coming in until after the elections."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bank-picks-agency-as-does-blockbuster.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Picks Agency, As Does Blockbuster", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Bank Picks Agency, As Does Blockbuster", "body_text": " **********Two marketers have changed agencies on their accounts. **********Blockbuster Entertainment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a unit of Viacom Inc., named Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago to handle the account of its Blockbuster Music retail chain, which had been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in St. Louis for the last two years as part of the overall Blockbuster account.

The new heart of Lockheed's operations beats most strongly today here in Georgia, where the company makes its military planes with lower-cost labor. **********The nation's manufacturers of military hardware, an industry that still employs nearly 1.5 million people, are migrating. Like Lockheed, they are transferring operations to Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi and other low-cost states. In doing so, they are joining the rest of corporate America in its itinerant search for cheaper wages, fewer unions, less regulation and easier tax policies. And gradually the South and the Rocky Mountains are becoming the new centers for military spending, edging aside the Northeast and the Pacific Coast. **********\"As we consolidate and become more efficient, we do think of things we never would have thought of in the past, like states where we can be more competitive,\" said Daniel M.

But the shares going to the Southeast and the Rocky Mountain regions have doubled compared with 1976, while the Northeast and the Pacific Coast regions have lost 15 percent or more. **********\"To be a bigger share of a shrinking pie is not the best position to be in, but it is better than being a shrinking share of a shrinking pie,\" said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta. \"Because of the shifting, the defense cutback has not been a blow to the economies of the South.\" **********That cannot be said of Long Island, where the Grumman Corporation, now Northrop Grumman, was once the biggest employer.

Hughes Electronics, for example, recently transferred missile operations from Southern California to Arizona and Colorado, shifting hundreds of jobs in the process. **********In Massachusetts, the Raytheon Company, still the state's largest employer, is threatening to transfer missile work to Tennessee -- if the state does not grant the sort of concessions that Tennessee offers. **********\"We may end up being forced to go elsewhere, if we can't get $600 million out of our cost base in Massachusetts,\" said Elizabeth Allen, Raytheon's chief spokeswoman, happy to use the news media to pressure for concessions. **********All this represents a striking turnabout. Until the late 1980's, military contractors stayed pretty much in place, serving as a bulwark in high-cost regions that lost other manufacturers. The Pentagon's generous contracts shielded them from the intense competition that drove so many other industries to cost-cutting and migration. But with the cold war's end, the Defense Department urged the contractors to slash costs so that it could buy as much as possible with a shrinking budget. **********\"Ten years ago, there was a lot of money spread around in defense and you did not have to look for ways to cut costs,\" said Al Hansen, a Lockheed vice president. \"Now we meet weekly to do this.\" **********The corporate response is making the Federal Government an increasingly visible participant in a movement that contributes to wage stagnation in the United States. \"The cold war is over and the Pentagon should get the most bang for its declining budget,\" said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"But on the other hand, the President keeps pushing for higher wages, and this strategy works against that.\" **********There are other consequences. The movement exacerbates the already intense bidding war among the states to attract companies and jobs by offering tax concessions and outright gifts. It is a competition that some economists label a giveaway of public goods: schools, roads, municipal airports, public transportation and the like. The huge Lockheed plant here is soon to receive such a gift from the Cobb County government. The county will pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass so that traffic will not be held up when trains cross the factory's property on a line now at ground level. **********Pentagon officials, however, say this largess serves the needs of national defense. They say they must find ways to buy enough weaponry despite their shrinking budget, and if competition among the states helps, so be it. The Pentagon, in fact, has given Lockheed, Hughes and other contractors tens of millions of dollars to help cover the costs of moving and consolidating. **********\"It makes economic sense to consider sharing the short-term costs to realize the long-term savings,\" Joshua Gotbaum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, said at a recent Congressional hearing. **********Nothing illustrates the post-cold-war migration and its impact more clearly than the decision by Lockheed to shift its principal aeronautic operations from Burbank to Marietta. This Atlanta suburb has boomed in recent years with the construction of federally financed interstate highways -- five and six lanes in either direction -- that tie Cobb County to Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. Lining the interstates are mile after mile of shopping centers, gallerias, hotels, office buildings and one-story factories. Although Sherman fought here en route to Atlanta, the landscape has been so transformed that Cobb County seems to lack almost any history before the 1970's. **********\"We have roads going everywhere,\" said Timothy Mescon, dean of the new business school at Kennesaw State College, itself a young and rapidly growing university just off Interstate 75. **********The Lockheed plant, a square half-mile of floor space next to Dobbins Air Force Base, dates from the dark ages before interstates. That is typical of the major military contractors, who are not building new plants as much as they are consolidating into what were once satellite operations. Lockheed Martin still has a big presence in California, including a top-secret advance design operation in Palmdale. But the center of its aeronautical operations has shifted to the South and the Mid-Atlantic. **********The plant here, which Lockheed acquired in 1955, first to make C-130 propeller-driven transports for the Air Force and then giant C-5 jet transports, took on new life in the 1990's with the arrival of the P-3, a propeller plane designed to hunt submarines. It had been built in Burbank for years. Not long after, Lockheed transferred a host of administrators to Georgia and then its research teams, bringing a thousand engineering jobs here. \"We de-staffed California in engineering, and staffed Georgia,\" said Mr. Hansen, the Lockheed vice president. **********The engineers, many of them newly hired Georgians earning on average 10 percent less than the California scale, are now developing Lockheed Martin's next weapon, the F-22, a 21st-century supersonic stealth fighter for the Air Force. If the Pentagon gives the go-ahead, the planes are to be assembled here, rather than Burbank, where the prototypes were made. In anticipation, bright yellow tape sets off an acre of empty floor space reserved for the F-22. **********Just having the F-22 in Georgia might persuade Congress and the Pentagon to pay for it. \"Southerners have traditionally been more pro-defense than people in other parts of the country,\" said William B. Bullock, a Lockheed vice president. **********Fitting this mold, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represents Cobb County in Congress, campaigns for the Pentagon to buy Lockheed's planes: the F-22, more P-3's, C-5's and the C-130J, an updated version of the C-130. **********Aides to Mr. Gingrich consult regularly with Lockheed officials, according to Allan Lipsett, the Speaker's Georgia press secretary. \"I think Mr. Gingrich considers it a good idea for defense contractors to come to the South,\" he said. **********Lockheed's payroll here has remained at 11,000 since 1989, or 3,000 more than would have been the case without the exodus from California, Mr. Bullock estimates. Still, Martha Mossman, who works on the C-130 line, is nervous. In 15 years at the plant, neither she nor her husband, Donald, has ever been laid off from Lockheed. But he recently received a \"warning\" that this could happen to him in June, costing him a union job that pays $18 an hour, far more than he could earn elsewhere in Georgia. **********Without new funds, work is winding down. Only four partly assembled P-3's remain on the line, their unpainted fuselages covered in steel scaffolding, and the C-130 line is also slowing. \"We have been doing a lot of traveling,\" said Mrs. Mossman, ticking off recent tourist excursions to Hawaii and Mexico. \"But this year we aren't going anywhere.\" **********Lockheed is Cobb County's largest employer, representing nearly 6 percent of the work force. With so many new companies arriving here, Lockheed's impact on the economy is gradually declining. Still, any cutback would hurt if only because for every Lockheed job, three more exist at subcontractors and suppliers within 100 miles of the plant, Mr. Bullock estimates. **********That, too, whittles away at labor costs. The Aidcorp, for example, a machine shop in rural Clayton, Ga., less than two hours away on the new highways, has doubled its employment since 1990 -- to 35 workers -- on the strength of the parts Georgia's military contractors farm out, particularly Lockheed. Its best-paid workers earn only $13 an hour, with nothing for sick days. **********For all the growing concentration of military work here, however, the question remains: Will it stay? After all, Lockheed Martin also makes F-16 fighters in Fort Worth, having recently acquired that similarly huge and underused plant from General Dynamics. **********\"If we don't get orders for the C-130J and the other planes we make here, then we would move to Fort Worth in a wink,\" Mr. Bullock said. \"And if the opposite happens, we could close Fort Worth and move the F-16 here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/10/world/world-news-briefs-conservatives-defeat-socialists-in-ontario.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; Conservatives Defeat Socialists in Ontario", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; Conservatives Defeat Socialists in Ontario", "body_text": " **********The Progressive Conservative Party, promising tax and spending cuts and radical changes in social policy, have swept out the socialist New Democrats to take control of the provincial government in Ontario. **********The comfortable majority for the Progressive Conservative leader, Mike Harris, in the election on Thursday wrenches Canada's richest and most populous province sharply to the right. **********By capturing 82 of the 130 seats in the Ontario assembly and 45 percent of the popular vote, the Progressive Conservatives have also given new hope to the national Conservative party after its collapse in federal elections in October 1993. **********\"We'd have to be blind not to say that we're very much ahead because of this,\" said Jean Charest, the national leader, who holds one of just two Tory seats in the Commons. **********Premier Jean Chretien had been counting on a victory for his fellow Liberal, Lyn McLeod, to solidify support for his expected re-election bid in two to three years. **********The change in political winds was a reaction to budget deficits and a very rapid rise in taxes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/15/business/takeover-bids-made-for-two-big-utilities.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1995-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Takeover Bids Made for Two Big Utilities", "print_headline": "Takeover Bids Made for Two Big Utilities", "body_text": " **********Two big power-company takeovers -- one hostile, one friendly -- were proposed yesterday, providing an early sign that the coming free market for electric power will lead to a major consolidation among utilities amid a struggle to cut costs. **********In an attempt to unite the two companies that serve eastern Pennsylvania, Peco Energy Company, the parent of the Philadelphia Electric Company, made a hostile offer of $3.8 billion, or $24 a share in stock, for PP&L Resources Inc., the parent of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, which serves a number of cities outside the Philadelphia area. **********At the same time, the Union Electric Company of St. Louis and Cipsco Inc., a power company in central Illinois, agreed to merge in a stock deal valued at $1.2 billion. The companies said they expected to generate cost savings of $570 million over the next 10 years by eliminating duplicate jobs and combining other overlapping operations. **********After decades of operating as government-regulated monopolies with total control over their designated service areas, electric utilities are being driven to become larger and more flexible as big industrial customers have developed the ability to generate their own power at lower cost or to go outside their local areas to buy electricity from cheaper suppliers. In response, the Federal Government and several states have moved to deregulate the industry. **********\"Each of these mergers is different, but the general theme is that utilities have to cut costs to become more competitive,\" said Barry M. Abramson of Prudential Securities Research. \"Most of these companies have done a lot of cost-cutting and are as lean as they are likely to be, so a merger gives them the opportunity to cut costs again.\" **********One of the big issues that has emerged from the various deregulation proposals is whether the benefits of a freer market in electric power will flow mostly to big industrial users at the expense of small business and residential users, who may be asked to shoulder additional costs for maintaining the vast distribution networks needed to deliver electricity. **********State regulators, who must also deal with the question of who pays for investments in existing power plants that may no longer be competitive, are being forced into a difficult balancing act. **********\"Regulators will try hard to see that small customers will suffer no increase in costs,\" Mr. Abramson said, \"although most of the savings will be passed on to large customers.\" He noted that transmission systems would remain local monopolies subject to regulation, even as competition spreads in the business of generating electricity. **********Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a proposal that would force electric utilities to open their transmission systems to power generated by competitors. That will allow big industrial customers to negotiate for lower rates by threatening or actually importing power from lower-cost generators in other areas. **********The proposal would also give low-cost independent power companies access to the distribution grids owned by integrated utilities and allow them to compete with those utilities for desirable big customers. **********Given the new rules of the road, utilities are being forced to seek combinations with neighboring systems to gain strength with their big customers and achieve economies of scale, said Robert Guberman, a vice president of A. T. Kearney, a consultancy. \"The industry is not burying its head in the sand,\" he said. \"This is the beginning of a flurry of actions -- some agreeable, some not agreeable.\" **********The two utility proposals yesterday followed on the heels of a planned merger between the Northern States Power Company and Wisconsin Energy Corporation, two big Midwestern utilities. On May 1, they announced the intention to merge into a company to be called the Primergy Corporation, based in Minneapolis. The companies provide power to 1.3 million customers in the upper Midwest and gas to 350,000 customers. All the pending deals are subject to approval by shareholders and state regulators. **********In making its hostile bid for PP&L yesterday, officials of Peco said they were doing so because months of discussions had not produced an agreement. **********Joseph Paquette Jr., the chairman of Peco, in a letter to his counterpart at PP&L, said the stalemate \"makes clear the need to present a specific proposal now so you and your board can fully evaluate the potential benefits a combination provides to PP&L Resources and shareholders and customers.\" **********Mr. Paquette said the companies had adjacent service areas and would be a \"natural fit.\" He predicted that the combined companies would be able to lower rates for electricity and save $2 billion over 10 years, with the benefits divided between shareholders and customers. **********PP&L, which had been informally discussing a merger with Peco since November, expressed reservations, although it promised to \"fully evaluate\" the offer. **********In a letter to Mr. Paquette, William F. Hecht, PP&L's chairman, said his company was concerned about Peco's \"high cost structure\" and whether the combined company could recover Peco's \"considerable past investment costs.\" Moody's Investors Service recently estimated those costs above $4.86 billion, Mr. Hecht said, adding that Peco's rates were 55 percent higher than PP&L's. **********In an interview, Mr. Paquette noted that the $24-a-share offer was 27 percent above PP&L's previous price and said the combination was \"too good to ignore and too good to delay.\" **********The price of PP&L's shares rose yesterday in response to the offer, closing at $21.50, up $2.625. Peco's shares declined $1, to $26.75. **********If the merger is completed, the combined company would be one of the largest utilities in the nation, covering most of eastern Pennsylvania. Peco provides electricity to the city of Philadelphia and its suburbs, and supplies natural gas to the suburbs. PP&L provides both services as far west as Williamsport. The deal includes nuclear power plants, but not the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, which is owned by General Public Utilities. **********Union Electric and Cipsco have adjacent service areas on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the Mississippi River. \"We have contiguous territories and are similar in the way we treat costs, so we will have a seamless transition,\" said Clifford L. Greenwalt, Cipsco's chief executive. **********Part of the savings generated by a merger would be returned to customers under legislation adopted in Missouri and pending in Illinois, executives for the companies said in telephone interviews. Some of those savings will come from the elimination of 300 jobs through attrition rather than layoffs. **********Under the terms of the merger, neither company would retain its current form. Instead, a new holding company would be formed, with shareholders of Union Electric getting one new share for each one held and Cipsco shareholders receiving 1.03 shares.

XL to the Rescue  Don't look now, but there's a vast, confused group taking shape across the land -- \"dual-cola users\" is what Pepsi calls them, with that poetic solemnity special to marketing. And those fickle souls just won't stick with either regular or diet cola, so -- yes -- they switch back and forth. Now this is heavy stuff. Sodas are a $50 billion business, and $30 billion of that's in colas; the cola wars are BIG. Just last week, to try to nab those D.C.U.'s (as marketers no doubt call them), Pepsi introduced a low-sugar concoction called Pepsi XL in a few Florida cities. The company had some convoluted explanation for that \"XL\" -- it mixes sugar with artificial sweetener -- but what it surely comes down to is that Pepsi wanted it to sound like a car. Slurp. Vrrooom. Help. EXECUTIVE SUITE  At Sony, Software Is In  In consumer electronics, there's \"hardware\" and \"software\" -- the machines and the stuff they play, like movies or CDs. For half a century, Sony has been the master innovator of hardware -- just look at the Walkman and its billions of descendants. In software it's been a rougher ride -- look at its billions in Hollywood losses. But it's a new era at Sony -- its visionary co-founder Akio Morita just stepped down as chairman, Norio Ohga moved up to that job from president, and all eyes were on his successor. And the choice, last week, was a shock: Nobuyuki Idei, who leapfrogged over at least 10 higher-ranking executives. But the appointment sent a crystal-clear message: with Mr. Idei, a movie buff with the \"software spirit,\" running things, software is definitely in.  THE PRESIDENT  And Think of His Aching Wrist  In the spirit of the latest times, here's a stock tip: invest in companies that make pens. In the House version of the line-item veto, the President could strike offending budget items. But in the Senate version, passed last week, he would accept or reject each budget morsel separately -- by one estimate, perhaps 10,000 separate bills. That's a lot of Presidential autographs -- and a lot of pens. But why do (Republican) legislators want to give the (Democratic) White House such power? Maybe they figure it's the only way they can get out the pork (which they, of course, put in). Or maybe it's because they have this idea that Bill Clinton will be back in Arkansas come 1997. Another point: Is a line-item veto even constitutional? Probably not, said Pat Moynihan.  POLITICS Snippets of Discontent  Yes, old-style liberalism may be dying, gunned down by Republican assault rifles, but it's not going quietly. All last week, protests rippled across the land against Federal and local budget-slashing. In the House welfare debate, several lawmakers, including Sam Gibbons, showed a commitment to children by wearing ties or scarves designed for Save the Children. And hundreds of children, with the message \"Pick on someone your own size,\" rallied on the Capitol steps to protest school lunch cuts. Later, more students converged on the Capitol -- one, in a towel, bearing a sign reading \"We Are Being Stripped\" -- to protest cuts in school aid. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson led a march to Albany to battle Governor Pataki's proposed cuts to Medicaid, education and programs for the homeless. And New York City's hospitals chief quit abruptly, saying he couldn't back deep Medicaid cuts.  CYBERSPACE  alt.ban.internet.sex.but.how  There they are on the Internet listings, news groups like \"alt.sex.beastiality\" and \"alt.sex.masterbation.\" Such spelling, apparently, causes no outrage, but the content does. Everything from Playboy photos to the crudest of language is available at a click, no matter how young the wielder of the mouse, and many people want it stopped. But how? Cyberspace is the Wild West of the 90's, untamed and, for now, untamable. Stuff can come as easily from across the street as from across the globe. Trying to control it would be like spitting digits into the wind. But the Senate Commerce Committee is trying anyway. Last week it approved a ban on cyberporn, vowing $100,000 fines and two-year prison terms. Senator Jim Exon, who wrote the bill, admitted that it was probably futile, but he said he had to try.  THE MARKETS  A Slowdown, and Stocks Soar  The stock market loved Friday's economic news -- an 0.8 percent drop in orders for durable goods (stuff that's supposed to last longer than bananas or most electronic gadgets). By the market's current upside-down thinking, any slowing means less chance that the Fed will raise interest rates this week. And such a strong negative number was especially positive, as the Dow jumped 50, to 4,138.

They are hungry, they call out, and they are angry because the Government is forcing them to pay for getting the nation's economy back on track. **********The difference between what is said in the palace and what is shouted on the plaza underscores an inescapable conclusion about Mexico almost seven months after the peso was disastrously devalued: the economy here now has two faces. One is reflected in steadily improving macroeconomic indicators; the other reveals the deepening misery of Mexico's 91 million people. **********The extent to which Mexico can draw those two economies together in the coming months will determine not only how well it recovers from this latest crisis, but also whether it will be able to overcome some of the fundamental problems that have for so long created appalling gaps between the rich and poor in Mexico. **********Should it fail to draw the economies closer, many fear a period of deepening political and social unrest in a country that has already been shaken for more than a year by a peasant uprising and a string of assassinations. **********The outcome is of critical importance to the United States, which is still waiting for the promised benefits from the North American Free Trade Agreement and is fearful of a new wave of illegal immigration if conditions worsen. **********And while the Mexican Government trumpets the latest positive numbers, it is far from declaring victory. **********\"We are very careful not to claim that because we have made progress in returning to the market that the crisis is over,\" said Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz. \"We will say the crisis is over when we get some real growth going and employment increasing.\" **********Still, the palace version of the economy is positive indeed. With surprising speed, the Mexican stock exchange has bounced back to pre-devaluation levels. Inflation rates are still high, around 3 percent a month, but declining broadly after peaking at 8 percent in April. Although the peso is now allowed to float freely, it has remained at around the same level -- between 6 and 6.3 to the dollar -- for weeks. **********What's more, Mexico had a $165 million trade surplus in the first quarter and the Government last week successfully placed $1 billion in commercial notes, a startlingly swift recovery considering that after the last financial crisis here, in 1982, it took seven years to regain access to international capital. **********From the plaza, however, the Government's recovery program looks more like a virus than a cure. **********Fearing hyperinflation, the Government essentially shut down the economy here, raising prices on basic items like electricity, gasoline and even tortillas. Interest rates on consumer loans reached 100 percent and, though dropping, still exceed a punishing 45 percent. Banks have repossessed houses and cars in record numbers. Inflation far outstrips wage increases. And perhaps worst of all, in a country with no unemployment insurance, as many as a million people may have lost jobs since January. **********As the Government's March 9 recovery plan of budget cuts, tax increases, price hikes and a tight money supply continues to take hold, the gap between the palace and the plaza economies appears to grow wider. That is hard for President Ernesto Zedillo to accept because he campaigned on a promise of personal well-being and prosperity for Mexican families. But even he concedes that the hardships are likely to get worse before a real turnaround begins. **********The Government hopes that as investor confidence slowly returns in the second half of the year, and exports remain strong, companies will begin to buy equipment and expand, providing jobs that will lead to some positive growth by the end of the year. Government spending will also increase throughout the rest of this year, while the national development banks will start to make more credit available. **********But until then, as savings run out and the recession hits harder, more jobs will be lost and more pockets will go empty. **********\"There's a big difference between what the Government says and what we the people feel,\" said Maria Ortega, a 28-year-old nurse from Puebla, a colonial city about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City. Like other civil servants, she received a 13 percent wage increase this year, \"but that's not enough to cover my bus fare,\" she complained. **********It's not just having to pull their belts tighter that bothers many Mexicans like Ms. Ortega. They remember how just a little more than a year ago the Mexican economy was widely praised, with a booming stock market and the ability to attract billions of dollars in foreign investment. They believed the Government's promises that by entering the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico was entering the first world. **********ALL that collapsed last December when Mexico jolted world markets with the devaluation, which caught the United States and others by surprise and set off a chain reaction that sent investors and their dollars fleeing. **********Faced with a spreading disaster, the Government appealed for help from the international community and dedicated itself to a major restructuring that would eliminate the $30 billion in volatile short-term foreign capital on which it had been financing much of its expansion. Squeezing out that $30 billion meant putting the economy into a straitjacket. **********It was a classic response to a recurring problem. The economies of eastern Europe and many countries elsewhere in Latin America have adopted the same rigid therapy to rehabilitate their economies, with the same painful results. **********The United States brokered a rescue plan for Mexico last February that includes $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees from Washington and about $30 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and other organizations. When they lobbied for the package last January, American officials said the help was needed to prevent the short-term crisis \"from escalating into a prolonged and severe economic downturn, which would put at risk important U.S. interests,\" in particular 700,000 export-related jobs. **********Already, what had been a positive trade balance with Mexico has turned into another deficit for the United States. Without some relief for the Mexicans who cannot now afford American imports, jobs north of the border could be lost, too. **********Some members of Congress, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, are still opposed to assisting Mexico financially. Senator D'Amato held a hearing in Washington on Friday in which he rapped the Mexican Government for its management of the economy and for the pace with which it has been tapping the loan package. It has already made use of $12.5 billion in United States credits and another $9.8 billion from the I.M.F. **********Such criticism is causing the Mexican Government to fight a battle on two fronts, trying to show American officials that the international rescue has worked while also attempting to show its own people that it is not unaware of the gap between the macroeconomic indicators and everyday life. **********Mr. Ortiz said the Government knew that making a huge economic adjustment would be painful, but believed it was unavoidable. \"If we hadn't got the macroeconomics right,\" he said, \"it would be much more difficult to make progress on the real side of the economy.\" **********The Government clearly has been getting the macroeconomics right. On almost every issue that had become a concern to international investors, Mexico has scored at least a temporary success. **********The stability of the peso is one of the most surprising. Before the recovery plan was announced in March, the peso had dropped to 7.45 to the dollar, a decline of 54 percent since the devaluation. **********But steps taken by the central bank have helped bring the peso back to around 6 to the dollar. Peso futures are now traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Mexico's central bank reveals the level of international reserves and the money supply every week so investors know where the country is heading. Before the devaluation, reserves were officially announced just three times a year. **********The last time the reserves were announced before the crisis was in October, when they stood at about $17 billion. Within a month after the crisis began in December, the reserves stood at only slightly above $2 billion. Since then, they have bounced back to $14.35 billion, mostly with the help of the United States aid package. **********AT the heart of the crisis were doubts about Mexico's ability to pay its debts. As 1994 ended, Mexico had $29 billion worth of outstanding tesobonos -- short-term Government bonds denominated in pesos yet payable in dollars. As the peso lost value, and tesobono holders demanded to be paid in dollars, Mexico faced a liquidity problem. **********But Mexico was able to use the aid package to cover its obligations. Now, only $8.9 billion of tesobonos are outstanding. Of that amount, about $6.6 billion come due the rest of this month and in August. Given the current reserves of Mexico, only a few analysts are worried about its ability to make the payments. **********As the peso lost value earlier in the year, so did Mexican stocks. First-quarter profits were depressed but not as badly as some had feared. As interest rates started to drop during the second quarter, the picture improved. A rate cut by the United States Federal Reserve on July 6 gave additional help to the leading index of the stock exchange here. On Friday, the index closed at 2,531.49, more than a thousand points above its post-devaluation low of 1,447.52, which was set on Feb. 27. The stock market's recovery, however, is not all that it seems because in dollar terms, the exchange is still down more than 18 percent. **********In some cases, the devaluation of the peso has been both a boon and a burden for the same Mexican industry. Auto exports are soaring while domestic sales are slumping badly. For example, exports of the Ford Motor Company of Mexico have increased 50 percent since January. The company recently announced $450 million worth of direct investment, mostly in plants dedicated to producing exports. **********At same time, however, few Mexicans can afford a new car and Ford's domestic sales have plummeted. In the first five months of the year, Ford sold 10,999 cars and trucks, a drop of 20,579 from the same period in 1994. **********Chrysler's domestic sales are down 75 percent; General Motors 40 percent. Volkswagen, which still produces the Beetle in Mexico, has also been hit hard. It sold 503 Beetles in May, compared with 6,283 in May 1994. **********THOSE harsh domestic realities have many investors nervous, notwithstanding the bullish macroeconomic indicators. **********\"They've really got a recession going on,\" said Scott Kalb, manager of the Smith Barney International Asset Management Fund. \"They are going to have some very poor earnings results come out for the second quarter. They've got a tough political situation and plenty of potential for political problems, labor problems and social unrest.\" **********Mexico's plaza economy is better reflected in the eyes of the weary than in Government figures, but statistics give a sense of the difficulty facing most families. **********Of all the bad signs, unemployment is the worst. Mexico's national statistics institute estimates that more than two million people are unemployed, double the number of last December. That comes to an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent, the highest since figures started to be collected 12 years ago. **********But those official figures are unreliable because virtually anyone who earns anything is counted as employed, even someone who sells gum at a traffic light. President Zedillo's own Labor Secretary, Santiago Onate Laborde, doubts the figures, saying at a news conference recently that the number of unemployed workers was closer to six million. **********The only thing that seems certain is that unemployment will get worse as the recession continues. Few new jobs are being created, but this year nearly two million Mexicans will enter the work force. **********Government officials expect the numbers for the second quarter of this year to show the economy contracting by as much as 5 percent, and they forecast no growth at all until the end of the year at best. The leaders of several of Mexico's most important business groups told President Zedillo last week that if the economy did not start to improve soon, there would be more unemployment, more business closings and more social unrest. **********Life is hard even for those who have jobs. The minimum wage has gone up twice since December, 7 percent the first time and 12 percent the second, but still stands at no more than $3 a day. Contract wage settlements have averaged around 12 percent, with 8 percent more in fringe benefits. But inflation for the first six months of 1995 reached a compounded rate of 33 percent and even under the best of estimates will come close to 50 percent for the year. **********The price of gasoline, produced only by the state oil monopoly Pemex, will have increased 48.5 percent by the end of the year, pushing up prices for everything that moves by truck. Even the price of tortillas, the flat corn pancakes that are a daily staple, has risen twice since the crisis began. **********As part of its plan to avoid hyperinflation, raise revenues and suppress demand, the Government increased the national value-added tax to 15 percent, from 10 percent, on April 1. **********THAT in itself produced a spike in inflation for the month of April to a post-devaluation high of 8 percent, but the shock was great enough to stop demand short, theoretically limiting a spiral of price increases. **********To survive the falloff in retail sales -- down at least 40 percent in the first four months of the year -- many store owners are opening earlier and closing later. And like the Mexico City pizza shop that now serves breakfast or the Chrysler dealer who turned his showroom into a car wash, they are willing to try anything. **********Even the rich have been hurt. The number of billionaires in Mexico declined this year to 10, from 24, but there is no need to feel sorry for them. The net worth of Mexico's richest man, Carlos Slim Helu, whose holdings include the Mexican telephone company, was cut in half but still totals $3.7 billion. **********Mr. Slim has said in interviews that he has no doubt Mexico will bounce back from the crisis, and perhaps be even stronger than before. **********For their part, international investors and analysts say they are fairly confident that the harsh medicine that Mexico's leaders have administered will be enough to revive the economy. **********But they are still uncertain whether, after all the pain and hardship caused by this latest crisis, Mexico will make the long-term changes necessary to correct fundamental problems in its economy. **********They are still looking for some clearly defined Government policy to create the millions of new jobs needed each year to account for Mexico's high birth rate. They are hoping to see a plan for building on the export advantage offered by the devaluation, which is rapidly being eaten away by inflation. **********And they are waiting to see how Mexico intends to increase productivity and efficiency to compete with other Latin American countries as they shake off the effects of the Mexican crisis. **********Out in the plaza, plenty of angry people are also waiting. For them, it will take more than a continuing stream of good news from the palace to keep the anger from boiling over."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/business/insider-trading-case-is-settled-in-luxottica-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1995-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insider Trading Case Is Settled in Luxottica Deal", "print_headline": "Insider Trading Case Is Settled in Luxottica Deal", "body_text": " **********The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it had settled an insider trading case arising from Luxottica Group S.p.A.'s acquisition of the United States Shoe Corporation earlier this year. **********Giovanni Malavasi, secretary to the board of Luxottica, an Italian eyewear company, agreed to pay $100,000 for 12,500 shares of U.S. Shoe on Feb. 14, more than two weeks before Luxottica's bid was announced, the commission said.

But to the watchdogs at the S.E.C., there is no legal distinction. **********\"Maybe people on Main Street need a little cautioning,\" said Thomas C. Newkirk, associate director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division in Washington. \"I don't think this is a problem of people not knowing that it is wrong. It is more a case of them not realizing how much trouble they can get into as a result of doing it.\" **********The commission is using more than harsh words to make its point. In the last year, it has successfully concluded five civil lawsuits against people accused of using family ties to obtain secret corporate information and then profiting from that information in the stock market. **********\"The message we're trying to get out to middle America is the importance of safeguarding material, nonpublic information in family situations,\" Mr. Newkirk said. \"We are seeing more cases in which such information is passed on or misappropriated in family situations.\" **********Such family cases represented more than 10 percent of all the insider trading cases filed by the commission last year, a larger share than in recent years, he added. **********According to regulators, family members trading on inside information are among the transgressors easiest to spot. Unlike the Wall Street professionals involved in the elaborate insider-trading rings of the 1980's, individuals tend not to be active in the markets, so their transactions are more likely to jump out at regulators, who regularly review stock trades leading up to a company's acquisition or merger. **********Of course, the Federal Justice Department, whose power exceeds that of the S.E.C., may seek criminal sanctions against a professional insider-trading ring, while criminal charges are rare in family cases because of the smaller amounts of money involved. **********The S.E.C.'s recent crackdown has produced civil insider-trading complaints against the husband of a GTE Corporation administrative assistant; a Washington lobbyist for Kansas City Southern Industries, who reportedly shared merger details with friends and family; a Cray Computer Corporation employee and her husband; a father-son team at the FNB Rochester Corporation, a bank holding company, and the son of an executive at Tele-Communications Inc., the giant cable television company. **********As in most S.E.C. regulatory cases, each of the defendants settled the charges out of court without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Their fines and penalties varied, depending on the amount of profits; their out-of-pocket expenses included substantial legal bills, and they were probably exposed to public scorn and embarrassment as well. **********Some of the cases involved accusations of misappropriation, a gentle form of theft, by which a relative wrongfully obtains sensitive information from a family member and then uses it for trading purposes. For example, a husband was accused of repeatedly misappropriating information from his wife, who was a confidential aide to GTE's chief executive. According to the S.E.C. complaint, the husband garnered profits of $13,810 by trading on tips he obtained between April and July 1990, when GTE was considering a merger with the Contel Corporation. To settle the case, he agreed to return his trading profits and to pay a matching sum in civil penalties. **********In the Tele-Communications case, the executive was asked in July 1993 to work on an acquisition from his home to insure the confidentiality of the talks. According to the S.E.C., his son learned of the deal, and purchased options to buy the stock of the target company. The settlement called for him to pay $76,894 in forgone profits and penalties. **********One securities lawyer recalled an earlier case in which an investment banker's brother-in-law secretly rifled the banker's briefcase at a family gathering and obtained information that he used to trade stock in advance of a takeover. **********Cases like these show how important it is for people who have confidential information either to withhold it from family members or to insure that family members do not trade on the news until it becomes public. Indeed, many large corporations have guidelines on when and whether family members may trade in corporate securities; smaller concerns may lack such formal policies, but usually have lawyers available to advise executives about family trading in company stock. **********At times, however, the S.E.C. has concluded that the person who transmitted the valuable information was more than indiscreet. In the Cray Computer case, which was settled last July, both the employee and her husband were cited by the commission, although the husband actually carried out all the disputed trades. The settlement called for the couple to turn over $24,545 in trading profits and $20,672 more in penalties. **********As this case shows, the opportunity to take advantage of inside information may be fleeting, but the penalty could resonate for some time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/14/business/company-news-potash-stock-surges-on-export-pact-with-china.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POTASH STOCK SURGES ON EXPORT PACT WITH CHINA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; POTASH STOCK SURGES ON EXPORT PACT WITH CHINA", "body_text": " **********The shares of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan rose yesterday after the company announced a new export contract with China.

After the war, thousands of Russians settled in Grozny, taking administrative jobs in running the region. **********Today, the veterans stood for a while on the shattered pavement outside the provisional government building here, waiting for orders. Then the administrators who have been sent from Moscow to run this haunted city told them to get on a bus. They drove past the ruins of apartment buildings that for some had once been home, past factories blasted practically to sand, past parks that are now only graveyards. **********\"My God!\" said Mr. Dmitriyev, his nose pressed against the glass of the bus like a boy on an eerie school trip. \"What have they done?\" **********It was a question he had promised himself he would not ask today, because he wanted to celebrate a victory that changed the world. **********\"I am so proud that I fought,\" he said, fighting tears from his clear gray eyes as the bus approached the heavily fortified Grozny airport. \"I am so proud that we won.\" **********There could hardly have been been a gloomier place to spend Victory Day than at Grozny airport, a dusty, remote area chosen only for security. The Russian authorities could not possibly have risked a parade on the cratered streets of the city without constant fear of sniper fire or mortar attacks from Chechen separatist fighters. **********But at the airport, thousands of Russian troops narrowed the likelihood of an attack. There was a parade and speeches, and lots of flowers were distributed -- men were given tulips and women received roses or lilacs. Because there were no medals to hand out, the military command awarded Russian soldiers fighting the rebels surplus army wristwatches. **********The Russian military commander, here, Gen. Mikhail Yegorev, also promised peace. \"I am sincerely telling you we have come here to establish peace,\" he said.

Night has become the time for snipers and gun battles. The day is the time for pretending that the war does not exist. **********Russian soldiers have taken to standing in front of Grozny's most famous and ghastly building -- the ruins of the nine-story presidential palace. Young boys are always there with Polaroid cameras to photograph the victors as they stride through the rubble. **********Not everyone was gloomy about Grozny's future today. Vladimir Y. Zorin, who runs the Russian administration here, was full of hope. Asked if he saw anything ironic in honoring the remaining veterans today when so many of their colleagues and family members had died in the last five months, Mr. Zorin looked surprised. \"This is a day for looking forward,\" he said. \"It is a day to honor understanding and friendship between people. **********\"For those who are suffering we offer help.

She emerged impassive after 30 minutes and said she would make no comment. **********In an unusual joint statement, the French Interior Ministry and Foreign Ministry said that the French Government had never intended the affair to become public. But they said the American Embassy had been asked to withdraw the diplomats for activities incompatible with their status here. **********The statement did not say how many diplomats were involved, and some French reports said there may have been as many as six. **********In Washington, the State Department described the allegations as unjustified and said it was reviewing the incident. It spoke only of the accusations in the French press. **********\"We regard allegations in the French press, citing French Government sources, concerning purported official U.S. activities, as being unwarranted,\" a department spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, said. **********\"The handling of this matter in France is inconsistent with the approach that allies have taken to resolve sensitive matters in the past,\" she said. \"There is no reason for expelling any Americans, nor is the French Government calling for it.\" **********Other State Department officials, saying that the French planned no expulsions, added privately that the American officials would be moved out of France according to their regular rotations. **********A spokeswoman at the American Embassy in Paris, asked how many of the four embassy diplomats were still in France, said only, \"All of them are working or have worked at the embassy.\" She gave no further elaboration. **********Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Balladur tried to treat the matter lightly. \"The French people are friends of the American people and the French Government is a friend of the American Government,\" he said. \"Events like that occur regularly on both sides of the Atlantic.\" **********But seldom, if ever, have there been such spectacular sparks between allies, according to old C.I.A. hands and diplomats. Many said they could not recall anything to match the incident since the height of the cold war, when Moscow and Washington periodically cleaned out each other's spy networks. This time, the protagonists were officials who presumably dealt with each other regularly on such common threats as international terrorism and organized crime. **********A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said tonight that the French Government had fed the spying story to the news media in a background briefing. He speculated that the main aim was to move the spotlight away from a wiretapping scandal that has embarrassed the French Government. **********The French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, has been under fire this week for authorizing secret wiretaps, and the stir has set back Prime Minister Balladur's campaign to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in elections this spring. **********\"We're not speculating, but the issue may be related to Pasqua's political fortunes,\" the senior Administration official said. \"In France, the speculation is exactly that, in relation to the timing and the handling of the incident.\" **********The official said the French Government's background briefing with the news media about the accused spies was \"totally unprecedented.\" **********\"We're declining to get into the substance of the allegations except to say they're vastly overblown,\" the official added. **********Le Monde also speculated that Mr. Pasqua, who is in charge of the counterespionage service, would not be displeased by a report that distracted attention from the wiretapping scandal. **********That friendly countries also spy on each other's economic and business secrets these days is taken for granted. It is also assumed that friendly diplomats occasionally have privately been asked to leave after getting into mischief. **********Two years ago, French officials themselves were embarrassed by the disclosure of a 21-page Government document that targeted 21 American aerospace companies for industrial espionage. Yet a scandal of this dimension between allies has few, if any, recent parallels. **********The French struck back this time, according to official accounts cited by Le Monde, because the Americans broke the rules of the game -- offering bribes, in 500-franc (equivalent to $100) bills, to at least three high-ranking officials since 1992. **********\"The clandestine research detected concentrated essentially on French domestic politics as well as on the broad economic and commercial policies of our country, in particular in the audiovisual domain and in telecommunications,\" according to a counterespionage report quoted by the newspaper. **********Among the pieces of evidence gathered by the counterspies, the newspaper reported, were photographs of clandestine meetings between the C.I.A. agents and their French contacts, hotel registration papers and credit card imprints proving the use of false identities by American agents, and the serial numbers of 500-franc bills paid to one of the French officials. **********The newspaper's report detailed three approaches made by the Americans. In the first, a woman \"acting for the C.I.A. in Paris,\" approached an unnamed conservative Member of Parliament close to Mr. Balladur's Government. **********He informed counterespionage officials of the approach and was told to go along with it to try to trap the Americans, the report said. He was later approached seven times \"by a known C.I.A. officer coming from Brussels and operating under false identity,\" according to the report, and was offered bribes to disclose the French negotiating position on the global trade talks in 1992 and 1993. **********France compromised in response to Washington's demands to lower agricultural subsidies worldwide, but only at the last minute, at the end of 1993. The United States agreed to drop its insistence that Europeans stop trying to keep American movies and television programs from flooding their markets, but it demanded on quotas and subsidies for European-produced entertainment. **********The second approach, Le Monde said, was to an unnamed high official in the Ministry of Communications who was in charge of audiovisual policy. He, too, was offered bribes, the report said, for information about French strategy on audiovisual policy and on telecommunications. He, too, pretended to cooperate until very recently, the report said. **********The third person allegedly recruited by the C.I.A., according to the report, was a technician, also not named, for the international network of France Telecom, the country's telecommunications network. **********Until last Jan. 27, the report said, the technician pretended to work with the C.I.A., turning over \"documents and technical details on the structures and international networks of France Telecom, in exchange for remuneration and valuable technical materials.\" **********The previous day, Jan. 26, Mrs. Harriman was summoned by the Interior Minister, Mr. Pasqua, to his office. Mr. Pasqua told the American Ambassador what the counterespionage service had discovered, Le Monde said, and asked her to see to it that the five accused Americans left the country immediately. **********Mr. Pasqua repeated this demand in a letter sent to Mrs. Harriman on Feb. 1, Le Monde said. **********On Feb. 3, according to the newspaper, she replied to Mr. Pasqua that she would report the accusations to Washington. The Interior Minister summoned her again on Feb. 10, according to Le Monde, again asking her to get the accused diplomats out of the country soon. **********Mr. Pasqua informed President Mitterrand of the affair on Feb. 18, Le Monde said.

Speeds Repeal of Syndication Rules", "body_text": " **********Ignoring the last-gasp efforts of Hollywood studios, the Federal Communications Commission yesterday accelerated its repeal of the regulations that had impeded television networks from directly entering the syndication market. **********The commission moved the date for the repeal of the financial interest and syndication rules from Nov. 10, when they had been scheduled to be lifted, to sometime next week, when the repeal will be published in the Federal Register. **********Most industry executives said yesterday that the end of the rules, which have prevented the networks from sharing hundreds of millions of dollars in syndication profits from hit series like \"The Cosby Show\" or \"Seinfeld,\" had been widely anticipated. **********Certainly the recent moves by the Walt Disney Company to acquire Capital Cities/ABC and by Westinghouse Electric to buy CBS were fueled by the expectation that the networks would no longer be locked out of the syndication market. **********But the earlier-than-expected demise of the 25-year-old rules was still greeted with celebration by the network executives most active in working to eliminate them. **********\"It took 15 years for her to tune up her voice, but the fat lady has finally sung,\" said Martin D. Franks, senior vice president of CBS Inc. and that network's Washington lobbyist. The rules were first challenged in 1980. **********\"It's historic,\" said Richard Cotton, the senior counsel for NBC. \"It finally restores competitiveness to the television marketplace.\" **********But Diane Killory, the lawyer for a coalition of studios of producers working to preserve the rules, said, \"It's a sad day for diversity.\" She said that the rule changes would encourage the networks to use their power to engage in anti-competitive behavior, such as insisting that producers give them a percentage of the profits in their shows before the networks agree to put them on the air. **********\"There are not enough other buyers out there yet to keep the networks in check,\" Ms. Killory said, \"We're certainly extremely disappointed.\" **********Mr. Cotton argued that with so many new networks, producers will have ample opportunity to make the best deal possible for their shows. **********All of the executives contacted yesterday said the commission's decision was not surprising because the commissioners had already signaled their belief that the rules had outlived their usefulness. **********The F.C.C. chairman, Reed E. Hundt, has repeatedly emphasized that the commission is seeking to eliminate all unnecessary regulations and favored giving free rein to an increasingly competitive television marketplace. **********That position mirrors many of the arguments the network had long made for repealing the syndication rules. **********Because the rule was scheduled to end in two months, yesterday's decision was not expected to have any drastic impact, though Ms. Killory suggested that producers now negotiating to get their shows onto network schedules for the middle of the television season may find themselves facing changed terms. **********But Preston Padden, the president of network distribution for Fox Broadcasting, said: \"Everyone is likely to be underwhelmed at the significance of the change. Good shows will always find distribution.\" **********He said that Fox, which had not been bound by the rules that impeded ABC, CBS and NBC, had still bought shows from a wide range of producers and sold some of its own shows to competing networks. Fox is owned by the News Corporation. **********Mr. Cotton said that has been the essence of the network argument for some time: that allowing the networks to compete freely will only open up opportunities for producers to find financing for their programs, rather than limiting them to being backed by the Hollywood studios. **********He said NBC had already made plans to commit far more money to backing shows from independent producers and to producing its own shows for first-run syndication. NBC made a deal earlier this summer with New World Productions to create syndicated shows. **********Mr. Cotton said the end of the financial interest and syndication rules \"definitely makes networks more valuable,\" but he added, \"Wall Street has assumed the rules would be repealed and that's why there has been a run-up in the value of the networks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/world/iraq-holding-2-americans-seized-near-kuwaiti-border.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1995-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Holding 2 Americans Seized Near Kuwaiti Border", "print_headline": "Iraq Holding 2 Americans Seized Near Kuwaiti Border", "body_text": " **********The State Department said today that Iraq is holding two Americans who apparently strayed from Kuwait into Iraq by mistake earlier in the week. **********The two civilians were working for an American company in Kuwait, Administration officials said, and were visiting friends near the Iraqi border when they lost their bearings. **********American officials said they did not know how the two men could have mistakenly crossed into Iraq because last year Kuwait built a 10-foot-deep, 16-foot-wide trench and a 13-foot-high rampart along its 130-mile-long border with Iraq. **********Iraq's detention of the Americans is expected to aggravate already bitter relations with Iraq, which was defeated by an American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf war in 1991. **********The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iraq and has taken the lead in maintaining severe economic sanctions on President Saddam Hussein's Government. **********The Administration has succeeded in lining up a majority in the United Nations Security Council to overcome a drive by France, Russia and China to ease the sanctions that have wrecked Iraq's economy and imposed hardships on the Iraqi people. **********The State Department said the United States Embassy in Kuwait had asked the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission to make inquiries in Iraq about the two Americans. **********\"We have also been in contact with Polish officials in Baghdad, who provide service to American citizens in Iraq,\" said David Johnson, a State Department spokesman. **********According to American officials, the two men were arrested Monday night and the United States learned about their detention on Tuesday.

Nicknamed the \"clean hands\" team, they swept through Italy's political system in the early 1990's like a whirlwind, rooting out so many dirty politicians and businessmen that in the end they brought down the system itself. **********Since those early, heady days, the prosecutors of so-called \"Tangentopoli\" -- or \"Bribe City\" scandal -- have hit periodic obstacles. But until recently, the magistrates proved more adept at protecting their role than politicians have been at controlling them. **********Now, the tide is turning, and the magistrates here and elsewhere are on the defensive.

Now I think the arrogance and the exagerations of the magistrates have begun to bother public opinion, and there will be an attempt to rebalance the forces in the field.\" **********In recent days, new voices have joined a chorus once led almost exclusively by one of the magistrates' fiercest critics, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, in Sicily last weekend, said the magistrates' use of preventive custody had become perplexing, and in certain cases, gives a \"sense of spectacle rather than justice.\" Antonio Bassolino, the leftist mayor of Naples, in a newspaper interview this week, called on prosecutors to let Italy's new political class get down to work, \"to finish well, and honestly, work that began badly, or else we face paralysis.\" **********When people complain of the arrogance of the prosecutors, they refer to long prison detentions, abuse of press leaks, high profile arrests and a selectivity in applying the law that some say smacks of vendettas, perhaps personal, perhaps political. The problem has become particularly acute in the most recent phase of the scandals, which, by focusing on tax evasion and kickbacks to tax inspectors, cuts deep in a society that has long operated on the notion that only fools pay the Government what it says they owe. **********\"Of the 56 million inhabitants of the country, who knows how many would stay out of jail if you were to jail everyone who paid off tax inspectors,\" said Mr. Feltri. \"If you cut off the right hand of everyone who has paid the Guardia di Finanza, you'd have a country of left handed people.\" **********Like reformers in other countries that have been convulsed by political changes, Italy's judges also get hit with an historical judgment that paints them as avenging angels with no concern for the destruction they leave in their wake. **********\"The problem is that we have the same level of corruption, but we have destroyed a political class,\" said Lucio Caracciolo, editor of Limes, an Italian political review.  \"The result is loss. We have lost prestige, efficiency, and in some sense an attachment to democracy. Now we need a more rational approach to problems, and we have to admit that Tangentopoli was a bluff.\" **********In the Palace of Justice here, which remains the citadel of the nationwide corruption probe given Milan's role as Italy's financial and business center, prosecutors, dismissing arguments that they have overstepped any constitutional line, talk instead about getting on with their job. **********\"I don't think that it is pleasant for anyone that the continuous emergence of crimes exists,\" said Gherardo Colombo, a top member of the prosecuting team. \"It would be wonderful if we could say that all the crimes in this area have been discovered, but that hasn't been the case.\" **********\"We feel as though we are crabs,\" said Mr. Colombo. \"With the passage of time, the more we go forward, the more we move back; the more we discover, the more we have to work.\" **********In the Milan magistrate's office alone, 3,000 people have been investigated by the team since the first bribery case was brought in February 1992. Of these, Mr. Colombo said half have been charged, and are awaiting initial judgment on whether they will go to trial. Another 900 are awaiting trial, and 600 have actually been brought to court, he said. Of the 300-odd sentences handed down, only one -- involving a cemetery inspector from Milan -- has resulted in a jail sentence. **********Most agree that the magistrates' crusade has had some effect. \"For the first time, dirty laundry was washed in the piazza,\" said Mr. Feltri. \"Before, corruption was habitual, and society was convinced it was normal. Now people are more careful, they are more afraid of getting caught.\" **********But Italy -- deadlocked by the political confusion that followed the collapse of the old political system -- has still not managed to tackle some of the key sources of corruption. Public administration still functions on a buddy-system, while conflict of interest remains a dimly-understood notion for many Italians, including Mr. Berlusconi who has seen no problem in being both a Prime Minister and owner of a vast business empire -- including three television stations. **********Mr. Berlusconi remains the prosecutors' most vociferous opponent, and for obvious reasons. In the last month, he has been charged twice -- once as head of his giant Fininvest business empire, which is accused of having paid bribes to tax inspectors, and the second time for evading taxes on the purchase of property utside Milan. In a separate case against Publitalia -- the advertising arm of Fininvest that stands accused of sponsoring sports events as a way of concealing slush funds, prosecutors put its chief executive in jail for two weeks and for the first time, threatened to put the privately held company under public trusteeship. **********Mr. Berlusconi's campaign against the Milan prosecutors -- he calls them \"judges in red robes,\" in an allusion to their alleged leftist bias -- has been a running theme in Italy's recent political drama. But it has also clouded a serious look at the prosecutors' far-ranging powers, which even Mr. Berlusconi's critics agree is overdue. **********Sergio Romano, a respected political commentator, calls the current situation \"a constitutional skirmish between branches of government,\" in which the magistrates have assumed powers that \"hang like a sword of Damocles over the entire political class, continually conditioning their movements.\" **********\"They have come to identify themselves with their public mission and in the process, have become prisoners of a self-feeding process,\" said Mr. Romano in an interview. \"It is a typical police syndrome, which is constantly seeking results.\" **********Mr. Colombo marvels at the resistance he still finds to the idea that corruption is bad. As an example, he cited the recent case of a public official who sought a bribe from the wife of a businessman who was in jail on corruption charges. **********\"We have to measure our success in years because it will take years for the relationship between public administration and business to become correct,\" he said. \"And that change cannot happen as a result of the magistrature but through a change of the Italian culture. We must begin to believe that it is more convenient for a society to be clean rather than corrupt.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/03/business/outlook-1995-the-economy-california-starts-to-chase-the-blues.html": {"writer_name": "Sallie Hofmeister", "pub_date": "1995-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "California Starts To Chase the Blues", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY; California Starts To Chase the Blues", "body_text": " **********Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's. **********A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. **********Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services. **********Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry. **********The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc. **********Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. **********And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort. **********The University of California at Los Angeles may have been overstating California's recovery when it chose \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as a theme song for its annual business forecasting conference in December. **********\"I wouldn't say we're out of the woods,\" said Joe Mattey, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. \"After an extended period of decline, conditions here have stabilized. But we're not back to pre-recession rates in terms of unemployment, housing sales and the other economic indicators.\" **********Still, California, lagging behind the national economy by about two years, is definitely crawling out of the trenches after having hit bottom in mid-1993. Though rising interest rates have slowed the housing recovery here in recent months, economists say holiday retail sales in 1994 were far ahead of the previous year. Moreover, construction, business services, tourism, a booming entertainment business and the export trade, bolstered by the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, are all contributing to the recovery. **********Meanwhile, most of the rest of the West has been enjoying a strong boom, driven in part by migration from California and in part by the attractiveness of the mountain and desert states as locations for high-tech industries. **********U.C.L.A. predicts that nonfarm payrolls in California will rise 1.8 percent this year, below the national average of 2.6 percent, but will beat the nation next year with a 3.6 percent gain -- a forecast that some economists are calling overly optimistic. **********Military cutbacks continue to ravage the state, though job losses are not as great as they were earlier in the decade. They are also starting to be offset by growth in other areas, economists say. One study, by Joel Kotkin at the Center for the New West, found that entertainment and tourism have surpassed military-related industries and aerospace in employment in Southern California for the first time. **********Jack Kyser, chief economist for the independent nonprofit Economic Development Corporation, contends that the streamlining of the state environmental process and changes in workers' compensation laws in late 1993 are finally helping to lure employers to the state, although he had only anecdotal evidence. **********Some economists say the migration out of California, which has helped bolster the economies of surrounding states, has also slowed. As California grappled with the aftershocks of the recession, riots, an earthquake, military cutbacks, a construction downturn and a state fiscal crisis, neighboring states like Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon enjoyed some of the strongest growth in the country. **********Utah has used its low wages, a central location in the region and hard-working reputation to build a hub around Novell Inc. in software development and production. And, like Nevada and Arizona, it has also benefited as corporations have consolidated their computer back offices in low-cost states. **********Growth has slowed in Washington, meanwhile, because of layoffs at the Boeing Company.

Sir Patrick and Mr. Spring confirmed after their three-hour meeting that a disarmament commission had been discussed, but they did not elaborate on that or other aspects of the plan. Asked to assess the prospects for the peace effort, Sir Patrick said, \"There are sensible grounds for being hopeful.\" **********Officials familiar with the plan said it had three parts. First, the disarmament of the I.R.A. would be referred to a commission of international arms experts. Disarmament, called decommissioning by all sides and involving the destruction or impoundment of weapons at a neutral site, has been one of the chief blocks to the advancement of the peace effort. **********The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, has insisted that decommissioning can only be done as part of full-fledged peace talks, not as a condition to their start. A senior British official, Michael Ancram, said over the weekend that Sinn Fein would not be invited to all-party talks \"unless we see the beginning of a credible process\" of disarmament. **********The possible ground for compromise, officials and analysts say, is in simultaneous announcement of the establishment of a disarmament commission and the convening of all-party talks, possibly this year, that would include Sinn Fein. Such a development would allow both sides to save face, telling their supporters that they had not weakened their positions. **********The second part of the plan envisions inclusive talks, but in two groupings, one including the British and Irish Governments, Sinn Fein, the predominantly Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party and the Alliance party, a 60-40 mix of Protestants and Catholics. The other group would involve the British and Irish Governments meeting with the Protestant Unionist parties. **********Officials acknowledged that there was no guarantee that Sinn Fein or the unionists would accept such arrangements, and that considerable negotiating and fine-tuning of precise terms of the plan would be needed. Until now, unionists have refused to sit at a table with Sinn Fein until the I.R.A. has totally disarmed. **********But it was the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party that first proposed a disarmament commission earlier this year. And Mr. Adams has never rejected the idea of a commission. Some analysts said Sinn Fein might agree to a commission that would take a year or two to study the issue, while full-fledged pace talks progressed. **********The third part of the plan involves the prisoner issue. Sinn Fein has demanded the early release of some of the 600 I.R.A. guerrillas now in British jails. Early release is also sought by political parties representing the 400 Protestant paramilitaries in jail. The plan of the two governments would be to release some of them once they have served half their terms. **********As Mr. Spring and Sir Patrick met today, a delegation of influential Irish-Americans visited leaders on all sides in Belfast and Dublin. The head of the delegation, former Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, said that after meeting the leaders, including Mr. Adams and Mr. Bruton, \"the exact shape of the table\" for the peace talks had not been decided, but that \"things are happening that we consider helpful and hopeful.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/business/us-companies-evaluate-outlook-in-kobe-quake-area.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1995-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 731, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Companies Evaluate Outlook in Kobe Quake Area", "print_headline": "U.S. Companies Evaluate Outlook in Kobe Quake Area", "body_text": " **********Thirty seconds after his alarm went off at 5:45 A.M. last Tuesday, Glenn Spargo, general manager of Sea-Land Service, had the jolt of his life. **********The earthquake that struck Kobe, where Mr. Spargo was living with his family, knocked out the electricity and made it impossible to conduct normal business. But Mr. Spargo convinced a friend to lend him a tugboat and he went to inspect the pier. There he got some bad news: His four cranes were damaged and the asphalt by the berths had sunk four to five feet. **********The terminals will take about six months to repair fully, and in the meantime he has been trucking his container loads to Osaka. But in the long term, he said, Sea-Land would remain in the area. **********\"Absolutely we'll remain in Kobe,\" Mr. Spargo said in a phone interview from the stricken city. \"We have a commitment to Kobe.\" **********Having checked on their families and employees and assessed the damage to their plants and offices, managers at American companies are only beginning to evaluate the prospects this year for business in the Kansai region, as the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto area is known. For the most part, many say that earthquakes are a \"risk of doing business\" in Japan and have no plans to scale down, but with the recession here and the high cost of doing business in Japan, some are raising more fundamental questions. **********\"The Kansai politicians, economists and business organizations had such high hopes for this year, with the new airport and all, and it was going to be the year of Kansai,\" said Ron Siani, the administrator for the Kansai regional office of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. \"Now, this is going to be destroyed. **********\"With China such a player in the world market, is it necessary to have a presence in Japan? Companies are looking to Singapore or another country to establish an Asian presence. It's a wild card, but what would happen if Tokyo was hit with an earthquake?

In the meantime, Eli Lilly will ship products to its clients from the United States. **********\"The risk of earthquakes is there all throughout Japan,\" said Mr. Millon, who has spent the last week shuttling in his car among his damaged plant, his temporary and damaged offices and his Osaka hotel room. \"We have no plans to leave the area.\" **********Eli Lilly, which had its distribution interrupted for only one day, is planning to donate insulin and antibiotics to people living in shelters in Kobe, Mr. Million said. **********As a result of the earthquake, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. might have an expanded market for hydraulic excavators that it makes in a plant in the western part of Kobe. Dorwin R. Larsen, general manager of the hydraulic excavator development center at Shin Caterpillar, said there was some damage to the office building and equipment in the design office and there would be some delays at the plant, which makes 10,000 excavators a year at one of Caterpillar's largest plants. **********\"There are already plenty of excavators around for that,\" Mr. Larsen said in a telephone interview, referring to the post-quake rebuilding that is getting under way in Kobe. **********\"I suppose they're going to need a lot of construction equipment for rebuilding,\" he said, but acknowledged he had not thought about it. \"I've been dealing with our people's immediate problems.

Last month it warned that it would from now on demand more than a tit-for-tat response if the Bosnian Serbs attacked Sarajevo or other United Nations-protected cities in Bosnia. All the talk was about \"robust\" and even \"disproportionate\" military responses. **********But in the wake of Monday's shelling, the Administration found that its thirst to retaliate was clashing with its desire to pursue diplomatic solutions, as well as with the fears of European allies whose soldiers are closer to harm's way. **********Today Administration officials were uninhibitedly boasting that they were instrumental in persuading the United Nations and NATO to retaliate, but they seemed to be keeping their fingers crossed that the retaliation would be neither too little nor too much. **********The Administration feverishly twisted the arms of the United Nations and NATO in the last 24 hours to insure that there would be more than a pinprick response to show the Bosnian Serbs and the world that such horrific deeds could not go unpunished. On the other hand, it discreetly told the United Nations and NATO not to hit the Bosnian Serbs too severely because that could undercut the Administration's fledgling efforts to get the warring Muslims, Croats and Serbs to sign onto a peace plan. **********\"No one is looking for something that would cause things to escalate wildly or cause serious problems with the diplomatic initiative,\" a senior White House official said. \"At this same time this kind of outrage can't stand, and it can't be a pinprick response.\" **********It would not be the smartest thing in the world, several policy makers said, for Richard C. Holbrooke, the Administration's top negotiator on the Balkans, to show up in Belgrade later this week to meet with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia right after NATO planes bombed his Bosnian Serb brothers. Large-scale bombing might cause Serbian nationalists to pressure Mr. Milosevic to tell Mr. Holbrooke to go away -- and derail a peace initiative when the Administration believes that the chances to end the war are the best in years. **********While some Republicans view this approach as diplomatic mush and Clintonesque backsliding, the Administration asserts that its nuanced strategy is the best way to bring peace to Bosnia and keep the support of its allies. **********This approach helped keep skittish British officials from vetoing a military response, Administration officials said. The British fear that too strong a response could cause the war to widen and could make it appear that the United Nations and its peacekeepers have taken sides. That could push the Serbs to take more British and French peacekeepers hostage. **********\"We are vulnerable to attack, not just hostage-taking,\" a United Nations official said today. \"Should their mood turn violent, the Serbs would have a clear shot at shelling concentrations of peacekeepers at United Nations headquarters all over Bosnia.\" **********From the moment the Clinton Administration learned of Monday's carnage in Sarajevo, it pushed for a quick response. But United Nations officials and several European powers cautioned Washington that it would be unwise to shoot from the hip. **********The United Nations wanted time to withdraw about 90 British and Ukrainian peacekeepers from the Muslim enclave of Gorazde because the Serbs could have easily taken them hostage. The troops were removed Monday night. **********Then the United Nations wanted time to double-check that the shell dropped on Sarajevo was actually fired by the Bosnian Serbs. After examining the crater left by the shell and radar records of the shell's trajectory, the United Nations said today that it was sure beyond a reasonable doubt that the Bosnian Serbs were responsible. **********Even as some White House officials said they were disgusted with the bureaucratic delays over retaliation, one Administration official acknowledged, \"Waiting for that conclusion will make the military response less controversial among those who were skeptical, especially the Russians,\" who had insisted it would be wrong to blame their traditional allies, the Serbs. **********Some American officials ended up finding something else to praise in the delay: It gave them time to determine targets and think through what would happen if the Bosnian Serbs retaliated against United Nations forces. All the analysis about the source of the shell helped the United Nations determine that it was fired from a clump of trees south of Sarajevo, Administration officials said, but the Serbs have apparently moved the mortar that fired the shell. **********\"It wouldn't do us much good to shoot at an empty clump of trees,\" one official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/01/business/the-basinger-bankruptcy-bomb.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1995-01-01", "snippet": "CAROL CLARK lost her job as president of the bank here after it was auctioned in the actress Kim Basinger's bankruptcy.\n\nTom Brown, 76, was laid off five years ago when Ms. Basinger, in a burst of publicity, \"bought\" tiny Braselton, including the ...", "word_count": 2340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Basinger Bankruptcy Bomb", "print_headline": "The Basinger Bankruptcy Bomb", "body_text": " **********CAROL CLARK lost her job as president of the bank here after it was auctioned in the actress Kim Basinger's bankruptcy. **********Tom Brown, 76, was laid off five years ago when Ms. Basinger, in a burst of publicity, \"bought\" tiny Braselton, including the hardware store where he worked. Now he fears that he will lose his rented home as she and her investment partner prepare to sell off parts of the town, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, which they purchased with big development plans in mind. A neighbor, Terry Kitchens, is worried about the same thing. \"If they say, 'Move out,' I get 30 days to load up,\" Mr. Kitchens said. **********Meanwhile, in California, the owner of Golden State Landscape Irrigation and Maintenance, Mark Booth, is still waiting to collect $8,100 for yard work at Ms. Basinger's home in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles. **********These are some of the not-so-glamorous people caught up in a multimillion-dollar contract battle-cum-bankruptcy brawl between the decidedly glamorous Ms. Basinger, star of \"Batman\" and wife of the actor Alec Baldwin, and Main Line Pictures Inc. **********The Basinger case is hardly a typical bankruptcy. But in its extremes, it highlights some of the ironies of the bankruptcy system, which has been flooded with cases in recent years as the stigma of \"going under\" has lessened. **********For openers, the case is one of those in which the \"bankrupt\" person manages to keep on living a life of luxury while creditors are forced to wait patiently to collect a fraction, if anything, of what they are owed. For Ms. Basinger, that means living in three homes on both coasts and spending $31,000 a month on clothes, pets and an ex-husband, among other things. **********The case is noteworthy as well because of the way the bankruptcy court's shield can be used as a sword. Some companies involved in labor disputes have invoked the shield to void union contracts. In Ms. Basinger's case, bankruptcy protection has allowed her to appeal a big jury verdict in the dispute with Main Line without having to post an expensive, perhaps unobtainable, $12 million bond guaranteeing payment if she loses, as required by state law. **********That has left small creditors like Mr. Booth in limbo, as Ms. Basinger and Main Line lurch slowly toward a final ruling on the questions of whether she was legally bound to appear in the 1993 movie \"Boxing Helena\" and hurt Main Line when she bowed out. **********For Mr. Brown, Mr. Kitchens and others in Braselton, a town with a hardscrabble history, the bankruptcy has been a rude awakening from a Hollywood dream. Instead of becoming a tourist attraction tied tightly to Ms. Basinger's name, Braselton is now just another asset in her bankruptcy -- and one with an uncertain future. **********As the case drags on, and the lawyers' bills mount (the litigants have already spent more than $3 million chasing each other through the courts), those holding the bag can only guess what they may get. **********Creditors desperate for their money have been known to go bankrupt themselves -- though not in this case, said John Reitman, the lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee handling Ms. Basinger's case. But, he said, small creditors cannot afford to force quicker action. **********Most creditors fall into this category, said Charles Normandin, who teaches bankruptcy law at Harvard Law School. Bankruptcy's little guys may wind up getting only 10 to 15 cents for each dollar they are owed, he said, but all they can do is wait. \"If I had a client come into my office and say, 'I've got $20,000 in an unsecured claim,' I'd say, 'File a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court and forget it,' \" he said. **********Unsecured creditors are at the end of the line in a personal bankruptcy case. And those lines have multiplied since the 1978 rewriting of the country's bankruptcy law, which generally made it easier for the financially swamped to walk away from most or all of their debts. **********Almost 4.4 million corporate and personal bankruptcy petitions were filed in the 1980's -- more than double the number filed in the 70's, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Slightly more than that record number have already been filed this decade, though filings have declined slightly since the 1992 peak as the economy has improved. **********At the same time, Mr. Normandin said, legal costs have grown, with lawyers pocketing more of the money that could have gone to creditors. That happened largely because bankrupt corporations began hiring more expensive lawyers and their cases started raising complicated issues like pension rights and environmental liability. **********Bankruptcies filed by individuals have changed less, Mr. Normandin said. But flashy cases like Ms. Basinger's can annoy those who see so much money flushed through the courts while creditors wait years to collect a few thousand dollars.The Verdict **********The troubles for Ms. Basinger's creditors began in May 1993, when a jury in Los Angeles decided that Ms. Basinger had indeed agreed to appear in \"Boxing Helena,\" a film about a doctor who cut off his lover's arms and legs, and then reneged. Sherilyn Fenn got the vacant role and \"Boxing Helena\" opened to strong reviews but a weak box office in the late summer of 1993. **********Main Line won an $8.1 million award. To file an appeal, a bond of $12 million was required, to take account of interest and expenses that might pile up while the case continued. To get the bond, Ms. Basinger would have had to pledge $12 million in assets and pay perhaps $1 million or more. Five days after the verdict, Ms. Basinger instead filed for bankruptcy protection in Los Angeles. She claimed about $5 million in assets and $11 million in liabilities, including the Main Line award. (Ms. Basinger did not respond to requests for an interview for this article.) **********Last September, the California Court of Appeal reversed Main Line's victory because of the way the jury's decision was worded. The court said it could not tell whether the jury wanted the actress or her solely-owned professional service company to pay. If her corporation is liable, her assets and income might be outside Main Line's reach. A new trial, then more appeals, will probably take years unless the sides settle. **********While the wheels of justice creak and moan, Ms. Basinger's small creditors --those who arranged her travel plans or repaired her home -- go unpaid. And the folks of Braselton, population 450, learn that getting too involved with an actress can be dangerous. **********\"If I move, I'll have to move, I reckon,\" said Mr. Brown, who came here 52 years ago to pick cotton for the Braselton clan, which ran Braselton much like a company town, owning most of the land and buildings. The Braseltons sold 1,691 acres to Ms. Basinger and her backers in 1989. Mr. Brown now rents his unpainted, three-bedroom home from the Braselton/Basinger Limited Partnership for $60 a month, but suspects it will be torn down when it is sold to a new owner. He doesn't know where he will live then. **********Nearby, Mr. Kitchens runs Terry's Auto Center out of a building owned by the partnership. He and his wife and five children live in one of the partnership's rental properties as well. Mr. Kitchens, though still a Basinger fan, recently removed her signed publicity photo from the most honored position on his office wall, filling the space with a poster of supermodel Cindy Crawford. **********Even 29-year-old Anne Elisabeth Braselton Miller, a great-granddaughter of the Braseltons who settled here in 1876, might have to vacate the Braselton Furniture and Appliance store she runs near the town's lone stoplight. **********Ms. Basinger's life style stands in sharp contrast to that of people affected in Braselton, Los Angeles and elsewhere by her bankruptcy and failure as a developer. **********Bankruptcy documents refer to her Woodland Hills house, valued at $600,000, as well as to the apartment in Manhattan and house in Amagansett, L.I., owned by Mr. Baldwin. His properties are not part of the case. **********A July 1993 filing outlines Ms. Basinger's expenses, then running at a rate of $43,000 a month. The actress spent $6,100 a month for clothes and $4,000 for \"recreation, clubs and entertainment, newspapers, magazines, etc.\" Another $7,000 went to \"pet care and other personal expenses.\" Her ex-husband, Ron Britton, received $9,000 in alimony. **********A later filing trumpeted that Ms. Basinger had slashed her monthly expenses to $31,000 even though her \"life style has never been extravagant or lavish.\" In one filing, though, she reported $592,000 in furniture and clothing and $192,000 of jewelry. **********Main Line argued that Ms. Basinger was not entitled to the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization because she could pay all her debts in full -- if not out of current assets, then through future earnings. Agents for the actress, who commanded $3 million fees for films like \"The Real McCoy\" and \"Final Analysis,\" could \"pick up the telephone and engage Ms. Basinger's services\" in contracts worth more than enough to pay off the judgment, Main Line's president argued in a motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition. Chapter 11 allows a debtor to keep control of assets while proposing a plan to pay off creditors. **********Ms. Basinger, now 41 and starring in the just-released \"Ready to Wear,\" has countered that her high earning years are behind her. \"Actresses over 40 years of age are much less marketable than younger actresses,\" Ms. Basinger's lawyers said in one filing. Paying the Main Line claim plus her other debts, with interest, would have been impossible even if she turned over all her after-tax income for the rest of her life, they said. Instead, her payback proposal under Chapter 11 would have combined the sale of some assets with some future earnings. **********Last January, with the bankruptcy court seemingly unsympathetic to her efforts to reorganize, Ms. Basinger converted her bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation. That meant most of her assets -- including her interest in Braselton -- would have to be sold. Under Chapter 7, Ms. Basinger might get to keep $75,000 or so of her jewelry, furniture and clothing, a $300,000-plus I.R.A. and $50,000 of home equity but perhaps little else. No future earnings, however, would be thrown into the pot under Chapter 7.Current Status: Chaos **********The September Court of Appeal decision leaves everything in chaos. With the Main Line judgment reversed, Ms. Basinger could win a new trial and not have to pay the movie company anything, said one of her lawyers, Leslie A. Cohen. In that situation, the bankruptcy case might even be dismissed if her assets once more exceeded liabilities. **********Ms. Cohen, of the Los Angeles firm of Levene & Eisenberg, said Main Line never had an \"actual agreement\" with Ms. Basinger to star in its movie and therefore she should not have to pay the company anything. Even so, Ms. Cohen said, her client tried to settle. **********\"Instead of trying to work with us, Main Line chose to reject everything and just fight and fight and fight,\" Ms. Cohen said, adding that creditors \"should direct their complaints, if any, toward Main Line.\" **********Not so, said Eric Landau, a lawyer for the company. Main Line \"was simply trying to recover the damage caused by Ms. Basinger,\" he said. \"Main Line has never rejected a reasonable settlement proposal.\" **********Braselton folks seem weary of talk of the actress and her financial turmoil. Newspapers and TV programs from as far away as Australia covered her \"purchase\" of the town. **********Despite all the fuss, people here know that the movie star's role in the purchase never lived up to its billing. Virtually all the $20 million used to buy a chunk of the town came from the pension fund of the Ameritech Corporation, the Baby Bell based in Chicago. Money Ms. Basinger contributed was either lent to her by Ameritech or essentially given as a kind of finder's fee. **********Ameritech's pension fund bought in because of the development potential of the property, located along Interstate 85. Fund executives teamed with Ms. Basinger because the actress, who grew up in nearby Athens, Ga., was the person the Braseltons wanted to deal with. The executives also thought the actress could give the project \"a certain aura,\" said a person involved in the deal. Moreover, because most of the stock of the town bank was put in her name, Ameritech did not have to become a bank holding company. **********Ameritech now is less enamored of its investment and has put the partnership's property back on the block, not only because of Ms. Basinger's troubles but also because of the drop in land values in the area and a change in investment strategy. **********Ms. Basinger's bank stock brought $1.5 million in a bankruptcy auction. The partnership's land is listed with an Atlanta broker for $8.5 million, about half what Ameritech paid. Ms. Basinger's creditors are not likely to see anything from the land sale because the actress can share in the proceeds only if Ameritech recoups its original investment. **********Braselton residents were excited when Ms. Basinger announced that she was buying their town. There was talk of restoring the turn-of-the-century stores and houses, of making Braselton an historic theme park, of installing a movie studio in the old bank and dry goods building. **********Instead, little of note has happened other than the tearing down of some rickety buildings. **********In October Congress passed a law setting up a nine-member commission to study the bankruptcy system and report back by mid-1997 with suggestions for improvement. **********Mr. Normandin, the Harvard bankruptcy expert, expects little to change. Americans have long been more understanding than their European ancestors toward deadbeats. \"This country was founded by debtors and to some extent you've always had a pro-debtor bankruptcy law,\" Mr. Normandin said. **********Just listen to Mr. Kitchens, the mechanic. \"I was feeling more for her than for myself,\" he said, when asked his reaction to the bankruptcy and sale of some of Braselton. \"If I had my way, I would have done something to help her.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/business/the-media-business-broad-deregulation-sought-in-cable-and-phone-services.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Broad Deregulation Sought In Cable and Phone Services", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Broad Deregulation Sought In Cable and Phone Services", "body_text": " **********In a sweeping bid to deregulate the telecommunications industry, Senate Republicans proposed legislation yesterday that would end all price controls for cable television after one year and let the regional Bell companies enter the $ 60 billion long-distance market after three years. **********The proposal, which would also eliminate longstanding restrictions on the number of television and radio stations a company can own, drew criticism from consumer advocates and complaints from telephone companies, which say the proposal would hinder their efforts to compete in the cable business. **********But Senator Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican who introduced the proposal, said in a statement yesterday, \"Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur innovation and the development of new services.\" **********Senator Pressler, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said yesterday that he would circulate the draft bill among Democrats and Republicans and seek a bipartisan consensus before introducing a formal piece of legislation. As a result, the bill is certain to be modified considerably in the coming weeks. **********The bill would slash regulations much more sharply than a similar measure proposed last year by Democratic lawmakers. **********The most confrontational proposal would repeal cable television rate controls, which were passed in 1992. During the last two years, Federal regulators have ordered the cable television operators to cut their prices by about 17 percent, generating furious opposition from the industry. **********The bill would also give cable television companies a brief respite from competition by the telephone companies. A separate provision would block the Federal Communications Commission for one year from approving any applications by telephone companies to provide \"video dialtone\" service, a regulatory term that basically means cable television programming. **********If adopted, the provision would set back plans by most of the Bell companies, several of which have already received approval to start video services and would be blocked retroactively from constructing the new networks. **********The bill would also make it easier for telephone and cable operators in the same market to merge. Such mergers are permitted in rural areas, whose definition would be changed by the proposal to mean areas with fewer than 100,000 people from the current threshold of 10,000 people. Telephone executives said the new bill would permit mergers in about half the communities in the United States. **********\"For cable consumers, it's a bad thing,\" said Brad Stillman, legislative counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, which lobbied strongly for cable television rate regulation, \"because it's going to cost them 3 billion bucks because the companies are going to raise prices as high as they can.\" **********Like the bill that almost passed Congress last year, the new plan is intended to promote open competition between the segments of the communications industry that have been divided into separate, protected realms by current regulation. It would allow cable television and local telephone companies to enter each other's markets, force telephone companies to adopt changes that make it easy for rivals to interconnect and would lift restrictions that prevent the Bell companies from offering long-distance service or manufacturing equipment. **********But neither the Bell companies nor long-distance carriers were entirely happy with the plan outlined yesterday. The AT&T Corporation, the nation's biggest long-distance company, said it \"strongly disagreed\" with any provision that would automatically allow the Bell companies into their market on a particular date. **********Lobbyists for the regional Bell companies said they were not happy either, complaining that the bill would force them to open their local telephone markets entirely, while slowing their entry into cable television and long-distance. **********Bell company executives said they were particularly incensed at the one-year restriction on providing cable television, mainly because most of them had persuaded Federal courts to overturn a provision of existing law that kept them out of that market. But they also complained about provisions that would block them for a year from offering \"incidental\" long-distance service in conjunction with cellular telephone service or from manufacturing equipment. Such provisions would be more restrictive than those in last year's Democratic bill. **********Senator Pressler and other Republican lawmakers argue that most of current regulations, which were adopted amid a concern that telephone and cable companies could use their traditional monopolies to stifle new competitors, have become outdated by new competition. Cable television operators argue, for example, that they now face competition from direct-broadcast satellites and will soon have to defend themselves against the phone companies. **********But Democratic lawmakers have been much more cautious about deregulation. The Clinton Administration has made it clear that it opposes legislation that would simply let the Bell companies enter the long-distance business on a certain date."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/01/business/company-reports-shares-of-quantum-health-off-23-after-profit-report.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 438, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shares of Quantum Health Off 23% After Profit Report", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS; Shares of Quantum Health Off 23% After Profit Report", "body_text": " **********Shares of Quantum Health Resources Inc. plunged yesterday, a day after the company, which provides health services to patients with chronic diseases, reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. **********The stock fell 23 percent, or $6.75, to $22 on Nasdaq, where it was among the most active issues. Earlier in the session, the shares reached a 52-week low of $20.75.

DUENAS learned last week that her mail order pharmacy had been cleaned out of her drug. \"I feel like an addict,\" she says, explaining her anxiety. Ms. Duenas counts herself among the fortunate, however. She has enough Pergonal -- one of the most widely prescribed fertility-boosting drugs in the United States -- left over from previous failed attempts at fertilization to try again. In her efforts to become pregnant the 28-year-old Bostonian quit a public relations job three years ago. **********Women like Ms. Duenas and many doctors prescribing Pergonal are baffled and angry at the severe shortage of the drug. Pergonal and Metrodin are the two best-selling fertility drugs made by Ares-Serono S.A. of Switzerland. Infertility affects more than 2.5 million American couples and Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, faults Ares-Serono for failing to stockpile a contingency supply of Pergonal as the company began a changeover to a purer version of Metrodin. \"It has created needless anxiety for many patients,\" he says. **********Two years ago, Ares-Serono introduced a new Metrodin whose production has contributed to the shortage of Pergonal. Both Pergonal and Metrodin are made from the urine of postmenopausal women. Urine is collected twice-a-day from 100,000 donors, whose health must be monitored constantly. But making the new Metrodin requires 25 percent more urine and in the process destroys a hormone that helps regulate menstrual cycles and is an essential component in Pergonal. **********Ares-Serono is also planning to have both Pergonal and Metrodin genetically engineered. And because it expects to receive regulatory approval to start marketing synthetic or recombinant versions of the drugs within the year, says Gina Cella, a spokeswoman for the American arm of the company in Norwell, Mass., Ares-Serono is unwilling to increase the number of urine donors or build more processing capacity in order to make more Pergonal. **********Some fertility specialists are threatening to boycott Ares-Serono's drugs once the shortage ebbs, which is expected after a rival drug, Humegon, comes on the market in April. Others are unconvinced that the new drugs will be suitable substitutes -- or even necessary. **********Dr. Mark L. Jutras, a specialist is reproductive medicine in Orlando, contends Ares-Serono is making Pergonal scarce out of greed. \"The new drug is no more effective than the old, but is more costly to produce,\" he says. Since price setting typically occurs when a drug is introduced, Ares-Serono stands to profit more from a new product than an old one, he reasons. **********Some Wall Street analysts estimate that Ares-Serono derived roughly $153 million, or 24 percent of its 1994 total revenues of $637 million, from Pergonal sales and is already suffering from the worldwide shortage. According to Edmund A. Debler, a biotechnology analyst for Mehta & Isaly, a brokerage firm, a continuing shortage of Pergonal and a developing shortfall of Metrodin will also hurt the company's first half earnings. **********Mr. Debler and other analysts forecast per share earnings of between $15.50 and $20.40 this year, but they predict better profits and even a vibrant 20 percent increase in sales in 1996. **********Ares-Serono's revenues and earnings peaked in 1992 and have been in decline primarily because of reductions in price and Government reimbursements in Italy, its largest market. Despite a 60 percent increase in sales of Metrodin worldwide last year, the company was unable to make up for an estimated $170 million shortfall in revenue from Italy, says Mr. Debler. **********The potential profits from Ares-Serono's drugs -- and its plan to have most of its eight-drug line genetically engineered by 1996 -- keep its shares trading at a multiple of 40 times estimated 1995 earnings, similar to biotechnology stocks like Genentech. The stock, which is traded on the Zurich and Geneva exchanges, ended last week at 755 Swiss francs. The price has dropped 13 percent from a high of 865 in December 1993, hurt mostly by bad news from Italy but unmoved by the Pergonal shortage, says Sam Islay, of Mehta & Islay. \"Despite sharply lower earnings, investors have looked beyond to the long-term attractions.\" **********The new Metrodin has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the United States. According to Ares-Serono, this drug is preferable to Pergonal because it can be self-injected into an arm or thigh instead of the buttocks. **********In the meantime, Ares-Serono is creating ill-will. Even though the company's fertility drugs have no patent protection, until now it has had a de facto monopoly. The in vitro fertilization program at the University of Southern California has not received Pergonal since November, says Nanette Bahl, the office manager. She says her clinic intends to switch to Humegon, made by Akzo Nobel N.V. of the Netherlands. **********Last month, Organon, the New Jersey subsidiary of Akzo, received F.D.A. approval to begin selling Humegon, a urine-derived fertility drug that has been sold overseas for 20 years. \"What Serono has succeeded in doing is driving everyone to Organon,\" says Ms. Bahl. **********This development could add perhaps 5 percent to the parent company's profits, says Mr. Islay. Akzo, a conglomerate, is traded as American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq at $58.25. **********The company has been swamped with phone calls from women awaiting treatment, says Craig A. Rothenberg, an Organon spokesman. \"These are incredibly stressed patients.\" The company intends to start marketing the drug even before an adequate backlog of inventory is in place.  \"We know full well our stocks will be depleted instantly.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-programmers-form-latin-group.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Programmers Form Latin Group", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Programmers Form Latin Group", "body_text": " **********Twelve television networks and programming services are forming the Television Association of Programmers -- Latin America, to be known as T.A.P.

Dyna smiles on the cover of Hallmark greeting cards. Tens of millions of Nestle Crunch chocolate bars feature Dyna's face. As readers peruse this column over the breakfast table, they may even see Dyna on the front of their boxes of Cheerios cereal. **********And who is Dyna Taylor? Ms. Taylor is a young California woman who contends she is the face of Pocahontas. **********\"Pocahontas,\" of course, is the animated Walt Disney feature about the legendary American Indian princess. The movie has grossed more than $75 million since it opened less than two weeks ago. **********Ms. Taylor, on the other hand, was paid $200 in modeling fees by Disney. She received no screen credit and she is disappointed. **********\"Without a face, Pocahontas is not much of a person, even if she is a cartoon character,\" said Ms. Taylor, a student majoring in graphic design for advertising and product packaging. **********For its part, Disney says Ms. Taylor was not the sole or even a major influence for the look of the Pocahontas character. Glen Keane, the supervising animator for \"Pocahontas\" at Walt Disney Pictures in Burbank, Calif., said in an interview that if the producers had asked him whether Ms. Taylor deserved a film credit for \"Pocahontas,\" he would have said no. **********\"Actually, I would have had to draw up a list of maybe 15 people for that,\" Mr. Keane said, including a young black woman and an American Indian woman. Ms. Taylor is of Filipino descent. **********Still, Mr. Keane thought enough of Ms. Taylor's modeling efforts to autograph a picture of Pocahontas for her that reads, \"To Dyna, with gratitude for the inspiration you gave us.\" **********Granted, Disney's Pocahontas has waist-length hair and Ms. Taylor has shorter, curlier hair. And Pocahontas's figure is more voluptuous than what Ms. Taylor describes as her \"pretty good\" figure. But many elements of Ms. Taylor's face, especially her jaw line, are similar. **********Ms. Taylor says she is unsure about whether to sue Disney but has consulted a lawyer, who has advised against a lawsuit. **********Cases like Ms. Taylor's, while rare, reflect the often hazy provenance of animated features, where a variety of human performers can be claimed as influences in the illustration of characters. **********A Disney spokesman said he was not aware of any lawsuit by a model or other performer for screen credit or other compensation for work in the studio's animated features, which include top-grossing movies like \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid.\" **********Nor is Disney likely to be successfully sued, lawyers say, because animation does not carry the certitude of photographs or films with live actors. **********When Ms. Taylor first modeled for Disney almost three years ago, she was an 18-year-old student at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, which was founded by Disney and which regularly uses students to help in its productions. At the time, Ms. Taylor was flattered to be part of the film-making process. **********The performers in the speaking and singing roles of Pocahontas received screen credit and have even appeared in promotional tours for the movie. But Ms. Taylor has only been indirectly recognized in a scattering of newspaper and magazine articles, including a brief reference in Entertainment Weekly and a television appearance on \"Entertainment Tonight.\" **********Konrad Trope, the Beverly Hills entertainment lawyer whom Ms. Taylor consulted, said Disney could marshal the best lawyers in the business against Ms. Taylor and also privately ostracize her from modeling work. He added that he had no affiliation with Disney but lectures on legal matters at the California Institute of the Arts, where Ms. Taylor is currently in her senior year. **********\"The problem Dyna Taylor has is that she just went in and did it and she was flattered to do it,\" Mr. Trope said. \"She's over 18 so she can't claim she's a minor. And as many Cal Arts students do, they give away their services for bubkes. After all, look where she is in the food chain of Hollywood. They can always get somebody else.\" **********Ms. Taylor's run-in with \"Pocahontas\" began in September 1992, when a graduate of California Institute of the Arts now working for Disney asked Ms. Taylor to send the studio two rolls of black-and-white film showing her face. **********What followed were four modeling sessions held intermittently over three years, during which she was extensively sketched and videotaped. At one point, 15 animators surrounded her and sketched her face from a variety of angles. **********Mr. Keane, the film's supervising animator, acknowledged that Ms. Taylor was one of the first faces that inspired the animated character. But, he said, \"I find inspiration where I can.\" **********Mr. Keane said many other young women had inspired Pocahontas, including Jamie Pillow from the Pasadena Art Center; Natalie Belcon, a black woman whom Mr. Keane's son met at a martial arts class, and Charmaine Craig, an American Indian actress who appeared in the film \"White Fang 2.\" **********Mr. Keane acknowledged that these other women had been used for \"live-action reference\" -- in other words, for Pocahontas's body when she was shown running, jumping and walking -- and only partly for the character's face. **********Despite her disappointment over the lack of recognition, Ms. Taylor, who works as a cashier in a clothing store in a local mall near her college, gets a kick out of seeing so much Pocahontas paraphernalia around Southern California. **********She is even considering buying a T-shirt with a big Pocahontas face on it, but not just yet. \"Maybe when I'm in a really goofy mood,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/business/time-warner-gets-preview-of-cnn-s-future.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner Gets Preview Of CNN's Future", "print_headline": "Time Warner Gets Preview Of CNN's Future", "body_text": " **********Last Wednesday, in the midst of his protracted negotiations with Ted Turner, Gerald M. Levin took time out for a tour of Cable News Network's sprawling newsroom in Atlanta. Mr. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., greeted some of CNN's senior news producers and lingered at a presentation of the network's fledgling interactive ventures. **********With Time Warner seemingly on the verge of clinching a deal to acquire CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., for about $8 billion, Mr. Levin's visit to the CNN newsroom was fraught with meaning. **********Executives at Time Warner and Turner said Mr. Levin was determined to give the 24-hour news network a central role in what would be the world's largest entertainment company. **********Editors at CNN and Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner, held a series of meetings last week to begin hatching ideas for editorial services that bridge print and electronic media: TV shows based on magazines like Time and People; on-line services that use CNN's news feed; even a sports cable network drawing on the resources of Sports Illustrated. **********\"When you add the editorial clout of Time and Fortune to the worldwide distribution of CNN, you've got a substantial powerhouse,\" said Porter Bibb, a media-industry banker at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. **********But CNN and Time reporters would do well to ask some follow-up questions: How will Turner's scrappy news operation fit with Time Warner's more stolid magazines? Will CNN be able to turbocharge Time's halting efforts to break into electronic media? Will Time bring some editorial sophistication to CNN's rip-and-read style? **********The editor in chief of Time Inc., Norman Pearlstine, and the president of CNN, Tom Johnson, both declined to comment on any plans before a deal is announced. But Mr. Pearlstine and two other Time Inc. executives, Walter Isaacson and Paul Sagan, met with Mr. Johnson in Atlanta a week ago to discuss potential synergies. **********At this point in the talks, Mr. Turner, chairman and president of Turner Broadcasting, would continue to run CNN and the network would remain in Atlanta. But longer term, said people inside the companies, Mr. Turner and Mr. Levin may merge the news operations. At a minimum, the news bureaus of CNN and Time Inc. would share office space. **********Turner Broadcasting does not stand to gain huge savings by merging CNN with Time Inc., as it would if it merged the network with CBS News or NBC News. But one senior Turner executive said there could be \"very substantive cooperation\" between CNN and Time Inc. **********Still, no company has ever tried to integrate print and TV news organizations of this size. CNN has 2,500 editorial employees, 30 news bureaus around the world and $600 million in annual revenue. Time Inc. publishes 24 magazines and has $3.4 billion in revenue. **********Even on a smaller scale, some media experts said, print and electronic news operations do not easily mesh. Reese Schonfeld, a veteran cable-television executive who was the first president of CNN, said the network might be able to draw on Time's magazines for help in soft news areas like fashion. But Mr. Schonfeld predicted that the collaboration would not go beyond that. **********\"There's just too much competition,\" said Mr. Schonfeld, who began his career in the 1940's at United Press when the wire service was trying unsuccessfully to break into electronic media through a venture with Movietone, the newsreel producer owned by 20th Century Fox. **********One area where Time Inc. and CNN plan to cooperate is in financial news. CNN is starting a business news channel, CNN Financial News, or CNNFN, next January. And executives at CNN said Fortune and Money magazines would be tremendous resources for the fledgling network: Through Fortune, CNNFN would gain access to top corporate executives; drawing on Money, it would be able to offer personal finance news to compete with NBC's business cable network, CNBC. **********Multimedia is another area of potential collaboration. CNN is already testing an interactive service on Time Warner's full-service cable network in Orlando, Fla. The network will probably also have a presence on Pathfinder, Time Warner's site on the World Wide Web, an area of the Internet where text, graphics, sound and video are blended. **********CNN has its own on-line service and a venture with the Intel Corporation to deliver news programming to desktop computers. But some media experts said that the venture had a slow start. If a deal is reached, the service, CNN at Work, could add material from Fortune. **********Conversely, some executives said CNN could help Time Inc. expand its magazines into television formats -- an area where the company has met with scant success. Although Time Warner's cable division started a successful 24-hour news service, New York One, the magazine division has had a surprisingly low profile on the channel. **********\"They have such a strong editorial core that it's almost shocking that Time has not elevated them into electronic media,\" Mr. Bibb said. **********But if Time Inc. has been slow to break into television journalism, its magazines have mastered the craft of analytical and investigative journalism. Some media experts said CNN could use that expertise. **********\"We still do primarily breaking news,\" said a Turner executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I think that has been a valid criticism of CNN, in comparison to newspapers and magazines.\" **********Mr. Bibb also said CNN could benefit from editorial executives like Mr. Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, and Mr. Isaacson, a former senior editor of Time magazine who now heads the new-media efforts of the magazine division. **********\"Lou Dobbs and Ed Turner are running that shop themselves,\" said Mr. Bibb, referring to Mr. Dobbs, an executive vice president of CNN and anchor of its daily business news program, and Mr. Turner, an executive vice president and news director of the network. **********Indeed, some CNN executives said they were worried that Time Inc. would end up dominating the network. Mr. Pearlstine has close ties to Mr. Levin. Before joining Time Warner, he briefly ran a venture firm that experimented with delivering print media in new ways. **********Time is not about to move CNN to New York. \"It would be nuts to take a low-cost, efficient news operation and move it into the Time-Life Building,\" said a senior Time Inc. executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********Yet some media experts said CNN could use an injection of new editorial blood, even if its center of gravity shifts to New York. Mr. Schonberg said CNN would thrive as part of a broader media empire because the network had grown far beyond its Atlanta roots. **********\"To the extent that the focus shifts from Atlanta to New York, that's for the good,\" Mr. Schonfeld said. \"You wouldn't publish the International Herald Tribune in Lyons; you'd publish it in Paris.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/world/rival-claims-to-island-chain-bring-edginess-to-asia-s-rim.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1995-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rival Claims to Island Chain Bring Edginess to Asia's Rim", "print_headline": "Rival Claims to Island Chain Bring Edginess to Asia's Rim", "body_text": " **********China and its Southeast Asian neighbors say they are eager to avoid a military clash over a chain of potentially oil-rich islands in the South China Sea, but their recent actions suggest that they may be girding for a fight. **********The dispute over the Spratly Islands grew more serious last week when the Philippines announced that it had torn down or blown up Chinese territorial markers on several of the islands and seized four Chinese trawlers.

All but Brunei have put garrisons on islands they claim. **********Diplomats have been haggling for years over the sovereignty of the islands, which are valuable not only because of the possibility of large oil reserves but also because they are scattered across vital sea lanes. **********American and Philippine officials say the United States, concerned over the growing tensions in the South China Sea and the possibility of a military clash, agreed on Monday to raise the issue with Beijing in hopes of a peaceful settlement of sovereignty claims for the Spratlys. **********While American diplomats here would not comment publicly on the issue, the Philippine Foreign Minister, Roberto Romulo, said Monday that he had been told by senior American officials that the United States \"views these developments with a great deal of concern.\" **********The Chinese threat to the Spratlys was contained for decades by the presence of the United States Navy. But after the Americans left their base in Subic Bay in the Philippines in 1992, the American security umbrella has mostly disappeared. **********Southeast Asian leaders have long worried that China would someday use the Spratlys as a means to assert control over the entire South China Sea -- turning it, as Asian diplomats often say, into a \"Chinese lake.\" **********Those worries turned into alarm in February, when the Philippines announced that the Chinese had built a military-style structure atop a reef in the Spratlys also claimed by the Philippines. The contested land, Mischief Reef, is about 135 miles west of the Philippine island of Palawan. **********The Philippines responded by dispatching warships and by destroying Chinese markers and metal structures built on four nearby shoals. **********Manila has turned aside Beijing's demand for the freedom of the 62 Chinese fishermen who were aboard the five boats seized last month. The Philippines said investigators had found 80 endangered sea turtles and hundreds of sticks of dynamite in the holds of the boats. **********The Chinese have insisted that the structures on Mischief Reef were intended as a shelter for Chinese fishing vessels. The assertion was brought into question, however, when reporters recently flew over the reef and found that the structures included a satellite dish and other telecommunications gear, and that the reef was being guarded by at least one Chinese military ship. **********The Chinese and the Filipinos are not the only ones willing to use force to defend their claims to the Spratlys. On Sunday, Vietnam asserted that Taiwanese troops stationed on Taiping, the largest of the Spratlys, had fired on Vietnamese transport ships passing nearby. **********The Taiwanese Foreign Ministry said it would investigate the incident, but added in a statement that \"it is within the sovereignty right of our Government to have activities and disperse boats from other countries in the area.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/world/dutch-hold-serb-war-crime-documents.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dutch Hold Serb War Crime Documents", "print_headline": "Dutch Hold Serb War Crime Documents", "body_text": " **********Contrary to its earlier statements, the Dutch Interior Ministry is in possession of original documents provided by a Serbian defector that could, if genuine, implicate the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, in war crimes in Bosnia. **********A spokesman for the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague said today that its chief prosecutor, Judge Richard Goldstone, had been informed recently that the Dutch ministry had not, as it earlier asserted, handed back the documents to the defector, Cedomir Mihailovic. **********\"Judge Goldstone is extremely troubled by this development, which could have negative repercussions for the United Nations tribunal, and will hold a meeting with a top Dutch official tomorrow to seek an explanation,\" said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********An article in The New York Times last month described how Mr. Mihailovic fled from Serbia last October and provided what he said were top-secret documents from the Serbian security services to the tribunal. **********The documents, from the Interior Ministry in Belgrade, contain instructions on the running of Serbian concentration camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina and incriminating orders to the Serbian paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan.

Travelers plans to merge the Aetna businesses with its own property and liability insurance units and create a new company which will sell stock to the public next year. **********Travelers executives expect to eliminate about $300 million of costs and about 3,300 jobs from the combined divisions in the next two years. **********The deal is a milestone for the Hartford-based companies, which started the 1980's as two of the country's best known and strongest insurers. But bad real estate investments, a surge in environmental cleanup claims from corporate customers and chronic problems in controlling expenses led the companies to look outside themselves for help. **********Travelers, which had more severe financial problems than Aetna did, turned to Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street entrepreneur. Mr. Weill bought the company in  1993 for about $3.5 billion in stock of the Primerica Corporation and subsequently changed the combined company's name to Travelers. **********Aetna, after years of mixed success from shrinking its property and liability businesses and trying to cut costs, turned earlier this year to Richard Huber, a former banker, to develop and execute a strategic plan. **********The new company will operate initially under both the Aetna and Travelers names, Mr. Weill, the Travelers chief executive, said, and could earn $1 billion after taxes in three years. This year, the Travelers property and liability businesses are expected to earn about $400 million, while those of Aetna are expected to lose $120 million. The loss is mostly attributable to a $750 million increase in Aetna's reserves to cover claims from corporate policy-holders now calling on those policies to pay for environmental clean-ups. **********Because the purchase does not require issuing any new Travelers shares, and because Travelers executives have a strong record in merging operations, the company won the approval of traders yesterday. Travelers shares rose $3.75, to $58.875, an all-time high close. **********Aetna's stock, though, fell $3.875 a share, to $72, amid concerns that Aetna's per-share earnings would decline because of the sale. Investors were also uncertain about when and how effectively Aetna would spend its cash hoard to buy companies in its remaining businesses of health care and life insurance. **********\"There is already a lot of speculation about what other managed health care companies Aetna might want,\" Margo Vignola, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. She noted that Pacificare Health Systems of Cypress, Calif., United States Healthcare Inc. of Blue Bell, Pa., and Humana Inc. of Louisville,  Ky., had been mentioned as possible targets, because they are \"good-sized, growing and have a major presence in their regional markets.\" **********Ronald Compton, Aetna's chairman, said the $4 billion would be used to acquire companies with proven management, with a capacity to grow faster than they have been and with strength in markets where Aetna is relatively weak. \"We  are a growth stock now,\" he said. **********Travelers will pay Aetna from a variety of sources, including sales of preferred stock, bonds and, eventually, a public stock offering in the new company. Travelers will also contribute $1.1 billion of capital to the new company, roughly covering an increase of more than $1 billion in reserves needed to pay asbestos and other claims. **********Earlier this year, Travelers collected $830 million from the sale of its health care business. Travelers is also close to selling its RCM Capital subsidiary, a San Francisco money management firm with $25 billion of assets, to Dresdner Bank. **********Travelers plans to sell about 18 percent of the new company to outside investors -- including Aetna, which promised to buy $200 million of stock. But Mr. Weill took exception to speculation that Travelers would leave the business  once the deal was completed and it could sell at a high price. **********\"We are buying Aetna to enter the business, not to leave it,\" Mr. Weill said. He added that the merging of the two businesses might not be as daunting as it sounded, since both companies had plans to reduce expenses in 1996, and the $300 million of expense cuts amount to only 15 percent of their combined $2 billion of fixed expenses. About half the job cuts are expected in Hartford, where the new company will be based. **********Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a group  financed by insurers, said that mergers of competing companies might be the most attractive way to expand, \"since this is an industry that grows only at about the same rate as the economy.\" **********With too many companies chasing too few customers, Mr. Mooney said, property  and liability insurers have had difficulty raising prices and their profits have tended to be lower than other companies their size. **********Even so, he noted that the industry attracted financiers who envisioned big,  Warren Buffett-style profits from managing the companies' stock and bond investments. **********Maintaining income from premiums is a chronic problem for insurers, since whenever their premiums get high enough to produce large profits, they often lose large corporate customers that opt to insure themselves. Often, high insurance premiums also attract new specialized companies created to service niche markets -- as with catastrophe insurance after Hurricane Andrew in 1994. **********\"This should be a fabulous investment for Travelers,\" said Robert A. Spass, managing partner of Insurance Partners, an investment group in New York. \"There  will basically be one less competitor,\" he said. Weaker companies like Aetna; Continental Insurance, which merged earlier this year with the CNA Financial Corporation, and Home Insurance, which was bought by the Zurich Insurance Company, he noted, had been criticized for keeping prices low just to hold customers. **********Mr. Spass said the industry was likely to see more mergers or acquisitions. The Talegen insurance unit of the Xerox Corporation has been for sale for two years, he noted, and the Cigna Corporation's plan to divide its property and liability businesses into two parts -- one selling new policies and the other devoted only to paying claims of old policies -- was a prelude to a sale or merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/business/how-to-succeed-go-to-wellesley.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Dobrzynski", "pub_date": "1995-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "How to Succeed?

It's hard to think of one without the other. Here's a new link in the business landscape. Henceforth, when you hear Wellesley, Mass., the home of Wellesley College, think of top-level executive women. **********More than any other college -- large or small -- Wellesley has groomed women  who shatter the glass ceiling. Wellesley women take up far more seats in executive suites and corporate boardrooms than their numbers suggest they should have. They are overrepresented, too, at places like the Harvard business school, a fountainhead for occupants of the nation's corner offices. **********To cite just a few of Wellesley's major achievers, there's Lois D. Juliber,  '71, president of Colgate North America; Ellen R. Marram, '68, president of the  Seagram Beverage Group; Shirley Young, '55, a vice president of General Motors,  and Marion O. Sandler, '52, co-chief executive of Golden West Financial, a large savings and loan association. **********Influencing business policy, there is Alicia Munnell, '64, a top Treasury Department official recently nominated to the Council of Economic Advisers. And  of course there's Hillary Rodham Clinton, '69, the once and future corporate lawyer and director. **********Just how does Wellesley, a school of only 2,200 students, do it? **********This good fortune certainly wasn't planned, college officials said. Wellesley's outstanding record stems from -- in addition to bright students -- a strong, popular economics department; a dynamic professor, Carolyn Shaw Bell, who taught at the college from 1950 to 1989; and programs that encourage networking among alumnae and between alumnae and students, people said. Wellesley, in fact, could be an inspiration to other colleges that want to help  their graduates go where few women have gone before, into the business world's upper echelons. **********Evidence for the Wellesley edge abounds, starting with the number of companies that look to Wellesley for executive women. In 1994, 75 companies recruited at its leafy campus west of Boston, far exceeding the number at similar-sized elite colleges like Smith and Amherst. **********Some executive recruiters say they sense that Wellesley women know how to really succeed in business. \"I have always felt this was true, and I've always said I want my two daughters to go to Wellesley,\" said Julie Daum of Spencer Stuart, a big search firm. **********Several studies lend credence to a \"Wellesley factor.\" When Business Week magazine named the \"50 Top Women in Business\" in 1992, four went to the school.  Only one other college claimed more than one spot on the roster -- the University of Wisconsin, which matched Wellesley's four but which also has six and a half times as many women students. **********Of the 390 women who serve as directors of the Fortune 500 companies, at least 17 went to Wellesley -- more than any other college -- according to Catalyst, a women's advocacy group (headed, it happens, by a Wellesley graduate, Sheila Wellington). **********And Carol A. Scott found evidence in her 1992 survey of America's senior executive women. Asked by The New York Times to look at the colleges attended by those women, she found 8 Wellesley graduates among the 439 respondents. That is  64 times Wellesley's share of the female college population and more than any other college except the University of California at Berkeley (with 9, but also  five times as many women students). **********\"I thought you were out of your mind when you called, but I see that there's  something to it,\" said Ms. Scott, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles's Graduate School of Management. **********And don't forget Wellesley's position as a dominant supplier of women to the  Harvard business school. In 1975, for example, Wellesley sent more women to the  Harvard business school than any other college. Twenty years later, Wellesley graduates still made up the biggest contingent from any women's college, though  by then Harvard and Dartmouth were sending a few more proportionately. **********Success, of course, breeds success. \"There's a self-reinforcing mechanism at  work in terms of student selection and faculty recruitment,\" explained Victor Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University who wrote \"Women's Quest for Economic Equality.\" **********Indeed, many Wellesley women are now feeding into the pipeline that leads up  to the executive office. All told, about a third of Wellesley's graduates go into the business world, more than any other career. **********As an all-female school, Wellesley starts with an edge. Numerous studies show that graduates of women's colleges, compared with women graduates of coeducational institutions, develop higher levels of self-esteem and do better in their careers. **********But when it comes to business, Wellesley still outdoes its rivals -- a thought that raises hackles among some of them. \"When you look around at the Seven Sisters, I think you'll find similar results,\" said Barbara Reinhold, director of the career development office at Smith. **********True, of those elite traditionally women's colleges, Vassar can claim Geraldine Laybourne, president of the Nickelodeon network, while Smith can boast of Rochelle B. Lazarus, president of Ogilvy & Mather North America, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the White House's National Economic Council. Columbia's Barnard College has Phyllis Grann, chief executive of the Putnam Publishing Group. And Radcliffe College at Harvard has Joan T. Bok, chairman of  the New England Electric System, and Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures. **********YET none of these colleges -- nor any other college or university -- has produced proportionately as many corporate women in high positions as Wellesley. Neither Smith nor Barnard nor Radcliffe produced a list that matched Wellesley's. **********Vassar conceded the point. \"Recruiters do say that Wellesley students are very business-oriented,\" said Clare D. Graham, director of career development. \"Our alums have tended to have a focus in communications and the arts.\" **********Wellesley's president, Diana Walsh, cannot explain precisely how Wellesley came to produce graduates who ascend to jobs like senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Margaret Yeo, '64) and executive vice president of Bloomingdale's (Christine Miller, '66). **********Ms. Walsh cited the school's past as the key ingredient. \"Wellesley has a history of women's rights, a culture of women struggling to succeed in a man's world,\" she said. **********Many graduates agreed that Wellesley's culture influenced them mightily. Many also credited the grounding they got at Wellesley's economics department, which  was recently ranked No. 2 (according to the traditional standard, published citations of its members' academic work), behind Williams, among the liberal arts colleges in a study by Michael Robinson of Mount Holyoke College. Ms. Bell  has retired, but the department still has widely respected teachers like Marshall Goldman. **********Uncommonly for a women's school, economics is usually Wellesley's most popular major, or at least second. And that is a longstanding phenomenon, not a  product of the go-go 1980's, which lured many bright students into business. **********More important, \"Wellesley has Carolyn Bell, who within the school set a model,\" said Margaret Hennig, dean of the Simmons Graduate School of Business. \"She made it legitimate even during the antibusiness period, the hippie period,  for Wellesley women to get involved with economics and business. She obviously influenced enormous numbers of women.\" **********And they agree. Ms. Marram, of Seagram, remembered the first meeting, in 1989, of Wellesley's Business Leadership Council, a group of 93 high-powered alumnae. \"A bunch of us sat around after dinner, and soon we were all talking about Carolyn Bell,\" she said. \"She was a fierce promoter of Wellesley economics graduates. She used to tell us that we should brag, that we should let people know what we can do.\" **********To that, Ms. Bell, a graduate of Mount Holyoke who at 75 still writes a monthly column for The Boston Globe, pleads guilty. But she says she \"never pushed any particular field for people.\" **********\"It was a personal value that any woman should be able to support herself and her children, whether or not she has to,\" Ms. Bell said. \"Wellesley produced women who were responsible for themselves, and that may have helped.\" **********Whatever it was, it worked. Marsha Williams, for example, was majoring in archeology until she ran into Ms. Bell. \"She made economics come alive,\" said Ms. Williams, now treasurer of the Amoco Corporation. \"It made me not be afraid  of being unable to hold my own in a business setting.\" **********Wellesley also tries to expose students to the business world. Ten years ago, it started a program called \"Wall Street Warm-Up.\" It takes 20 to 30 students a  year to Manhattan, stationing each with a Wellesley graduate in a brokerage or investment bank. **********Whether it is for their first job or years later, Wellesley graduates use these contacts. Some networking is formal, through the Business Leadership Council, which began as a forum for busy graduates to help the school, but quickly became a place where members compared notes about work. **********BUT much more of this power-networking is informal, a matter of keeping in touch by women like Adele Morrissette, '77, a director at Cowen & Company, a Manhattan investment bank. She is not a member of the leadership council. Nor did she go to Wellesley with a business career in mind. By the time she was a junior or senior, however, \"I knew there were a lot of Wellesley women in business and that they were breaking barriers,\" she said. **********When it came time to look for a job, Ms. Morrissette met Donna Ecton, '69, now chief executive of Business Mail Express Inc., who was recruiting for the Chemical Bank. \"She really championed me,\" said Ms. Morrissette, who took the job, then got an M.B.A. \"I would not be a Wall Street investment banker, were it not for her.\" **********Ms. Morrissette keeps up with several Wellesley women, calling on a former client, Robin Smith, '61, the president of Publishers Clearing House, as a mentor; trading information with an alumna employed by a venture capital firm, and steering Cowen to a search firm run by Patricia Morrill, a Wellesley graduate. **********This kind of mutual support happens all the time. Ms. Juliber, for example, joined the board of the State Street Boston Corporation after Nannerl O. Keohane, a former Wellesley president who is now president of Duke University and a member of both the leadership council and State Street's board, recommended her. **********No wonder, then, that Wellesley graduates keep turning up in corporate circles. And because few colleges have picked up on Wellesley's bottom-line success -- only a couple, like Simmons College, have started groups for alumnae  in business -- Wellesley may well remain a mother lode of executive women for a  while to come."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/27/world/world-news-briefs-us-signal-to-haiti-election-must-be-held.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;U.S. Signal to Haiti: Election Must Be Held", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;U.S. Signal to Haiti: Election Must Be Held", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration signaled strongly today that it expects Haiti to hold presidential elections as scheduled next month and President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to step down in February. **********\"We expect him to leave,\" the White House national security adviser, Anthony  Lake, said today after President Aristide suggested last week that he would consider the requests of his followers to stay in power for another term. **********Mr. Lake, appearing on ABC's \"This Week With David Brinkley,\" said President Aristide \"is in a difficult position here because clearly he is still the most popular politician in Haiti and a lot of Haitians don't want him to leave.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/your-money/IHT-dividends-ascending-for-many-uk-companies.html": {"writer_name": "Christine Stopp", "pub_date": "1995-04-01", "snippet": "After three years in the doldrums it seems that British dividends the UK dividend record may be turning the corner..Peter Edwards, a partner in Premier, a Bristol unit trust broker, has shown in his annual unit trust income survey that 49 percento...", "word_count": 6179, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividends Ascending for Many U.K. Companies", "print_headline": "Dividends Ascending for Many U.K. Companies", "body_text": " **********After three years in the doldrums it seems that British dividends the UK dividend record may be turning the corner. **********Peter Edwards, a partner in Premier, a Bristol unit trust broker, has shown in his annual unit trust income survey that 49 percentof funds cut dividends in 1994, compared to 55 percent in 1993, 52 percent in 1992 and 20 percent in 1991.Mr. Edwards believes the percentage has peaked and is on its way down again. **********, and now may be the start of another good period for equity income funds. **********Total returns in the British equity income unit trust sector fell during the year ended Feb. 28, were depressing over one year to the start of this month, with an average loss of just under 15 percent. Despite this, the case for the long-term performance of such funds compared to bonds and to inflation is impressive.The graph shows how total returns on British equities, with gross income reinvested, have performed since >f 20<>f 19<>f 18<1918 >res<compared to government securities, or gilts.A lump sum of \u00a3100 invested in December 1918 in equities would have grown to \u00a327,291 in real terms by the end of 1994 compared to a sorry \u00a3379 if invested in gilts. **********Aside from the yield incentive, British equity income funds also have a steady capital growth record, with the best funds up by well over 50 percent in three years with gross income reinvested.In this respect, onshore funds have a better record than offshore.The offshore equity sector had an average return of \u00a3124.54 for each \u00a3100 invested over three years. with only three funds offering a total return of more than 50 percent over the period.Most funds in the offshore sector have a zero yield. **********Premier's unit trust survey compares income and capital growth across a range of unit trusts.Of the unit trusts shown in our table, all except M&G Equity Income are included in the Premier \"white list\" of funds, which averaged income growth of 22 percent and capital growth of 56 percent over five years. **********Mr. Edwards emphasizes the wide variation in performance in the sector: his \"Black List\" funds averaged minus 20 percent growth of income and only 10 percent capital growth in five years.There are some big names included in his Black List catalogue of horrors, including one fund from Save & Prosper one from Gartmore and two from Fidelity. **********If one can avoid the poor performers, the climate at present seems promising for the equity income funds. **********Michael Hughes, Head of Global Strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is forecasting British dividend growth of 10 percent for 1995 and 7 percent for 1996 against a likely inflationary background of less than 4 percent.He expects real dividend growth to be higher than the expected growth of theeconomy. **********\"Dividends have been one of the surprises of the company reporting season to date,\" he said.\"Companies are in a generous mood.\" **********While the dividend percentage of total return has played second fiddle to capital growth over the last 10 to 15 years, it is now proportionately more important, and should continue to be so for a while, Mr. Hughes expects. **********Neil Woodford, senior investment manager at??????Perpetual, also thinks dividend growth will exceed earnings growth for the immediate future. **********He has seen a change in dividend culture in recent years. \"In previous cycles at this stage corporate activity was booming, sometimes with takeovers and mergers that made little sense. Now\"Shareholders have exerted more discipline,\" he said. \"Companies are more attuned to returning value to shareholders.\" **********What has been the deciding factor in making Perpetual Income fund perform? Mr. Woodford cites stock selection and an effective but flexible approach to strategy. The fund, he says, had been well positioned in capital goods and smaller companies prior to Britain's exit from the ERM, but started moving away from that stance at the end of 1993 towards a more defensive portfolio with the emphasis on blue chips, especially consumer goods and financials. The main weighting now is on financials, though pharmaceuticals have also played a useful part. \"We read the macro trends well,\" says Mr. Woodford. **********Among the companies that have performed well for Perpetual Income Fund, Mr. Woodford said, are SmithKline Beecham, Tesco and Barclays Bank. None of these have been \"traditional income\" stocks, with the first two now both offering low yields and a recent dividend cut from Barclays. **********Michael Hughes agrees that the best dividend performance may come from companies that have not been among the highest yielders to date. He thinks there could be a general bias towards food companies. He expects price increases among diversified industrials, food and textile companies during the year. **********Utilities, a traditional staple for income seekers, are suffering a degree of sensitivity at the moment, due to adverse publicity from the electricity ombudsman's decision to impose price controls and general criticism of the level of profits being made by former state-owned industries. **********Mr. Edwards, who has been tracking income funds for 19 years through the Premier survey, is persuaded of their virtues. **********\"They are not boring at all,\" he said, \"and should be considered actively by anyone who just wants to make money.\" **********Herecommends British onshore funds for expatriates because of what he perceives to be their superior performance. Many expatriates resist the idea of a British unit trust for tax reasons. Mr. Edwards regards this as letting the tax tail wag the investment dog. There is no tax disadvantage with a British fund on the capital gains tax side, and a non-British taxpayer can claim income tax deducted. **********Premier's view is that it is worth the inconvenience in order to capture a performance fillip, though investors should remember that \"there are the good, the bad and the ugly in this area.\" Not all those companies \"selling funds in the Gulf to people in air-conditioned rooms\" are at the most successful end of the equity income story."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/30/business/business-digest-099325.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 495, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Mexicans Reach New Pact On Wages and Prices The Mexican Government signed a new agreement with labor and business intended to control prices, limit salaries and cut public spending, in an attempt to restore stability and economic growth.

About 33 percent of the accidents occur at the weekend when people return home from discos, the study found. Since the beginning of the year, 7,406 people have died in traffic accidents. **********Eduardo Duhalde, Governor of Buenos Aires Province, recently announced that he intends to sign a decree requiring discos, bars and cafes to close at 4 A.M.  The Governor said that the measure was intended to create \"a certain order that  society needs\" and to \"encourage families to spend more time together.\" **********Mr. Duhalde, an old-line Peronist who is a considered a possible successor to President Carlos Saul Menem, is well known for his aggressive stance against drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. He has said that the measure is necessary to reduce the large number of minors who roam the streets and frequent bars and  discos in the early morning. **********\"We should have done this a long time ago,\" he told local reporters recently. \"We are behind the times. In no country of the first world does this type of activity exist.\" **********But the proposed crackdown has generated a storm of protest, especially from  entertainers, disco and restaurant owners, and opposition political leaders, who have assailed it as a political ploy and a violation of freedom. **********\"This is just Duhalde's way of positioning himself for the next elections --  he has political interests in mind,\" said Federico Bergalli, a manager at El Cielo disco. \"In fact, he doesn't give a hoot about the whole thing. It's only demagogy.\" **********Three of Argentina's best-known musicians, Charly Garcia, Claudio Gabis and Alejandro Medina, recently joined politicians from the center-left Frepaso party at The Roxy disco to protest the proposed restriction. **********\"It is not a function of the state to impose a paternalistic and abusive mode of living,\" the group said in a statement. \"We will fight this false paternalism with vigilant opposition throughout the city.\" **********Protesting may do little good. Mr. Duhalde can issue the decree without the approval of the provincial legislature. It would apply to all cities in the province except the capital, which is controlled by a municipal legislature. But Mayor Jorge Dominguez has publicly assured Mr. Duhalde that he will work to persuade the municipal legislature to go along with the early closings. **********Ruben Miguel Citara, the province's Minister of Government and Mr. Duhalde's  chief lieutenant, said in an interview that his government hoped to have a uniform closing time for all cities in the province, including the capital, within six months. In addition, Mr. Citara said that the provincial government would propose a law under which establishments that serve alcohol to minors could be fined $50,000 or shut down. The legal drinking age is 18, but violators are seldom punished. **********\"We are not trying to limit people's right to enjoy the night,\" Mr. Citara said. \"We are trying to protect minors and reduce abuses. People need a lot of stimulants like drugs and alcohol to maintain this type of life style.\" **********In the early morning, minors and adults can be found drinking and abusing drugs in many discos throughout the city and province, even though many dance clubs have held special non-alcohol sessions for minors between 10 P.M. and midnight. **********The Argentine custom of going out for the night at 2 or 3 A.M. began only about 15 years ago with the decline of the military dictatorship and advent of disco culture. In fact, the military Government imposed a 4 A.M. closing for discos and restaurants in the capital in 1980, but it has not been enforced for  more than a decade. **********Jorge Arlan, 30, a taxi driver who kicked up his heels at El Living disco, called Mr. Duhalde a \"fascist\" and said that the early closing of discos would be difficult to enforce. **********Mr. Citara said that the province planned to compile a list of \"late night\" establishments that would be given to the federal police, who have promised to enforce the decree. **********While some parents agreed that it was time to bring control to the night, others criticized the proposal, saying it would restrict their own freedom to go out when they please. **********\"I think the real issue is that parents have to be responsible for their own  children,\" said Juanita Avila, 47, a nurse. \"You cannot legislate family values. Just because you shut down discos early doesn't mean that kids are going to spend more time at home with their parents.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/04/world/world-news-briefs-8th-argentine-arrested-in-jewish-center-bombing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 164, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;8th Argentine Arrested In Jewish Center Bombing", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;8th Argentine Arrested In Jewish Center Bombing", "body_text": " **********An eighth army officer was arrested today in connection with the car bombing  last year of a Jewish cultural center, the main prosecutor in the case said. **********The arrest of Sgt.

The plane, on a flight from Miami, hit a mountain during a nighttime approach through a valley to the southern Colombian city of Cali on Dec. 20. **********In an unusually swift and frank admission, American Airlines issued this statement from its chief pilot, Capt. C. D. Ewell: **********\"We've always taken great pride in the vigor of our training and the excellence of our flight disciplines, and we are saddened that human error on the part of our people may have contributed to the accident.\" **********\"The accident reminds us that aviation, while not inherently dangerous, is terribly unforgiving of any inattention to detail.\" **********While Colombian and American officials were guarded in their official comments, the information they released today and unofficial comments by some people familiar with the case left little doubt that investigators believe that  the pilots had made a series of fatally careless mistakes as they approached Cali on a clear night with a planeload of people flying home for Christmas. **********In Washington, a Transportation Department official said the initial findings pointed \"almost without a doubt\" to pilot error. The official, interviewed by telephone on condition that he not be identified, said Transportation Secretary  Federico Pena had expressed \"deep concern\" over the findings. **********A statement issued by the Colombian authorities described some of the apparent navigational errors, based on recordings of cockpit conversations and of readings from navigational instruments from the final 30 minutes of the flight. The recordings show that the crew was asked to report to the airport's traffic controllers as they crossed over a locational beacon about 40 miles north of the airport. **********But, the statement said, the pilots mistakenly passed beyond that spot when they programmed their navigational computers to fly toward it. **********Apparently confused, the pilots steered the plane to the left, toward the mountains, and then to the right, but too late to avoid disaster. **********The recordings showed that warning alarms sounded in the cabin nine seconds before the crash. An electronic voice warning \"pull up\" could be heard on the cockpit recorder. The pilots were pulling up the plane's nose and adding power when the plane hit the mountain. **********\"The data indicate that the crew began a recovery maneuver to avoid ground impact with increased engine potency two seconds after the alarm was activated,\" Capt. Rodrigo Barrera, the chief investigator for the Colombian Civil Aviation Administration, said at a news conference in Bogota today. **********The plane missed clearing the mountaintop by about 200 feet. **********\"We do not have the official cause of the accident,\" Captain Barrera said. \"This is a preliminary reading of information that was analyzed in Washington.\" **********The airline said that the pilot was Nicholas Tafuri, 57, of Marco Island, Fla., and that the co-pilot was Don Williams, 39, of New Smyrna Beach, Fla. Both pilots had thousands of hours of flying time and clean records, the airline said. **********Officials believe that 164 people were on board, including the crew, but the  complete list of passengers has not yet been established. Some passengers who were scheduled to board the plane did not do so, while others got on the flight  at the last minute. Four people survived the crash. **********Many of those on board were naturalized Americans living in the New York area and were planning to spend Christmas with their Colombian families. **********The data comes from a flight data recorder, which provides a record of changes in navigation and power settings, and the cabin voice recorder, which details the conversations in the cockpit and with air control officials on the ground. Both systems were scrutinized over the weekend. **********Aviation officials here and in Washington said the preliminary findings were  in no way conclusive. But several said the information analyzed suggested that the crash was a result of an operational error. \"This could mean either a human  error, a mistake in the navigational procedures or a mistake in airline procedures,\" said Col. Jorge Parga, deputy technical director of the Civil Aviation Administration. **********Captain Barrera said there was no indication that the two pilots on the plane had conducted an \"approach briefing.\" Colonel Parga explained that before every  landing, the captain is required to hand out instructions to the co-pilot. Airlines typically train pilots to call out lists of procedures well before every landing. **********\"For example,\" Colonel Parga said, \"the plane's speed would have to be discussed, they would have to go over the route they are going to take for landing, how they will position the plane and configurate it, at what time to begin communication with the air control tower, what to do when the runway is visible, and what to do if any problems arise. This is a mandatory procedure.\" **********But it is also possible that the crew went through the required briefings before the 30-minute period analyzed in the tapes. **********According to Captain Barrera, the Cali air control tower had authorized the American Airlines flight to land at the designated runway with \"calm winds.\" The crew responded by repeating the same information the tower had given them. The tower then gave the plane instructions to report in when it crossed over a navigational beacon on the ground.  The crew, again, read back the same instructions. **********A United States official, speaking by telephone on condition that his name not be used, said those findings indicated incorrect cockpit procedures in preparation for landing. \"It is uncommon for a pilot not to follow these procedures,\" he said. **********The official added that the fact that the plane swerved twice meant that it could not find the ground-based navigational beacon at Tulua, at which point the pilots were supposed to radio the control tower. The crew was clearly lost, the  official said. **********American air safety experts noted that about 80 percent of plane accidents are caused by human error. **********The official added that F.A.A. officials were currently involved in discussions with American Airlines and the Allied Pilots Association to determine what measures should be taken to prevent such an accident in the future. **********Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the United States Transportation Department said in a telephone interview from Washington that \"the report raises some serious questions about actions that occurred.\" **********American and Colombian investigators said identifying some passengers had been difficult. Some bodies were strewn about in the crash sites in parts that may belong to those, including three United States citizens, who remain unaccounted for or to some bodies that were identified by their families. \"It is a great confusion,\" an official said. **********The remains of one passenger, Rebecca Taylor, an American citizen who lived in Arkansas and was coming to Colombia to be married, were identified yesterday  by family members."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/world/giuliani-he-wouldn-t-get-castro-s-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Lizette Alvarez", "pub_date": "1995-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Giuliani?

Giuliani.

He wore his recently disclosed wardrobe of international diplomacy -- a starched white shirt, gold cuff links, a red tie and comfortable  shoes. **********The suit and tie, however, were no more than superficial accouterments. As the 69-year-old Mr. Castro tackled the tough questions first, then the more lighthearted, he showed no signs of bending his political will to suit others, defending his rule in Cuba as a form of democracy that enjoys deep public support. **********Replying to a question about Cuba's longstanding policy of imprisoning dissidents, Mr. Castro agreed with estimates by Amnesty International that some  600 Cubans are in prison for political reasons. **********But he quickly defended the policy, saying he was not alone in jailing those  who fight against the state. Mexico does the same, he said, as do Argentina, France, China and a host of other countries. **********Showing a keen knowledge of the United States political landscape, he spoke about Ross Perot and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but saved his most admiring words for President John F. Kennedy. He described Mr. Kennedy as a formidable opponent in the \"positive sense\" because he had the courage to stop the attempted invasion of Cuba at the  Bay of Pigs. \"He is a man for whom I feel respect,\" he said. **********Now, however, it is General Powell who has captured his attention. He said he ordered 46 translators to transcribe the general's recently published autobiography into Spanish, for reading by himself and by senior Cuban officials. His hectic schedule, however, has kept him from any bedtime reading. **********On the economic front, Mr. Castro said Cuba was beginning to make headway, citing an increase in foreign investment and the large number of tourists and foreign entrepreneurs visiting the island. This openness, he said, poses a security risk, but one he is willing to take. **********Emphasizing a recurring theme of his visit, Mr. Castro said he refused to abandon his principles and Cuba's sovereignty by moving toward democracy just to meet conditions set by the United States for lifting its economic embargo. **********\"This is not a business deal,\" he said. \"This is not about bargaining.\" **********Mr. Castro called his trip, his first to New York since 1979, successful, saying he tried to accommodate many of the 200 invitations he received to different functions. He went to a church in Harlem, a banquet hall in the South  Bronx, a media executive's Fifth Avenue apartment and the homes of millionaire business executives. **********He ended the day by meeting for two hours with about 100 religious leaders, overwhelmingly Protestant, at Cuba's United Nations Mission. **********Mr. Castro joked about a trick he played in 1957 on a determined Times reporter, Herbert L. Matthews, in the Sierra Maestra, when his small band of guerrillas had been all but written off by the outside world. \"We tried to give  Matthews the impression that there were more of us,\" Mr. Castro said, recounting how he ordered the same troop of weary soldiers to parade past the reporter again and again. **********Two years after Mr. Matthews interviewed Mr. Castro, his revolutionary movement had grown, and in January 1959 his forces swept into Havana. The visit  by The New York Times to his remote encampment, he said, had been \"really very helpful.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/30/world/rebuilding-yes-but-gi-s-think-too-about-hearts-and-minds.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1995-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rebuilding, Yes, but G.I.'s Think Too About Hearts and Minds", "print_headline": "Rebuilding, Yes, but G.I.'s Think Too About Hearts and Minds", "body_text": " **********Capt.

As a wounded World War II veteran, he commands respect on issues of war and peace in the Senate, where the old-fashioned internationalism that spread from Wall Street Republicans in the late 1930's to Main Street in the 1950's is still alive, and NATO remains a concept of consequence. **********Mr. Dole's influence does not necessarily extend to the House, where the Republicans seem less deeply rooted to the traditional centers of commerce.

There is nothing the President can say that will change my mind.\" **********In between these two views, there are dozens of Republicans and many traditionally dovish Democrats whom the Administration will try to convince over the next couple of weeks. **********Mr. Dole, Mr. Gingrich, and the Democratic leaders, Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, will meet with the President on Tuesday afternoon. A larger meeting will follow, and so will several days of closed briefings and then open hearings on the details of the Balkan agreement and the NATO peacekeeping mission. **********There is neither a requirement nor an expectation of overwhelming Congressional support to send American troops to Bosnia. But then the resolution giving President Bush authority to go to war in the Persian Gulf won by only a 52-to-47 vote in the Senate. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who backed Mr. Bush then and Mr. Clinton now, said today that he would  be quite satisfied to duplicate that margin. **********The President's request is likely to get heavy, though not nearly unanimous,  support from Democrats. The argument today, heard from Representatives Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the senior Democrat on the International Relations Committee, and David E. Bonior of Michigan, the minority whip, was that years of opposition to using troops abroad were irrelevant, because this would be peacemaking, not warmaking. **********Probably two-thirds of the 198 House Democrats will line up behind the President. That would mean that about 100 of the 234 Republicans would be needed to pass a measure supporting the use of troops. **********Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's press secretary, insisted that Republican leaders would not approach the issue as \"a partisan decision, unlike the way the Democratic leadership voted on the Persian Gulf war.\" Democratic Congressional leaders voted against the war. **********But keeping partisanship out will be a heroic task in the environment of mutual denunciation and distrust that the intense budget battle is generating. It is hard to invite international statesmanship from someone you have just called a hard-hearted destroyer of Medicare. **********Which brings the question back to Senator Dole. While it is plain that he disdains many of Mr. Clinton's policies, his sharp tongue avoids insulting the President. **********He has always been cautious about opposing a President on foreign policy. Nearly five years ago, he threw himself behind President Bush's war plans in the Persian Gulf, even though he had warned the President that it might be too soon to fight. **********Tonight he told ABC News, in a friendly but basically noncommittal interview: \"I want to find a way, if it's possible, to support the President. He hasn't made the case yet. He's started.\" **********Mr. Clinton's allies here are counting on that same instinct toward unity in  foreign policy to overcome Mr. Dole's doubts about whether the mission of the American troops is clear enough, whether there is a sound plan for getting them  out, and whether the President has made an effective case to the public about the urgency of the United States' role. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, perhaps Mr. Clinton's most enthusiastic backer on Bosnia, put it hopefully today: \"Bob Dole is the key and  will do the very best thing he can for the Presidency -- not the President, but  the Presidency. He fought in one of those wars.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/25/business/session-is-short-and-quiet-but-treasury-prices-go-up.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 413, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Session Is Short and Quiet, But Treasury Prices Go Up", "print_headline": "Session Is Short and Quiet, But Treasury Prices Go Up", "body_text": " **********Treasury prices ended higher yesterday in a quiet and abbreviated session. **********Without fresh economic data, market participants took their cue from strong buying in Asian and European markets early yesterday before the opening of the New York market.

Israel agreed  to move up the withdrawal date. **********Security for thousands of expected tourists and even more Palestinian visitors is now in the hands of the Palestinian Authority, which is eager to prove it can run the celebrations smoothly and safely. **********\"In Bethlehem we will provide security for all people,\" Hajj Ismail Jaber, the Palestinian police chief in the West Bank, said shortly after his forces took control of the town, which has 40,000 residents. **********Bethlehem has become a predominantly Muslim city in recent decades as Christian Palestinians have left in growing numbers, driven away by unrest, economic hardship and tensions with Muslim neighbors.

Cheers went up as sections of the metal barrier crashed to the ground and were stomped on by jubilant teen-agers. **********\"When I saw the fence come down, I thought: the occupation is gone and the Palestinian state is on the way,\" said Maha Andoni, who came to the square with  her daughter. \"We waited 28 years for this. There's nothing sweeter.\" **********Issa abu Kamel, a quarry worker who arrived with his family, said he had wept as he watched the scene. \"I can't express what I feel inside,\" he said. \"That fence was like a prison for the Palestinian people, and now Bethlehem is free.\" **********As loudspeakers boomed out nationalist music set to a deafening drum-beat, men danced and women clapped. Palestinian officers stood on a truck moving slowly around the square, silhouetted against hundreds of bright Christmas lights. **********Pennants showing a grinning Mr. Arafat flapped next to banners of the Virgin  Mary and the infant Jesus. With his smiling visage on posters everywhere, Mr. Arafat seemed to take on the aura of a kind of Father Christmas, competing with  Santa Claus on Bethlehem's festive streets. **********\"We're breathing fresh air for the first time in 30 years,\" said Kamal Kamel, owner of a macaroni factory, who came to the square with his wife. \"We feel security, peace of mind for the Palestinians.\" **********Security is, in fact, a formidable first challenge facing Palestinian officials, who not only have to protect the expected throngs of Christmas pilgrims but must also secure the visit of Mr. Arafat. **********The Deputy Mayor, Hanna Nasser, said the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 4 had made necessary security measures like metal detectors and searches of visitors to Manger Square. **********During the years of Israeli rule, such checks and the presence of armed soldiers had drawn bitter complaints from Palestinians. Now both sides are consulting on holiday arrangements and will maintain a joint command center. **********For Jewish settlers near Bethlehem, the hand-over of the city to armed Palestinians is cause for a different set of concerns. Shunted by the army to a  newly built bypass road around the town, they complain that the road is unsafe,  and worry that they might be attacked if they use the main highway to Jerusalem, which runs through Bethlehem. **********They find small consolation in the continued presence of Israeli police officers at Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish shrine near Bethlehem that remains under Israeli protection. **********Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition Likud party, warned today that the hand-over of Bethlehem had put Jerusalem in a \"stranglehold.\" But the Mayor, Elias Freij, who is also Minister of Tourism in the Palestinian Authority, said the withdrawal opens a new chapter. **********\"What is past is past,\" he said in an interview. \"We have to look to the future and build peaceful relations with Israel on the basis of mutual interests and recognition of national rights of each other.\" **********Something of the new spirit was evident today in the Israeli departure from Bethlehem.

This cluster of elite bureaucrats controls billions of dollars and can  have a major influence on exchange rates. **********But that pillar has been battered this year. The Japanese banking sector is  in turmoil, and several financial institutions have failed. The Vice Minister of Finance stepped down in May, ahead of schedule, under pressure from the ruling party. And Euromoney magazine has named pana's Masayoshi Takemura as the year's  worst Finance Minister. **********Now the scandal at Dalwa Bank Ltd. has come into play. A former executive of the bank suggested in a newspaper of the bank suggested in a newspaper interview this week that the ministry may have played a role in hiding from American authorities the $1.1 billion in losses that the bank incurred from bond trading  in the United States. **********The uncertainty about the role of the ministry, which denies any wrongdoing, has added to worries about the management of Japan's banking system, which is struggling under the weight of at least $500 billion in bad real estate loans. Moreover, it ahs raised questions about the prospect for greater trust in coordination between Wasdhington and Tokyo on a wide variety of financial matters, ranging from currency rates to international money markets to global liquidity. **********Even if the Finance Ministry had no role in covering up Daiwa's trading loss, some analysts suggest that it did not manage the affair properly. In particular, they not, Japanese authorities did not think it necessary to pass on information immediately about the loss. **********\"They didn't believe this was a big deal and that's the problem,\" said Elizabeth L. Daniels, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Inc. \"It's a disconnect.\" **********\"They think they were doing everybody a big favor,\" she added, because by trying to handle the problem quietly, the ministry might have thought it could avert a crisis. \"It's the Big Daddy approach. In the U.S., what you don't know may hurt you. In Japan, what you don't know won't hurt you.\" **********A decade ago, Japanese banks were the envy of the world. They were able to obtain funds at the lowest cost and were admired because they ignored short-term profits and focused on long-term market share. **********Now the banks are the focus of concern. **********The Finance Ministry is increasingly viewed as having mishandled the nation's banking troubles, much of whic had arisen from the bad real estate loans. And after Daiwa disclosed that it ahd told the ministry on Aug. 8 about a possible big loss - six weeks before the bank notified American authorities - foreign bankers became concerned by the ministry's decision not to pass on the information to American regulators. **********Then, earlier this week, the big Japanese newspaper Asahi Shinbun carried an interview with Hiroyuki Yamaji, a former Daiwa Bank executive who participated in the August meeting with Yoshimasda Nishimura, Japan's top banking official. When told that a rogue bond trader in New York had racked up $1.1 billion in losses during an 11-year period, Mr. Nishimura replied, \"It's bad timing for this affair to surface,\" Mr. Yamaji said in the Asahi interview. **********At the time, Japan had just experienced its first bank run in decades, which culminated int he failure of the Cosmo Credit Union, one of the nation's largest credit institutions. The ministry was also sounding out the unpopular idea of using public funds to help rescue the nation's ailing financial institutions. **********In September, two more financial institutions failed. **********The ministry has denied that Mr. Nishimura made any comment about bad timing. Mr. Yamaji has resigned from Daiwa, and his telephone has apparently been disconnected. He could not be reached for comment. **********In the Asahi interview, Mr. Yamaji said Mr. Nishimura gave no \"specific instructions\" to report more details of the scandal or to report the loss to the Federal Reserve in the United States. Mr. Nishimura seemed to react negatively to the idea of Daiwa's announcing its loss immediately, Mr. Yamaji said. **********Kazuhito Ikeo, a professor finance at Kelo University said: \"Because the ministry and financial institutions are on close terms, the ministry has a tendency to protect its financial institutions against the outside, or to cover  up the ugly aspects to the outside. There are potentially problems that have not been disclosed yet.\" **********That appears to be the worry these days in financial markets, which dealt another blow to Japanese banks this week when some lending institutions raised the premium charged on loans to Japanese banks. **********Earlier this week, for instance, the Bank of Tokyo - one of the nation's most creditworthy institutions - was being charged an interest rate of 6 13/22 percent for a three-month loan in the Eurodollar market.

This week, investors found out just how fragile that thread could be. **********The share price of the Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia AB tumbled 5.5 percent Tuesday, pushing the Helsinki stock index to a 4.7 percent loss. Although Nokia's share price - and the Helsinki index - recovered Wednesday, nervous investors and analysts have been left wondering if the rout was a freak or a mere taste of things to come as Nokia prepares to announce its earnings for the first eight months of the year Wednesday. **********One thing remains certain. As Johan Rinne, an analyst with Handelsbanken Markets in Helsinki put it, \"Where Nokia leads, Finland follows.\" **********Nokia accounts for nearly 40 percent of the entire value of the companies listed on the Helsinki exchange. With one company steering the Finnish market, predicting future levels for the Helsinki stock index is perilous work. **********\"To predict the general index you have got to know the price of Nokia,\" Mr. Rinne said. **********Now that the market has been reminded that even its stars - Nokia's share price currently stands at 26 times its level of three years ago - feel the occasional tug of gravity, the peril of over-dependence has come to light. **********\"This is a big shock for a lot of people who believed that Nokia shares would rise forever,\" said Pakka Samuelson, an analyst with Protos Stockbrokers in Helsinki. **********Nokia's stock Tuesday fell 20 markkaa, to 252 markkaa ($58.77), which ranked between over-done and wholly irrational in many analysts' view. That was bourne out Wednesday, when Nokia climbed back 19 markkaa, to finish at 271. **********Nokia's prospects, analysts say, were mistakenly linked with those of Motorola Inc., which had issued a profit warning Tuesday that highlighted softness in demand and prices for its analog-system mobile phones. **********Nokia watchers quickly countered that the Finnish company's strengths were in Europe and in newer digital cellular phones and that demand and prices remained robust for those products in Europe. But the key question is, for how long? **********\"Motorola's announcement confirms the view that somewhere in the future Nokia's margins will come under pressure,\" said Taina Slandebroek-Uljas, an analyst with BZW in London. **********Even Nokia has forecast steep declines in the price of its digital phones, but that forecast has been tempered by a pair of compensating factors: a steep decline in the cost of phone production and a continuing explosion in demand for those phones. **********Nokia and LM Ericsson AB, the Swedish telecommunications company, have estimated that by 2000 there will be 350 million mobile phones in use in the world.

The data come from a report published recently by Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm in Boston, and Lipper Analytical Services, a fund tracking firm in Summit,  N.J. **********Much of the money under advisers' care is going directly into mutual funds through no-fee sales programs like those of Schwab, Jack White and Fidelity Investments. Though individuals can deal directly with these brokerage companies, the rapid rise of the financial adviser indicates that investors find advice as important as convenience in such programs. **********In addition, the demand for this advice is growing far faster than the number of companies. The Cerulli-Lipper report states that the number of independent fee-based adviser firms, which primarily serve individuals, grew to 12,500 recently from 11,000 in 1992. Over the same stretch, the assets managed by those firms grew sixfold. **********\"The proliferation of mutual funds has obviously become overwhelming,\" said Mary McAvity, a consultant at Cerulli. **********The report also shows that the bulk of the advice is to invest in mutual funds. Advisers with less than $25 million in assets under management put about  70 percent of that money into mutual funds, while financial advisers with more money are far more likely to recommend individual stocks or other investments. **********According to the report, advisers with $25 million to $50 million under management put about 50 percent of those assets into mutual funds, while advisers with more than $100 million put less than 10 percent, on average, into  funds. **********Financial advisers are increasingly turning to no-fee brokerage services as a means of selecting funds for customers. While that might provide fund companies  with a new way to distribute their products, the Cerulli-Lipper report says the  trend might also be costing fund companies some customer loyalty. The portion of assets managed by advisers that is invested directly with mutual fund companies  has fallen to less than 30 percent from 57 percent three years ago. **********One reason for that shift, the report says, is that advisers using brokerage  firms can offer clients a single statement of all their holdings, rather than separate statements from each fund company. The trend spells trouble for medium-sized fund companies in particular, because they may shun the brokerage programs but may not have the marketing power to attract investors. **********The hidden benefit for investors, however, may be that advisers will focus more on expenses and other fees in deciding where to put their assets. About one-fifth of financial advisory firms now refuse to put clients in mutual funds  that charge shareholders an additional amount, known as a 12b-1 fee, for distribution expenses. **********The financial advisers' own fees may also be under pressure. Most of the advisers surveyed by Cerulli and Lipper charge customers about 1 percent of assets annually for their advice, but Ms. McAvity said there was new competition from products like brokerage firms' wrap accounts. In these accounts, brokers are not paid commissions, but instead receive a percentage of assets under management. **********Another factor contributing to the popularity of advisers is the bull market. \"When we get into a down market, that's when the value of financial advisers will really be tested,\" Ms. McAvity said. \"The unsophisticated financial adviser who buys a PC, buys a portfolio optimization program and signs up with Schwab will then have a hard time retaining those relationships.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/23/business/exxon-in-belgian-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exxon in Belgian Deal", "print_headline": "Exxon in Belgian Deal", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Corporation's Exxon Chemical unit will acquire the 35 percent stake in a Belgium ethylene and polypropylene complex held by the Danish petrochemical company Borealis A.S., the Belgian oil and gas company Petrofina S.A. said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/21/world/world-news-briefs-us-may-return-some-okinawa-bases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. May Return Some Okinawa Bases", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. May Return Some Okinawa Bases", "body_text": " **********The United States has agreed in principle to return some of its military bases in Okinawa to Japanese landowners within three years, Japan's Defense Agency said today. **********The 10 sites make up only 4.2 percent of the 58,000 acres occupied by United  States bases on Okinawa in southern Japan.

Still, it also reflects the desire of politicians to win the public's favor by promising to deliver lower electric power rates to their constituents. **********The Lilco situation has its roots in the mid-1980's, when the New York State Public Service Commission awarded Lilco large rate increases for construction of the ill-fated Shoreham nuclear power plant, which has ended up in mothballs. **********Today, Lilco charges an average 16.8 cents a kilowatt-hour, nearly twice the national average of 8.8 cents and well above even the rates charged by other utilities in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. **********Recently, the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency empowered to acquire all or part of Lilco, put out a request for proposals from utilities, investment banks and others. The deadline for responses is Oct. 20. **********The authority said its goal was to acquire Lilco and restructure it so that there could be a substantial reduction in rates. The principal advantage of a state takeover revolves around the agency's ability to issue debt with interest payments that are exempt from Federal and state income taxes. **********Gov. George E. Pataki, who originally opposed a takeover, called last month for the authority to develop a plan that would reduce electric rates by at least 10 percent, encourage competition, avoid higher property taxes and lead to the \"dissolution\" of the utility. **********The chairman of Lilco, William J. Catacosinos, said the company would cooperate in any plan that protected its employees, shareholders and customers, but questioned Mr. Pataki's use of the word \"dissolution\" and warned customers that they would miss the company if it ceased to exist. **********Politicians and business groups on Long Island regard the region's high electric rates as a competitive disadvantage and a costly burden on the 2.7 million residents, who also pay among the highest sales and property taxes in the country. Lilco notes that 21 cents of each dollar it collects on utility bills goes to taxes. **********In 1989, a $7.45 billion offer for Lilco by the Long Island Power Authority was rejected by the company and its shareholders. In October 1994, Mario M. Cuomo, then the Governor, proposed a $9 billion takeover. The plan lapsed after Mr. Cuomo was defeated. **********In June, Richard M. Kessel, a holdover from the Cuomo administration who was still serving as the authority chairman, revived the idea, proposing to let a Michigan-based private company manage Lilco after a public acquisition. **********But Governor Pataki called it \"irrelevant\" and replaced Mr. Kessel with James F.

Araskog, said in a telephone interview yesterday. **********Mr. Araskog said the split would give each company better access to capital at a lower cost. Also, the three concerns could adopt strategies and policies based on their own particular business characteristics and devise employee incentives that were tied more directly to the specific performance of each unit. **********Analysts said each of the companies was strong and well-positioned to compete within its industry. The Hartford insurance group was the country's fastest-growing life, health and casualty insurer last year. The ITT automotive unit is the largest global supplier of four-wheel, anti-lock brake systems, and the entertainment group includes the New York Knicks basketball team, half of Madison Square Garden, the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars World casinos. **********\"Fluid technology is not a glamourous business like hotels and casinos, so the press tends to ignore it,\" said Jay Cohen, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, referring to one of the ITT businesses. \"But it's a real solid performer, as are the other businesses.\" **********Analysts and investors also speculated privately that a breakup would allow Mr. Araskog, who is 63, to extend his tenure beyond the \"normal retirement age,\" described in the company's proxy statement as 65. Mr. Araskog, who has been one of the nation's highest-paid and most socially prominent executives, will become chairman and chief executive of the new ITT Corporation, which will operate the entertainment properties. **********\"I expect that I could be going on at ITT with the approval of the board as long as I wanted to and thought I could do a good job,\" Mr. Araskog said. **********The split had been widely anticipated, propelling the company's stock up by 25 percent from the first of the year and generating a spate of news reports during the last six months speculating about an ITT breakup. **********During the last two years, the company, which is based in New York and once comprised more than 250 concerns, has pursued a radical makeover. It has shed assets that did not complement its three lines of business and bought companies that did. **********Still, the news yesterday lifted shares of ITT by $5.625, to $114.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts predicted that ITT's stock would continue to rise as investors pulled apart the three pieces and valued them on a stand-alone basis. **********Conglomerates have fallen out of favor as investors increasingly have placed their bets on focused companies, which has resulted in the dismemberment of Sears, Roebuck & Company, Kodak and Tenneco, to name a few. Analysts say that a so-called market basket of companies is hard to assess because valuation methods differ from industry to industry. Hotels and casinos, for instance, are measured by cash flow, while insurance companies are valued as a multiple of their cash flow. **********\"You're not creating value here, you're unhiding it,\" said R. Jackson Blackstock, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. **********Many analysts said they saw few obstacles to the spinoff, though it needed the approval of shareholders, Federal regulators and state insurance and gaming authorities. **********Mr. Cohen of Salomon Brothers said the credit rating agencies might place the company on credit watch while they assessed the impact of the spinoff on the insurance business in particular. In March the Standard & Poor's Corporation downgraded the ratings of the Hartford group, which generates roughly half the ITT profits. **********\"Frankly, I would expect it,\" Mr. Araskog agreed, \"until all this has settled down.\" **********The spinoffs also resolve issues of succession, which had begun to haunt the company and seemed likely to end in a struggle between Robert A. Bowman, an executive vice president and chief financial officer of ITT, and D. Travis Engen, an executive vice president. **********Mr. Bowman, who is widely credited with ITT's push into the entertainment business, will serve as president and chief operating officer under Mr. Araskog. **********Mr. Engen, who was regarded as the executive most likely to run ITT after Mr. Araskog's departure, will become chairman, president and chief executive of ITT Industries, which will operate the largest manufacturer of anti-lock brakes, a military electronics unit and the third-largest pump company in the world. **********Donald R. Frahm, currently chairman and chief executive of the ITT Hartford Group, will become chairman and chief executive of ITT Hartford. **********Two decades ago ITT became something of a phenomenon under the leadership of Harold S. Geneen, perhaps the most acquisitive chief executive in history. With the help of Andre Meyer of Lazard Freres & Company, Mr. Geneen was a pioneer of the hostile takeover, buying companies at the rate of one a week at one point until ITT comprised more than 250 companies. **********Breaking up ITT also resolves another problem for Mr. Araskog -- establishing a consistent pattern of earnings to meet the company's own hurdles for return on equity. **********From 1979 to 1991 shares of ITT trailed the S.& P. 500 index by 36 percent, which caused a shareholders' revolt, led by the California Public Employees Retirement System, the activist public pension fund. The revolt prodded the ITT board to tie Mr. Araskog's compensation to the company's achieving a return on equity of 16.4 percent. Last year ITT just made it over that hurdle, helped by a stock buyback program. **********Last year the company earned $1.02 billion, an increase of 11.9 percent from the previous year, on revenues of $23.6 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/world/jerusalem-journal-in-a-museum-of-hell-qualms-about-decorum.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1995-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 969, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; In a Museum of Hell, Qualms About Decorum", "print_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; In a Museum of Hell, Qualms About Decorum", "body_text": " **********What many cannot forget are her eyes. **********She stands slightly hunched on the far left of the grainy photo, huddling in fear with two other women as Nazi soldiers hover with rifles.

But what transfixes many viewers is not the nudity in this picture taken by the Nazis. It is the eyes of the woman on the left. **********They are large dark circles of terror and bewilderment. **********The photo, near another one showing naked men also about to be shot, has been hanging for 23 years on the walls of Yad Vashem, the Israeli museum and memorial to victims of the Holocaust. Now, the photo has fallen victim itself, to a painful dispute among Jews over whether it is proper for Yad Vashem to hang even a few pictures showing the dead and the near-dead without clothes. **********The questions are stark, and they have swirled here for several weeks, with Holocaust survivors on either side of the issue invoking their own terrible memories. **********Are the victims degraded yet again by being shown in their nakedness? **********Yes, some say, especially political leaders of black-frocked Orthodox Jews known here as haredim, who are in the forefront of a campaign to take the photos down. Haredi rabbis, whose influence over disciples is almost total in their circumscribed world, also call the photos an offense to the living because it is sinful to look at naked bodies. **********\"In July 1943, my parents were marching to their death at Sobibor,\" Yeshayau Shafir of Tel Aviv said the other day in a letter to the newspaper Haaretz. \"If my mother's picture would be hanging on the walls of a museum -- naked, shamed and frightened the moment before her death -- I would do anything, and I underline 'anything,' to get her off the wall.\" **********Or is the issue instead as others frame it, observant Jews among them. Would it be sanitizing Nazi atrocities to remove those graphic images? Some holding this view warn that it might even play into the hands of Holocaust-deniers, who could say once the pictures came down: Look, even the Jews had doubts. **********Eva Lux-Braun of Jerusalem wrote to The Jerusalem Post that she had been forced to strip at the Auschwitz death camp, and would have wanted photos displayed had they existed. \"Are the pictures indecent, immodest, demeaning, humiliating?\" she said. \"The facts are, not the pictures. We couldn't cover our nakedness then. Don't cover it up now.\" **********Yad Vashem has formally rejected the protests against nudity, insisting that the photos will stay on its walls. \"We have no reason, and I don't have the authority, to cover up the terrible truth or to beautify it,\" said Avner Shalev, the memorial's chairman. **********But that did not end the dispute. **********Deputy Mayor Chaim Miller of Jerusalem, a haredi official who first raised the issue, says he will continue to press for change, by urging fellow haredim to write protest letters and to boycott the museum, and, he suggests, by asking Orthodox donors to freeze out Yad Vashem. **********\"If they will turn this into a matter between religious and secular,\" he said bluntly, \"I have the means to affect them financially.\" **********Why the issue has arisen after all these years is not clear. One reason may be general Holocaust consciousness on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi camps. Another may be that haredim seem to be visiting Yad Vashem in growing numbers. Now, they want a say in how it is run instead of leaving it, as before, to secular and modern religious Zionists. **********A few haredi leaders even talk about setting up their own museum -- to memorialize the victims \"properly and objectively,\" in the words of Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, head of the Agudat Yisrael political party. **********Many haredim feel that the collective Holocaust memory here has been dominated too long by secular Zionists -- whom some in the haredi world blame for the Nazi horror in the first place, by not having waited for the Messiah before seeking to create a Jewish state and thus going against God's will. In their view, Yad Vashem devotes too little space to religious Jewish life in pre-Nazi Europe and to how some Jews clung to their faith in the camps. **********But to other Israelis, the call for Holocaust separatism is another attempt by haredim to seal themselves off from the rest of Israel -- by creating an institution parallel to an existing one, much as they have done with schools and social services. It is a dangerous gambit, some warn. **********\"There's a feeling that the religious are trying to take away the one unifying force we have,\" said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian of the Holocaust. **********Other specialists warn of haredi revisionism, what they regard as an attempt to gloss over how some rabbis in Europe counseled loyal followers -- disastrously -- to stay put while the Nazis were on the march, and in some instances fled while others died. **********Disputes aside, there is pain because half a century later Jews are tearing at one another over whose Holocaust it was. **********\"You would think that on this one thing there would be a willingness to stand silently together,\" said Efraim Zuroff, Israel director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. \"Do you think the Nazis distinguished between Jews when they killed them?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/business/key-rates-314095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/business/c-a-correction-commodities-in-1994-514095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Correction: Commodities in 1994", "print_headline": "A Correction: Commodities in 1994", "body_text": " **********A table yesterday in the special Outlook '95 section of Business Day garbled the 1994 percentage-change figures for some commodities.

Klingensmith, who has been publisher since the beginning, said he expected Entertainment Weekly to make money by the end of 1996, a year behind schedule. **********The success of Entertainment Weekly comes as Premiere, a leading rival in coverage of the movie industry, has gone on the auction block for a reported asking price of $20 million to $30 million. **********Officials at the K-III Communications Corporation, the parent of Premiere, say the magazine no longer fits in with the company's growing roster of publications. K-III recently acquired a number of technical and trade magazines. **********While Premiere's bread and butter is coverage of the film industry, Entertainment Weekly, which is owned by Time Inc., has a much wider agenda. Describing itself as the entertainment equivalent of another Time publication, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly is the only weekly magazine that covers television, music, books, multimedia and videos, as well as movies. Time has just started to put the magazine's contents on line every week on America Online. **********\"It's a service magazine in terms of making choices about what to see, what to buy,\" said James W. Seymore Jr., who replaced Jeff A. Jarvis as managing editor four months after the start-up. **********\"This magazine keeps people pop- culturally literate,\" Mr. Klingen smith said. **********Unlike many entertainment magazines that have become known mostly as cheerleaders for the industry, Entertainment Weekly has managed to retain its critical edge. **********An article in September, for instance, dealt with what Hollywood considers its greatest plums: movies that gross more than $100 million. Eschewing the reverential tone normally used by publications when referring to blockbusters, Entertainment Weekly briskly spelled out the techniques used by studios to lift films beyond the magic number of $100 million. **********The magazine described, for example, how some studios put the films into discount theaters, which charge $2 or $3 a ticket, while others simply keep the movies in regular theaters for 10 weeks or more -- at no small expense -- just to be able to attain the magic number. **********The article also quoted a box-office analyst by name who questioned the accuracy of the weekly estimated movie grosses that are listed in hundreds of newspapers and magazines. He said the figures submitted for publication were usually about 2.5 percent higher than the actual box-office numbers. **********While no one at Time Inc. will say how much of an investment has gone into Entertainment Weekly, people in the industry estimate the amount to be $60 million to $70 million. **********\"It is no longer perceived as a hot, exciting book in the communications community,\" said Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a consultant for the magazine industry, \"but that doesn't mean it is not very solid and doing very well.\" **********An executive at another publication covering the entertainment industry, who insisted on anonymity, described Entertainment Weekly as \"mind-bendingly aggressive\" about marketing itself. **********\"People tend to pick it up and look at it pretty religiously,\" the executive added, \"but it is designed for people who don't want to read anything more than two paragraphs.\" **********The young staff of Entertainment Weekly tends to reflect the magazine's readers, who have an average age of 32 and are almost equally divided between men and women. **********Mr. Klingensmith said the magazine's young readership had helped attract advertising from consumer electronics, automotive, liquor, television and apparel companies. **********Inevitably, the magazine has been dogged by the question of whether it gives favorable treatment to the music, films, videos and music of its Time Warner siblings, Warner Brothers and Warner Music Group. Mr. Seymore insists the magazine is editorially independent and says Entertainment Weekly shows no favoritism toward Warner products. **********The process of reviewing and rating movies, television shows, books and music on a scale of A+ to D- is a complicated -- and finally a subjective -- enterprise, one that does not always endear the magazine to all of its readers. With a circulation of 1.1 million, Entertainment Weekly is a magazine for the masses -- and the masses often cannot fathom the critics' tastes. **********For instance, Entertainment Weekly critics panned \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Forrest Gump,\" two of the most popular -- and some might say schmaltziest -- movies of recent years. **********The magazine's chief movie critic, Owen Gleiberman, found \"Forrest Gump\" to be \"dishonest,\" saying it \"reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park; a baby-boomer version of Disney's America.\" He gave the film a grade of C. **********When a critic gives a biting review to what will probably turn out to be a popular movie, the magazine nonetheless runs a feature article on the movie. The review and the article, however, do not usually appear in the same issue. And sometimes the magazine just goofs. **********\"We didn't see 'Gump' coming, and we didn't anticipate what a phenomenon it was going to be,\" Mr. Seymore said. \"Consequently, we never had a cover devoted to the biggest movie of the year.\" **********Mr. Seymore said the magazine's willingness to be tough had \"definitely cost us access\" to some stars who were not willing to cooperate with a magazine that had panned them on other projects. **********\"But we don't live or die by our access to the stars,\" he said. \"If we were to shade our reviews to curry favor, I think we would be doomed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/business/looking-outward-to-keep-us-economy-chugging.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1995-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1080, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Looking Outward to Keep U.S. Economy Chugging", "print_headline": "Looking Outward to Keep U.S. Economy Chugging", "body_text": " **********With the nation's economic expansion still strong but aging, this year is likely to provide a crucial test of whether increased trade can visibly deliver on its promised benefits to Americans. For now that the advance in domestic demand is expected to slow at least somewhat, trade specialists say, foreign growth is the best hope to animate the United States economy. **********\"If the U.S. slows down in the next couple of years,\" said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, \"a lot of slack can be taken up by the resurgence in Europe, Japan and the emerging markets.\" **********Trade, in fact, is becoming the new standard currency of American diplomacy, and not just because the cold war has ended. The nation's annual exports have more than doubled in the last decade, accounting for a sharply rising share of the nation's output. **********Although economists see no recession soon, increasing interest rates could retard economic growth at home. But many of America's major trading partners are just getting their own recoveries under way, while much of Asia and Latin America is growing much faster than the United States. **********Mexico caught up with Japan last year to become the nation's second-largest export market, behind Canada. Although the recent plunge of the peso and an austerity plan is likely to curb Mexican imports this year, most economists expect Mexican demand for American products to continue rising over the longer run. **********For almost a decade now, exports have been one of America's secret economic weapons. United States corporations did so well in foreign markets last year -- merchandise exports were up 9.5 percent through September -- that they favored the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with near-unanimity. From 1985 to 1994, exports rose from 7.2 percent to 10.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product as American firms vastly improved their competitiveness. With the new global trade agreement and a worldwide economic expansion, business leaders say, things should only get better. **********\"America has a huge potential for increased export opportunities,\" said Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Compaq Computer Corporation, which gets half its sales from abroad. In an interview, he spoke of having penetrated the Japanese market in 1992, and now expanding in Europe as more companies learn to take advantage of technology. Among the recent visitors at Compaq's headquarters in Houston have been oil executives from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and bankers from Poland. **********Labor leaders point out, however, that the trade deficit also swelled last year, despite a weak dollar, which would normally favor exports over imports by making American goods less expensive in foreign markets. And they say the export of jobs, promoted by the year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, is only beginning. While the Administration says that each billion dollars in exports creates 20,000 jobs, the unions respond that each billion dollars in imports destroys 20,000 jobs. And the merchandise trade deficit for 1994 is expected to reach about $160 billion, which would nearly match the 1987 record. **********\"The trade deficit, the huge deficit, represents a net loss of employment to this nation,\" said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Task Force on Trade. \"We are losing the broad middle class that provided stability in this country.\" **********Economists ascribe the imbalance to the economy's gathering strength. Import demand is stronger in the United States than abroad because growth is more robust here. They also say that trade promotes the most efficient allocation of resources, which helps lift living standards across the board for nations that participate in the global economy. **********That is little solace to many union officials. While champion exporting companies tend to pay higher wages, labor leaders contend that the surge in international trade has led to little more than stagnating incomes for many workers. **********They point to Caterpillar Inc., a leading supporter of GATT, which has gotten the United Automobile Workers union to allow some new workers to receive $8 an hour instead of the usual $17 minimum. Caterpillar, a top maker of construction equipment, has profited from the nation's strong 13 percent rise to $151 billion through three quarters in the export of capital goods, which are used to equip factories, build roads and run offices. **********For consumers, the benefits of freer trade are obvious: not only cheaper imports, but also pressure on domestic producers to keep prices down. But some workers inevitably suffer. After the North American pact took effect a year ago, the Administration offered retraining for those who could prove that the flow of goods and investments had cost them their jobs. Labor unions complain that only a quarter of the 48,000 workers who have applied has been certified for retraining. **********THE Clinton Administration has promoted exports as single-mindedly, it seems, as anyone since Japan's MITI bureaucrats at their zenith, if not Louis XIV's mercantilist minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. **********\"We need a superaggressive national export strategy,\" the Commerce Department's Mr. Garten said in an interview. \"We have to turn up the heat in ways not yet contemplated.\" **********He can already point to billions in foreign contracts signed after executives piled aboard for Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's many trade missions abroad. Some wonder, however, whether political supporters have an edge in winning seats on the plane. **********When Brazil wanted to build a $1.5 billion satellite and radar system in the spring to monitor the Amazon environment, Mr. Garten said, the chiefs of the United States space, environmental and interior agencies lobbied their Brazilian counterparts. Secretary Brown visited the country and the United States promised to match any financing that its chief rivals, the French, could offer. The United States won the contest. **********As the Administration and many corporations are discovering, the most rapidly growing export markets are sure to be among such rapidly developing nations. For the first three quarters after the new trade pact took effect, exports to Mexico were up 21.7 percent, imports up 22.8 percent. **********That's why when other goals conflict with the pursuit of foreign trade these days, those other goals usually give way. The Chinese Government hardly bothered to make even cosmetic improvements in its human rights record in 1993, but the Clinton Administration decided it had little choice but to grant China the most favorable trade status."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/international-briefs-abb-posts-40-jump-for-first-quarter-profit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; ABB Posts 40% Jump For First-Quarter Profit", "print_headline": "International Briefs; ABB Posts 40% Jump For First-Quarter Profit", "body_text": " **********The electrical engineering company ABB Asea Brown Boveri A.G. reported yesterday that it had a 40 percent surge in profit in the first quarter of 1995 and confirmed its earlier forecasts of higher earnings for the full year.

Jacobs, ING's chairman, told a news conference that Peter Baring, the British company's chairman, and all other top Barings executives would remain in place, although they would be overseen by an ING representative, Hessel Lindenbergh, who is a member of ING's executive board. **********ING, or Internationale Nederlanden Groep N.V., is acquiring the three main Barings business lines: asset management, corporate finance and securities. Mr. Jacobs said ING's strategy had been to expand around the world in precisely those three areas, and that Barings was a perfect fit.

Leeson. **********Mr. Jacobs said that ING had calculated the total losses from the investment positions taken by Mr Leeson at $:860 million, or about $1.39 billion. **********But he said that with the $1 billion in financial assistance being provided by ING, Barings would be able to pay off all its depositors and creditors in full, except for holders of $:100 million, or $162 million, worth of bonds issued by Barings P.L.C. **********Barings P.L.C., the parent company, is not technically being acquired by ING. **********Mr. Jacobs said the bondholders would receive 5 percent of the value of their holdings soon, and perhaps another 20 percent at an unspecified later date, depending on how much money the recapitalized firm had available. **********The other big loser was the Baring Foundation, a charity that owned all of the Barings equity. The equity was wiped out by the firm's collapse. **********Mr. Jacobs said the only other claims ING would not pay would be any that had not been filed by the time the deal became final and was formally signed today. **********Among the liabilities that ING assumed and would honor in full in meeting the $1.39 billion loss were payments to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange in Japan, where Mr. Leeson had dealt in $7 billion worth of Japanese stock-index futures and nearly $22 billion of Japanese Government bond futures. **********Mr. Jacobs said ING would also pay off a group of Japanese banks that had lent heavily to Barings, apparently to help meet growing margin calls on Mr. Leeson's position. **********He said the payments included $:160 million (about $259 million) to the Singapore exchange, $:90 million ($145 million) to the Osaka exchange and $:610 million (about $988 million) to institutions in Tokyo including the bank creditors. **********The loss of $:860 million ($1.39 billion) was nearly twice the Barings capital of $:440 million ($713 million) Mr. Jacobs said. But ING's injection of $:660 million ($1.07 billion) leaves Barings with a capital base now of $:240 million ($389 million), a level he said would be sufficient for the firm to recommence its own trading immediately. **********Mr. Leeson had bet heavily that Japanese stock prices and interest rates would rise. But he lost both gambles, wiping out the Barings capital and plunging the bank into bankruptcy last week after 233 years in business. **********Mr. Leeson is in jail in Frankfurt and is fighting an attempt to extradite him to Singapore. **********Mr. Jacobs said that Mr. Baring and five other executive directors of Barings had volunteered to forgo their bonuses for 1994. But he said the rest of the 4,000 Barings employees would be paid their bonuses, although senior executives would be paid in installments rather than in a lump sum. Barings executives said many key personnel would have left had they not received their bonuses, which are often several times their base salaries. **********For ING, the deal promises a chance to greatly expand its international presence. ING already gets 60 percent of its revenues and 30 percent of its profits from abroad.

And those that prevent us from worshiping there confront us at their peril.\" **********The two-hour interview was conducted in Arabic, although Colonel Qaddafi occasionally switched to English. **********The United Nations imposed the air embargo and banned the sale or transfer of military parts to Libya in April 1992 after the country refused to hand over two Libyans wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan American World Airways flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed. **********Since the air links were cut off, Libyans have traveled by land to neighboring countries like Egypt, then flown on to Saudi Arabia or other destinations.

He said Libya was considering withdrawing from the organization and joining Taiwan, Switzerland, the Vatican and the Pacific island of Nauru as nonmember states. **********\"Unfortunately, the usefulness of the United Nations is over,\" said Colonel Qaddafi, who dressed in brown slacks, a brown shirt and brown boots for the interview. \"We are calling on the small nations of the world to withdraw and form another international body. **********\"It seemed that for a while the smaller nations had a voice, but the U.N. is now used as a sword against us,\" he said. \"It is controlled by the big powers.\" **********Frustrated by Libya's refusal to hand over the suspects in the bombing of th Pan Am flight, the United Nations Security Council expanded the sanctions in December 1993 by freezing Libyan assets around the world and denying the country access to a range of oil equipment. **********The tightened sanctions were also a response to Libya's refusal to cooperate with an inquiry into the 1989 bombing of a French airliner over Niger in which 171 people were killed. France has issued arrest warrants for four Libyans, including Colonel Qaddafi's brother-in-law, in connection with that blast. **********Colonel Qaddafi said today that he was putting some military equipment, including 100 planes, up for sale \"to anyone -- even individuals we know nothing about or gangs\" because sanctions had prevented his country from getting spare parts. **********As he spoke, the Libyan leader sat under the canopy of a green Bedouin tent in the sprawling Bab al-Azizya army barracks in Tripoli, not far from the site of the American bombing raid in 1986. The United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for what it said was Libya's role in the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by American servicemen. **********Colonel Qaddafi touched frequently on the 1986 bombing raids, calling former President Ronald Reagan and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain \"war criminals who must be brought before Libyan courts.\" The air attacks reportedly killed 37 Libyans. **********\"Reagan and Thatcher are killers,\" he said as two aides stood against the tent walls. \"They killed scores of innocent Libyan children.

This might finish them off, leaving ever more people with no health care and more retirees eating cat food. If an employer has been deducting $3,000 a year for health insurance and $2,000 a year for a pension contribution, that corporation is not likely to give the same $5,000 to a worker without getting the tax deduction.

The same thing men want, they seem to be saying: sex, plenty of it and the tackier the better. **********Publications that used to attract readers with recipes for lemon meringue pie now reel them in with exposed flesh -- the same time-worn tabloid tactic that used to be the province of men's magazines. After a flirtation with articles aimed at women with broader interests, magazines like Marie Claire, More! and Company have been reaching new highs in circulation by publishing just about any article with the word sex in it. **********As a result, cover lines featuring the \"s\" word scream out in fluorescent colors from London newsstands: \"The Secrets of Women who Adore Sex,\" \"Future Sex and Shopping,\" \"Sex and the Psycho Girl\" and \"Suburban Porn Stars.\" That last one, in the January issue of Company, came complete with graphic photographs under the headline \"Suburban Sex Scandal: Group Sex With Strangers, Masturbation, Whipping; It Could Be All Happening Next Door to You.\" **********That article may have gone too far. After all, Company is published by the National Magazine Company, a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation that puts out the British versions of Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping, as well as the upscale Harpers and Queen magazine. **********When Company was introduced in 1978 as a kind of younger sister to Cosmopolitan, it focused on the concerns of 18- to 25-year-old women: relationships, straightforward sexual advice and women's health issues. **********But in the last year the popular monthly has shown a preference for sensationalistic articles. One issue ran a sealed inner section showing rows of close-up pictures of men's sexual organs. The point, according to the article, was to educate women about male anatomy. Educational claims were also made for January's suburban sex article, which photographed and described in vivid detail -- employing an impressive variety of four-letter words -- scenes of group sex and sadomasochism being filmed for a pornographic movie. **********Many readers were outraged. So were retailers who received angry complaints from customers. Supermarkets removed the offending issue from their stands, as did W. H. Smith and John Menzies, two of the largest news agents in Britain. **********\"Young girls browse around the newsstands, and we didn't want them to be exposed to these things,\" said a spokeswoman for Safeway Supermarkets, which also removed the January issue of More! because of a suggestive cover photograph. **********The moves were just a warning shot, however. The February issues of both magazines are back on the stands. \"Hopefully, they got the message,\" the Safeway spokeswoman said. **********Clearly they did. Mandi Norwood, the editor of Company, refused to answer questions about the January issue. The managing director of National Magazine, Terry Mansfield, released a statement that said, in part: \"The translation of such a controversial theme into the magazine medium presented challenges which, on reflection, could have been met more appropriately. We accept that the photographs used in the feature are not in good taste and regret that they may offend some people.\" **********The February issue of Company published a box asking readers whether subjects \"that may sometimes be unsavory but, nevertheless, like abortion, rape or abuse, are part of today's world,\" belonged in the pages of women's magazines. Mr. Mansfield said the magazine received about 200 letters in response, most of which supported coverage of such subjects. **********Mr. Mansfield, who said the company periodically conducted market surveys to determine which subjects were of interest to the magazine's readers, asserted that there was widespread interest in stories about sex in the context of relationships. He also cited research showing that young women were less informed about sex than commonly assumed. \"We find that it's through magazines that young women seek this information,\" Mr. Mansfield said. **********Critics of what The Daily Telegraph calls the \"sex-made\" trend among women's magazines contend that the goal is increasing circulation, not education. \"It's about selling magazines,\" said Jane Proctor, editor of Tatler, another women's monthly, which for the most part has steered clear of the trend. \"It's about editors trying to outdo each other. The recession has hit everybody.\" **********Linda Kelsey, editor of She, the British equivalent of Redbook, agreed, saying there was a lot of pressure on editors to increase circulation revenue as advertising income drops for British magazines. **********Stories on sex appear to be working like magic. The circulation of Company has grown by 18,000 in the last year, to 268,022 from 250,343 in 1993. Marie Claire, which used to be aimed at women with more intellectual interests, was amply rewarded for its decision about a year ago to include sexier stories: its circulation rose from 313,866 in 1993 to 398,019 last year, a jump of 85,000. **********\"A lot of editors have noted that sex pretty rapidly puts on sales,\" Ms. Kelsey said. \"But it's not the only thing that sells magazines. One of the most phenomenal success stories is Good Housekeeping, which sells very traditional values but in a kind of bright, up-to-date way.\" **********As for the other magazines, Ms. Kelsey said: \"I think that in nearly every case, what some call sensationalist has been explicit but acceptable. I would say, 'Why not?' \" **********An article in The Daily Telegraph said why not -- \"The result is degrading to women and ironically deserves all the old charges of exploitation that used to be leveled at girlie magazines for men.\" **********Ms. Kelsey, while admitting that the Company article in January \"overstepped the mark,\" maintained that the magazines were simply treating sex less reverently. \"I don't believe that women are titillated in the way men are by these overt, sexy articles,\" she said. **********Ms. Norwood of Company says it is the readers who decide what is acceptable. \"I think there is such a thing as bad taste,\" she said. \"But I find it hard to define. If it will offend the reader, it's bad taste.\" **********The trend toward sexually oriented subject matter in magazines parallels the recent growth of mainstream female erotic literature in Britain. Little Brown recently introduced a new imprint here -- but not in the United States -- called X Libris, which includes four slim bright pink volumes with titles like \"Arousing Anna.\" They are all written by, and for, women. **********\"We have to wake up to the fact that sex is here and people are talking about it,\" Ms. Norwood said, \"and thank God they are.\" **********\"I don't think there's anything wrong with a little voyeurism,\" she added. \"In small amounts.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/13/world/conflict-balkans-us-policy-us-took-calculated-risk-not-curbing-croat-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1995-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1895, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Took a Calculated Risk In Not Curbing Croat Attack", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: U.S. POLICY; U.S. Took a Calculated Risk In Not Curbing Croat Attack", "body_text": " **********In the days before Croatia attacked rebel Croatian Serbs on Aug. 4, Bill Clinton met repeatedly with his national security aides almost every morning to weigh a crucial question: How far should he go in pressuring the Croats to call off their offensive? **********Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, were arguing that a Croatian attack probably could not be stopped, and might bring some benefits. **********It could save Bihac, the besieged United Nations safe haven in northwestern Bosnia, which NATO had promised to defend with air power without being sure it could do so. It could deal a crushing blow to the Serbs. And it might just open new opportunities for peace talks. **********Pentagon officials were a bit more circumspect. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told Mr. Clinton the Croatian Army's timetable for victory in four to eight days was overly optimistic. Many officials feared that if the Croats didn't prevail quickly, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia would come under powerful pressure to help his fellow Serbs. **********Even if it did work, the operation could produce yet another vast stream of refugees. Were the gains worth the risks? Or was it too late for anything to stop a Croatian onslaught? **********Mr. Clinton eventually approved what one official termed the \"yellow-light approach\" and another characterized as \"an amber light tinted green.\" The Croats say they took it as tacit encouragement. **********Under the policy, Washington warned Zagreb of the risks of launching an attack, but said that it would not threaten sanctions, as it had done in March to prevent Croatia from ousting United Nations peacekeeping forces. Instead of dispatching Vice President Al Gore to meet President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, as happened in March when the United States leaned hard on Croatia to forestall a similar operation, the message was to be delivered by the American Ambassador in Zagreb. **********The consensus among most officials was that nothing the United States could do or say would dissuade Mr. Tudjman from attacking. **********\"Rather than a feckless effort to say don't do what we know you're going to do, we used our influence to steer them towards limited objectives,\" said one senior official. \"We were cautioning restraint. We were not saying this is a great idea.\" U.S. Feared Serbian Response **********The chief worry was that the Croats might broaden their attack to include the Serbian-held territories in eastern Croatia on the border with Serbia, a move that American intelligence officials believed would provoke Mr. Milosevic to retaliate. The American messages to Croatia in the hours leading up to the attack stressed the importance of avoiding civilian casualties and \"ethnic cleansing,\" officials said. **********On Aug. 4, the Croatian forces attacked. Within days they had reclaimed the land seized by rebel Serbs when Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, shocking Pentagon officials with the ease of their victory and the collapse of the Serbs. Just as quickly, more than a 100,000 Serbs fled the country, a result Croatian officials insist they did not anticipate or encourage. **********The Croatian attack on the Krajina Serbs illustrates how the calculus of American power has changed in the post-cold-war world. The United States' influence in the Balkans has waned as the Clinton Administration's primary goal has become avoiding sending American troops to the region. While the Croats dearly want warm relations with the United States, they have other allies. In this instance, American officials said, Germany's decision not to strongly oppose the operation curtailed the American leverage. **********It is not yet clear how the Croatian victory will reshuffle the deck in the Balkans, and whether the American approach will ultimately pay dividends. Mr. Lake has been presenting the European allies with an American peace plan that promises all sides incentives for signing on and punishments for continuing the war. On Sunday, he is to discuss the plan with the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. **********There was at least one high-profile skeptic about the Administration's approach. Peter W. Galbraith, the United States Ambassador to Croatia, had earlier been instructed to try to avoid the war through diplomacy. He began a furious round of last-minute peace talks that won substantial concessions from the rebel Serbs. **********At the last moment, as senior officials in Washington were concluding that his effort could not succeed, Mr. Galbraith urged the Administration to change course and press Mr. Tudjman to accept the deal he had worked out. Senior officials turned down his request. Several believed the Serbs would never honor their promises, and that the time for a diplomatic solution had passed. Two days later, the attack began. **********\"It was too late to stop us,\" said Mario Nobilo, Croatia's representative to the United Nations. \"We thought we knew best how weak they are and how quick this could be.\" **********But Mr. Nobilo also acknowledged that the plan envisioned a \"minimal\" and a \"maximal\" option for the invasion, depending on both the international reaction and the stiffness of the Serbs' resistance. Croatia Builds Modern Army **********When Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Serbs living on its fringes seceded. With the help of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army, they seized about one third of the country, and said they hoped to join a \"Greater Serbia\" that included Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs. **********The fighting in Croatia subsided by January 1992, and the United Nations sent peacekeeping troops to monitor an agreement under which the Serb regions would eventually rejoin Croatia. It never happened. **********Over the next three years, Croatia bitterly complained that the United Nations was failing to fulfill its mandate, fearing the partition of their country would become permanent. Quietly, it began building a modern army that could win back the territory occupied by the Serbs, which the rebels called Krajina. **********In its early days, the Croatian Army was scarcely more organized than a local militia, its soldiers often seen on the battlefields in sneakers. **********Three years later, after hundreds of millions of dollars in purchases in Eastern Europe's arms bazaars, the picture had changed. Although Croatia is covered by the same United Nations embargo that forbids the Bosnians from buying weapons, the Croats, helped by a long coastline that is ideal for smuggling, have had far more success, tapping suppliers throughout the former eastern bloc, particularly Russia and the Ukraine. **********Bihac, a predominantly Muslim enclave just over the border in Bosnia, was one of the key flash points for the Croatian military. The rail line from Serbian-held Bosnian territory to the heart of Krajina wound its way through Bihac. As long as the town was in Muslim hands, the Serbian rebels would not be able to deliver provisions or move troops by train to much of Krajina. **********The rough terrain around Bihac favors the defenders. But the Krajina Serbs joined rebel Serbs from Bosnia in attacks on the town several times. **********Last November, Croatian officials saw a serious threat that Bihac might fall. Gojko Susak, the Defense Minister, summoned Mr. Galbraith to his office and said his Government was thinking about opening a corridor to the town through Serbian-held territory. Would the United States impose sanctions? The American reply was emphatically against such an operation, though no specific sanctions were mentioned. **********In January, Mr. Tudjman announced that he was fed up with the United Nations, and that he would refuse to renew the peacekeeping troops' mandate after March 31. This provoked alarm among some American officials. **********They worried that Mr. Tudjman was planning to attack the Krajina Serbs, which could in turn prompt Serbia to declare war on Croatia. At the time, a shaky cease-fire was holding in Bosnia. **********Richard Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, flew to Zagreb in early March and warned Mr. Tudjman of dire consequences if he did not relent. Germany told Croatia it could not expect to join the European Union if it threw out the United Nations peacekeepers. A few days later, Vice President Gore and Ms. Albright met Mr. Tudjman in Denmark with a similarly tough message. **********The pressure worked. Mr. Tudjman changed his mind in exchange for a United Nations promise to begin monitoring the international border between Croatia and Bosnia. Bosnia Events Alter Strategy **********The cease-fire in Bosnia expired May 1. That day, more than 10,000 Croatian troops stormed into Western Slavonia, the smallest of the four Serbian-occupied areas of the country, retaking it in a lightning strike. **********After that triumph, Mr. Nobilo said, Croatia's plan was to maintain peace through the summer tourist season, and pressure the Krajina Serbs with an ultimatum in the fall. **********Events in Bosnia changed that plan. **********The Bosnian Serbs went on the offensive after NATO's raid on ammunition dumps in the Serbian stronghold of Pale, overrunning the so-called safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa. When Western nations warned the Bosnian Serbs not to attack Gorazde, one of four remaining safe areas, the Serbian forces from Bosnian and Krajina renewed their attacks on Bihac. **********That worried Croatian officials. Once again, the Muslim defenders were giving ground. Once again, they faced the prospects that Krajina Serbs would finally secure their rail link to Serbia. **********Among Pentagon officials, there was a debate about how much could be done to save Bihac. Eventually, the allies' ultimatum was extended to all the safe areas, allowing NATO to bomb the attacking Serbian forces. Bihac, however, was being assaulted by rebel Muslims, Krajina Serbs and Bosnian Serbs. That made it difficult to use air power. Some American officials thought that the only way to save Bihac was to launch a bombing campaign across Bosnia, an idea France opposed. **********On July 22, Mr. Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, met in Croatia to discuss closer military cooperation. The subject of the meeting was Bihac, and Mr. Galbraith, the American Ambassador, attended. According to a Croatian official, Mr. Tudjman promised to send Croatian troops into Bosnia to seize towns just across the border from the Krajina Serb capital of Knin. This, it was hoped, would relieve the pressure on Bihac. **********American officials supported this idea, but warned Mr. Tudjman against attacking Krajina. **********The military assessment had shifted a bit. American intelligence officials were no longer certain Mr. Milosevic would intervene to prevent an attack on the Krajina Serb regions in central Croatia, a view the Croats shared. The threat of a wider war seemed to recede. Still, Pentagon officials were warning that a Croatian attack was a \"a high-risk deal,\" as one put it. **********By Aug. 1, the Croats had taken Bosansko Grahovo, cutting off Knin. The ease of that victory, as well as the Serbs' continued attacks on Bihac, Croatian officials said, encouraged them to push on. In Washington, there was little hope of restraining them. **********\"The issue was, they seem determined to go, and we can't stop them, unless we go to the mat,\" one senior official said. \"The top levels of our Government are fed up with the Serbs. There's no reason to threaten termination of our relations, and it probably won't work anyway.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/business/company-news-shares-of-applied-materials-soar-on-strong-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHARES OF APPLIED MATERIALS SOAR ON STRONG EARNINGS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SHARES OF APPLIED MATERIALS SOAR ON STRONG EARNINGS", "body_text": " **********Shares of Applied Materials Inc. and other makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment rallied yesterday, after the company reported second-quarter results that were better than expected.

And \"the Greatest Show on Earth\" is introducing the first national advertising campaign in its history. **********Ringling \"is the greatest brand on earth,\" said Allen J. Bloom, the circus's marketing and sales director, sounding very much like P. T. Barnum, a predecessor in the job. **********\"Our research has shown us that our name recognition is up there with Coca-Cola and Chevrolet,\" he added, \"and we're older than both. We think it's time to extend our brand.\" **********The new show will arrive next Thursday at Madison Square Garden, Ringling's traditional opening-night venue, with maximum publicity. But marketing has always been very much an internal story in the privately held company. It has never disclosed revenue or income. **********Those with knowledge of the company's operations, however, said that Ringling would buy about $20 million worth of newspaper, radio, television and outdoor advertisements this year in the cities where it tours. That amount is to be supplemented by another $5 million for the new national campaign. **********Mr. Bloom's forerunners, the legendary circus advance men, would be astonished at such princely sums. For generations, before the advent of radio and television, Ringling's advertising focused on the spectacle of the circus itself, which was both attention-getting and cheap. A visiting show's parades, elephant walks and even the raising of the circus tent were all calculated elements in Ringling's pied-piper strategy to draw the citizenry into the tent. **********This year, Ringling \"wanted to take a more global view of who we are, what we are and what our value is,\" said Susannah G. Smith, the company's vice president for corporate communications. \"We play to more people than any other live show -- 11 million people a year -- and our circus appears within 100 miles of 87 percent of the United States population.\" **********Ringling's 125th anniversary year has its own national sponsor: Sears, Roebuck & Company. And Ringling, said Rodney A. Huey, its vice president for public relations, \"wanted to shift from selling the specific attributes of the show to how we benefit the consumer nationally. Circus is a cultural imperative for children and parents in this country.\" **********Marketing experts are not surprised by the campaign. \"Ringling has an awesome advertising machine, and no one knows as much as they do about local marketing,\" said Thomas J. Crangle, an independent event-marketing consultant based in Los Angeles. \"A national campaign is the next logical step.\" **********Why hadn't there been one before? \"It made no sense to have national ads due to the nature of the circus tour,\" Ms. Smith said, because each of Ringling's two touring units travels to more than 90 cities during a two-year run. **********For example, a national campaign trumpeting the performance of Gunther Gebel-Williams, the circus's tiger trainer, at next week's opening in the Garden would be forgotten when the show reaches San Francisco in September. **********But making advertising buys in each market has become increasingly difficult. \"Twenty years ago you could buy spots on three television stations and saturate any local market,\" Ms. Smith said. \"Now you could buy 20 stations and still not saturate, thanks to the segmentation of the audience.\" **********To solve this puzzle, Ringling is relying increasingly on direct marketing: sending ticket brochures to customers in its mailing-list data base of those who have purchased tickets within the last four years. **********Those efforts are then enhanced by local television and newspaper advertising and promotions in supermarkets, department stores, mass merchants and other retailers. **********Ringling is coordinating the new national campaign, Mr. Bloom said. Circus footage was shot by the New York director Steve Horn, a longtime industry favorite who has worked for such clients as Nike, Liz Claiborne and Mitsubishi, and the Seiniger Advertising Group in Beverly Hills, Calif., used it for a test television campaign that ran last month in the New York and Baltimore-Washington markets. Goldberg Fossa Seid Advertising in New York is creating more spots. **********The television message, Mr. Bloom said, is: \"There is no better time to spend with your family than at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\" **********Beyond the image-building, the campaign is \"paving the way for the expanded use of the Ringling brand in the years to come,\" Mr. Bloom said, adding that the company plans to restructure its management to help affix its brand on everything from video games and television programs to movies, snack foods and baby products. **********Can such grandiose plans work? \"The recognition level of the Ringling brand is astounding,\" Mr. Crangle said, \"so cross-pollinating the brand could work if they find people out there in their niche who are favorably disposed to circus. They shouldn't try to sell ice cubes to Eskimos.\" **********Yes, but wouldn't P. T. Barnum have tried?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-goodby-silverstein-wins-at-one-show.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goodby, Silverstein Wins at One Show", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Goodby, Silverstein Wins at One Show", "body_text": " **********Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco has won the most awards, eight, at the One Show for creative excellence in advertising, sponsored by the One Club for Art and Copy. **********At the 19th annual ceremony, held Wednesday night in New York, Goodby, Silverstein, a unit of the Omnicom Group, won for work for clients like American Isuzu Motors, an affiliate of Isuzu Ltd. of Japan. **********The Best of Show Award went to the Amsterdam office of Wieden & Kennedy for a television commercial for Nike Inc. that brought to life soccer players painted on signs on buildings around the world. **********Other multiple award winners were Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, with six; Cole & Weber, part of the WPP Group in Portland, Ore., five, and Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif., four."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/futures-markets-gold-price-makes-sharp-gains-copper-and-soybeans-also-up.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 480, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gold Price Makes Sharp Gains; Copper and Soybeans Also Up", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS; Gold Price Makes Sharp Gains; Copper and Soybeans Also Up", "body_text": " **********Gold prices jumped to an eight-week high yesterday on concern that production will fall in South Africa, just as demand is growing in China. **********\"Gold is in a severe supply deficit,\" said Leanne Baker, precious metals analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.

It turned the main shopping thoroughfare, Church Street, into a pedestrian mall, and attracted a gleaming new shopping center. **********While the area had long suffered from shoplifting, prostitution, assaults and other crimes, stepped-up police patrols had already driven crime down by 25 percent over the last few years. **********The $600,000 surveillance program, concentrated on or near a half-mile stretch of Church Street, has provided 24-hour surveillance through cameras perched atop 20-foot poles placed at intervals of several hundred yards along the bustling street. The program is the result of a joint effort by the local government and businesses, using Government grants and donations. **********While many cities and businesses in the United States have limited video security systems, no other country has embraced the technology as Britain has. The national Government announced late last year that it was making $3.1 million in matching grants available for new projects this year. The program drew more than 200 applications. **********About 200 programs are already in operation in cities like Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Sunderland. The picturesque town of King's Lynn in northeastern England has 60 cameras. **********In Liverpool, the police can monitor the cameras through a screen of their own in a local station house, and are alerted to potential problems by the private security guards operating the system. **********\"It's been very helpful in making arrests, and perhaps more important, in helping us to allocate our resources to where they're most necessary,\" said Superintendent Howard Parry of the Merseyside Police, which patrols Liverpool. **********Mr. Parry said the police had no evidence yet that the system, installed last summer, has cut crime rates, although there are fewer panhandlers, illegal street vendors and professional shoplifters. **********But he said that in the face of videotaped evidence, a higher percentage of those charged with crimes in the central business district are pleading guilty. Local residents, asked on downtown streets, said they felt safer downtown, even at night. **********They also agreed with Mr. Parry that the cameras had not raised any civil rights concerns. There have been scattered objections around the country from critics worried that the system could have a chilling effect on public demonstrations, for instance. **********But for the most part there has been little public debate, in part because the legal system here tends more than in the United States to favor law enforcement over the rights of the accused. **********\"It was quite surprising,\" said Chris Sarno, a researcher at Southbank University's School of Land Management and Urban Policy in London who has sampled public opinion about the video systems. \"There were a few people who were sort of worried about what would happen to the tapes and where were they stored and the like. But in general -- no, there was very little concern about civil rights.\" **********In the Liverpool control center on a recent afternoon, the main concern of the guards on duty, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was tracking the movements of known or suspected shoplifters, prostitutes and muggers. **********For 20 minutes the cameras followed the four young men. Several times, one of the men would enter a store, while the others stood outside as if standing watch. The guards in the control room watched carefully for any sign of stealing. **********The guards in the control room on that afternoon radioed the police.  Then, as the young men rounded a corner, they ran into a waiting police officer. He took down their names and asked by radio if arrest warrants were outstanding on any of them. **********He seemed to give them a bit of a chewing out, and then sent them on their way. They trudged away from the downtown area, out of sight of the cameras, a bit less swagger in their step."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/business/funds-watch.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1995-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1011, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUNDS WATCH", "print_headline": "FUNDS WATCH", "body_text": " **********Tech Alternatives **********Just as there seems to be a movement afoot to put a personal computer on every desk, the mutual fund industry seems on its way to putting a computer stock in every portfolio. **********Technology and computer stocks now account for 16 percent of the holdings of diversified equity funds. That's nearly twice the weighting of such stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Among the 40 top-selling mutual funds, technology stocks now account for 20 percent of the portfolios, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund researcher in Chicago. **********As long as investors are comfortable with such a large stake in a volatile sector, jumping ship is unnecessary. But many investors may not be aware how much of their fund portfolios are riding on the performance of the technology sector, which has been leading the stock market rally this year. Should technology stocks dive, as market cycles suggest will eventually happen, investors may get a rude awakening. **********One way for investors to pare exposure is to make sure some of their funds shun technology issues. Morningstar recently listed five diversified equity funds that have kept their technology holdings below 5 percent in recent years: Longleaf Partners, Scudder Growth and Income, T. Rowe Price Growth and Income, Capital Income Builder and Franklin Equity-Income. No-Loads Gain **********A look at buying habits shows that mutual fund investors are increasingly independent. The percentage of sales through stock brokers is shrinking, while sales directly by fund companies are on the rise. And that trend is likely to continue, said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Sales forces, including brokers, bankers and insurers, accounted for 55 percent of the fund industry's sales last year, down from 69 percent in 1988, according to the Investment Company Institute. **********Mr. Moszkowski says investors feel less need for advice and have become more price sensitive. The booming stock market has helped as well, since stock funds tend to be a strong suit for companies that sell funds directly to the public. The market share lost by stock brokers has been picked up by financial planners and to a smaller extent, by banks. But only a handful of banks are selling funds profitably, Mr. Moszkowski said, and there are already some signs that banks are losing momentum in the fund business. Questions on Ads **********Think mutual fund ads tell only part of the story? You're in good company. **********The advertising regulation department of the National Association of Securities Dealers is concerned that funds are increasingly using incomplete and misleading performance charts in their sales material. So the N.A.S.D., a self-regulatory body, is advising fund companies to clean up their act. **********One problem involves funds that don't show their own performance, but use an index as a proxy. Some ads stress the performance of the S.& P. 500, for example, while playing down the fund's actual performance or even omitting it. **********The N.A.S.D. is telling funds that they should include their own performances prominently in such materials. Furthermore, the sales material should include important caveats. For example, a chart that shows small-company stocks outperforming other investments over a specified period should also note that these stock prices are usually volatile and that government securities offer a fixed rate of return if held to maturity, while stocks do not. Investor Protection **********Should a brokerage firm fail, the investors' last resort is the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. The S.I.P.C. insures up to $500,000 in securities and $100,000 in cash in an investor's account. Not all brokers, though, are covered by the fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission will soon force brokerage firms to make it clear if they lack such protection. Starting on Oct. 2, brokers who are not S.I.P.C. members will have to say so on customer confirmations. Manager Changes **********The Invesco Funds Group has shuffled the managers of five funds. Invesco Emerging Growth passes from Doug Pratt to John Schroer, who continues to co-manage Strategic Health Sciences. Strategic Environmental goes to Jeff Morris from John Schroer. Tom Samuelson, who came from Swiss Bank Capital Markets, picks up Strategic Energy from Dan Leonard. Al Grossi, formerly of the Westinghouse Pension Investments Corporation, takes over Worldwide Capital Goods. Doug Pratt will co-manage the Invesco Growth with Dalton Sim, and continue running Strategic Financial Services. **********Bruno Bertocci, formerly with Rockefeller & Company, joined Stein Roe & Farnham as manager of Stein Roe International. **********John F. Brennan, who manages MFS Value, will also run MFS Capital Growth, replacing Kevin R. Parke, who was named director of equity research. **********Garth Nisbet joined Crabbe Huson as primary fixed-income portfolio manager from Capital Consultants. **********Mark Gordon, formerly the director of mortgage research for Kidder, Peabody Inc., has joined Alliance Capital as chief mortgage strategist. **********David Glen, lead manager of AARP GNMA and U.S. Treasury, was named lead manager of AARP High Quality Bond, previously managed by Bill Hutchinson.

The improvement in the real estate market merits higher valuations for the funds' investments, and cash flow and dividend yields are strong. **********While only five funds specialized in real estate in 1990, with a total of $80 million in assets, there are now 22 funds with more than $1.5 billion under management, said A. Jason Windawi, an analyst with Morningstar, the mutual funds tracking service in Chicago. **********Unlike health care, environmental and Latin American funds, which are fads based on industries or regions peripheral to the world economy, funds devoted to real estate allow investors to participate in one of the world's biggest classes of assets, commercial real estate, he said. For the most part, the funds buy real estate investment trusts, which trade like stocks and own a stake in properties. **********Ms. Belden's favorites include Cohen & Steers Realty Shares in New York; CGM Realty and Fidelity Real Estate in Boston, and PRA Real Estate Securities in Chicago.

But the move by Sumitomo, the third-largest bank in the world, was also praised by analysts as a bold attempt -- at least for the normally conservative Japanese banks -- to bite the bullet and resolve problems quickly. **********\"It's a gutsy move,\" said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. \"It's completely unprecedented. It will make other banks answer the question of why they are not doing that.\" **********Many major banks in the United States have had losses from writing off bad debts. Investors often regard these moves as positive for the long run because they speed the cleanup of the balance sheet. **********But in Japan, analysts said, the all-powerful Ministry of Finance has restrained banks from reporting losses for fear of undermining public confidence in the banking system. **********As a result, banks have been disposing of their bad loans bit by bit, and selling stock in companies they own to compensate for the write-offs. \"If every bank did not take equity gains, every bank would have a net loss,\" said Elizabeth Daniels, banking analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. **********The slow disposal of bad debts, however, has been delaying Japan's recovery from a three-year-long recession, because banks weighed down with bad loans have been reluctant to lend new money. **********Analysts said Sumitomo's action might be emulated by some other banks, but not by many. Most banks do not have the financial strength that Sumitomo has to withstand a big loss. And the Finance Ministry, which approved Sumitomo's move, might be reluctant to see the practice spread too widely. **********\"To suddenly start having a half-dozen or a dozen banks taking a loss, that might cause some worries,\" said J. Brian Waterhouse, an analyst with James Capel in Tokyo. He and other analysts said they saw little risk to Japan's banking system from Sumitomo's action. **********Sumitomo, part of the huge Sumitomo Group based in Osaka, is considered one of the most prestigious, aggressive and profit-oriented banks in Japan. It owns 12.5 percent of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street firm. **********But Sumitomo ran into trouble because of billions of dollars of loans it made to the Itoman Corporation, a scandal-tainted trading company. Itoman invested wildly in real estate and bought Picassos, Chagalls and other works of art as a way to launder money, resulting in the arrests of several executives. Itoman was rescued by Sumitomo Bank and absorbed into another company in the Sumitomo Group in 1993. **********Sumitomo Bank said today that it had been planning to write off 500 billion yen, or about $5 billion, worth of loans in the second half of the fiscal year, but has now increased that to 800 billion yen, or about $8 billion. This includes all the Itoman loans still on Sumitomo's books. **********While the bank will sell some of its stock holdings to partly compensate, it predicted it would still end up with a net loss to its parent company of 280 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, in the fiscal year that ends March 31. Until today the bank had been forecasting a net profit of 35 billion yen. **********At a news conference today, Yoshifumi Nishikawa, a senior managing director, said the bank made a \"strategic choice\" that would improve its financial condition in the medium and long term. He said the loss would be for this year only. **********Sumitomo, which had 1.2 trillion yen, or $12 billion, of nonperforming loans on its books in September, said it had a strong capital position and could withstand the loss. **********Sumitomo's announcement came after the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The bank's shares had ended the day at 1,610 yen, a loss of 20 yen. **********Most Japanese banks made unwise loans during the late 1980's, when Japanese land and stock prices were soaring wildly. But in the early 1990's, the \"bubble\" collapsed and Japan plunged into a recession. **********Japan's 21 major banks reported 13.3 trillion yen, or about $133 billion, of bad loans in September, but that excludes restructured loans on which the banks receive little or no interest. Ms. Daniels of Morgan Stanley estimates that bad loans actually total 40 trillion yen, or $400 billion. **********In October, the Nippon Trust Bank essentially collapsed and predicted a loss of $1.6 billion this fiscal year.

It was the first major carrier to announce results in what is expected to be a record second quarter for the industry. **********But a couple of sour notes could be heard in the fanfare, for good news for the airlines can also be bad news. One problem is that the airlines are trying to persuade Congress to extend a tax exemption of 4.3 cents a gallon on fuel beyond Oct. 1, which would be worth more than $500 million to the industry. With strong earnings, though, politicians are not likely to give the airlines a break. **********\"The exemption for aviation fuel is unwarranted and would be unfair to other sectors of the transportation industry.\" said Cynthia G. Beerbower, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy for the Treasury Department, before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday. **********Second, airlines have long pleaded poverty to their unions, contending that they need wage or productivity concessions to compete against low-cost and low-fare carriers. **********With many carriers still in labor contract talks, they are likely to find that union members are not swayed by the argument that record earnings at present are little more than a drop in the bucket compared with their losses of $13 billion over the last five years. **********Airline unions have long complained that they have pitched in to help in the lean years and have not been invited to the feast in fat years. **********At Continental, pilot representatives are sending a proposal to the union's board this Friday for a vote. Bob Wilson, president of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots, declined to predict how the vote will go. He whistled aloud, however, when told yesterday morning of Continental's profit. \"That is significantly more than we expected,\" he said. **********Other airlines are also negotiating with labor groups that will be closely following quarterly earnings. Delta Air Lines hopes to wrest $340 million in annual savings from its pilots to help fulfill its broader cost-cutting goals. American Airlines, a unit of AMR, is talking with nearly all its labor groups. And USAir is hoping that its three main unions -- pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- will contribute $500 million in annual savings to its goal of cutting costs by $1 billion a year. **********\"That's going to be a hard sell,\" said Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association. He added that pilots were typically willing to entertain proposals, if there was sufficient potential to share in future gains, through stock ownership, for example. **********Paul Karos, an airline analyst at CS First Boston, said that most investors were not counting on significant labor concessions in their earnings estimates. But if the fuel tax exemption is not extended, he said, \"that would be incremental new bad news.\" **********Over all, the airline industry has seen more good news than bad recently. Low-fare competition has declined, in part because Continental has scrapped its Continental Lite experiment. In addition, airlines have been trying to raise fares, and they have been relatively successful because of the infrequency and shallowness of fare wars. **********As a result, many airline stocks have jumped sharply in recent months. Continental's B-class shares, for example, have risen from a low of $6.50 a share in mid-January to $26.625, up 87.5 cents, yesterday. **********The important question, of course, is whether these long-term trends will continue. But for now, at least Continental executives appear eager to celebrate rare good news. **********In a teleconference, executives gleefully rattled off that this was the first year in the last 10 that the carrier made money in the first six months of the year, and that this was the best quarterly profit in the airline's 61-year history. **********\"We're ecstatic here,\" said Gordon Bethune, Continental's president and chief executive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/business/currency-markets-the-dollar-slips-as-trading-quiets-after-volatile-week.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 387, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Dollar Slips as Trading Quiets After Volatile Week", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; The Dollar Slips as Trading Quiets After Volatile Week", "body_text": " **********The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday.

To buy bonds, foreign investors must first purchase dollars. **********In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.4067 marks from 1.4120 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 90.75 yen from 90.90 yen. **********After touching record lows of 1.3455 marks and 88.76 yen on Wednesday, the dollar slowly recovered. Now it is in the process of settling into ranges of 1.34 to 1.42 marks and 88 to 92 yen, Mr. Spence of Standard Chartered said. **********In other currency trading yesterday, the mark continued to climb against the Italian lira. The German currency reached a record high of 1,211.44 lire, lifted by Italy's political and economic difficulties. **********Investor confidence in Italian assets and the lira was further weakened after the governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, said a budget package was \"necessary but not sufficient\" to bring Italy's large budget deficit under control. **********\"The lira-denominated market is very nervous about political developments, and Fazio's comments have clearly added to the concerns,\" said Lorenzo Stanca, currency analyst at Credito Italiano. **********The mark was last quoted at 1,194.07 lire, up from 1,182.72 lire late Friday in New York.

But by announcing that American companies were passed over in a high-profile competition, China is highlighting the potential consequences of diplomatic trouble without actually losing a beneficial deal. **********For all the concern that Beijing is looking for ways to punish American businesses, executives at more than a dozen companies here said they expected the tensions to have little effect on their businesses, especially those involving large investments. **********\"At this point, we don't see any real reason for concern,\" said James J. Paulsen, Ford's chief representative in China. \"I think, based on the rocky relations we've seen between the U.S. and China in the past, that decisions are still based on economic reasons.\" **********Among the large deals for which American companies are competing this year, two are in Shanghai: a $1 billion venture to build passenger cars, where General Motors is considered a front-runner over Ford and Toyota, and two subway projects worth a total of $500 million, a toss-up between a German group and an American consortium that includes General Railway Signal of Rochester and Cubic Automated Revenue Collection of San Diego. **********In each case, executives said, commercial factors are likely to outweigh the nationality of a partner. **********Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce, said in a telephone interview from Paris that his department was carefully tracking a dozen pending projects worth more than $100 million that involve American companies bidding against foreign competitors in the power, transportation and telecommunications fields. \"We have no indication that any have been affected\" by the disputes, Mr. Garten said. **********Besides, Chinese organizations do not want to lose the money and technology that American partners bring, and would likely object if Beijing made any kind of unilaterally anti-American business decisions. **********\"They don't just send out central directives saying, 'Don't do business with Americans,' \" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. \"People seem to think there are five guys sitting around making all the decisions. That's not the way it works.\" **********To be sure, politics does intrude on foreign business operations in China. Several executives said their meetings with Chinese officials on ordinary issues like operating regulations and taxes had become more stern in recent weeks, sometimes interrupted with questions about why the United States Government was interfering in China's affairs. **********In politically sensitive areas like publishing and information services, executives said, it is not a good time to approach the Chinese. Business-related exchanges have been canceled, including a visit by Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to talk to Chinese officials about the advantages of regulation. **********\"When tensions are high,\" said Jim Bercaw, executive vice president of AT&T China, \"no one in the Chinese Government wants to be accused of making a decision\" that looks pro-American. **********Unless, that is, the decision is made at the top. Senior Chinese leaders, in times of strained relations with the United States, sometimes like to reward American companies they regard as particularly friendly -- in the hope that the companies will reciprocate by putting pressure on Washington to ease its stance. **********Last week, senior leaders told the American International Group that it would be allowed to start selling both life and general insurance in the big southern center of Guangzhou, making it the first foreign insurer allowed to operate outside Shanghai, where A.I.G. has been selling insurance since 1992. The timing of the permission surprised even A.I.G., said Michael I. D. Morrison, the company's general manager here. **********Maurice R. Greenberg, the big insurer's chief executive, has been working on his relationships with Chinese leaders for more than 20 years. During a visit to Beijing last week with another \"old friend\" of China, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Greenberg was named special economic adviser to the Beijing municipal government, a position created for him. **********Germany, known for granting generous low-interest loans to finance projects in China involving German companies, appeared to reap a pile of benefits during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Bonn. More than $3 billion of contracts and letters of intent were announced. **********In addition to the mini-van deal, Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., was chosen as a partner in a $50 million venture to make tour buses and bus chassis in Yangzhou, President Jiang's hometown in Jiangsu Province. **********Yet among the dozens of other projects announced, reporters noticed, many were the same ones disclosed last year when Prime Minister Li Peng visited Germany. **********For Mercedes-Benz, auto executives noted, being selected as a partner for a Chinese venture is still some distance from actually signing a contract, to be negotiated only after a feasibility study is completed, which may take more than a year. **********The mini-van project invited attention last year when it seemed to turn into a hot race between Chrysler, the mini-van leader in the United States, and Mercedes-Benz, a company with high name recognition in China but one that has never before made a mini-van. **********Late last year, however, Chrysler executives became frustrated by their negotiations, including what they saw as China's unwillingness to protect Chrysler technology from being illegally copied. Chrysler is particularly sensitive to the issue, in part because the Jeep Cherokees it makes with a Chinese partner in Beijing have been imitated by pirate factories. **********One auto executive who is not with Chrysler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Chrysler was driven away by the \"botched negotiating\" of the Chinese at the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry. **********Executives at Ford, once considered a leading contender for the Shanghai sedan-making venture, said they were surprised early this year when they were asked to submit a bid for the mini-van venture. **********Although Mercedes-Benz was clearly the favorite, Ford executives duly prepared and submitted a proposal. Since they did not really expect to win the deal, Ford executives have stressed their determination to make cars in China in the future. **********\"We do not expect it to be easy, because the logistics and bureaucracy are so complex,\" a Ford executive said of working in China. \"But over the long term, we feel we have to be assembling vehicles here.\" **********Not that doing business in China has ever been easy or predictable. **********\"We knew this wasn't going to be a smooth ride when we got on the bus,\" Mr. Bercaw of AT&T said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/05/world/china-is-said-to-sell-executed-inmates-organs.html": {"writer_name": "Catherine Manegold", "pub_date": "1995-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 596, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Is Said to Sell Executed Inmates' Organs", "print_headline": "China Is Said to Sell Executed Inmates' Organs", "body_text": " **********Two Chinese refugees -- one a former political prisoner and one a former police official -- testified in Senate hearings today that the Chinese Government removes organs from executed prisoners and sells them for use in medical transplants in state-owned hospitals. **********The recipients of the organs, they said, are usually top Chinese officials or foreigners from Hong Kong, Japan, Britain and the United States who need either kidney or cornea transplants and can afford to pay for the operations in foreign currency. **********\"Basically, they look at the prisoner's body as whatever they want it to be,\" said Gao Pei Qi, a former member of China's Public Security Bureau who now lives in exile in London. \"They would take the prisoner's skin, if necessary.\" **********Mr. Gao, who testified through an interpreter, described a prison system so entwined with China's hospitals that executions are scheduled and sometimes ordered in concert with transplant demands. Another witness, Harry Wu, a former political prisoner who now runs a human rights foundation and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, described the transplant system as an \"open secret\" that the Chinese Government does not want exposed abroad for fear of political retribution and pressure to end what has become a lucrative trade. **********Today's testimony, at a hearing conducted by Senator Jesse Helms but attended only by Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, portrayed a hidden world in which the ethical checks and balances of American medical practices do not apply. **********Several witnesses said the testimony showed that the United States should take a harder stance against China. A year ago President Clinton severed the relationship between China's trade status with the United States and its human rights record. **********Mr. Gao, describing the public executions, said death row prisoners were made to kneel before being shot in the head or heart before their corpses were rushed into waiting vans where surgeons removed organs while the bodies were in transit to local crematories. Prisoners whose corneas are to be used are shot through the heart, he said, though other details of the executions vary from one region to the next. When the vans deliver the corpses at their destinations, he said, the removed organs are transferred to waiting vehicles and escorted to local hospitals by the police. **********Many of the transplants occur within 10 hours of a prisoner's death, several witnesses said. **********One ward at the Huzxi University of Medical Sciences in Sichuan Province performed 10 kidney transplants in one day, said Mr. Wu. Another hospital in Hubei Province simultaneously provided five patients with new kidneys, he added. **********While the organ removals are done in secret, Mr. Wu said, the executions are public, with citizens called together to observe them. At times, as many as 15,000 people may gather in a sports arena or other large auditorium for the event, witnesses said. \"It's a big show,\" Mr. Wu said. **********There are no firm figures on the number of organ transplants obtained from prisoners each year, witnesses said. But estimates ranged from 2,000 to 10,000, with most operations involving the replacement of kidneys and corneas, they said. **********Mr. Wu described one incident in which he said an ailing Chinese Air Force pilot was matched with a female prisoner on death row. \"The female prisoner was already sentenced to death,\" said Mr. Wu said. \"But there was no timing for the execution. The pilot needs an organ, so they set up the execution.

They gave much of the credit for the dollar's recovery to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who in recent months has frequently used skills honed on Wall Street to catch speculators off balance -- often during their summer vacations -- making them increasingly wary of placing billion-dollar wagers that the dollar would resume its decline. **********\"Betting against the U.S. Treasury looks like a riskier proposition than it seemed a few months ago,\" an American monetary official said today. Some economists agreed. \"The execution of this strategy could only be called brilliant,\" said Allen Sinai, the global economist at Lehman Brothers, \"in part because it was done so quietly, in part because the Administration has let actions speak louder than words.\" **********After a fall of roughly 20 percent earlier this year, the dollar has regained its lost ground, closing today in New York at 101.16 yen, up from 99.96 yen on Monday.  [ The dollar continued its surge in Tokyo on Wednesday, trading above 102 yen for the first time since June 21, 1994. ] **********There is some risk, of course, that the dollar could reverse direction again. But for now, several senior Administration officials said privately that they were astounded by the speed of the dollar's rebound. **********Back in April, when the dollar touched a record low of 79.75 yen, almost no one in the White House or the Treasury believed that the changing alignment of political and economic forces with Japan and Germany, among other nations, would bring the dollar back so strongly. Most doubted it would recover before the 1996 election. **********Against major European currencies, the dollar showed little change.  The dollar closed in New York at 1.4737 German marks, down slightly from 1.4739 on Monday. The British pound also gained slightly on the dollar, closing at $1.5548, compared with $1.5482 on Monday. **********Economic policy is never far from electoral politics these days, and there is a growing hope in the White House that the stronger dollar -- along with the low inflation that a buoyant currency helps sustain -- will make it far easier to keep interest rates from rising as the election approaches. **********Mr. Rubin took pains today not to declare victory, saying during a telephone conversation that \"markets always make you regret doing that sort of thing.\" He attributed much of the dollar's rebound to a declaration of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in Washington on April 25 that stated that \"Recent movements have gone beyond the levels justified by underlying economic conditions in the major countries.\" **********At the time, the statement and a vaguely worded expression of resolve to cooperate in reversing the trend were dismissed by many traders and commentators as jawboning. **********\"People were skeptical and that was wrong,\" Mr. Rubin said. \"What we said would happen is what in fact occurred.\" **********While President Clinton is one of the big winners from the strengthening of the dollar against the yen, the Japanese may have won even more. The soaring yen had only compounded the troubles crippling the Japanese economy -- turning many of the country's key export industries into money-losers -- and it worsened the precarious condition of the country's banks. The stronger dollar also eases some of the pain of Japan's bad investments in the United States: in yen terms, the Mitsubishi Estate Company's nearly $2 billion fiasco over Rockefeller Center would have looked worse in April than it does today. **********It took some time, however, and that says much about how political fortunes changed. Japan's banking crisis and its deflation worsened, finally scaring its financial authorities into taking steps to pump more money into the economy. Germany's growth slowed, prompting it to lower interest rates and seek a stronger dollar as well. **********And there was good luck: inflation in the United States has stayed low, and the American stock market's rise continued to attract foreign investors. The standoff between the White House and Congress has probably helped as well, convincing investors that a real reduction in the national deficit was on the way. **********In part the dollar has come back because the Bank of Japan, after months of vacillation, has regularly stepped in to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a day to prop the dollar up. Combined with Mr. Rubin's surprise interventions, Japan's determination to buoy the dollar has suddenly made it risky for speculators to be caught holding yen. **********The end of the bitter trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo over automobiles was probably the final factor, economists and some Government officials say, in helping to reverse the psychology that dominated currency markets until recently. While most outside experts were unimpressed with the details of the agreement, it may have cleared the way for Mr. Rubin to press the Japanese to act more decisively in stimulating their economy and dealing with the banking crisis. **********Mr. Rubin communicated frequently with his Japanese counterpart, Masayoshi Takemura, in recent months to nudge Japanese authorities along, but today he declined to give the details of those conversations or speculate about how influential they might have been. **********\"The important point,\" Mr. Rubin said, \"is that we have seen the Japanese Government taking measures to deal with the realities of their economy -- slow growth, declining prices -- and they have now taken some serious measures.\" **********Tokyo's gradual change in attitude has been matched inby Washington, where the accepted wisdom has been that a weak dollar would bolster American exports to Japan, and bring down the trade deficit. But Mr. Rubin's constant incantation that \"a strong dollar is in America's interest\" came to signal a revisionist view that the American economy would be helped even more by a revived Japanese economy than by a struggling one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/world/convicting-cali-s-drug-boss-may-be-as-hard-as-arresting-him.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Convicting Cali's Drug Boss May Be as Hard as Arresting Him", "print_headline": "Convicting Cali's Drug Boss May Be as Hard as Arresting Him", "body_text": " **********It took months of effort and a massive manhunt to capture Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the leader of the Cali cocaine cartel who was arrested Friday and immediately rushed to a maximum-security prison here.

Each time he was able to use his wealth and a battery of lawyers to gain his freedom, helping earn him the nickname \"El Ajedrecista\" -- \"The Chess Player.\" **********The arrest in Cali by a special security unit of more than 1,000 men was the most significant blow against drug traffickers since Pablo Escobar, head of the rival Medellin cartel, was hunted down and killed in December 1993. But for President Ernesto Samper Pizano, it is also a personal victory. **********Since taking office 10 months ago, Mr. Samper has faced accusations that his Government had failed to take an aggressive stance against drug trafficking because he was in league with the Cali cartel. **********\"The capture means a personal sigh of relief for me, because I was exposed to accusations and suspicions,\" the President said in an interview today at his weekend home. \"I feel relief for the country, which was also under suspicion.\" **********The charges against Mr. Samper arose as the result of telephone conversations tape recorded during his campaign last year in which cartel members were heard agreeing to donate $3.75 million to his campaign. Mr. Samper denied knowingly receiving money from the cartel. **********In March, the Clinton Administration, in an annual evaluation of the cooperation it receives from foreign countries, declined to certify Colombia as an effective ally in combating the drug trade. Shortly thereafter, Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill that would deny Colombia important trade benefits unless its performance against drug trafficking improved. **********But in an interview Friday night, Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea denied that the strike against the cartel had come in response to pressure from the United States. Rather, he said, Mr. Rodriguez's capture was the result of \"an incremental effort\" aimed at undermining the cartel from within and leaving its leadership exposed and vulnerable. **********\"The President has from the beginning of his administration ordered the most extreme efforts in order to capture the Cali kingpins,\" Mr. Botero said. **********He said Colombian authorities learned about three weeks ago that Mr. Rodriguez had purchased a house in the exclusive Santa Monica section of Cali with the intent of using it as a hiding place. From that moment on, he said, \"We had female police posing as joggers and policemen dressed as street vendors and the like making the necessary surveillance on this property.\" **********Though he is in custody, Mr. Rodriguez could still become a source of tension between the United States and Colombia. Just this week, he was among a group of 59 people indicted in Miami on drug trafficking charges. **********But the Colombian Constitution prohibits extradition, and Mr. Botero said the Government would abide by that provision. In the past, drug cartel leaders wanted in the United States have been able to continue running their operations from plush quarters in prisons here. **********In 1985 Mr. Rodriguez was arrested in Spain, and both the United States and Colombia sought his extradition. Colombia won, and he eventually was set free. **********Mr. Rodriguez \"will be prosecuted and judged in Colombia, without external pressures,\" Adolfo Salamanca, the deputy chief prosecutor here, said at a news conference on Friday.  He said the American Embassy had offered to supply evidence gathered in the indictments pending against Mr. Rodriguez in the United States.

For example, the fee for a Hertz rental car picked up in Munich, Germany, and left in Milan, Italy, is $320, while it is $464 for one picked up in Milan and dropped off in Frankfurt. **********At least those were the fees, before Hertz recently cut them to about $55 for rentals that begin and end in any of 16 European cities. In addition to Frankfurt and Milan, these also include Amsterdam, Brussels, Geneva, Munich, Paris and Zurich. **********\"The drop-off fee is so high in Europe,\" Lauren Garven, a Hertz spokeswoman, said, \"because some countries require that cars dropped off from another country must be re-rented within a specific time -- and to a driver going back to where the car came from.\" **********For example, a car rented in Paris and dropped off in Munich, she said, must be re-rented within 24 hours to avoid a high drop-off fee -- high, because to comply with such laws it is often necessary for the company that rented the car to send someone to drive the car back. **********\"We looked at our traffic patterns from country to country for over a year,\" Ms. Garvey said. \"When we found the movement was efficient and consistent among those 16 key cities, we decided we could offer the program.\" Always Time for Golf **********Mark Twain described golf as \"a good walk spoiled,\" but there don't seem to be many spoilsports among movers and shakers: A recent poll of the holders of American Express platinum cards found that a majority of them said they would modify their schedule to include a round of golf while traveling for business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/28/business/taking-in-the-sites-for-designers-space-to-do-it-their-way.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Holcomb", "pub_date": "1995-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 560, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking In the Sites; For Designers, Space to Do It Their Way", "print_headline": "Taking In the Sites; For Designers, Space to Do It Their Way", "body_text": " **********In the old neighborhoods south of Times Square, an eclectic community of innovators and artists has grown up around the business of computer graphic designing.

It is written by Carl Goodman, curator of the American Museum of the Moving Image and designed by the Total New York staff. **********On a personal computer with a 486 microprocessor and a fast enough connection (28,800 baud or more), Scanner screams with flashing colors and streaks in motion, before landing in Mr. Goodman's cyber column (he reports that the flashing colors are a result of a bug in Netscape \"that savvy programmers have discovered and exploited\"). On a computer with a 386 microprocessor and a 14,400-bps modem the effects are as disappointing as a motion picture shown at too slow a speed. **********The first link on Mr. Goodman's page takes one to the animated homepage of Razorfish Inc. (again, a fast connection is needed to appreciate the dynamics). He then offers three links in which he promises to \"make fun of easy targets,\" \"offer intelligent linkages,\" and \"present an opinionated calendar of New York media events.\" **********The other links look enticing. The Outpost, for example, was put together by a group of artists in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and offers a look at their work and their lives. Unfortunately, a few of the other links go nowhere. **********Mr. Goodman's discussion of New York's media designers introduces some of the region's noteworthy design and production resources and provides links to organizations and consortiums like the Center for Digital Multimedia of New York University. **********Certainly there are other geographic clusters of cybertalent in the world, and many of their inhabitants have produced fascinating Web sites.

In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Omnicom shares closed up 75 cents at $58.50. Omnicom bested a second suitor, Richard Humphreys, a partner in the holding company that controls N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York. **********Omnicom has been a principal reason for the continuing consolidation of the agency industry, buying independents like Chiat/Day, Griffin Bacal and TBWA International in the last two years. It has grown to become the world's second-largest agency company in billings, according to Advertising Age, with 1994 billings of almost $16.1 billion, behind only the WPP Group at $20 billion. **********\"We get about equal parts of growth through acquisitions and organic means,\" said Bruce Crawford, president and chief executive of Omnicom in New York. **********\"But we're not on an acquisition binge,\" he added. \"It's all strategic. With Ross Roy, it's a strategic step in the marketing services area, where they're very strong.\" **********Ross Roy, based in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is the 27th-largest agency in the United States, according to Advertising Age, with 1994 billings of $508 million from clients like the Chrysler Corporation and Domino's Pizza. It lost a big important account last month when the Kmart Corporation left after 26 years for Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis. **********Ross Roy has about 800 employees in offices in Bloomfield Hills; Hanover, Md., a Baltimore suburb; Windsor, Ontario, and Woodland Hills, Calif. It will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, and its current management will remain in place. Ross Roy will join a division known as Diversified Agency Services with 35 autonomous units offering clients direct marketing, sales promotion, advertising and other services. **********\"There may, I think, be a little bit of nostalgia on the part of some of our folks,\" said Peter R. Mills, chairman and chief executive of Ross Roy, which was founded in 1926 by Ross Roy, a former automobile salesman who became a Detroit advertising pioneer and died in 1983 at age 85. **********\"But I think at this point in time most people are beyond that,\" he added, because \"if you look at the trends it's becoming clearer and clearer\" that agency companies like Omnicom represent an increasingly attractive option to all but the largest independents. Mr. Mills will report to John Wren, chairman and chief executive of the diversified services division. **********Omnicom's interest in Ross Roy was initially piqued more than two years ago, Mr. Crawford said, but talks were broken off after some discussions about Ross Roy's being absorbed into BBDO. Omnicom's interest in Ross Roy, then as now, was primarily because they share a significant client, Chrysler. BBDO is the agency for Chrysler's Dodge division, while Ross Roy is direct marketing agency of record for Chrysler. **********\"I don't think anyone views this as anything but an opportunity\" to better serve Chrysler and other clients, said Mr. Mills, who held top executive positions at BBDO in Canada and the United States before joining Ross Roy in June 1993 as president and chief executive of its advertising operations. **********For instance, he added, Mr. Wren told him of a client of Diversified Agency Services in Toronto \"with some pretty significant telemarketing needs, but D.A.S. in Toronto doesn't offer telemarketing.\" \"But,\" he said, \"our office in Windsor does.\" **********The other offer before the Ross Roy board was from Mr. Humphreys, a former executive of the Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide unit of Cordiant P.L.C. He is now president of Adcom, a company that owns most of Ayer; Ross Roy and Ayer are joint venture partners in a direct marketing agency, Worldwide 1 on 1. A third bidder, the Bozell Worldwide unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, dropped out in early May; Bozell, like Ross Roy and BBDO, is a Chrysler agency. **********\"We had three pretty aggressive bidders,\" Mr. Mills said, but \"at the end of the day, our board felt Omnicom offered the best of both worlds, a financially strong partner and relative autonomy.\" **********\"We can operate independently to leap over conflict hurdles,\" he added, \"and still have a big daddy there with big pockets if you need it.\" **********Ross Roy's turning down of the bid from Mr. Humphreys could have implications for Ayer, according to trade publications, which have reported that W.Y. Choi, who owns Adcom with Mr. Humphreys, is reluctant to pursue acquisitions. If Mr. Humphreys and Mr. Choi part ways, senior executives of Ayer might seek equity stakes in that agency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/business/accord-is-reached-on-a-common-security-system-for-the-internet.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1995-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 520, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accord Is Reached on a Common Security System for the Internet", "print_headline": "Accord Is Reached on a Common Security System for the Internet", "body_text": " **********The three largest consumer on-line information systems and two major Internet software companies said today that they had agreed to adopt a common technology for protecting commercial transactions on the Internet from hackers, thieves and eavesdroppers. **********The agreement, announced before Tuesday's opening of the Spring 1995 Internet World Trade Show here, is expected to hasten the development of on-line shopping services and other commercial uses of cyberspace. **********Judging by the crowd here today, the advances cannot come soon enough.

For more than a decade, the station's announcers and transmitters were constantly under fire and on the move, eluding bombing attacks and ambushes intended to silence them. **********El Salvador is at peace now, and has been for nearly three years, but Radio Venceremos continues to broadcast -- though not from the hills, and not in the name of a guerrilla movement. Instead, the station has settled into comfortable studios on a quiet residential street here and has gone commercial, replacing its battle reports with the music of Madonna, Phil Collins, Air Supply, the Eagles and Boyz II Men. **********\"Our format and our audience are adult contemporary,\" explained Carlos Henriquez Consalvi, who under the nom de guerre Santiago was the station's primary announcer during the 12-year civil war. \"During the war, we did not have to pay rent or telephone bills, but now we do, and that means we have to play the music that people want to listen to.\" **********Throughout that conflict, Radio Venceremos, broadcasting from the mountains of Morazan Province with a second-hand 60-watt transmitter, later upgraded to 1,000 watts of power, was essential listening for diplomats, journalists and the front's own combatants. Working for the station meant \"doing radio with a microphone in one hand and a gun in another, broadcasting underground and amid flying bullets,\" as a writer, Jose Ignacio Lopez Vigil, described it in a recent history of Radio Venceremos called \"Rebel Radio\" (Curbstone Press, 1994). **********The transition to being \"a normal station, a radio station like any other\" has not been easy, said Marvin Galeas, who joined Radio Venceremos in 1982 and is now a member of the station's board of directors. But the process has been eased somewhat by similar changes that have occurred throughout Salvadoran society, as onetime enemies struggle to learn to live with one another and former allies take diverging political paths. **********At first, when the station's announcers and engineers returned to the capital and tried to resume civilian life, there were some death threats. The quarters Radio Venceremos was able to rent, and now hopes to buy, are owned by a member of the right-wing Arena Party, which during the civil war sponsored the death squads that massacred thousands of suspected rebel sympathizers. **********In place of guerrilla communiques, the 5,000-watt station now has commercials, including public service announcements paid for by the Salvadoran Government. During last year's election campaign, Radio Venceremos even broadcast the jingles of the Arena campaign slate, the winning presidential candidate, Armando Calderon Sol, among them. **********\"Business is business,\" Mr. Galeas said. \"That is the only way for us to stay on the air and pay our employees.\" Mr. Calderon Sol, he added, calls on Radio Venceremos reporters at news conferences, and his remarks are broadcast on the station. **********After the move to the capital, the station formally severed its links with the rebel front, which has itself now splintered, and also parted company with the front's political commissars. Later, five members of the news department were dismissed in an internal dispute that grew out of the management's decision not to support a teacher's strike. **********At the time, the dissidents argued that the station had a moral obligation to endorse automatically any action undertaken by left-wing labor unions or political movements. Radio Venceremos continues to emphasize news coverage, but prefers to offer what Mr. Galeas describes as reporting that is \"balanced, professional and intelligent, not contestatory,\" and has occasionally used programming material from the Voice of America's Spanish-language service. **********\"In the past, we did propaganda and political agitation,\" Mr. Henriquez Consalvi said. \"Now we want to do real journalism, and that means we cannot be the appendix of a political party.\" **********Such pragmatism, however, has not gone down well with some of the station's old admirers. Mr. Galeas said a German foundation affiliated with the Green Party, which had long supported Radio Venceremos with generous grants, cut off its financing in January for just that reason: \"They thought we had drifted too far to the right and were getting too bourgeois,\" he explained. **********As a result, Radio Venceremos has had to step up its efforts to attract advertisements from businesses, some of which are still reluctant to be associated with the station because of its guerrilla past. To soften that image, the station now more often bills itself as \"Your RV, an open window\" rather than use its full, formal name, taken from a leftist slogan that means \"We Shall Triumph.\" **********Though advertisers may still be hesitant about the station, listeners are not, which veterans of the old days find especially encouraging. Ratings here are not as reliable as in the United States, but Radio Venceremos consistently ranks in the top fifth overall in most radio surveys, rising in some to as high as second during the early morning rush hour. **********\"For some one to say that they listen to Radio Venceremos is itself a sign of the profound changes this country has experienced,\" Mr. Henriquez Consalvi said. \"To make such an admission five years ago could have meant death. No, the fear is diminishing, and that makes me optimistic about our future.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/01/business/investing-it-minding-your-business-an-options-strategy-for.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1995-10-01", "snippet": "Q.

My broker suggested that I sell call options against some blue chip stocks I own. Isn't this a risky type of investment where only the broker ends up winning by making a commission?T. ESTRANew York CityA. Not necessarily. Let's face it, all investments carry some degree of risk. Nicholas W. Leeson, the rogue trader who last February lost $1.8 billion in Singapore and promptly took down Britain's oldest bank, Barings P.L.C., was trading in that scariest of investments, derivatives. **********But Toshihide Iguchi, the Daiwa trader who allegedly lost $1.1 billion and was arrested last week, was playing with Treasuries, that supersafe bond backed by Uncle Sam. **********In other words, how you use an investment sharply affects its risk. And what your broker seems to have in mind -- selling options against shares you already own -- is one of the few options strategies that make sense for individual investors. **********Known as writing covered calls, this tactic is a conservative way of insuring part of your portfolio against a decline, according to Stephanie L. Ackler, a vice president at Tucker Anthony, a financial services firm. **********Okay, here's how it works. Imagine you own 100 shares of XYZ Technology, and you are worried its price will fall, either for company-specific reasons or due to a broad market downturn. To soften the impact of such a drop, you sell an option to another investor to buy your stock. **********This \"call\" option gives the other person the right to buy your shares at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, within a certain period of time. One call covers 100 shares of stock. If XYZ is trading at $44, for example, imagine that you sell one November call at a strike price of $45. You get $300 for selling this right. **********First, the $300 goes into your account and you keep that no matter what. Next, one of two things will take place. If the market falls and XYZ stock closes at, say, $39 at some point before expiration, which occurs the third Friday in November, the option holder will have no interest in buying your stock at $45. The option will expire worthless. And, with the $300 you have pocketed, you have cut in half the losses on your 100 shares due to the stock's decline. If the stock stays at $44, you have made money on the deal, to the tune of $300. **********But suppose instead that the market rises and XYZ closes at $55 at the option's expiration. The defensive technique of writing covered calls doesn't work well in such a rise. The option holder will naturally elect to buy your 100 shares for $45 apiece.  You do get the $300 from sale of the option, but that isn't nearly enough to make up for the $1,000 you lose in selling stock for $45 a share in a market where it is getting $55. **********Knowing that this can occur, you may want to consider selling calls on only half the number of XYZ shares in your portfolio. This way you won't miss out completely should the stock go up. **********And you should select sleepy stocks -- those equities in your portfolio likely to remain at or around their current levels, said Ms. Ackler.  An example is Lilco,, the Long Island utility, which has been sluggish lately. A contrary example is a volatile stock like Cyrix, a technology company. While you will doubtless get more money for selling options on such a stock, you will also run a greater risk of missing out on a significant upside move. **********But be aware that selling calls without owning the underlying stock is an entirely different strategy. This is an uncovered position -- and a very risky one, even for the pros. I know, having been a floor options trader on the American Stock Exchange for a few years. A number of my colleagues had to trade in their yachts for rowboats. **********Still, even writing covered calls requires cautions. One big one: unless you know exactly what you're doing don't fly solo. Options are complicated, but more than that, they can be very volatile. Should you ever drop into a busy options pit around lunch hour, you'll observe the traders chomping their sandwiches, eyes riveted on the computer screens above them and essentially afraid to leave. Don't go it alone. **********Second, read \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options,\" a booklet your broker should send you when you open an options account. You may also want to read a book on the subject. Given that most tomes in the investment section of your local superstore are much too complicated -- as if the authors expect George Soros or Warren Buffett to buy one for a brush-up session -- look for something more easily understood. **********I suggest \"Getting Started in Options,\" by Michael Thomsett (John Wiley & Sons, $17.95). Just so you know where I'm coming from, my idea of a beginner's book is Elbert S. Mahoney's \"Chapman's Piloting, Seamanship & Small Boat Handling,\" which begins with the weighty question, \"What is a boat?\" **********However, if you don't get around to the book (there are only 84 days left for holiday shopping) here are a few guidelines. Always know your potential profit and loss before trading an option. **********Ms. Ackler warns against selling a call for under a half point ($50) since it won't be worth the commission cost. And don't get carried away; most professional portfolio managers only sell call options on 5 to 10 percent of their entire holdings. **********If you follow these rules and if you have the stomach for it, by all means listen to your broker and let him play the options game. After all, when Charles F. Kettering, a top executive at General Motors years ago, said we should all be concerned about the future because we will have to spend the rest of our lives there, he might just as well have been talking about options trading. **********But if you are the type to get upset if you make a bad options trade, heed the advice of Sam Goldwyn, the malapropist filmmaker of yore: never make any predictions, especially about the future. **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, in care of Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

Borland sold the Quattro Pro program to Novell in March 1994, but would nonetheless be liable for damages if Lotus eventually won its suit. **********The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that Lotus had no claim against Borland alarmed many in the industry, who warned that the court's analysis could easily extend beyond the menu commands at issue in this case to software programs in general. \"Virtually all elements of a program are means of operating some aspect of a computer,\" a brief from an organization called Intellectual Property Owners told the Supreme Court in support of the appeal by Lotus, which was acquired by International Business Machines in July. **********The Copyright Act of 1976 protects computer programs, defined in the law as \"a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\" The First Circuit Court drew a distinction between the ordinary computer program and the \"user interface\" at issue in this case, which one of the appeals judges, Michael Boudin, analogized to the familiar QWERTY layout on a typewriter keyboard. **********All typists \"would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on the production of such a keyboard\" if copyright protection were available for the arrangement of keys that operates a typewriter, Judge Boudin said in a concurring opinion. **********Borland offered its own analogy to the Supreme Court, describing the menu commands that operate a program as similar to the buttons on a videocassette recorder that operate the machine. Borland's brief drew a distinction between the commands and the program itself, which it said was \"copyrightable in the same way that the literal text of a play would be\" but was not at issue in this dispute. **********In its Supreme Court appeal, Lotus v. Borland, No. 94-2003, Lotus described the appeals court ruling as \"a jarring departure from the prevailing consensus\" and warned that the health of the software industry would be threatened if it could not rely on copyright law \"to protect the fruits of its creative efforts.\" **********The Court will hear the case in January. **********In stock trading today, shares of I.B.M. rose $1.50, to $94.375, on the New York Stock Exchange, while Borland shares fell 37.5 cents, to $14.125, in Nasdaq trading. **********As the Justices prepared for the official opening of the Court's term next Monday, they added several other business cases to their calendar, including these: Banks and Insurance **********The Justices agreed to resolve a dispute among the lower Federal courts and decide whether states can block national banks from selling insurance from their small-town branches, an activity that is authorized by Federal law. **********A provision of a 1916 banking law, known as Section 92, permits national banks that are \"located and doing business in any place\" with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants to act as agents for \"any fire, life or other insurance company.\" The Comptroller of the Currency has interpreted this provision broadly to permit banks with branches in small towns to sell insurance not only to residents of those towns, but also to customers anywhere in the state. **********The case before the Court is an appeal by Barnett Bank of Marion County, Fla., a subsidiary of Barnett Banks, from a ruling earlier this year by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. That court ruled that despite Section 92, Florida had the right to stop Barnett from operating an insurance agency it had acquired in Belleview, Fla., a town of 2,666, where the bank has a branch. **********Ruling that Florida could apply a state law that barred any financial institution from engaging in \"insurance agency activities,\" the appeals court invoked a Federal law, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the states the power to regulate the \"business of insurance.\" **********The Comptroller of the Currency's office joined Barnett's appeal, in a brief filed by Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d. The brief said the McCarran-Ferguson Act should not apply because Florida in this instance was seeking to regulate banking, not insurance. The appeals court's analysis \"permits significant and unwarranted state interference with activities that Congress has specifically authorized national banks to undertake,\" the brief continued. **********Florida is defending its law, which is similar to laws in 14 other states including Connecticut and New Jersey, as a consumer-protection measure. The Solicitor General's brief disparaged this characterization, saying that the most plausible explanation was a desire to protect insurance agents against competition from banks. Shares of Barnett Banks rose 87.5 cents yesterday, to $56.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is Barnett Bank v. Gallagher, No. 94-1837. Patent Juries **********The Court agreed to decide whether, in a patent-infringement case, there is a constitutional right to a jury trial to resolve a factual dispute about the meaning of the patent. **********In this case, Markman v. Westview Instruments, No. 95-26, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court here that has nationwide jurisdiction over patent appeals, ruled in April that judges rather than juries should ordinarily determine what a patent means. The judges, by virtue of their specialized training, are better suited to this task than juries, the court said in an 8-to-3 ruling that was a departure from its own precedents. **********The particular dispute in the case is a limited one: a patent-infringement suit by the inventor of an inventory-control system for use in the dry-cleaning business against the inventor of a competing system. The case comes down to the meaning, in the disputed patent, of the word \"inventory,\" which the appeals court said referred to articles of clothing themselves and not just to the invoices. The appeals court ruled that the defendant's system, which keeps track of invoices but not the clothes, did not infringe the plaintiff's patent. **********But the broader issues are intriguing, involving both the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases as well as a debate about whether the traditional jury system is up to the challenge of handling the scientific and technological cases that are increasingly common."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/earning-it-vineyard-immigrant-s-search-for-logic-leads-him-top-cpa-class.html": {"writer_name": "J.

When he immigrated here from the Soviet Union in 1990 he spoke little English and worked in a deli. \"You want lettuce on that?\" he used to say. \"Mustard or mayonnaise? Tomatoes?\" **********Now Mr. Sorkin is an accountant with a Big Six firm, KPMG Peat Marwick. And he says that complicated terms like amortization, depreciation and intangible assets are a piece of cake. **********It's a classic: the hard-driving immigrant. But Mr. Sorkin is not merely upwardly mobile. By one measure, he has gone higher than anyone else. Just a few months after his graduation from Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., he earned the best score in the nation on the legendarily difficult Certified Public Accountant exam. **********In other words, just as he switched from Russian to English, this 23-year-old son of Communism also mastered capitalism's main language in five years. **********\"It was a pretty hard test,\" he said, swishing a prawn through clarified butter at a downtown restaurant here. \"But . . .\" He trailed off, modestly. **********Very modestly, in fact.  Only about 12 percent of prospective C.P.A.'s pass the four-section, 15 and a half-hour exam on their first try. **********Mark M. Chain, a partner at another of the Big Six firms, Deloitte & Touche, said many of the field's top people had taken the test three or four times before they could put those three letters after their names. **********\"Anyone who passes the first time, much less gets the highest score, it's pretty amazing.\" he said, confessing that he took the test three times. **********Moreover, Mr. Sorkin was not flush with resources on either side of the Atlantic. He was born into a working-class family in Gomel, a small city 175 miles southeast of Minsk in Belarus. **********\"In Russia it's not what you know but who you know that counts -- and we didn't know anyone,\" he said, laughing. It didn't help that Gomel was the site of some of Chernobyl's heaviest fallout. **********So Mr. Sorkin and his family immigrated to Pawtucket, R.I., on Feb. 12, 1990. His father found work as a mechanic and his mother cleaned rooms at a nursing home, while Mr. Sorkin and his younger brother went to school. **********Mr. Sorkin said he majored in accounting to be able to make a living right out of college. But he also gives other reasons for his career choice -- and in them are clues to the desire that took him so far, so fast. **********\"I was drawn to accounting because I was curious about America,\" he said. \"Business is the engine of the society. Here the system is rational. There's a procedure for everything, from getting movie tickets to doing a leveraged buyout. Once I plugged into the logic of how things work, I was, like they say, a duck in water.\" **********He paused, then traced the story back again to his childhood in Russia. **********He recalled the ever-longer lines for basic goods in the late 1980's as the Soviet system breathed its last gasps, with crime and rampant inflation rising and expectations nonexistent. **********\"As a student there I was drawn to math because it was logic and order,\" he said. \"It was a rational realm in a world without reason.\" **********And now he is surrounded by the order he craves. **********\"When the results came back from the test everyone here congratulated me and I got a small bonus,\" he said, popping another prawn into his mouth. \"Then it was back to work.

Adding peripherals \"will become child's play,\" he said. **********For millions of PC owners, ease of use can't happen fast enough. The back of a typical PC is an uninviting collection of bare connectors. Attaching a new device, like a scanner or tape backup drive, is about as straightforward as triple-bypass surgery. In many cases, it involves opening the computer and inserting a circuit board, installing the appropriate driver software and sometimes getting out the magnifying glass and fiddling with little switches or configuring and reconfiguring software in an attempt to mediate incompatibilities with the system. **********Most ports on the back of a PC have a particular function: one for the modem, another for the keyboard, still another for a printer or a scanner, and so on. Oh, you want to hook up two printers? Easier said than done. **********The universal serial bus, on the other hand, consolidates the functions of the computer's parallel port, serial port, keyboard port, mouse port and others into a single connector that sends data at the moderately high speed of 12 megabits per second. No longer does each port need a dedicated controller associated with a particular function. With the universal serial bus, the user will be able to hook up any of dozens of peripherals, including several of the same type, into a single connector simultaneously, by daisy-chaining the devices. **********The universal serial bus is one manifestation of the Plug and Play specification co-developed by Microsoft and Intel, in which the bus automatically detects when devices are being added or removed. The bus also determines what software drivers each peripheral needs and loads them. **********\"It should make life easier for customers,\" said James L. Pappas, program manager in charge of the bus's development at the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. \"They won't have to skin their knuckles opening up the box.\" **********The new bus specification was developed by a consortium that includes I.B.M., NEC, Compaq, Northern Telecom and Digital Equipment. The idea for it came as the PC telecommunications industry started pushing for a higher-speed bus that could handle the various communications products under development, like integrated services digital network modems and cards that turn the PC into a phone answering machine or call management center. The idea was to develop a bus specific to the telecommunications market. But the idea of squeezing yet another specialized port onto the back of the PC made a lot of people in the industry cringe. **********\"The PC industry has evolved ad hoc,\" Mr. Pappas said. \"We were always adding one more piece of baggage.\" **********Carl Stork, Microsoft's director of Windows hardware programs, was one of the people who could be seen cringing the most. \"I thought to myself, 'You're going to give me another connector that's not any easier to use?' \" Mr. Stork said. Instead, he dug in his heels and starting looking for a satisfying permanent solution. **********The idea for a universal bus was not altogether original. Earlier, a group of developers led by Philips Electronics, the Dutch giant, had tried to popularize a universal bus, called the Access Bus. But the effort largely failed because the bus was not fast enough to accommodate the range of products that were to be delivered in the coming years, and Philips had trouble persuading developers to support it, Mr. Doherty said. Similarly, the Apple Desktop Bus found on all Macs was deemed too proprietary for PC's. **********Even though the list of companies endorsing the universal serial bus is an impressive one, support for it is less than universal. Apple Computer and AT&T are supporting an alternative bus, called the Geoport, but it too has limitations. For starters it is aimed at meeting the needs of the telecommunications market, rather than solving the problem of proliferating buses. It is also slower, operating at only 2 megabits a second. **********A chief advantage of the universal serial bus is its compactness: it takes up less than one square inch -- currently, the various connectors fill half the back of a desktop PC. And that should make it an instant hit on notebook computers, where real estate is so scarce. **********Some analysts say that by 1996 the new bus will be a standard feature on virtually all new PC's. Others are more cautious. Mr. Pappas compares it to the industry transition from 5.25-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch ones. For years after the first 3.5-inch drives arrived, PC manufacturers included both drives to protect users' investments. **********Yet whatever progress it brings, the universal serial bus will not eliminate every port found today, in part because its top speed is limited. Ports for local-area networks, hard drives and monitors will still be needed, because they all require higher speeds. But the bus may serve for just about everything else. **********Numerous other ease-of-use issues remain for the PC world, most notably the lack of an industry standard for CD-ROM's and also for sound cards, making every purchase of new software a potential compatibility issue. **********Oddly, though, neither the mess at the back of the machine nor the other issues have kept other personal computers from outselling the Macintosh 10 to 1."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-health-for-youth-on-council-s-agenda.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Health for Youth On Council's Agenda", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Health for Youth On Council's Agenda", "body_text": " **********The Advertising Council, the agency industry's public service organization, said yesterday that it would place additional emphasis on campaigns that benefit \"the health and well-being\" of the nation's youth. **********As part of the new initiative, called \"Commitment 2000: Raising a Better Tomorrow,\" the council will introduce multiple, multiyear campaigns focusing on social issues like health care, education, family and community concerns.

The incident also seemed reminiscent of one that occurred on March 5, when 11 passsengers were taken to hospitals complaining of headaches and eye pain after exposure to fumes on a different train in Yokohama. That case has not been solved. **********Yokohama Station on Wednesday afternoon was a mixture of havoc and the humdrum. About three dozen military chemical warfare specialists went to the station with their gas-resistant uniforms and decontamination equipment. Ambulances gathered outside the station and began taking people to hospitals. Helicopters circled overhead. Riot policemen roped off a huge area in an underground passageway for an investigation. **********But train service was barely interrupted, and commuters continued to stream through the station, which serves 1.5 million passengers a day and is the main rail hub of this port city of 3.2 million people, just southwest of Tokyo. Some people covered their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs, even though any odor had long since dissipated. **********A railway spokesman said passengers had reported smelling fumes in a wide underground passage that connects the east and west exits of the station. Somewhat later, witnesses said, fumes were apparent in a hallway one level up that is lined with shops. The shops were closed by the police but reopened late in the afternoon. **********Mariko Hashimoto, a college student who was in the hallway, said she had seen \"a couple of people\" injured by gas. **********\"They cried a lot and their eyes were red,\" Miss Hashimoto said, and one man had fallen to the ground. She said that she had not smelled anything but that her throat had briefly become sore. \"I felt like someone was pushing on my chest,\" she added. **********About the same time, passengers arriving at the station on the Keihin Tohoku line from Tokyo complained of strange odors. There were more complaints from passengers on the train at Kannai Station, two stops beyond Yokohama Station, and at Ishikawacho Station, three stops down, said a spokesman for the East Japan Railway Company. At Ishikawacho, the train was evacuated and inspected for 10 minutes, but nothing was found, he said. **********Hiroko Nei, a passenger on the train, said that as soon as people boarded at Yokohama Station, they began jumping back out of the car saying there was a strange smell. **********\"I smelled something, and I started to cough and I had something in my eyes,\" Mrs. Nei recalled, saying the smell was irritating but hard to describe. She said the experience had lasted only two or three minutes and the pain and coughing abated quickly, so she went home. Later, though, she decided to go Saiseikai Kanagawa Hospital as a precaution. **********Hiroshi Yoshio, a doctor at that hospital, said most patients needed no treatment other than an intravenous drip. He said that although they had sore throats, they could talk and swallow. **********Descriptions of the fumes were varied. Some peoples reportedly described the fumes as smelling like sulfur, others like nail polish remover. **********The Kyodo News Service quoted witnesses as saying they saw a white liquid spilled on the floor in the underground passage after seeing a man, dressed in black and in his late 20's, walk through the passage with some luggage. **********A woman told a television reporter that she had smelled something like nail polish remover and choked after a thin man in his 20's walked by her carrying something in his hand that was little bigger than his fist. **********Kyodo also quoted witnesses as saying that investigators had found some blue vinyl bags containing liquid in the passageway. But television reports quoted the police as saying they had found no remnants of chemicals or of containers. **********Whatever the fumes were, they apparently dissipated quickly. Many people near the scene said they had not smelled anything. **********\"I only realized something happened when the police came,\" said Morihiro Murata, who was working in a kiosk in the underground passage at Yokohama Station. \"Until around 1:20, when the police started to evacuate the area, it looked normal and everyone was continuing to shop.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/business/credit-markets-bond-prices-move-higher-on-jobless-claims-report.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 772, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Prices Move Higher On Jobless-Claims Report", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Bond Prices Move Higher On Jobless-Claims Report", "body_text": " **********The Labor Department's report that more Americans than expected filed for jobless benefits last week sent bond prices higher yesterday.

Since the bonds are exposed to market fluctuations, the investment bankers hedge that exposure with short positions in Treasury securities. **********\"So, of course, the next step when the underwriters do sell the corporate issue,\" he said, is to \"unwind the hedge positions by buying back Treasury securities.\" This, he said, has helped fuel the latest run-up in Treasury prices. **********An offering by Cox Communications Inc., which is controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc. was well received by investors yesterday, and the company increased the size of the deal by 19 percent, to $950 million, through the CS First Boston Corporation.

The bottom line for the market is that it definitely puts into play the strong likelihood of an interest rate cut at the July meeting of the F.O.M.C.\" **********But the prospect of a July Fed easing, Mr. Maude said, could change quite a few times before the policy meeting. Among the key data to be released before the meeting is held are those in the National Association of Purchasing Management's report. **********Mr. Maude said that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, \"constantly refers to vendor performance and feels it is a good measure of the health of the manufacturing sector as compared to the durable-goods reports, which are usually volatile.\" The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the report on May's durable-goods orders this morning. **********Mr. Maude said the coming purchasing-management report could swing the vote in either direction. \"If it weakens significantly more, then a easing is almost certain,\" he said. **********Traders said yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills did not produce any surprises.

The regular players have said that if United States District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor grants an injunction in their favor, they would be willing to end their strike. The owners, who have said they do not want to play this season under the previous economic system, could them lock them out and field the replacement players. But they would suddenly find themselves at risk of having to pay huge fines, if they lost a second round in the courts. **********\"If you lock people out, you can hire temporary replacements; there is no question about that,\" said David M. Silberman, a labor law expert at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. \"But the risk in doing that -- the reason the owners might hesitate -- is that the damages are considerable.\" **********The courts, in effect, would have to decide whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice or a fair one. A fair lockout would be one that is a continuation of the battle over \"economic issues,\" which means the terms of a new contract. Using replacement workers, temporary or permanent, during lockouts over economic issues is legal. An unfair lockout would be one imposed without first engaging in strenuous good faith bargaining over the \"economic issues.\" **********If the judge grants the injunction, perhaps on Friday after a hearing, the owners could then lock them out, assuming 21 of the 28 teams vote to do so. But that would almost certainly draw the case back into court in the early weeks of the season for a battle over whether the lockout was fair or unfair. **********Under the National Labor Relations Act, if a court ruled that the lockout was unfair, the owners would have to immediately dismiss the replacement workers, take back the regulars -- if the players' union still wanted to end the strike -- and pay the players as a penalty two or three times their wages during the lockout period. That's no problem for lockouts involving auto workers or steelworkers. Their wages are clearly defined. But who knows how much to pay a major leaguer who had not yet signed a contract for this season -- the situation for most of the 700 or so players. **********The National Labor Relations Board, established in 1935 to govern relations between unions and management, plays a big role in this process. The board's general counsel, Fred Feinstein, with the backing of the five-member board, brought the court action that Judge Sotomayor is to rule on. The N.L.R.B. asked for an injunction against what Feinstein, responding to the outcry of the players, described as an unfair labor practice by the owners. **********The owners, according to Feinstein, unilaterally and precipitously changed the rules on player free agency and salary arbitration without first trying hard enough to reach agreement through collective bargaining. If the judge agrees, then the rules under the old contract on salary arbitration and players' rights as free agents would be temporarily restored -- and the players have said that in these circumstances, they would end their strike. **********The owners, although reinstating the old rules, could then lock out the players, perhaps immediately or after a few days of resumed negotiations, to help strengthen their case that they had done all they could to reach an agreement and they therefore had a right to continue the labor standoff in the form of a lockout -- using replacement players. **********That would start the legal process over again. The players would push Feinstein to decide whether the owners had in fact bargained sufficiently, and if he decides they had not, then he could once again take the case to court."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/01/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-the-issues-the-elements-of-peace-money-land-and-justice.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1006, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Elements of Peace: Money, Land and Justice", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE ISSUES; The Elements of Peace: Money, Land and Justice", "body_text": " **********For the first time since the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began in 1991, the way to an unlovely peace appears to be opening, but several extremely difficult issues remain. **********The door to negotiation was opened over a fifth summer of war by several crucial developments: a new balance of power, inimical to the Serbs, rooted in the growing strength of the Croatian Army; a new wave of expulsions -- of Serbs from Croatia and Muslims from Serbian-held eastern Bosnia -- that virtually completed the slicing up of the former Yugoslavia into ethnically homogeneous zones; and the political victory, consummated this week after more than a year of maneuvering, of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over a much weakened Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. **********These internal developments were complemented by equally important changes in Western capitals and in the United Nations command in Bosnia that have made a resolution of the war more likely. **********In Sarajevo, Lieut. Gen. Rupert Smith replaced Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose as commander of the United Nations forces in Bosnia and brought a complete change of style. General Smith pointed relentlessly to the fundamental contradiction of Western policy: The presence of United Nations peacekeepers in territory exposed to any NATO air strikes. **********This patent roadblock to any coherent or effective approach had long served Western governments as a shield behind which to fudge their reluctance to take any action over the war in Bosnian. But by this month, with the removal of vulnerable peacekeepers, it had at last been cleared away. **********In France, President Francois Mitterrand, a lifelong friend of the Serbs who was deeply hostile to any concerted military action against them, was replaced by Jacques Chirac, who has taken a different view of the war. President Chirac has now staked considerable political capital on ending the siege of Sarajevo. **********In Washington, the growing threat of a withdrawal of United Nations troops (which would almost certainly require the dispatch of American soldiers to Bosnia) and of a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia (which would divide the Western alliance) abruptly focused the energies of the Clinton Administration on leading the quest for peace. **********The result, this month, was that the process was abruptly galvanized because the Yugoslav crisis has shown that the European Union -- a single market but a still-fragmented political and military power -- still needs American leadership. **********That leadership, for the moment, appears to be in place. But as serious talks on a settlement look set to begin, tremendous obstacles stand in the way of peace. \"We are getting into a room at last,\" Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American envoy, said today, \"But the room is still dark.\" **********Among the most difficult issues will be these: **********EASTERN SLAVONIA Serbia remains committed to holding this oil-rich piece of Croatian territory that abuts Serbia. Its capture -- symbolized by the destruction of the town of Vukovar in 1991 -- involved an enormous expenditure of firepower. **********Croatia wants the land back. The United States is proposing \"freezing\" the issue for three years, pending a final settlement. **********SARAJEVO The Bosnian Serbs want part of the city as an ethnically pure Serbian zone. The Muslim-led Bosnian Government is deeply committed to preserving a single, undivided, multi-ethnic city under its control. It is also suspicious of Western proposals that the city come under United Nations control an an interim measure because this would suggest a surrender of sovereignty. **********CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS The Bosnian Serbs want an independent state on the territory they control. The United States is offering self-rule and the possibility of a confederation with Serbia. **********The Bosnian Government will almost certainly reject any settlement that does not preserve Bosnia as a single, independent state within its current borders, no matter what degree of autonomy the Serbs are given. Suggestions that the Serbs might ultimately be allowed to vote on secession from Bosnia will be rejected by the Government. **********THE MAP The Bosnian Serbs want substantial changes in the current proposal for a division giving them 49 percent of the territory and the Muslims and Croats 51 percent. They want a wider corridor south of Brcko, the completion of the ethnic purification of Eastern Bosnia through control of Gorazde, and control of more cities and economic resources. **********Strategically, they want the land to be coherent and self-sufficient, because they have an eye toward independence. The Bosnian Government is opposed to these changes. **********WAR CRIMES Both Mr. Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, have been named as war criminals by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. The Serbs will seek an amnesty. The Bosnian Government will resist this and demand that all criminals responsible for the eviction and killing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims in 1992 be prosecuted. **********ECONOMIC MEASURES The Bosnian Government will want a huge international injection of funds for reconstruction and will almost certainly demand financial compensation from the Serbs for \"ethnic cleansing.\" **********Money will certainly play a central part if the Muslims, who have suffered the most and are still the most vulnerable, are to accept a peace that leaves them with real control over only a small part of Bosnia. **********SANCTIONS Serbia and President Milosevic will press for a complete lifting of international economic sanctions as early as possible in the peace negotiations. Bosnia will want the sanctions maintained for as long as possible as a guarantee that Serbian promises -- such as the withdrawal from land they now hold in Bosnia -- are fulfilled. The Serbs will have to give up a third of the land they hold if they are to reduce their territory to 49 percent of Bosnia. **********Some American politicians will seek to tie sanctions to other issues, including the status of Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/world/peru-and-ecuador-sign-truce-in-effort-to-halt-border-war.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peru and Ecuador Sign Truce In Effort to Halt Border War", "print_headline": "Peru and Ecuador Sign Truce In Effort to Halt Border War", "body_text": " **********Peru and Ecuador signed a new cease-fire today, seeking to end a monthlong Amazon border war that has claimed 73 lives and left at least 200 wounded. **********Last week, the heaviest fighting of the conflict broke the first cease-fire, forcing diplomats to negotiate the new one, which was signed in Montevideo, Uruguay.

With patriotism running at a fever pitch, about 20 Ecuadorean mothers over the last month named their babies after Tiwintza, a frontline Amazon border post.

The license plate on Dr. Karadzic's car now carries the Cyrillic double S: it stands for \"Serbian Sarajevo.\" **********Because such ethnically based objectives flout the values on which Western civilization has been built, the people of this city still cannot understand why the Serbs have not been confronted. **********\"I am in a state of permanent disappointment with the West,\" said Abdullah Sidran, a distinguished poet. \"There is a quality of evil here; that has to be seen. Bosnia is like planet Earth. If Bosnia is senseless, then the planet is senseless too.\" **********This month, as more children's limbs were severed by falling mortars, Sarajevans heard President Clinton try to explain that the Bosnian conflict was 500 years old, if not 1,000 years old. Their cynicism, already almost fathomless, grew deeper still. **********Sarajevans heard the argument this way: turn a three-year-old war into a millennial conflict, and inaction becomes the only reasonable course. **********\"We thought there were rules in the modern world,\" said Ismet Ceric, the head of the psychology department at Kosevo Hospital. \"But as time has passed we have seen that only with a stone in your hand can you defend yourself.\" **********It has been 38 months now, and time passes slowly here. After the shelling there is a silence so deep it amounts to a prolonged hush. Little stirs. People tend the vegetable gardens that are now as ubiquitous as cemeteries. **********Some run across areas exposed to sniper fire; others make a point of not changing their pace. If you run, the saying goes, you hit the bullet. If you walk, the bullet hits you. **********When the shelling resumes, gravediggers find temporary shelter in the graves they are preparing. The smash of a shell takes the breath away. What follows is exhaustion. **********Inside, people burn books to heat stoves to cook the rabbits they have raised in cages in their bedrooms.

There is no past, because a normal life in the city is now so infinitely distant as to appear unreal. There is only today. There is only, in fact, this moment, because a Sarajevan life may be extinguished at any instant. **********\"Virtually everybody here now has some form of post-traumatic stress,\" said Dr. Ceric, who heads the department where Dr. Karadzic used to work in Sarajevo. **********\"It takes two forms,\" he said. \"The first is anxiety, shortness of breath, a sense of strangulation and, in extreme cases, delusions and paranoia. The second is extreme inertia, flatness and a denial that anything is happening.\" **********Darko Sljivic is calm.

Mr. Sljivic, who is 40, says the rain is bad for the potatoes and onions. Then he smiles to himself and mutters that he has become a peasant. **********His wife, who is half Serbian and half Jewish, hands him a photo album, but he pushes it away, saying that when he sees photographs of the world outside he feels worse. **********This banker-turned-urban-farmer started growing vegetables on a small patch of ground outside his apartment in 1993. The same year, he bought his first rabbit, for $40. He started breeding them and, at one time, had 30 rabbits. Now he is down to three. **********The rabbits live in an abandoned room, too exposed to fire to be habitable, along with some snails that Mr. Sljivic recently collected but has not yet cooked. **********\"I was worried about killing the first rabbit,\" he said. \"I thought it would upset my daughter. So I took the rabbit to a neighbor to be killed. When we put it on the table, my daughter asked what it was. I said it's the rabbit. She tried it and said, 'I like it better like this than alive.' She was hungry, you see.\" **********Mr. Sljivic laughed to himself.

He used to look with disdain at wars in Africa and the Middle East. Now others look at the Balkans in the same way. **********\"I don't worry anymore,\" he said. \"If anything, I worry about peace. I don't know if I could still be a bank director. I don't know if I can ever go back to that life.\" Tired of Answering 'How Does It Feel?' **********Sarajevo is now a giant laboratory. Mr. Sljivic, like others, is a specimen. The inhabitants of this town have changed, almost beyond recognition. **********They are tired of being exhibits, of being asked how it feels to line up for water, how it feels to lose a limb or a child, how it feels to have no freedom, how it feels to live in the sniper's sights, how it feels to burn clothes to cook macaroni distributed by the United Nations. **********They adapt and sip coffee and wait for some unimaginable deliverance. **********Havda Sadikovic-Coso has gone into the egg business. She recently acquired 99 chickens, which she keeps in a hut in her small garden. The chickens were brought through the tunnel under the airport that is the city's only tenuous connection with the world outside. They produce about 630 eggs a week, and Mrs. Sadikovic-Coso earns 10 German marks for every 30 eggs. **********\"Animals have saved me during the war,\" she said. \"It's much easier to deal with them than humans. Before the chickens, I had about 100 rabbits. I never believed I could kill one. **********\"But then one day I was really hungry. I took a rabbit by the ears and whirled him around, like a ventilator. Then I hit him on the head with a piece of timber. He lost consciousness and I slit his throat. The first time it was not easy, but after that I was fine.\" **********She lit a cigarette. \"It's funny,\" she said. \"I can look at 100 rabbits with their throats cut, but one drop of human blood and I start to cry. I have a well here, and when people come to get water, all I can think of is that a shell might land and. . . .\" Sobbing drowned her words. 'You Can Never Get Used to This' **********When shells do kill, Alija Hodzic deals with the bodies. He has been working as director of the morgue since June 1992. On July 7, 1992, the body of his nephew, Adnan Hodzic, 22, was brought in. Two months later, the body of his 21-year-old niece arrived. And on Oct. 10, 1992, Mr. Hodzic had to identify the body of his 22-year-old son, Ibrahim, killed by a shell in central Sarajevo. **********\"I can't stand it much longer,\" Mr. Hodzic said, \"but they can't find anyone else to do this job. Every day when I go into the morgue, I look at the spot where my son's body lay. It is terrible.\" **********He opened one of the frayed, olive-colored ledgers where he has entered the names of the thousands of Sarajevans, including his own son, killed since 1992. As he flipped the pages, the body of a woman with half of her head blown off by a shell was wheeled in on a stretcher. **********Mr. Hodzic accompanied her into a room where three other bodies lay. Because there has been no electricity in Sarajevo for more than a month, there is no refrigeration and the stench of dead flesh is strong. The other bodies were covered in cloths. Their exposed feet and ankles were turning blue. **********\"You can never get used to this,\" Mr. Hodzic said. **********Everywhere, now, there is death or madness or exhaustion. This strange experiment, in the midst of Europe, could not possibly continue for so long, and yet it has. Beneath the gaze of a disoriented world whose one achievement -- the curtailment of shelling through a NATO ultimatum last year -- has now evaporated. Battered Museum Offers Remnant of Civilization **********Just one haven remains. It is to be found in the overgrown botanical garden of the devastated National Museum. Here roses cascade off battered trellises amid the ancient tombs of Bosnian dukes and kings. There is silence and the scent of conifers. **********Enver Imamovic, the director of the museum, sits on a tombstone in the sun writing a history of Bosnia. **********It was he who, in June 1992, amid fierce fighting, saved the Sarajevo Haggadah, one of the world's most beautiful illustrated Jewish manuscripts, from a safe in the basement of the museum. **********It was an act worthy of this remarkable city: a Muslim saving a Jewish manuscript stored in an old Viennese safe in the basement of a museum built by the Austro-Hungarian Empire and under attack from Serbian nationalists bent on destroying the mingling of cultures and religions that is the hallmark of Sarajevo. An act, that is, of generosity and deep civility. **********More than 400 shells have hit the museum, and Mr. Imamovic said he felt like a man watching his child dying. Roman mosaics, prehistoric boats, massive medieval bells lie helter-skelter in the once elegant rooms. **********Nobody can be found to tend the botanical garden, and the undergrowth is growing thick. A single tortoise inhabits the garden. **********\"We used to have four tortoises,\" Mr. Imamovic said. \"But the other three have died during the war. This one is still going, however, and seems quite happy.\" **********As he spoke, the tortoise inched methodically toward an ancient tomb, as if to say, with its ponderous but steady gait, that everything passes in the end."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/20/business/sec-notice-sent-to-lehman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Technically, euthanasia is still not legal in the Netherlands. But some Dutch doctors have practiced it knowing they will not be prosecuted. **********Now the medical profession has taken stock of its experiences of the last decade and decided to tighten some rules for euthanasia and assisted suicide. **********Among the most striking changes is the recommendation that doctors taking part in euthanasia should, preferably and whenever possible, have terminally ill patients administer the fatal drug to themselves rather than have a doctor apply an injection or intravenous drip. **********\"This step is first a decision of the patient, and eating or drinking the substance is a symbol of the patient's responsibility,\" said Dr. Robert Dillmann, a member of the ethics commission of the Royal Dutch Medical Association. \"It is consistent with the decision. An exception should be made when a very sick person is not able to swallow.\" **********While most doctors here are not challenging the basic notion of euthanasia or assisted suicide, many have expressed concern about the emotional and moral burden they feel during the decision-making process and at the time of death. **********A number of doctors have said they feel too much pressure from patients and sometimes from colleagues to engage in euthanasia when they personally oppose it or when they are not sure the circumstances are appropriate. A 1991 study said that only 40 percent of euthanasia requests are carried out. **********At present doctors must limit euthanasia to people who are incurably ill, suffer irremediable pain and who explicitly and repeatedly ask for death of their own free will while they are lucid. Doctors must report such a death to justice officials and fill out a detailed checklist. **********In essence, the new guidelines, recently issued by the Royal Dutch Medical Association, make no fundamental changes but put forward restrictions. **********The new text emphasizes the rule that requires doctors to ask for a second opinion from an experienced physician, a rule that doctors said at times had been ignored. It adds that the consulting physician may not have a professional or family relationship with either patient or doctor. **********In another change, the text stresses that no doctor is required to perform euthanasia, but if he is opposed on principle, he must help the patient get in touch with a colleague who has no such moral objections. **********Further, the medical association insists on the obligation of doctors to report all cases. While this was already an intrinsic part of judicial and professional rules, experts say an unknown number of cases still go unreported. **********While 591 euthanasia deaths were reported in 1991, the number rose in 1992 to 1,322. The figure remained almost constant the next year with 1,318 reported cases, then rose again in 1994 to 1,436. Experts say the increase does not reflect a rise in euthanasia cases but rather the willingness of doctors to report them. **********For those who have been fighting euthanasia, the changes in the rules were seen as small but significant. \"It is a little step in the right direction,\" said Dr. Karel Gunning of the Dutch Physicians League, a group of some 600 members opposing euthanasia. \"Doctors cannot kill. I think Dutch doctors will eventually regain their senses.\" **********The previous guidelines were drawn up in 1984, but even before then euthanasia was practiced here, and in a number of precedent-setting court cases, some dating from 1973, doctors were acquitted on charges of helping to bring on a patient's death. **********Although the Netherlands is unusually open to social experiments, the complex moral, ethical and legal issues involved in the question of whether or when a doctor may kill a suffering, terminally ill patient at that person's own request, keep resurfacing. They came to the fore again in angry debates in Parliament in the early 1990's, until a law passed in 1993 and taking effect in June 1994 allowed procedures that tolerated euthanasia under controlled conditions. **********Since then, euthanasia has not been a major public issue and individual cases are reported in the press only when they appear to extend the limits of what is considered permissible. These have included recent incidents when people have not explicitly asked for death, like those involving a comatose patient or severely deformed newborn babies. **********The latest policy changes, doctors said, have come about largely as a result of the debate that continues among doctors themselves. **********Specialists who helped draft the new document said it reflected the doubts and anguish that existed among physicians and others involved in caring for the terminally ill, even if health workers believed suffering or dying people had the right to take their own lives. The medical association says it regularly receives requests from health workers for guidance or clarification. **********The new guidelines, drawn up by doctors, lawyers and ethicists, appear in a 39-page policy document of the Royal Dutch Medical Association, sent out to its members on Aug. 25. A spokesman for the association said the principles were considered binding for the group's 24,000 members, who represent nearly 60 percent of Dutch doctors. **********Explaining why the association had called for the patients to take the fatal drug themselves when possible, Dr. Dillmann, of the association's ethics commission, said: **********\"Many doctors find euthanasia an extremely difficult and burdensome action, and the patient's participation diminishes this burden slightly. In the past we said that all things being equal, there was no difference between mercy killing and assisted suicide. But in practice, doctors say this is not the same, that there is a difference if a doctor gives a lethal injection or an intravenous drip and, on the other hand, if the patient drinks a potion. Doctors regularly signal that they prefer the patient to do it if possible.\" **********Dr. Herbert Cohen, a family doctor who has practiced euthanasia a number of times, described how for him there is no difference between helping someone to commit suicide or applying the lethal substance himself. **********\"Morally and emotionally it is equally difficult,\" he said. \"You help prepare the patient and the family and you accompany them. A doctor does not just give a box of pills and walk away.\" **********Death by taking pills can take three hours or more, he said. \"This creates a lot more tension, also among others who accompany the patient. There are risks because people are terribly sick. A patient can spill the medicine or choke or vomit or fall asleep before the full dose has been taken. It is never simple.\" **********With an injection, he said, the patient lapses into a coma within about 10 seconds and death often comes 10 minutes later. \"This method seems more emotional, harsher, but it is less open to error,\" he said. **********Eugene Sutorius, the country's leading lawyer in euthanasia cases, predicted that assisted suicide, in which the doctor provides the means, \"will in the long run take the place of euthanasia here.\" He argued that medically assisted suicide would not only ease the emotional pressure on doctors but also reduce the number of messy suicides. **********As for the obligation to consult another doctor in a case of euthanasia, Roelof Mulder, a spokesman for the medical association, said, \"This is not always done, or done in the right way.\" **********He said doctors often preferred to discuss such a complex and far-reaching decision with someone they worked with or who knew the patient well. But the new guidelines emphasize the need for consulting someone who is separate and has no professional or family links to either doctor or patient. Mr. Mulder said it was not a matter of ill will when a doctor called in an associate or friend; doctors can get very involved with a suffering patient, he said, and an independent voice can offer new insight and support. **********\"The consultant must see and examine the patient,\" Dr. Dillmann said. \"The telephone is not enough.\" **********On the point of doctors who refuse to practice euthanasia, Dr. Dillmann continued, the new text says more explicitly that a doctor should make his position known early on to a patient asking to die. \"The idea is that a doctor cannot hide his views and leave a patient in the cold at the last moment,\" he said. \"He should help find alternatives.\" **********Dr. Gunning, who opposes euthanasia, sees in this \"the dangers and madness of the euthanasia logic.\" Refusing to kill someone, he argued, \"is now called leaving a person out in the cold and it is considered cruel. To cooperate and kill someone is seen as showing compassion. People have gone mad.\" **********He said that \"the real problem is that in the Netherlands we are very far behind in palliative care,\" or on alleviating the pain, the feeling of nausea or suffocation of the terminally ill \"so that people do not get so frightened and want to be killed.\" **********\"Britain has some 200 hospices for the dying, and in this country we are only getting some just now,\" he said. **********The medical association said it would deal separately, next year, with the even more complex issue of mercy killing that was requested not by the patient but by relatives, such as in the case of patients with severe psychiatric disorders, patients in a coma or extremely deformed and ill babies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/world/cutting-terrorists-support.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 22, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cutting Terrorists' Support", "print_headline": "Cutting Terrorists' Support", "body_text": " **********The United States took steps to prevent the flow of funds from Americans to terrorist groups in Israel and elsewhere.

The drug, better known as EPO, is used to treat anemia in people on dialysis. **********After millions of dollars in patent litigation, Amgen has successfully asserted a United States patent it received in 1987 to keep Genetics Institute and others out of the EPO market in the United States. But the European market is also important: it represents about $400 million of EPO's $3 billion worldwide sales. **********In November last year, the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office essentially upheld a similar Amgen patent covering Europe, which the company has licensed to Ortho Pharmaceuticals. But in that ruling the agency said it would address in later written comments several questions with potential commercial import. **********Essentially, there are two ways to make the EPO protein. One involves replicating an unabridged version of the hereditary material that encodes it, which is known as \"genomic\" DNA. The other involves making copies of something called cDNA, which is a condensed version of this hereditary material. **********In its written comments, the European appeal board appears to say that while the Amgen patent covers EPO made by the first method, it does not cover EPO made by the second method. **********\"The board's language, while not unambiguous, seems to say cDNA is outside the scope of the Amgen patent,\" said Bruce M. Eisen, a patent attorney who serves as a consultant to Genetics Institute, which has licensed its three patents covering other aspects of EPO to Boehringer Mannheim of Germany. **********\"It's a significant opening of the barn door to competitors in Europe,\" said Colin G.

New Check Design To Help Keep Track **********For most people, keeping track of household expenses -- whether for tax or budget purposes -- means having to conjure up lost receipts and sift through shoeboxes stuffed with canceled checks. **********Mason K. Yu Sr., a retired engineer in Birmingham, Mich., recently patented a checking system that would do away with this drudgery.  Mr. Yu has designed a check whose lower left corner is divided into different expense categories like \"medical\" or \"food\" or \"recreation.\" **********Each time the consumer wrote a check, according to Mr. Yu, he would mark the appropriate expense category. Normally banks process checks by putting them through an optical scanner, which reads the account number. Mr. Yu said that this same scanner simultaneously could read the checked-off category into a computer. **********At the end of the month, the bank statement would include, in addition to a list of deposits and debits, a bar graph showing the dollar amount spent in each category, and a pie chart showing each category's percentage of total expenditures. **********\"The number crunching is invisible to the end-user,\" said Mr. Yu's son, Mason K. Yu Jr. of Manhattan, who is marketing the idea. He pointed out that electronic checking programs like Intuit's Quicken are used by only a tiny proportion of the population. **********\"Americans still write 60 billion paper checks a year,\" Mr. Yu Jr said. \"The average person doesn't want to have to be a computer jockey to figure out their expenses.\" **********Mr. Yu Sr., who said he had a patent pending for a similar system using credit cards and automatic teller cards, said his idea would be helpful to small-business owners in particular. **********In addition, banks could generate valuable data bases of consumer information by providing such a service, according to Mr. Yu Sr. \"You could take the pulse of a regional economy at any given moment,\" he said. **********Mr. Yu Sr. received patent 5,433,483.

Rubin feared would circle the globe. **********Now Japan, a country that usually drowns in statistical measures of itself, seems intent on seizing this year's title. This week, its ministry of finance admitted that it knew in early August that one of the country's biggest banks lost $1.1 billion during an 11-year fraud at its New York subsidiary.

The first instinct of United States regulators would likely be to embarrass and punish the offending bank, to set an example.

After all, these are the same banks that went to extraordinary lengths to halt all major land transactions as soon as the real estate market began to collapse: If everyone knew how far prices had really fallen, the banks knew they would have to re-evaluate their portfolios and dramatically slash the value of their assets.

The bill faces an uncertain fate on the House floor because the Republican leadership has decided to pair it with a controversial bill that would repeal the rules that have separated the nation's banking and securities industries for 62 years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/14/business/investing-it-singer-s-success-requires-reading-between-the-bottom-lines.html": {"writer_name": "Reed Abelson", "pub_date": "1995-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Singer's Success Requires Reading Between the Bottom Lines", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT; Singer's Success Requires Reading Between the Bottom Lines", "body_text": " **********INVESTORS love a good story, and the Singer Company has all the makings of a best seller: a strong brand name, operations in exploding consumer markets like China and India and plenty of fans on Wall Street. **********Singer, which is synonymous with sewing machines, also uses its name to sell televisions, refrigerators and washing machines in more than 100 countries. Analysts rave about the company's consistent earnings, which have risen for 23 consecutive quarters. And James Ting, the 44-year-old Chinese-Canadian businessman who took over Singer in 1989, wants people to consider the stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange at $27.125 a share under the vanity symbol \"SEW,\" as much a blue chip as DuPont or Coca-Cola. **********Only Singer isn't the real thing. Without doing anything illegal, and with the blessing of its independent auditors at Ernst & Young, the company employs a myriad of tactics to raise its profits. Nearly a fifth of the $98.5 million that the company earned last year came from sources other than basic operations: asset sales, one-time investment gains and interest income and fees from affiliated companies. In fact, Singer offers a textbook case of five reasons why investors need to look beyond what's reported on the bottom line to determine the quality of a company's earnings. And it serves as a reminder of the perils in dealing with foreign companies that are allowed to tap American capital markets without complying with the same ground rules that home-grown companies follow. **********Investors interested in doing their homework have one key disadvantage: they only get the opportunity once a year. Because the company is incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles, Singer is required to file detailed financial information just once annually -- and even that update is allowed to arrive as much as six months after the end of the company's fiscal year. **********LESSON 1: PROFITS CAN OFTEN BE TOO PREDICTABLE. **********Wall Street hates to be surprised, and Singer seems to provide enough informal guidance to make sure that analysts are never caught unaware. In that way, quarter after quarter, the company meets the analysts' earnings targets, almost to the penny. Only the massive devaluation of the Mexican peso caused the company to miss the mark by nine cents when it reported fourth-quarter 1994 results -- the first time Singer's earnings had significantly trailed expectations since it went public in 1991. **********Whenever a company's profit projections are so completely on target, investors should wonder how the company is pulling off the feat -- especially when it is subject to wildly fluctuating currencies. Singer's near-flawless performance is curious for another reason, too. Just this week, a Singer official was quick to endorse Wall Street's view that the company would earn $2.10 a share in 1995, up from $1.97 last year. But he would not even begin to estimate sales -- a key engine of earnings -- because of currency devaluations and the situation in Mexico. **********LESSON 2: FAMILY TIES CAN BE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. **********Investors should also look out when much of a company's business involves dealings with related businesses. Singer has very close ties to a Canadian holding company, Semi-Tech Corporation, which is also controlled by Mr. Ting, the chairman and chief executive of both companies. About half of Singer's stock is owned by Semi-Tech, and only two of its eight directors aren't linked to Semi-Tech in some fashion. \"It's very incestuous,\" said Howard Schilit, who heads the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a Rockville, Md.-based research firm that analyzes accounting issues. **********Singer seems to use these close personal relationships to particular advantage. For instance, Semi-Tech Global, a company in which Semi-Tech Corporation has a big stake, owns a group of lackluster businesses that used to be owned by Singer. If the businesses turn around, Singer has the right to buy them on the cheap; indeed, it has already purchased seven of the original 12. In the meantime, Singer charges a 1 percent management fee and other fees. **********That's one reason why at least an eighth of Singer's net income last year was the result of dealings with affiliated companies. The company reported $12.2 million in management fees, royalties and interest, including $5.3 million of \"interest income\" from Semi-Tech Global, even after subtracting $8.5 million of selling and administration expenses, which the company claims were incurred on its affiliates' behalf. **********Whether Singer ever sees that entire $8.5 million in cash, however, is open to debate: while a company official said last week that Singer was paid at least $7.9 million in 1994, its year-end financial statements say it had collected only $2 million -- the rest is classified as \"accounts receivables,\" or outstanding debts owed the company. **********\"When you see the executives of the company also involved with affiliated companies and related-party transactions, it's an ugly picture,\" said Mr. Schilit. **********LESSON 3: THE BEST PROFITS ARE THE YEAR-IN, YEAR-OUT KIND. **********Tucked inside the $98.5 million in profits that Singer reported last year were an unusual amount of one-time-only gains. About 18 percent of earnings comes from extraordinary events that are unlikely to be repeated: a $4.7 million investment gain, foreign exchange gains of $600,000 (in spite of Mexico), asset sales worth $4.8 million, the $5.3 million of interest income, and $2 million in consulting fees. **********Thus, if investors simply excluded all the one-time items from last year's earnings, they would discover they were paying a hefty 17 times trailing earnings for Singer's stock, not the more modest 14 times that it otherwise appears. Alternatively, if they insisted on paying no more than the current multiple of 14, it would be hard to justify any price much higher than $22. **********LESSON 4: CASH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EARNINGS. **********At healthy companies, cash flow -- a fatter version of profits because it is not burdened with noncash items like depreciation -- roughly approximates net income over time. And as far as Mr. Ting is concerned, investors have nothing to worry about. In Singer's annual report, he says \"Singer's cash flow remained strong,\" a position he obviously feels justified taking because the company reported that $46 million more cash flowed into the company's coffers than flowed out last year. **********That claim would be beyond question if all the incoming cash came from operations. At least $132.2 million of it, however, came from an increase in the company's borrowings. Looking just at operations, Singer's cash flow has significantly lagged reported earnings. In fact, in 1994, the company's operating cash flow was in the red for $29 million. **********\"That's a pretty telling measure,\" said Mr. Schilit. When the figures diverge so significantly, despite their both being representative of profitability, he said, \"bad things usually happen.\" Like an earnings surprise. **********LESSON 5: CASH BEATS CREDIT ANY DAY. **********Whenever a company allows consumers to buy its wares on generous credit terms, investors should look especially hard for signs that customers aren't paying their bills. **********In Singer's case, half the company's sales come from Asia and Latin America, and much of the company's success in countries like Turkey and Thailand is the direct result of how easy the company makes it for people of limited means to buy big-ticket items like refrigerators over time. As much as 100 percent of Singer's Turkey revenue, for example, came from the sale of products bought on installment credit, while 85 percent of Thailand's sales were on credit. **********Analysts shrug off concerns about the company's ability to collect from customers, but there are some worrisome signs. Singer's accounts receivables have swelled to 40 percent of sales, up from 33 percent. The company's days receivable -- how long it would wait to get paid if current sales and payment patterns persist -- has increased from about 105 days in 1993 to 146 days last year. **********The payment record of Singer's affiliates is no better. They owe a staggering $92 million -- an amount easily equal to three times the business they did last year with the company. **********None of that might matter if the company were setting aside ample reserves. But the allowance for possible bad debts is only 4 percent of the outsized $452.9 million sitting in accounts receivable. **********The point is, next time you're tempted to pick a stock that's been reporting great numbers, remember you can't always judge a company by its bottom line. Despite Mr. Ting's best efforts, Singer is no blue chip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/13/business/business-digest-292095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 582, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Producer Prices Up 0.3%; Stocks and Bonds Rally  Producer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September, the biggest increase in eight months, but economists dismissed the jump as the result of only temporary factors, not growing inflation. **********Economists said that the increase mainly reflected short-term surges in the cost of vegetables and other food as well as the effect of seasonal adjustment, but many products posted declines. \"Inflation fundamentals look as good as they have in 30 years,\" one economist said.

Although statistics can be misleading -- the divorce rate is measured by comparing the number of marriages and divorces in a given year -- officials say it is rising all over China, and faster in cities than in the countryside. **********The national divorce rate is now 10.4 percent, still far behind the United States, where the divorce rate rose sharply in the 1970's to around 50 percent, where it has remained. **********The United Nations conference on women, to be held here from Sept. 4 to 15, is expected to draw attention to the social and economic ills facing women in China and elsewhere. **********Yet for women in Beijing, the growing divorce rate is a reflection of a new social and economic freedom, of the rising expectations that women bring to marriage, and of damaging effects from what many Beijing residents say is a remarkable increase in adulterous affairs. More than 70 percent of divorces are now initiated by women, divorce lawyers say, and the most common reason given is that a husband has had an affair. **********\"Only a few years ago, people would let a temple be destroyed before they would let a marriage fail,\" said Pi Xiaoming, a leading divorce lawyer whose work at the East Beijing Women's Federation used to involve applying intense pressure on couples not to divorce. **********\"We did everything possible to keep people from separating,\" Ms. Pi said. \"If there was 1 percent chance of saving a marriage, we'd expend all our effort to overcome the 99 percent of difficulty.\" **********Now, Ms. Pi and other Government officials who once actively opposed divorce support it as an acceptable alternative to an unhappy marriage, and a divorce that once took years to win approval can now be processed in three days if both side agree. Many officials even recognize a positive side of divorce. **********\"The high rate of divorce reflects a kind of 'master of my own fate' notion among urban residents,\" wrote the Beijing Youth Daily. \"From an overall perspective, the high rate of divorce represents a kind of social advancement.\" **********But the Government's shift in attitude is only one ingredient in the rising divorce rate. A larger one seems to be growing demands by women in an era of expanding opportunity. **********\"My husband used to say, 'You have your job, your study overseas, a roof over your head, what more do you want?' \" said Liang Hua, 41, who divorced last year. \"What I wanted was a husband who didn't sit at home all day, watching sports on television.\" **********If most Chinese men still look for a stable home and a reliable mother for their children, several women in different professions agreed, women who used to be content with a steady family income now want more: romance, sex and affection. **********\"My husband never kissed me, not once,\" said Lan Ding, 40, a self-employed tailor who said she had divorced her husband, an air force officer, because of the way he treated her. \"We had a child, but he never kissed me. I only learned how to do that much later.\" **********One of the most popular books in Beijing this year is \"The Bridges of Madison County,\" the American best seller whose story of a midlife affair that brings romance to a woman's life clearly struck a chord here. Several women said they had spent evenings sitting around with friends, debating whether the romance described in the book is possible in marriage. **********\"Before, marriage was very stable, but the quality was very low,\" said Wang Xingjuan, who listens to hundreds of complaints each month on the women's hot line she runs in Beijing. \"It was something you did and didn't think about. Now, people have high expectations from marriage.\" **********Ms. Wang also said that most Chinese women traditionally had sex only for the purpose of bearing children. But China's one-child policy, while resisted by many women in the countryside, has made urban women freer both to pursue careers and to pursue sex. \"Now it's for pleasure, for health,\" Ms. Wang said. **********Wu Liyong, 36, a director of a food products company in Beijing, said one of the causes of her divorce earlier this year, after 12 years of marriage, was an unsatisfactory sex life. **********\"We were taught that the man is the one to initiate sex,\" she said. \"I didn't say anything for a long time. But when I finally talked about it with my friends, they told me I was stupid. I feel like I wasted 10 years.\" **********If China's economic reforms have brought greater independence to women in some ways -- more choice of career, place to live, husband, lover -- they have also brought women a greater danger of unemployment than men face. **********At the same time, the loosening of Government control has also meant a resurgence of traditional attitudes among men: that money means access to women. **********\"Men like to see women as objects,\" said Feng Yuan, a journalist at China Women's News who has written extensively on how social changes affect women. \"They feel that the more they achieve, the more ability or charisma they have.\" **********A 32-year-old man who works for a securities company in Shanghai said that he was faithful to his wife during the three years they dated before marriage, but that he started having affairs about six months afterward. **********\"Chinese men need other women,\" said the man, who added that many of his friends feel the same way. \"Family life is one thing; life outside is another. You don't have to hide it; everyone at work knows who my girlfriend is.\" **********Part of the broader problem, both women and men say, is that Chinese society does not teach men to treat their wives well. **********\"My husband was a good worker, a good son to his parents, a good father to his son and a terrible husband,\" said Ms. Lan, the woman who divorced an air force officer. \"That's what our society teaches men to do.\" **********Ms. Feng, the journalist, thinks that one of several causes of the rising divorce rate is the influx of books and movies from the West. **********\"Ten years ago, the Government blamed affairs on 'bourgeois liberalization,' \" a code for Western influence, she said. \"But it was counterproductive because it made a lot of people think, now that capitalism is O.K., that it's also O.K. to have affairs, too.\" **********The current surge in divorce is not the first in modern China. The 1950 Constitution and a new marriage law, which redefined rights within families, encouraged a wave of divorces in the early 1950's. Many of these were initiated by Communist army soldiers who, after their victory in 1949, moved to cities and divorced wives they had married in rural hometowns but abandoned during the long years of war. **********At the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, when millions of lives were shattered by accusations of political incorrectness, many people were forced to divorce a spouse for political reasons. After that period of turmoil ended in 1976, many others divorced spouses they had married in unusual circumstances, though no reliable statistics have been kept on what the divorce rates were at that time, Ms. Feng said. **********For all the women who have divorced, there are countless more who have considered it but been unable or unwilling to do so. **********At the women's hot line, run out of a small office in central Beijing, a recent caller described herself as a 31-year-old doctor who has been married to a businessman eight years and has a small daughter. **********When she discovered that her husband was having an affair, she asked for a divorce. He refused, saying that he wanted to stay married for the sake of their child, and tried to soothe his wife by saying he would buy them a new house and give her a car of her own, still a rarity in China. **********\"I don't know what do,\" said the woman, who can still win a divorce if she demonstrates that she is incompatible with her husband. \"I want to rely on myself, but I don't want to have a less comfortable life.\" **********Ms. Lan said she urged many of her friends not to follow her example, because of the economic difficulty she has had raising a son on her own, and because of the hard time she has had finding another man. **********\"A lot of people still see a divorced woman as immoral, but see a divorced man as fine.\" Ms. Lan said. **********As for her son, Wang Xiyue, 14, Ms. Lan used to worry that he would be the only student in his class whose parents are divorced. She doesn't worry any more. **********\"There are six of them now,\" she said, affectionately rubbing a hand over his head. \"It's getting more and more common.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/business/treasury-to-sell-bills.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury To Sell Bills", "print_headline": "Treasury To Sell Bills", "body_text": " **********The schedule of Treasury financings this week has only today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills. **********At the close of the New York cash market late Friday, traders said, the rate for the outstanding three-month bill was 5.72 percent, and for the six-month bill, 6.29 percent. **********The following tax-exempt fixed-income issues are scheduled this week: TAX EXEMPT  TUESDAY **********South Brunswick Board of Education, N.J., $51.36 million of general obligation bonds.

Multimedia also owns two radio stations in Macon and a security systems business, as well as the television syndication business. **********Though the syndicated shows are the best-known of Multimedia's operations nationally, analysts viewed the shows as being past their prime and thus perhaps the least desirable part of the acquisition, which would be Gannett's largest ever. **********Diversification was a big appeal for Gannett, but the newspapers may be the real prize, the analysts say. Gannett is already the nation's largest newspaper publisher, and the Multimedia papers would add 321,000 to Gannett's 6 million daily circulation from 82 newspapers including USA Today, The Detroit News, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., and The Des Moines Register. Multimedia's flagship papers are in Asheville, N.C.; Montgomery, Ala., and Greenville -- all in states where Gannett owns no papers. **********Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., also operates 10 television stations, 11 radio stations and the largest outdoor advertising company in North America. Gannett's revenues, which were $3.8 billion last year, are expected to grow about 20 percent from the acquisition. **********\"It is a great fit,\" said John Reidy, media analyst for Smith Barney & Company. \"It broadens its geographic base, giving it very strong regional newspapers and TV stations,\" as well as putting it into cable and syndication. The company is paying a relatively low multiple of about nine times cash flow, he noted. **********Under the terms of the deal, announced jointly by John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief executive of Gannett, and Donald D. Sbarra, chairman and chief executive of Multimedia, Gannett would pay $45.25 for each of Multimedia's 37.87 million shares. In addition, it would assume Multimedia's debt of less than $600 million. The purchase price would be adjusted if Multimedia's debt exceeded specified levels at the end of the year. **********With the debt, the total value of the deal would approach $2.3 billion. But Gannett might have to sell some of the businesses, lessening the net value of the transaction. The deal was approved by both boards on Sunday and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. **********Gannett would have 15 television stations after the deal, 3 more than the current Federal limit. But Congress is considering deregulating telecommunications businesses, ending limits on station ownership. **********\"This is a smart deal for Gannett,\" said Fred Seegal, president of Wasserstein Perella & Company, which represented Media General Inc., part of a group that was also trying to acquire Multimedia. **********Shares of Gannett fell 50 cents yesterday, to $53.25, on the New York Stock Exchange, while Multimedia's stock rose 50 cents, to $42.25, in Nasdaq trading. Multimedia's stock was in the low 20's in February, when it put itself on the block. **********Since acquiring the Louisville and Des Moines papers in the 1980's under Allen H. Neuharth, Gannett's previous chairman, Gannett has done relatively little on the acquisition front, except to buy back its shares from the Gannett Foundation, building up its balance sheet and enabling it to negotiate from a position of strength. Indeed, the company could afford to retain all the holdings, if permitted to do so. **********Multimedia's newspapers, like Gannett's, have very high profit margins. Indeed, Charles Baker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Multimedia's margins, in the high 20's, were unusually high, exceeding even Gannett's. **********Gannett will also be acquiring cable television systems that serve about 450,000 subscribers and a security service that covers more than 76,000 security-alarm subscribers. **********Gannett tried its hand at television production in the 1980's and flopped. Its venture with Grant Tinker produced a short-lived television program named after Gannett's flagship national daily newspaper, USA Today. **********Analysts raised questions about the future health of one Multimedia business -- television syndication.

As Arthur Feder, a tax expert at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, noted, \"When a company buys another publicly held company for cash, if it chooses to sell any of the assets, it must use the cost at which the asset was carried by the original company.\" Many of Multimedia's assets have a low cost basis, so if Gannett were to sell anything, it would undoubtedly be liable for high capital-gains taxes. **********Mr. Baker of Salomon Brothers said: \"It looks to me like the company is generating $300 million or so of free cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends. And if you look at a $2 billion acquisition, that means you can repay the cost in little more than five years.\" **********Among those bidding against Gannett was a group including Ellis Communications, Charter Communications, Media General and two financial companies, that had offered $1.55 billion.

But most stood quietly, eager to see if this man who once held them in thrall would look any different now that he had been cut to mortal size. **********Eight months after he conceded defeat in an election that was forced upon him, Dr. Banda has been charged with ordering the murder of four top officials of his own Government. The men were rounded up by the police and clubbed to death with hammers and crowbars. **********The 12-year-old crime, its grisly details itemized in 1,000 pages of testimony, has absorbed this little sliver of southeast Africa, a country that prides itself on being a pocket of gentleness in a cruel continent. **********Even more than the elections last May, the case has become a rite of passage from the rule of one man's whim to the rule of laws. **********\"We're not wanting vengeance in this matter,\" said President Bakili Muluzi, who defeated Dr. Banda. \"We're not even wanting to use it as a political issue. But according to the laws of Malawi, you kill, you are tried.\" **********Echoing some of the gawkers outside the courthouse, he added, \"We must put the record right and make sure that nobody in my position, today, tomorrow, would ever commit atrocities like that and get away with it.\" **********In his mid-90's and reportedly given to depression and lapses of memory, Dr. Banda lives under luxurious house arrest and faces the possibility of being hanged if he survives the year or more his murder trial is expected to take. His lawyer, Lovemore Munlo, describes Dr. Banda as being \"in terrible shape.\" **********So far, Mr. Munlo has gotten his client excused from appearing in court. **********Dr. Banda (he earned a medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Tennessee) led the protests that won independence from Britain in 1964. Within two years he had consolidated all power in his own hands. **********The Victorian peculiarity of his rule -- he dressed formally in homburg hats and ordered long-haired male tourists shorn at the airport -- made him seem more comical than brutal. Even now many Malawians revere Dr. Banda as the father of their country, and blame any cruelties committed during his rule on his despised right-hand man, John Tembo, who also faces charges in the case. **********But the murder accusation, compiled by an independent commission created by Mr. Muluzi, has badly battered Dr. Banda's lingering reputation as a strict but well-intentioned patriarch. **********The commission found that in 1983 four men whose loyalty Dr. Banda had questioned -- three Cabinet ministers and a member of Parliament -- were arrested at police roadblocks, blindfolded, taken to a forest outside Blantyre and killed. **********\"I was the one who had the hammer and I hit him at the back of the head, where I knew, according to my police training, he would die immediately,\" said one policeman whose testimony filled pages of a local newspaper. **********The police packed the bodies into a blue Peugeot and rolled it over a cliff, and later presented the deaths to the country as an accident. **********The commission had only circumstantial evidence that Dr. Banda and Mr. Tembo ordered the men killed. The police official to whom Dr. Banda supposedly gave the command later died, although his wife and deputy say he told them about his instructions. **********But Robert Mzikamanda, who was secretary of the investigating commission, said there was \"debate, but no doubt\" about Dr. Banda's role.  Within days of receiving the report, the chief prosecutor ordered the former President and three others arrested. **********Dr. Banda's lawyer, Mr. Munlo, says the police must have acted on their own. The murder case, he argues, is a vengeful circus intended to distract public attention from the economic misery that has conspicuously worsened since Dr. Banda lost power. **********\"There is an enthusiasm to punish Dr. Banda,\" the lawyer said. **********It is true that President Muluzi could use a timely reminder of how bad things used to be, since many of his people are already muttering that life was better under Dr. Banda. **********Since the elections, the currency has lost more than half its value. The inflation rate is over 40 percent. Foreign aid, which keeps the Government afloat, is threatened by Republican control of the United States Congress and by competition from the more glamorous new democracy in nearby South Africa. **********The Government is also under pressure from others who lost husbands and fathers to search the past to its depths. **********Vera Chirwa, a human rights lawyer, contends that thousands died mysteriously. She and her husband, Orton Chirwa, spent 11 years in prison, much of the time manacled hand and foot in solitary confinement. Her husband died in custody in 1992. **********\"It's not enough,\" she says of the current murder case. \"My children would like to know, how did their daddy die?\" **********But in an interview at the hilltop palace he inherited, Mr. Muluzi said his country cannot afford a witch hunt, even if it wanted one. **********Investigating the one case, he said, has already cost his impoverished Government $250,000. In addition, courts have made huge compensation awards to victims of the past Government, which Mr. Muluzi calls forcing the new democracy to \"pay for Banda's sins.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/15/business/company-news-radius-and-ibm-talk-about-making-macintosh-clones.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RADIUS AND I.B.M.

If injured, a button can be pushed on a wireless radio transmitter that is worn like a necklace or wristwatch. **********When the systems were first offered, in the 1970's, they worked as a one-way alert sent to an emergency service. Now, more advanced units use a receiver attached to the person's telephone that picks up the distress signal, automatically dials the emergency service, sends an identification code and then transforms the telephone into a speaker phone so emergency personnel can talk to the elderly victim. **********But sometimes that is difficult because of background noise. L. Dennis Shapiro, an electrical engineer and chairman of Lifeline Systems Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., first noticed the problem when meeting customers who use his company's personal emergency equipment. **********\"When I visit the homes of elderly people, they almost always have a television set on,\" Mr. Shapiro said. \"And typically when the TV is on, it's loud because the average age of our subscribers is over 75 and the majority have a hearing problem.\" **********Mr. Shapiro worried that loud televisions would make it impossible to hold a conversation over a speaker phone. So he patented a personal emergency device that mutes the television volume. **********\"It's set up to learn the particular muting code of the TV,\" he explained. \"It has a learning circuit inside. You take the TV remote, press the mute button and it acts just like a TV. It receives the digital sequence of ons and offs of the infrared light bulb. It learns them and can mimic them.\" **********A microphone is installed in the radio receiver attached to the subscriber's telephone. If an elderly person is injured and presses the emergency button, the signal causes the phone to dial a monitoring station. At the same time, the microphone receives a sample of ambient room noise. If the noise registers above a certain level, the television mute function of the emergency device is activated. **********The television silencer is just one of Mr. Shapiro's patents in emergency communications. **********\"My orientation has been to provide communication to at-risk people, especially the elderly who cannot manage for themselves if there is a personal problem or an environmental problem,\" he said. **********He holds a patent for including a radio receiver in the emergency device the elderly wear. In case of a hurricane, he imagines, if electricity and telephones are out of order, the wearer can still hear emergency broadcasts. Another patent allows an older person to press the device's button to turn a ringing telephone into a speaker phone, so that the answerer does not have to get up. **********Mr. Shapiro went into emergency communications after designing radar systems for the military during the Vietnam War. After the war, he used that technology to create motion detectors for alarm systems. Then he became interested in personal alert devices. **********\"This is a real swords-to-plowshares type of story,\" he said. In the United States and Canada, Lifeline Systems has 100,000 direct subscribers, who are monitored at the company's headquarters, and nearly 300,000 indirect customers who use Lifeline equipment but are monitored by hospitals. About 25 percent of those have the two-way voice system. His company's service costs about $1 a day, Mr. Shapiro said. Other, smaller companies provide similar services. **********Mr. Shapiro said his patent for television-muting technology could be adapted to silence radios, stereos or tape players. And he says it might be useful for automatically muting the television when a phone or doorbell rings in the home of someone who is hard of hearing. **********Lifeline Systems is not yet selling personal emergency systems with television-muting capability, and Mr. Shapiro is unsure when the service will be available. He holds patent 5,420,907. Food Container Lid That Pumps Out Air **********More help for the elderly and others with limited physical strength or disabilities may come from a newly patented lid for food containers. Eric Miramon designed a lid with a mini-pump that extracts air from a container in place of the manual technique of gripping the bowl and pushing down on the lid while pulling up on a corner to force air out. **********\"The basic lid is about the same size, diameter and depth as a mayonnaise-jar lid,\" said Jeff Stuebing, a partner with Mr. Miramon in Invental Laboratories Inc. The company, in Morro Bay, Calif., can make the lids in any size. **********\"But where normally there is air space on the inside of a normal lid, we incorporated a bellows connected to a small valve,\" he explained. The lid has a textured, rectangular-shaped button on top that activates the bellows. **********\"When you push the bellows down, the air is expelled through the small valve into the atmosphere,\" he continued. \"When you let go, the bellows has resiliency and returns to its original shape, sucking the air out of the container.\" **********There is another, smaller button on the side of the lid that releases air back into the container to make it easy to break the vacuum seal and open the jar. Mr. Stuebing said pressing the buttons took little strength. Ordinary jars, containers and leftover dishes require only one push of the bellows button to expel the air. **********\"If you had a five-gallon bucket or ice chest for keeping picnic food cold longer, you'd have to actuate the bellows five or six times,\" he said. **********Mr. Miramon and Mr. Stuebing said the lid was designed to fit standard leftover storage containers like Tupperware and Rubbermaid products. They are also designing a five-gallon bucket for restaurant use and have approached manufacturers of picnic coolers about designing an ice chest. They also said they thought their patent could be used for air-tight storage of medical or pharmaceutical products. Mr. Miramon received patent 5,406,992."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/21/business/how-they-do-it-teaching-money-basics-to-children.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Teaching Money Basics to Children", "print_headline": "HOW THEY DO IT; Teaching Money Basics to Children", "body_text": " **********Alan and Linda Fingerman of Little Neck, L.I., want their children, Stacey, 9, and Kenneth, 7, to get in the habit of saving money.

More than 300 newspaper, radio and television reporters have descended on the United States to chronicle every minute of Mr. Lee's trip, to broadcast every public word he utters, and glean meaning from every private conversation overheard. **********This afternoon, all three Government-controlled television stations carried Mr. Lee's departure ceremony, complete with red carpets, a receiving line of the country's senior ministers, a military honor guard, and lingering pictures of Mr. Lee's chartered Boeing 747 roaring off the runway en route to Los Angeles, where it landed later today to another large press reception. **********For 16 years, Taiwan's leaders had not been allowed to so much as step off an airplane in the Honolulu airport for fear that such a step would antagonize the Government of China and violate the official American policy that there is only one China. **********On Friday, Mr. Lee is to address alumni at Cornell, where he received a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1968. **********\"We hope this is a watershed,\" said Jason C. Hu, the Government's chief spokesman, who traveled with the president to Los Angeles today. \"We hope from now on people we see us as what we are.\" **********\"This is significant in the sense that we can be seen and heard and not isolated,\" he said, in an interview before his departure. \"We want Peking to understand that we have done nothing with the purpose of irritating anyone.\" **********Because the United States does not recognize the Taiwan Government, Clinton Administration officials have refused to meet Taiwan's president. However, Taiwan officials have said that Mr. Lee expects several members of Congress to come to Ithaca. **********Yet despite the cold shoulder the Administration is showing Mr. Lee, Beijing, which regards this island as a renegade province, has reacted with fury to his trip, declaring that Chinese-American relations would suffer as a result. **********Since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations in October 1971, the country has fallen into a diplomatic black hole, an oblivion that many thought complete when the United States severed relations in 1979 and granted full diplomatic recognition to the Chinese Government in Beijing. **********But Taiwan prospered. Its economy has expanded dramatically, catapulting the country's per capita gross national product from $443 in 1971, the year it was thrown out of the United Nations, to $12,640 today. And after decades of martial law, the country has now embraced democratic politics with a boisterousness rivaled by few Asian nations. **********In the last several years Taiwan has trumpeted its economic achievements and democratic credentials as it has sought wider international recognition. Last year, President Lee visited several countries in southeast Asia where he happened to find himself on golf courses with those countries leaders. \"Vacation diplomacy,\" it was called. And earlier this year, Mr. Lee visited Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. **********But the centerpiece of Taiwan's diplomatic offensive has been the struggle to send Mr. Lee to the United States. For its part, the Clinton Administration had resisted appeals by Taiwan to allow Mr. Lee to visit the United States. **********Last year, when Mr. Lee's plane stopped in Hawaii for refueling on a trip to Latin America, the Administration refused to allow him to rest there overnight. Humiliated by his treatment, Mr. Lee refused even to leave the plane. Then last month, only after nearly unanimous votes in the Senate and the House of Representatives expressing support for Mr. Lee's visa application, did Mr. Clinton bow to a rising tide of sentiment and permit Mr. Lee's current visit despite the reported opposition of the State Department, which argued against jeopardizing relations with China. **********In Beijing, the trip has been denounced repeatedly. Several official delegations to the United States have been canceled and talks with the United States over controlling the spread of missile technology postponed. Yesterday, a spokesman for the Chinese Government suggested that it would take more steps to express its anger over the trip. **********Even as he flew into the political and diplomatic typhoon, there seemed to be unanimity here that President Lee's arrival in the United States would mark a decisive turn in this country's effort to break out from decades of diplomatic isolation. **********One of Mr. Lee's bitterest political enemies, Shih Ming-teh, the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, who spent more than 25 years in prison for his opposition to Mr. Lee's ruling Nationalist Party, hailed the trip. \"Basically we support the Lee Teng-hui visit,\" said Mr. Shih in an interview in his office. \"I believe there actually is room for the development of better relations between Taiwan and the United States.\" **********The State Department has been vigorously pressing Taiwan to keep Mr. Lee's profile in the United States as low as possible, according to Taiwan officials. **********Indeed, Mr. Lee turned down all requests for interviews before his departure, a decision prompted by pressure from the State Department, according to Taiwan officials. And this evening, local news reports announced that a news conference Mr. Lee had been planning on Friday at Cornell had also been canceled under American pressure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/business/business-digest-943095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 596, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Windows 95 Is Here!

Oblique literary attacks in prominent newspapers were often the harbingers of a persecution campaign. **********In 1965, Wu Han, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing who was also a scholar, published the story of a fearless Ming Dynasty official named Hai Rui, who stood up to a dictatorial emperor. Despite the fact that Mao Zedong had encouraged the author to tell the tale, it was later seen as a veiled attack on him, and he used the perceived insult as a pretext for purges against his party rivals. **********Now, Beijingers, who still have received no official notice that their Deputy Mayor is dead, are instead told about Qu Yuan. **********\"For a long time people believed that Qu Yuan, the famous poet in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-481 B.C.), killed himself by jumping into a river after losing political power,\" the Beijing Daily said on April 10. \"The only evidence was the poem he wrote after being exiled. In this poem, Qu Yuan wrote that the way had been chosen for his suicide -- jumping into the river. But some researchers have pointed out that this poem might be a forgery written as a suicide note by his political enemies.\" **********The article asks whether \"assassins\" might have been sent by the Emperor to kill Qu Yuan. **********Beijingers who knew of Mr. Wang's death had been raising similar questions. Did he sacrifice himself, or was he sacrificed to protect someone above him? Even if he was not killed, was he being positioned as a scapegoat? **********Mr. Wang, whose responsibilities included the reconstruction of Beijing under a master plan unveiled last year, was the protege of Chen Xitong, the former Beijing Mayor who is the capital's Communist Party secretary and a member of China's ruling Politburo. **********In the past, Mr. Chen was considered a rival of the Shanghai party boss, Jiang Zemin, who has risen to become President, Communist Party boss and commander of the military. **********Western Embassies in Beijing believe that Mr. Jiang is using the opportunity created by the corruption inquiries to go after Mr. Chen's fief. **********\"It looks like Jiang is moving against people who have challenged him in the past or might challenge him in the future,\" a Western diplomat said. **********The events leading to the corruption allegations started, oddly enough, in December, when the American hamburger franchise, McDonald's, was served an eviction notice at its prime location just off Tiananmen Square. McDonald's was in the way of Orient Plaza, a huge shopping and office complex that had important political backers. **********Initially, public attention was focused on the plight of McDonald's. Foreign investors feared that if McDonald's 20-year site agreement could be violated, contracts meant nothing in China. **********Then, suddenly, the focus shifted. **********Prime Minister Li Peng got involved in the case. Orient Plaza's backers were said to have skirted required approvals and to have violated height restrictions meant to protect the skyline around the Forbidden City. How could this happen? **********The first rumors of an investigation centered on \"the gang of secretaries,\" as they have been dubbed. Current and former secretaries to Mayor Li Qiyan and Party Secretary Chen were said to be under investigation or arrest. Alleged crimes were not spelled out, but \"financial irregularities\" was the catch phrase used. **********Several Chinese officials, in conversations with Western diplomats and journalists, confirmed that prosecutors were deep into the city's books and that the case involved all manner of real estate transactions. **********Then another shoe dropped. **********In February, Zhou Guanwu, the chairman of Beijing's Capital Iron and Steel Company, abruptly retired and his son, Zhou Beifang, was arrested for alleged \"economic crimes.\" The steel conglomerate is owned by the Beijing Government. The company, under the Zhou family, had gone on a spending binge in recent years, and its Communist Party executives were living the high life. **********Mr. Chen has told officials that he could not be expected to know everything his subordinates were up to. **********For Mr. Wang -- guilty or not -- these could not have been welcome words, and so, as in the case of the poet Qu Yuan, \"a cruel historical tragedy was played out.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/01/business/retired-and-still-saving.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1995-10-01", "snippet": "CHARLES HUSKEY was terrified when he was pushed into retirement five years ago at the age of 54.\n\nMr. Huskey, a Bedford, Tex., manager at an oil company, had amassed pensions from two companies and two tax-favored retirement accounts, and he had s...", "word_count": 2503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retired, And Still Saving", "print_headline": "Retired, And Still Saving", "body_text": " **********CHARLES HUSKEY was terrified when he was pushed into retirement five years ago at the age of 54. **********Mr. Huskey, a Bedford, Tex., manager at an oil company, had amassed pensions from two companies and two tax-favored retirement accounts, and he had squirreled away several hundred thousand dollars in other savings, but he was still worried. \"What if I live to be 105? What's enough?\" **********Good question. Blessed with life expectancies that stretch out for decades, more and more Americans are fretting that their hard-saved money will peter out long before they do. Ideally, they would like to maintain the life style they have become used to in their working years, and yet there are just too many unknowns. How much will inflation rise? What will happen to the stock and bond markets and to interest rates? And for how long must one hoard savings? Government life-expectancy tables give the averages, and few people last as long as the Delany sisters, centenarians recently immortalized by a hit Broadway show, \"Having Our Say.\" But 1992 death records tell of a man who died at a claimed 125 or more and of two women who expired at 123. **********Faced with such uncertainties, many retirees react by drawing a minimal allowance from tax-deferred accounts and by living on the interest from other savings, said Seymour Goldberg, a certified public accountant and trust and estates lawyer. Mr. Huskey and his wife live off his pensions and the earnings from their investments, without touching the money sitting in their individual retirement account and 401(k) plan. **********As scary as the future looks to the current crop of retirees, it gets more terrifying for those coming up behind them. Of all generations of American retirees, \"this may be the group that fares the best,\" said Bill Wiatrowski, an economist with the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********This may be the last generation, for instance, that was swaddled in old-style defined-benefit pensions. That's the kind for which the company promises to send a check as long as you live. Today's firm is much more likely to offer a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), for which it gladly deducts pretax dollars from the worker's salary, and maybe makes a matching contribution. Whatever accumulates, accumulates. There is no guarantee of payments for life -- or even of how much money there will be. **********The much-maligned Social Security system is also more of a certainty for today's retirees than for those of the future. The top payment for a retired couple who earned high salaries is now $2,398 a month. For a couple with one wage earner, the maximum is $1,798. **********Home equity is a potential source of income for this group. The median sale price of a house in this country soared to $110,000 last year from $23,000 in 1970, according to the National Association of Realtors. Reverse mortgages from companies like Transamerica Homefirst in San Francisco allow retirees to borrow against the equity in their homes as a way to raise money for living expenses, with the understanding that their estates will settle up later by selling the homes. **********A 1991 study by Mr. Wiatrowski showed that pensions plus Social Security on average replaced 56 percent of salary for a worker who earned $55,000, rising to 98 percent of salary for a worker who made $15,000. **********NONE of this seems to calm aging nerves. \"Their big fear, no matter how much they've got, is whether they will run out,\" said Tim Kochis, a San Francisco financial planner whose typical client sits on a $2 million nest egg. **********The worries can border on compulsion for the oldest retirees -- those who remember the Great Depression or at least their parents' skimping. This group is determined not just to die with break-even finances, but also to leave an inheritance. **********Linda K. George, associate director of Duke University's Center for the Study of Aging, tells of a 74-year-old Ohio man who went without his gout medication as long as he could stand the pain rather than pay more than $1 for each of the pills he was supposed to take twice a day. \"If you asked him why, he'd say, 'It could be worse. I might have to go to a nursing home, and I want to conserve my money. I might need my money.' \" Then he would talk about how he wanted to leave something for his children, she said. \"He wanted to be buried knowing that something he had went to his children.\" **********Such penny-pinching can be maddening to the children it is supposed to benefit. A North Carolina woman who insisted on anonymity complained of the coupon-clipping parents who never took vacations yet insisted on sending $500 birthday gifts to their grandchildren. Jerome Golden, an Equitable Life Assurance executive who markets investments for the elderly, told of a Florida couple who borrowed money from their children so they didn't have to spend the inheritance they wanted to leave to those same children. **********Often, the frustrated children are up against habits cultivated during a lifetime of frugal living, said Mr. Goldberg, the accountant. Never mind that there is a retirement bundle waiting to be spent and that there are only so many years of living in which to drain it. **********BARBARA WILKOC, a Manhattan public relations executive, knows that her 72-year-old father could treat himself better. But he insists on buying used cars, eating frozen dinners and spending his days fishing at a two-room lakeside cabin in South Carolina. Meanwhile, his hundreds of thousands of dollars languish in low-interest bank certificates of deposit. \"A part of it is for a rainy day. Primarily it's for the kids. He wants his kids to have it,\" she said. **********What makes this all the more galling to Mrs. Wilkoc is that her father's Depression-era parents were the same way. They hoarded so they could leave money to her mom and dad. \"My mother died the same month that the inheritance came,\" she said. **********Her father, Harry Potts, said he understood his children's attitude. \"I think they just feel that I have it, that it's mine, that I should use it to live the way I want to live. But, quite honestly, that's exactly what I'm doing. Why should I spend it just for the sake of spending it? I do everything I want to do.\" **********Leaving an inheritance \"is part of my heritage,\" he said. **********Sometimes giving to children springs from a desire to reassert the parental role of caretaker. Or to demonstrate independence despite growing physical infirmities. Other times, parental needs to control their children or to make sure the offspring don't abandon them are tangled in the desire to leave an estate, said Peter White, president of International Skye, a consulting firm that works with wealthy families. **********Younger retirees, in contrast, are more willing to spend their children's inheritances, Mr. Golden said. These retirees would be happy just knowing that the money won't run out, keeping them from becoming burdens to their children. **********No handy charts exist to tell these retirees exactly how much they can spend without running out. In publication 590, the Internal Revenue Service shows retirees how to calculate the minimum they need to withdraw each year from tax-deferred accounts like I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s, just to avoid tax penalties. There is also a Government-imposed maximum of $150,000. In between is uncharted sea. The I.R.S., of course, says nothing about spending regular savings. **********Financial advisers can draw up plans based on likely inflation rates, investment returns and life expectancies. William Matthews, a Dallas financial planner, shows how a retiree with $500,000 saved could take out $30,000 a year, adjust the withdrawal upward by 3 percent a year for inflation, and still at age 90 have more than the $500,000 he started with at age 65. That is, if he can earn 8.5 percent after taxes each year, a feat that would almost certainly require investing rather aggressively in equities. If that makes the retiree uneasy, he could live on less or resign himself to having to invade the principal. **********Those numbers are terribly sensitive to earnings shortfalls. If the retiree merely earned 8 percent a year after taxes -- half a percentage point less than hoped -- the nest egg would dwindle to $343,194 by age 90. **********It is also up to the retiree to choose between the conservative assumptions and optimistic ones. Will inflation average 3.1 percent, as it did between 1925 and July 1995? Or will it top 13 percent, as it did in 1980? Will the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks average 10.5 percent compounded annual returns, as it did between December 1925 and this July? Or will it fall 3.2 percent, as it did in 1990? **********AND unpleasant as the task may seem, it is up to the retiree to form an opinion about his or her mortality. The average life expectancy for someone who has reached age 65 is 15.4 years for a man and 19.2 years for a woman. **********Faced with such choices, hordes of retirees are turning to the certainty of fixed annuities -- handing a chunk of their savings over to an insurance company to buy the promise of a check for life or at least a guaranteed return on their money. Sales of fixed annuities swelled 80 percent between 1990 and 1994, according to the American Council of Life Insurance. The cost of this peace of mind is often higher fees and lower returns. **********Medical costs may pose the biggest threat of all, and for the unlucky, no amount of savings may be enough. Ms. George recalled the wealthy Durham, N.C., surgeon she met five years ago. He had been driven to increasing desperation by having had to care for a wife with Alzheimer's disease for eight years. \"He said, 'I always thought I was a rich man. But at the rate we're spending because of this illness, I have enough money to last two more years.\" The woman died of natural causes 17 months later, Ms. George said, and the surgeon sold his house and went back to work. **********Retirees can buy policies to help fill gaps in Medicare. Long-term health-care insurance can cover nursing-home care, but it becomes much more expensive unless purchased early. **********So how did Mr. Huskey deal with his forced retirement? Quite well, thank you. After a few months spent \"scared to death,\" he realized he could live just as well off his investments as on what he had been bringing home after taxes while working at the oil company in Fort Worth. Despite his Scrooge-like ways, his wife, Dolores, is coaxing him into taking vacations in Colorado and Hawaii. He no longer worries -- not even about whether there will be something left for the heirs. \"I don't want to hold back. If there's something we want to do, I want to do it.\" **********Perhaps retirees should listen to Robert Armstrong, the government statistician who draws up those life-expectancy charts and who retires in three years. **********He and his wife plan to sell their house in the expensive Washington, D.C., suburbs and head for someplace less pricey, with lower taxes. They're thinking of Morristown, Tenn. Despite the fact that they have less than $100,000 in savings, Mr. Armstrong, 63, isn't worried about outlasting his money. \"I'm not frightened of that at all. The vast majority of my pension is indexed to inflation. I'm not too concerned with outliving that. I can't.\" **********He also isn't adamant about leaving money to his two children. \"My wife says, 'They both have master's degrees and straight teeth -- we're through with our obligations.' \" Instead, the Armstrongs plan to travel to Ireland and to the Gaspe Peninsula in Canada to see some of the highest tides in the world. Said Mr. Armstrong, who knows his life expectancy is another 16.9 years: \"There are a lot of things I'd like to see.\"Annuities Can Provide Security, at a Cost **********Robert Politzer of Solana Beach, Calif., lost $80,000 of his retirement savings in the stock crash of 1987. Then he bought an annuity, a life-insurance product that provides him with an annual payout for the rest of his life. **********\"I wanted to make sure I had a base income,\" said Mr. Politzer, now 78. \"I didn't want to ever have to depend on my kids. Between that and Social Security, I can scrounge around.\" **********He took the tried-and-true approach to making sure one does not outlive one's money. With an immediate or distribution-type annuity, the insurer essentially assumes the risk that the buyer will live beyond his or her life expectancy, in exchange for a fee and for the right to invest the money. The checks just keep rolling in to the buyer, no matter the age. For this certainty, Mr. Politzer paid $150,000, and he is guaranteed $21,000 a year for the rest of his life, an annual payment based on the prevailing high interest rates on the date of his purchase. **********Individuals poured $99 billion into annuities of all types in 1994, according to LIMRA International, an insurance trade association. But the vast majority of that went into investment-style annuities, whose payouts will not be made for years. **********Only about $5 billion went into the type of annuity Mr. Politzer bought. Most of the immediate annuities sold are fixed -- meaning the retiree locks in a rate of return when he buys the contract. Payments to a surviving spouse can also be locked in. If the buyer dies soon after distributions begin, the contract usually guarantees some payout to children or other beneficiaries. **********The contracts turn out to be the best deal for people who live well beyond their life expectancies. \"We'll take the risk of someone living to be 100,\" said Jerome Golden, president of the Income Management Group at Equitable Life Assurance. \"We have a million annuitants.\" **********The most prevalent type of annuity sold today is a deferred one, meaning the buyer pays his money and the insurance company, bank or stock brokerage invests it until he retires years later. **********With this kind, the purchaser can choose fixed returns or variable returns, linked to underlying investments in stocks and other securities. A variable annuity works more like an investment vehicle than an insurance policy, and the final payout is not certain, though there may be a guaranteed minimum. **********A big advantage of such annuities is their tax deferral. No taxes are due on earnings accumulating inside the contract until withdrawals are made. And, unlike with individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and other tax-deferred plans, \"there's no limit to how much you can put into an annuity tax-deferred,\" said Scott Dunn, an insurance analyst with LIMRA. **********Despite the advantages of annuities, many investment advisers caution against them. Major reasons are lower returns than one could get by investing aggressively in the market and high fees, especially for variable annuities. **********Getting out of an annuity can be expensive, too. Most have surrender charges starting at about 5 to 7 percent of the amount invested, then decreasing over the years. **********Because a retiree hopes to receive annuity checks for a long time, choosing a company that is financially strong and has a high rating is important. \"It's like porcupines making love,\" Mr. Politzer said. \"You have to be careful.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/business/trump-loses-round-in-empire-state-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trump Loses Round in Empire State Suit", "print_headline": "Trump Loses Round in Empire State Suit", "body_text": " **********A New York State Supreme Court justice yesterday denied an effort by the owners of the Empire State Building to break a lease that the current tenants have held for the last 34 years and which does not expire for another 80 years. **********In his decision, Justice Edward H.

Morgan's Profits in First Quarter Are a Surprise to Analysts", "body_text": " **********Confounding expectations, J. P. Morgan announced profits for the first quarter yesterday that were sharply higher than what analysts had expected, largely because of a big improvement in its trading business this year. **********Morgan earned $255 million, or $1.27 a share, down 26 percent from $345 million, or $1.69 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. But earnings were up 32 percent from the fourth quarter and included a charge of $55 million related to cutbacks that have reduced employment by 4 percent. Morgan's operating earnings, before the special charge, were $1.44 a share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $1.16 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research. **********Shares of Morgan jumped $2.625 yesterday, to $63.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stocks of banking companies with large trading activities also rose sharply. Citicorp rose 75 cents, to $46.25, and Chase Manhattan rose $1, to $42. **********But Ronald I. Mandle, a bank stock analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said investors were overreacting to Morgan's earnings report. **********\"Trading revenue wasn't a disaster that some people expected, but expenses were up a lot as well,\" he said, adding that he was holding to his estimate of Morgan's profits for the full year. **********Over all, Morgan's revenue was flat from a year ago but expenses increased 18 percent, to $1 billion. The figure included the $55 million charge. Expenses were up because of increased employment and technology spending compared with a year ago, and because the decline in the dollar raised the cost of Morgan's large overseas operations. **********Trading revenue and interest on trading positions fell to $364 million in the first quarter from $401 million a year ago. **********The composition of the trading revenue, however, changed dramatically. Revenue from swaps and other contracts that relate to interest rates fell 70 percent, to $83 million. Swaps are the most common form of derivative -- a contract linked to the performance of an underlying asset or market. **********Morgan said it lost money on certain derivative deals with its customers. Analysts said the company indicated it had bought a large number of interest rate swaps from clients getting out of their positions in advance of a Federal Reserve meeting to set interest rates, and that Morgan was not able to hedge the risk from these contracts. **********Morgan said that swap revenue was down, even though volume has held constant, because it is selling fewer of the more complex, higher margin varieties. **********Currency trading revenue shot up, however, from $5 million in the first quarter last year to $69 million in the recent period. The sharp decline of the dollar this year created a flurry of trades by customers as well as an opportunity for the bank's own traders to profit by investing its money in the trend. Morgan said its bond and stock trading revenues also increased over last year. In the fourth quarter of 1994, Morgan had a $72 million loss from bond trading. **********Morgan indicated, somewhat by default, that it was not hurt significantly by the financial crisis in Mexico, despite its large \"emerging markets\" trading operation. Morgan did not mention that area in its earnings release, a fact that analysts said meant that emerging markets were not a significant source of profit or loss. In recent months, rumors swirled that Morgan had large emerging markets losses, especially after the Bankers Trust New York Corporation disclosed last month that it faced a loss of as much as $125 million because of trading in derivatives related to emerging markets. **********In its corporate finance business, revenue was flat from a year ago, as underwriting and lending declined but advisory and loan syndication increased. **********Morgan also earned $163 million selling stock in companies in which it had invested.

The new policy will take effect April 1. **********Until now, Prudential has paid its 5,700 brokers 5 percent more for selling the firm's services than for selling those marketed by other investment banks or independent mutual fund companies.

Almost all brokers get paid by commission, not salary. The more their customers trade, the more the brokers and their employers receive. **********Prudential, for example, pays its brokers 37 percent of the commissions paid to the firm when the brokers generate at least $200,000 in sales. The firm pays 41 percent of the commissions to brokers who produce at least $450,000. **********Commission structures like these can be found at most Wall Street firms and they sometimes lead investors to contend that brokers are trading excessively in order to generate commissions, even if the assets of their clients erode in the process. **********Prudential paid more than $1.8 billion in penalties and settlements and admitted to criminal wrongdoing in a scandal involving the sale of about $8 billion of limited partnerships in the 1980's and early 1990's. Investors lost more than $1 billion as the assets owned by the partnerships, including real estate and oil properties, declined in value.

Now, under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, the medical bureau will become somewhat demystified. **********Under the agreement, an insurer that, having read the bureau records, decides to reject an applicant or charge a higher premium will have to tell the applicant of that decision. Consumers then have 30 days to get a free copy of the medical record. **********The bureau's medical records can be as key to obtaining insurance as a credit rating is in getting a loan. \"We view the reports as identical to credit reports, and you have the right to dispute them in the same way,\" said David Medine, the F.T.C.'s associate director for credit practices, who negotiated the agreement, which takes effect on Oct. 2. **********While the bureau now makes its reports available to individuals for $8 each, the new procedure should raise consumer awareness and may increase the number of challenges to the bureau's records. **********Most files are set up when consumers apply for an individual health or life policy and disclose personal medical information through their written application, medical charts they release or physical exams. **********If the insurer decides to reject the application or to charge a higher premium because of risk factors like heart disease or high blood pressure, it may report that to the bureau, identifying its reason by code. The data is then shared with other carriers. **********For the millions of Americans covered by group policies at work, the medical bureau is not a big factor, because their personal histories generally are not examined. **********But as more people become self-employed or supplement group coverage with individual policies, they are exposed to the network of personal medical information. And those who have had trouble getting insurance should find out if there are records about them and what they say. Even people under group coverage may want to consider the bureau records when they receive care and accumulate medical data that one day may be shared by insurers. **********The F.T.C. agreement brings the medical bureau into alignment with the credit bureaus regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In fact, the act does not require the bureau to disclose medical data or tell consumers how such information is used. **********Still, said Neil Day, president of the medical bureau, \"If you want to build credibility, and we've wanted to for over 30 years, you don't want to take legalistic postures.\" The bureau, which is based in Boston, had resisted the F.T.C. since the 1970's, but finally, Mr. Day said, \"It just struck a number of us that it was time to sit down and see if we could work out some clarification of it on a basis mutually agreeable to all.\" **********How much will consumers actually benefit under the new agreement? **********Correcting a file to the degree that it restores some or all insurability can be accomplished. But most consumers still don't have contact with insurance agents or brokers who will show them how. **********And fundamentally, it's better not to have a file created in the first place. **********Mr. Day said that the bureau has files on 15 million Americans. In 1994, of the 130,000 consumers who requested bureau reports, some 17,000 actually had files. Of those 17,000, 900 asked for a correction. Some 300 prevailed on their insurers to alter or expunge their files, and 20 inserted a letter into their files disputing the information in it. **********Sometimes an error can be prevented in advance. Suppose a doctor mishears a remark about alcohol use and writes down an erroneous statement in your medical charts. Then you apply for insurance, and release those charts to the insurer for review. The insurer could spot the comment, interpret it negatively and report a code to the bureau. In this situation, the consumer would be wiser to review the doctor's records first, and have any corrections made before authorizing their release. **********It may even be better to put off the application for coverage. For instance, someone who recently sought psychiatric counseling or had taken antidepressants could be at risk. Consumers should seek out insurance agents and brokers who are knowledgeable about the medical bureau and level with them. **********If the damage is done and the accurate codes are in place, there may be little to do but let time go by and later add a letter if the condition improves. But if the file is wrong, your best allies are your doctors. They can object directly to the insurer that created the codes. If the insurer acknowledges a mistake, it can then instruct the bureau to change the codes. And after seven years, records drop off the bureau's files. **********To see whether you have a file at the Medical Information Bureau and to obtain a copy, call (617) 426-3660 or write to the bureau, at Box 105, Essex Station, Boston, Mass. 02112."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bell-atlantic-reviews-50-million-account.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell Atlantic Reviews $50 Million Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Bell Atlantic Reviews $50 Million Account", "body_text": " **********The Bell Atlantic Corporation said yesterday that it had begun a review on its account, now divided between J.

Mason Dawkins, the fund's founder and co-manager. **********From Longleaf's offices in Memphis, Mr. Dawkins, 47, and Mr. Cates, 30, adhere to the gospel of value investing as written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in \"Security Analysis,\" the industry tome on how to buy a company when its stock is cheap and how to value a company correctly. **********\"I had to read that book three times, and even if we're a little slow here in the Southeast, common sense finally takes hold,\" Mr. Dawkins said in a thick Georgia accent, hinting of his childhood in a family of loggers amid the longleaf pine trees that gave the fund its name. **********His aw-shucks demeanor belies a razor intellect and steel discipline, said Ken Gregory, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, a newsletter in Orinda, Calif. In his latest issue, Mr. Gregory heralds Mr. Hawkins as one of six masters of the No-Load Universe, among luminaries like Michael Price of the Mutual Series of funds and Shelby Davis of Selected American. **********\"Mason Hawkins thinks of himself as a partner in the businesses he buys,\" Mr. Gregory said. \"He comes up with the private market value of a company and buys at a huge discount to that.\" **********Mr. Hawkins doesn't buy stocks on momentum, nor does he look for industries expected to rise in the next economic cycle. He is an old-fashioned stock picker. And once he buys, Mr. Hawkins holds a stock until the market catches up. \"We don't pay more than 60 cents on the dollar, and we prefer 50 cents,\" he said of his investment philosophy. Rather than getting swept up in market fervor over a particular company's potential, he sells whenever a stock reaches the value he places on it. To stay up to date, he constantly reappraises his holdings. **********The results have been impressive. Longleaf Partners, known as Southeastern Management Value Trust until last August, chalked up a total return of 202 percent from its beginning in April 1987 through March of this year, nearly twice the 117 percent advance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, including reinvested dividends. Last year, when the average equity fund turned in a loss, Longleaf gained 9 percent. **********Mr. Cates and Mr. Hawkins thrive on activity when they are outdoors and on research when indoors. Mr. Hawkins, a fly fisherman, studied Graham and Dodd in college, in graduate school and later in the Certified Financial Analyst program. Mr. Cates, who enjoys basketball and biking, got a dose of Graham and Dodd early in his career as well. After a college internship at Southeastern, he began pressing Mr. Hawkins for a job. \"I bugged Mason and he finally caved,\" said Mr. Cates, who was named co-manager in April 1994. **********Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Cates and a staff of three equity analysts dispense with usual stock measures like price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-book ratios. They prefer other yardsticks: a company's free cash flow, its value if liquidated and the prices that have been paid for comparable businesses. **********Of these, free cash flow is the most important. \"It is the determinant of a company's value,\" Mr. Hawkins said. Longleaf takes reported net earnings and adds back what accounting standards have taken out -- depreciation, depletion, amortization and deferred taxes -- and then subtracts necessary capital spending. **********Accountants can really snip off a company's value, Mr. Hawkins said. General Foods, for example, once carried popular brand names like Jell-O on its books at about $300 million. When Philip Morris acquired General Foods, those assets were revalued at more than $4 billion. **********Companies that don't throw off a lot of cash, but have hidden assets in the form of land, minerals or other property, are assigned a value based on what they would bring if liquidated. The Horsham Corporation, a Toronto holding company and a Longleaf favorite, owns 20 percent of American Barrick Resources. Horsham carries the company on its books \"at a historical, ridiculous number,\" Mr. Cates said. \"That's another accounting mistake we look for.\" **********LONGLEAF'S investment adviser, Southeastern Asset Management, of which Mr. Hawkins is chairman and Mr. Cates is president, has an extensive collection of corporate sales data, which can be used to estimate a company's ability to generate revenues. The managers bought Knight-Ridder, a newspaper company with a monopoly in 29 markets, after studying such numbers as what other acquirers have been willing to pay for each newspaper subscriber and for each dollar in newspaper revenue in single-paper markets. **********After a financial analysis, the managers burrow in on a company and look for managers who can put capital to work. The Washington Post Company, a big Longleaf holding, is using cash to buy back 10 percent of its shares. Frank Cahouet, chief executive of Mellon Bank, impressed Longleaf by using excess cash to buy two asset management concerns, the Boston Company and Dreyfus. **********When Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates identify a likely prospect, they pay a visit, the first of many sessions if they decide to invest. Just ask Quaker Oats, Longleaf's biggest stake right now. \"We've probably met with them in person at least three times in the last 10 months or so,\" said Margaret Eichman, vice president of investor relations at Quaker. \"They've had meetings with our senior executives and sat down with the chairman to talk long-term strategy.\" **********Many fund managers claim to do intensive research on companies and their management, but Ms. Eichman says she mostly hears from Wall Street analysts. **********For confirmation of the managers' success, just look at the holdings that have either doubled in market value in a short time or been acquired at a big premium. The fund built a big position in Gerber Products in 1993, when the stock was trading at $25. Longleaf's managers reckoned it was worth $48. Last year Sandoz paid $53 a share for the company. **********In 1992, the managers began buying General Cinema (later Harcourt General) at $17 to $22, gradually building it up to more than 10 percent of the portfolio. While the managers are content to wait years for Wall Street to confirm their judgment -- portfolio turnover was zero in the first quarter of this year -- that happened with General Cinema in eight months: the shares soared to $38, prompting Longleaf to sell. **********Observing Graham and Dodd's advice to avoid investments you don't understand, Longleaf shuns technology. It also avoids businesses that are hard to value because they are highly regulated, like utilities, telephone companies and banks. Automakers and airlines are forbidden too, for another reason. \"Companies that use more capital than they generate do not fall into our area of interest,\" Mr. Hawkins said. **********Few stocks meet the managers' high standards. The fund usually has no more than 35 stocks, a rather concentrated portfolio. Although this seems to defy the mutual fund rationale, which is to diversify, Longleaf's team views it as an advantage. \"You can be adequately diversified with fewer than 20 names,\" Mr. Hawkins said. Other advantages are that the fund buys only the managers' best ideas and that a single stock can lift the entire portfolio. **********FINANCIAL planners have long been big Longleaf promoters. Richard K. Hammel, a planner in Nashville, Tenn., says his typical client has been investing in the fund since 1990 and has put 13 percent of total assets there. The fund usually accounts for the client's entire allotment of big-capitalization growth stocks. \"It's done unusually well, even in poor times,\" he said. **********Individual investors have flocked to the fund in recent months, as returns have surged and its minimum investment has fallen to $10,000 from $50,000. (Discount brokers can get an investor in for $2,000.) Assets nearly doubled last year and nearly doubled again this year, to $1.3 billion. **********Such growth is a matter of concern to Mark F. Spangler, a financial adviser in Seattle, who said the fund is his clients' largest equity holding. As the fund has grown, he said, its managers have drifted to bigger companies. \"They are not continuing to buy the securities that made them successful in the past,\" he said, adding that he has urged the managers to close the fund. **********Mr. Hawkins conceded that the fund is now sitting on about 20 percent cash, a relatively high level and nearly three times the average for equity funds these days. The proceeds of the Labatt stock sale, rather than new money, are largely responsible, he said. **********The fund invests in the same companies as its parent, Southeastern, which has grown at a more modest rate to just under $5 billion today. Given that the fund is just a small piece of the assets under management, the growth is not as steep as it seems at first glance, Mr. Hawkins said. \"Our research rules haven't changed,\" he said. \"We're not all of a sudden a different fund.\" But sharp growth inevitably alters a fund that concentrates on a handful of stocks, making it harder to take big stakes in smaller concerns. The average market capitalization of the companies Longleaf owns is $3.3 billion, Mr. Hawkins said, and the median is $1.5 billion. He is aware of the growth concern, but says it is not a problem now. \"Once we think it becomes an issue, we'll be the first to recommend closing\" the fund, he said, adding that he doesn't foresee that happening in the near future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/business/company-news-texaco-to-cut-its-work-force-by-another-1500.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXACO TO CUT ITS WORK FORCE BY ANOTHER 1,500", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; TEXACO TO CUT ITS WORK FORCE BY ANOTHER 1,500", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. said yesterday that it expected to post a charge of $55 million against earnings for the third quarter to cut its work force by an additional 1,500 people.

Bally Gaming was not accused of any wrongdoing. **********\"Bally Gaming's business decisions, particularly in Louisiana, have drawn innuendo and allegations of organized crime's involvment in gaming,\" said Bernard Murphy, a spokesman for Bally Entertainment. \"This has resulted in confusion as to Bally Entertainment's involvement in those ill-conceived decisions.\" **********In a interview last week, Daniel Horgan, a lawyer for Bally Gaming, said that company executives had done nothing wrong in Louisiana and that any disputes arising from the incident between Bally Entertainment and its former subsidiary had been resolved. **********\"We are surprised by the filing of this lawsuit,\" Mr. Horgan said. \"It is unwarranted and we plan to fight it.\" **********Starting in 1991, Bally Entertainment, which has its headquarters in Chicago and operates casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas, Nev., began to spin off control of Bally Gaming, which is based in Las Vegas. At the time, Richard Gillman, a former Bally Entertainment executive, became chairman of Bally Gaming. He and Arthur M. Goldberg, the chairman of Bally Entertainment, have previously clashed over such issues as their management styles. **********In January, the president of the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation, a state agency, denied Bally Gaming a permit to sell equipment to a Harrah's casino being built in New Orleans on the ground that company officials had allowed the company to become \"infiltrated\" by organized crime. **********But the agency's board later reversed the decision, siding with Federal prosecutors who described Bally Gaming as the \"victim\" in a scheme in which 17 suspected members of organized-crime families and associates from New Orleans and New York secretly controlled a distributor of Bally Gaming video-poker machines. **********All of those charged in the incident have denied wrongdoing and Bally Gaming was never a target or subject of the Federal inquiry. **********Separately, Alan J. Maiss, the former president of Bally Gaming, pleaded guilty in January to Federal charges that he failed to tell the authorities that a key official of the Louisiana distributor, Worldwide Gaming, did not have a gambling license. He is currently cooperating with Federal prosecutors. **********Mr. Murphy, the Bally Entertainment spokesman, said his company was particularly concerned because with the exception of Mr. Maiss, virtually all Bally Gaming executives involved in the Louisiana incident remain with the company. **********\"We are concerned that the same management structure is still in place,\" he said. **********Mr. Horgan, the Bally Gaming lawyer, said that disputes between the two companies had revolved around economic issues and that changes in Bally Gaming's managment structure had never been discussed during talks between the companies. \"The issue was never put on the table,\" Mr. Horgan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/10/business/market-place-a-fund-s-risky-bet-on-labrador-mining.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1995-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; A Fund's Risky Bet on Labrador Mining", "print_headline": "Market Place; A Fund's Risky Bet on Labrador Mining", "body_text": " **********With the stock market setting record highs regularly, one of the year's biggest surprises is the performance of the Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund, which is supposed to do well when the stock market is not. **********Nevertheless, the fund has gained more than 17 percent this year, most of it in the last month. That is barely behind this year's 18 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, despite the fact that the Contrarian Fund owns stock in no technology companies, no medical or drug companies nor any other of the market's hottest-performing sectors. **********The Contrarian Fund does own, however, more than 2.8 million shares of Diamond Fields Resources, a Canadian mining company that apparently has struck pay dirt in a large deposit of nickel, copper and cobalt in Labrador, Newfoundland. Since announcing the discovery last November, Diamond Fields' shares, traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, have soared more than 1,200 percent, to $54.625 (Canadian) from about $4 in early November. **********But investors who hope to cash in on the company's mineral discovery or the Contrarian Fund's performance should be wary of several potential pitfalls. Because of the big gain in the stock of Diamond Fields, the shares now account for more than 20 percent of the mutual fund's net assets. That is a big bet for any mutual fund, most of which rarely put more than a few percent of total assets in any one stock. But it is an especially huge bet on a company with no revenues, no earnings and a rather thinly traded stock. **********Diamond Fields Resources has attracted remarkable attention not only because of the apparent quality of the mining discovery. The company's co-chairman and largest shareholder, Robert M. Friedland, is a well-known Canadian stock promoter, some of whose previous projects left outside investors holding the bag. **********In fact, the Contrarian Fund itself got hurt last year by another of Mr. Friedland's companies, Vengold Inc. The value of the fund's 2.1 million shares of Vengold stock plummeted last summer when the prospects for the company's Venezuelan gold mine failed to meet initial projections. Another company related to Mr. Friedland, Galactic Resources Ltd., collapsed in late 1992, a couple of years after the Environmental Protection Agency began an investigation of the company's environmentally unfriendly mining practices in Colorado. **********The Contrarian Fund's bet on Vengold was a significant contributor to its dismal performance last year, when it lost 5.5 percent of its value, making it a bad performer in a bad year for stock funds, even though as a contrarian fund its purpose was to do better. **********The Contrarian Fund came closer to its stated purpose in the first quarter of this year. Its heavy investments in precious metals, real estate and oil and gas companies, as well as misguided bets that stocks of technology companies and other high fliers would fall, held the Contrarian Fund to a mere 1.2 percent gain -- far behind the 9.6 percent return of the S.& P. 500. **********But a frenzy of speculation surrounding the latest venture of Diamond Fields Resources has brought the Contrarian Fund's net asset value roaring back -- albeit only to its peak of a year ago, when Vengold shares were soaring. **********The prospects of Diamond Fields appear to be better than Vengold's, based on preliminary mining data analyzed so far. The newly discovered nickel deposits, near Voisey Bay on Canada's Atlantic coast, could yield more than 30 million metric tons of high-grade nickel, copper and cobalt, according to Ken Andrews, director of the mineral lands division of the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Natural Resources. Reflecting that potential, the Teck Corporation, a large Canadian mining company, bought three million Diamond Fields shares for $108 million (Canadian) last month. The Canadian dollar is worth 73.6 cents in United States currency. **********But several obstacles are likely to delay construction and commercialization of a mine for several years, Mr. Andrews said. The area to be developed lies in the annual migration routes of caribou, ducks and geese, is home to several endangered species, including the harlequin duck, and serves large populations of birds of prey. **********In addition, two groups of native inhabitants, the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu Nation, claim the area as part of their native lands, containing sacred burial sites. **********Environmental assessments and negotiations with the Eskimo and Indian tribes must be completed before any mining begins -- and then, mining activities will have to be scheduled around the fierce winter, which freezes the region solid for six months of every year. Edward L. Mercaldo, executive vice president of Diamond Fields Resources, said that while the project at Voisey Bay would likely use open-pit mining methods, it had hired an environmental consultant to advise it. And the company is in discussions with the native inhabitants, he said, about the project's potential impact on them. **********Diamond Fields Resources is in talks with several companies about a joint venture for long-term development of the site but it has yet to sign up a partner. Investors in Diamond Fields Resources do not appear to be concerned by any of those potential impediments. The recent run-up in the price of the company's 26.8 million shares has pushed their market value to $1.5 billion. But as of of Dec. 31, Diamond Fields Resources had a net worth of only $30.2 million. **********And while the Contrarian Fund is sitting on huge paper profits in its Diamond Fields shares -- which it bought for $5 to $6 (Canadian) apiece -- the fund has shown no inclination to cash in even a part of its investment. If it does, its sale order could unhinge the stock, which does not trade in large volumes and therefore is subject to big price swings. In addition, there is not much stock available to trade, because company insiders and Robertson Stephens together control more than half the shares. Paul Stephens, manager of the Contrarian Fund, declined to comment about the fund's holding. **********But clearly the fund wants to warn shareholders about its precarious position: Since April 27, every Contrarian Fund prospectus sent out by Robertson Stephens carries a special sticker noting that its Diamond Fields Resources investment accounts for more than 20 percent of the value of the fund. \"As a result,\" the warning states, \"a decline in the stock price of Diamond Fields Resources would have a significant adverse effect on the net asset value of the fund.\" In other words, caveat emptor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/24/business/media-press-legacy-of-a-dead-newspaper-a-bottom-line-vocabulary.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1995-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Legacy of a dead newspaper: A bottom-line vocabulary.", "print_headline": "MEDIA: PRESS; Legacy of a dead newspaper: A bottom-line vocabulary.", "body_text": " **********IF Mark H. Willes did not exist, the newspaper industry would have invented him. **********Two months ago, Mr. Willes said he had read New York Newsday once in his life -- when he was being considered to run Times Mirror, the company that published the paper for 10 years and vowed to stick with it forever. But Mr. Willes did not hesitate to close the paper on July 16, during his sixth week as chief executive. New York Newsday, he said, did not seem likely to earn an \"appropriate rate of return.\" **********That corporate-speak was not the kind of language newspaper publishers used to use when they closed papers. And that, perhaps, was the larger significance of the events in New York City, of the sweeping cost-reduction program at the company's flagship paper, The Los Angeles Times, and of the broad financial moves in Times Mirror's other businesses that were announced last week. **********Mr. Willes, a former General Mills executive, may now represent more clearly than anyone else the vast changes sweeping through the American newspaper industry. **********The New Yorker magazine said last week that Mr. Willes's arrival \"seemed to represent an encroaching soullessness.\" At a news conference last week, Mr. Willes kept talking about the business of publishing newspapers in the terminology of a chief financial officer. Newspapers were \"core businesses,\" he said, and shrinkage of papers' news staffs amounted to \"refocusing\" of those businesses. In the course of breaking some journalists' hearts in New York, he explained that \"we must get our cost base in line.\" **********But whatever the journalists said, one truth spoke louder than all their disappointment: The stock of Times Mirror went up on the news that one of its newspapers had died. **********In the past, when publishers closed newspapers, they sometimes talked about the pain. They noted the tragedy of voices silenced and wondered aloud whether there was some way to continue serving their cities. The Tribune Company, for instance, as bottom-line oriented a newspaper company as there is, remained entangled in New York City for more than a decade after it first said it wanted to sell The Daily News. **********This time, it happened with breakneck speed. There was Mr. Willes's lunch in Melville, L.I., where the paper is based, the helicopter ride, the tour of the New York newsroom and then the order to shut down. **********Times Mirror's stock price had been down and in the end there was no more complicated explanation for why New York Newsday had to die. **********When newspapers were minting money with high profit margins in the mid-1980's, the fact that many of them had sold their stock to the public seemed nearly incidental. But now, even at the premier newspaper companies founded by families that cared about journalism, business conditions are more difficult and an uncertain future is breathing down the necks of publishers. **********The stock market demands quarterly profit improvement. For public companies, there is no time to wait for long-term investments to pay off. **********Some publishers still talk about their various constituencies beyond the shareholders: advertisers, readers and perhaps even the democratic system that depends on newspapers. **********But when they talk that way, recent events at Times Mirror have shown, they may not be dealing in the real world. Murray Kempton wrote in his last column for New York Newsday that \"there cannot be much health left in a social order where corporations can clamorously proclaim a failure on Friday with entire assurance that therefore their stock will go up on Monday.\" **********Perhaps not. But Mr. Willes was not hired to worry about social order. He was hired to get the stock price up. And he did it. **********The stock market, that amorphous entity that provides the capital for business, does not like to worry about businesses that are struggling with such obstructions as the old-fashioned strike that has paralyzed the Detroit newspapers since earlier this month. **********When they went public, newspaper companies made a bargain of sorts with the market. In exchange for capital, the newspapers essentially agreed to behave more like companies that make shoes or ball bearings. They would have to live, or die, in the survival-of-the-fittest world. **********There have always been cycles in the newspaper business, of course, and shortcomings in the papers themselves. In all the sad obituaries of New York Newsday, in fact, maybe there was too little mention of the paper's flaws. **********It was not respectful to say it last week, but some journalists had always complained that New York Newsday seemed too slow-paced for the city and too confused about its identity. And when the other New York tabloids were on the ropes two or three years ago, Newsday's publishers did not seem to have the instinct to go for the jugular. **********But last week, some of those who remembered when The Los Angeles Times first began to expand as a company several decades ago recalled that the entire purpose of buying other newspapers -- indeed, of buying Newsday in the first place -- was to provide a cushion to protect any one of its papers from the consequences of mistakes and bad breaks. **********Other large newspapers have sought similar cushions. Under that concept, the corporation as a whole might have supported a fledgling New York City newspaper until the paper could support itself. **********Over time, a big corporation grew around the business of putting out newspapers. And then, some of Times Mirror veterans said last week, it seemed that the imperatives of being a big corporation took over and obscured the original idea that the point of the whole enterprise was to put out and protect good papers. **********\"The tail is wagging the dog,\" said Kenneth Reich, who has been a reporter at The Los Angeles Times for 30 years. **********Or perhaps what Mr. Reich and his colleagues really meant was that it seemed that Times Mirror could no longer afford to have a chief executive who cared too much about newspapers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/world/yeltsin-calls-for-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Specter", "pub_date": "1995-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin Calls for Talks", "print_headline": "Yeltsin Calls for Talks", "body_text": " **********Eager for a central mediating role in the widening Balkan war, President Boris N.

Streets peopled only by Croatian police officers and soldiers moving among Serbian women, many of them worried about the fates of missing husbands and sons. **********Just over 1,000 Serbian men were rounded up by Croatian forces in the Pakrac area on Thursday evening and taken to three Croatian towns -- Bjelovar, Varazdin and Pozega -- for questioning. **********Despite a rebuke on Thursday from the United Nations Security Council to Croatia for that action, it appeared today from Red Cross and European Union reports that the Serbs were being treated well. Gunter Baron, a European Union monitor, said, \"They are being correctly treated as prisoners of war.\" **********There was no evidence in Pakrac of the looting by Croatian \"governmental and quasi-governmental organs\" that was criticized Thursday by the British representative at the United Nations. Indeed, the Croatian police were protecting the cars of Serbs for what they said would be eventual return to their owners. **********The Croatian Government, which has said all Serbian men who are not war criminals will be returned to their homes within days, today called the British statement \"tendentious and dangerous.\" **********If the Serbs remaining in Pakrac appeared satisfied with their treatment, they were clearly very worried about the men who have been taken away. \"What matters most at the moment is that the men should be brought back,\" Mr. Ivanovic said. \"It will be impossible to speak about the future until they have returned.\" **********A Serbian woman, Mira Resan, was sobbing uncontrollably. Her 17-year-old son, Ljubica, went out to visit some friends Thursday afternoon. At that moment, Croatian shelling started up -- either in response to a Serbian attack or in an attempt to force a final surrender. **********The boy has not been seen since. Mrs. Resan lost her other son, Milan, when he stepped on a mine in 1993. **********\"I've no idea where my boy is,\" she said. \"I don't know if he's dead or if the Croats have captured him.\" **********The dismay of Serbs in western Slavonia has clearly been reinforced by their sense of abandonment by their leadership in Krajina's stronghold, the town of Knin. Mr. Ivanovic said he was particularly angry with Milan Martic, the self-styled president of the Krajina Serbs. **********\"Mr. Martic left us high and dry,\" he said. \"He did not defend us. And then, when I was trying to negotiate a way out of this mess, he encouraged some Serbs to go on shooting at the Croats -- a policy that only brought more suffering and loss of life.\" **********The Croatian attack has revealed debilitating differences among the Serbs of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. United at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution in their desire to go on living in a single state, they now appear deeply divided between a bellicose and a moderate faction. **********Serbs in Pakrac said they support a moderate, Borislav Mikelic, who is the self-styled prime minister of the Krajina and close to Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic. **********Mr. Martic, the leader of the faction favoring all-out war against the Croats, is close to the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, whom he met on Thursday in Knin. **********Mr. Sarinic said the Croatian Government would do everything to strengthen the hand of the Serbian moderates. \"I am here to cool things down,\" he declared. \"But after what has happened, I am aware that it will take a generation to heal the wounds.\" **********Mr. Ivanovic, the former Mayor of the now-conquered part of Pakrac, shook his head. \"We are still in shock,\" he said. \"Can we Serbs now become part of Croatia? Some things are reality, even if they are difficult to talk about.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/business/company-reports-ford-s-profits-conclude-banner-year-for-big-three.html": {"writer_name": "James Bennet", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford's Profits Conclude Banner Year for Big Three", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS; Ford's Profits Conclude Banner Year for Big Three", "body_text": " **********By announcing today that it had posted a record profit of $ 5.3 billion for last year, the Ford Motor Company made it official. The Big Three auto makers made more money in 1994 -- almost $ 14 billion -- than ever before. **********And Ford's earnings report illustrated how they did it, even though the market for vehicles constituted about a million fewer sales than at its peak in 1986: emphasizing sales of more profitable mini-vans and sport utility vehicles like the Explorer, loading record amounts of overtime on their workers to increase productivity, and cutting other costs throughout the company. **********For the quarter, Ford earned a record $ 1.56 billion, more than double last year's results of $ 719 million. The results came on sales of $ 33.6 billion, up nearly 21 percent from the comparable quarter a year ago. **********Bolstered by a turnaround in Ford's overseas operations, the earnings were in line with analysts' estimates. But investors panicked, possibly because of confusion over a one-time gain of $ 110 million that Ford made in the quarter because of the devaluation of the Mexican peso. **********Ford hit a 52-week low of $ 24.50 a share and rose as high as $ 26.125 before finally closing at $ 25.125, down 12.5 cents, in heavy trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Investors may have also concluded that the industry will set no more records during this economic expansion. Today's report, combined with January sales figures released by some auto makers and another Fed interest-rate rise, underscores that the auto makers have entered treacherous times. **********\"This is an interesting period,\" David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, said. \"Sometimes I wish it wasn't quite as interesting.\" **********Like his rivals at General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation and most industry analysts, though, Mr. McCammon said that demand for cars, and the economy in general, remained vigorous. The Federal Reserve would succeed in restraining growth to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent this year, he predicted, meaning that sales should rise and Ford should top its 1994 earnings. **********Indeed, Ford projects the recovery could last into 1998, setting a new sales record along the way. \"We believe there's still plenty of steam left,\" Mr. McCammon said. **********For the year, the earnings worked out to $ 4.97 a share, compared with $ 2.27 in 1993. Sales rose more than 18 percent, to $ 128.4 billion. **********But there were warning signs in the company's report as well. **********Analysts said that Ford overproduced light trucks last year, piling them up on dealers' lots. That had the effect of raising 1994 earnings, since the company books a sale when it sells a vehicle to a dealer. But it also created excess inventories that Ford must siphon off by offering rebates and other incentives. **********Rebate costs in the fourth quarter averaged $ 860 a vehicle, outpacing the year's average of $ 710 and only slightly less than the $ 865 Ford spent in the fourth quarter of 1993. **********Mr. McCammon said Ford was using rebates to help its dealers reduce inventories, since higher interest rates had raised the cost of carrying large stocks. Once rebates are used to help sell vehicles, though, it is hard to remove them. \"I don't know if it's temporary or not,\" he acknowledged. **********Mr. McCammon projected incentives in the first quarter would average $ 715, up from $ 695 a year ago. The General Motors Corporation and Chrysler have also said that rebates could rise. **********Unlike G.M., Ford continues to generate its greatest profits at home, though its overseas operations rebounded from a loss last year to a gain of $ 784 million. Ford's net profit margins in the United States were a robust 4.2 percent, compared with 2.4 percent overseas. **********Over all, Ford's margin of 3.6 percent, narrowly ahead of G.M.'s 3.5 percent, is well short of both companies' goal of 5 percent. **********Like its rivals, Ford is hoarding cash to prepare for the next industry downturn. At the end of the quarter, Ford had net cash of $ 4.8 billion compared with $ 1.8 billion a year ago. Ford said that its pension funds were overfinanced by $ 2.5 billion. **********Mr. McCammon declined to say how much cash Ford thought would be sufficient to sustain its spending on new car and truck development during the next downturn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/business/company-news-host-marriott-sells-16-hotels-and-buys-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOST MARRIOTT SELLS 16 HOTELS AND BUYS 2", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HOST MARRIOTT SELLS 16 HOTELS AND BUYS 2", "body_text": " **********Continuing to shift the focus of its hotel assets to full-service operations, the Host Marriott Corporation said yesterday that it had sold 16 Courtyard hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust of Newton, Mass., for $150 million but would lease back the properties.

Personal income and spending showed gains that were lower than expected, and a manufacturing report was stronger than expected. **********The Commerce Department said June income was up four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with estimates of as much as six-tenths of 1 percent.  Spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent, compared with estimates of as much as five-tenths of 1 percent. **********While the increases were less than expected, the report also suggested that the economy was recovering at a pace fast enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve from lowering short-term interest rates anytime soon. **********\"The gap between personal income and personal spending does not suggest that there exists more room for consumption in the second half of the year,\" said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. \"Given the fact that consumption grew by a fairly robust 2.5 percent in the second quarter, any acceleration beyond this growth rate is bound to cause some concern for credit markets and present a potential stumbling block.\" **********Bond yields, which mirror expectations for inflation and the demand for loans, could be as high as 7.25 percent by Labor Day, Mr. Chan said. **********Signs of resilient strength in the economy were also seen in the July report of the Chicago purchasing managers. The managers' index of business activity rose to 49.7 percent, from 47.6 in June. The forecast had called for a rise to 47.5 versus 47.6 percent in June. **********\"Much of the inventory correction that was long awaited may have taken place a lot sooner than expected,\" Mr. Chan said. **********Mr. Chan said a jump the new orders component of the index suggested that the manufacturing sector was moving toward an expansion. \"Such a development, if it persists, may very well push long-term Treasury rates into a new trading range of 7 percent to 7.25 percent within the next two or three months,\" he said. **********The market typically pays attention to the Chicago purchasing managers' report because it is considered as a precursor to the broader report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which is scheduled to be released today. **********Yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 24/32 , to 10928/32 .

He said investors seeking reinvestment strategies should note the attractive municipal to Treasury yield ratios prevailing in today's fixed-income markets. **********\"Certain technical factors show the muni market in a slightly oversold condition,\" Mr. Appelbaum said, \"and while it's not posible to predict whether municipal securities will be less expensive in the near future, the current attractive relationships should not be overlooked.\" **********Municipal bonds were steady yesterday as investors focused on today's $1 billion sale of New York City bonds.

In a statement published today, the insurgents insisted again that Government forces must withdraw to their earlier positions before new peace talks can begin. **********Officials have also given contradictory accounts of how the Government treated captured rebels and how it gathered the intelligence with which it moved against the Zapatista National Liberation Army. **********In particular, doubts have arisen about a man described by the Secretariat of Government, Mexico's interior ministry, as a turncoat rebel commander who provided crucial information about his former comrades, their sources of money and their ties to the Roman Catholic Church. **********A senior ministry official said last week that the man was in custody in Mexico's highest-security prison, which the ministry controls.

Yet even as the threat of military confrontation in Chiapas has receded, political tensions in the state seemed only to grow. **********On Sunday in the Chiapas city of San Cristobal de las Casas, demonstrators demanding the removal of the liberal Roman Catholic Bishop, Samuel Ruiz Garcia, attacked supporters of the Bishop outside his 16th-century cathedral.

But it also appeared that the commission's investigators reached few of the remote parts of the Lacandon rain forest to which the peasants who support the Zapatistas have fled and from which reporters have gathered accounts of mistreatment by army patrols. **********As has often been the case in the past, the commission provided more evidence of torture by the police. In the most important case, that of seven accused rebels captured at a safe house in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz just before the Chiapas offensive, it said forensic doctors found evidence of torture on four of five men detained. **********The report, which also noted claims of electric-shock torture by the two women who were arrested, directly contradicted an earlier report in which an investigator from the federal Attorney General's Office absolved the police of any abuses. But the commission was vague about which police or prison officials might be responsible for the prisoners' mistreatment. **********The rights commission also supported claims by other accused rebels who said they had been pressed into signing confessions that they had not even been allowed to read. Along with new questions about the reported defection of a rebel commander, Salvador Morales Garibay, the commission's report raised further doubts about the Government's depiction of the rebel movement. **********At a briefing for foreign reporters on Friday, a senior official of the Interior Ministry said Mr. Morales had been one of four top commanders of the Zapatista force until he had turned to the army out of anger at the leadership of the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos. **********It was Mr. Morales, in court testimony on Feb. 8, who provided by far the most damaging information on the insurgents: that they had been financed in part by a leftist bus drivers' union in Mexico City, that they had received support in Nicaragua from the longtime intelligence chief of the Sandinista Front, and that Bishop Ruiz had known of their activities long before their uprising on Jan. 1, 1994. **********But while failing to provide any confirmation of Mr. Morales's assertions, the Interior Ministry has also failed to produce Mr. Morales.

Five officers were killed in what authorities say may have been some attempt at revenge for either of the two earlier incidents. **********\"Sure we're afraid, wouldn't you be?\" said Ramiro Andres Flores, a 50-year-old laborer who lives not far from the ditch where the Salgado family was killed. He got off his burro to show reporters where the bodies had been found. The ditch was marked with a dirty T-shirt, and on the spots where the men, women and a 2-year-old boy were forced to lie before being shot there were small bunches of purple flowers and dark patches where the grass was mixed with blood. **********\"There is no law here in the mountains -- that's why so many bad things have happened here,\" Mr. Flores said. \"The only law around here is money.\" **********Even though the state has a dark heritage of political and criminal violence, the latest bloodletting in Guerrero has put Governor Ruben Figueroa Alcocer on the defensive. Leaders of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, which has pockets of strength in the state, are pressing him to resign on the grounds that the state has become ungovernable. President Ernesto Zedillo has so far resisted demands that he intervene, saying it is the state, and not the federal Government, that has jurisdiction. **********Mr. Figueroa, who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, has asserted that the police who fired on the peasants in Coyuca de Benitez were defending themselves from an initial attack by the peasants. There is even a videotape, taken by the police, that appears inconclusive but that the authorities say shows the peasants attacked first. **********Still, 10 policemen have been arrested in the case, and local photographers assert that the police put guns in the hands of dead peasants to make it appear that they had fired first. And the leftist Mayor of a nearby town says that on the day before the shooting, Governor Figueroa told the directors of a local hospital to be prepared for something big. **********The Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center, a Jesuit organization, blames the state's long tradition of iron-handed control and corruption for having created \"an atmosphere of confrontation and general violence that has resulted in those people with the least protection being the most threatened.\" **********Nestor Inocenzia Marquez, the Mayor of San Miguel Totolapan, played down the violence. \"What's happened in Guerrero over the last two weeks,\" he said, \"is just coincidence, awful of course, but because of the state's reputation people make something bigger out of it.\" **********Indeed, down at the local tavern and on the streets of San Miguel, life seemed to have returned to normal just a day after the mass burial. **********\"We are accustomed to the violence,\" said Placido, a 33-year-old policeman in San Miguel who was afraid to give his last name. \"What happened out there on the road was between families, revenge, you know? It happens all the time here, especially up in the mountains, where even we police don't go.\" **********In those same mountains a guerrilla movement arose in the late 1960's that, until the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas state in January 1994, was the most significant revolt against government authority in Mexico since the Revolution of 1910. **********The movement, led by a former teacher named Lucio Cabanas, became known throughout Mexico on May 30, 1974, when it kidnapped Ruben Figueroa Figueroa, then a gubernatorial candidate and father of the current Governor. Army troops freed the elder Mr. Figueroa, who went on to become one of Guerrero's most repressive governors. Mr. Cabanas was killed by soliders a few months later. **********\"What we're seeing from this current government is a return to the old way of looking at things,\" said Marcelino Diaz de Jesus, an Indian leader in Guerrero. \"Figueroa the father was one of the most murderous governors Guerrero has had, and his son is proving himself to be very brutal as well.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/business/executive-changes-315095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********ARMSTRONG WORLD INDUSTRIES, Lancaster, Pa., named Frank A.

Mr. Clinton has probably done more for American businesses operating abroad than any President in postwar history, turning the Commerce Department into a forceful advocate for American companies, pressing foreign governments to send business their way and raising trade issues to the top of the foreign policy agenda. But as the election approaches, Mr. Clinton also wants to protect his left flank after alienating many in the human rights community. **********The chief problem is that America's allies, who are also its biggest economic competitors, have no such codes, and companies in those nations stand to sweep in business that the United States passes by. That issue was highlighted earlier this month when the Clinton Administration barred Conoco Inc. from entering a billion-dollar development deal with Iran. Now French oil companies are negotiating with Iran to replace Conoco. **********It is unclear how many businesses will abide by the Administration's proposed code. Some executives reached last week said that if the wording is sufficiently weak or vague and appears unlikely to affect their competitiveness, there will probably be widespread adherence to what the Administration calls \"a model of behavior.\" **********But already there are signs that the final draft has so many compromises that it will disappoint the human rights groups it was trying to satisfy in the first place. **********Details of the code have not been disclosed, but Administration officials acknowledge that many provisions governing the rights of foreign workers have been weakened in deference to the commercial realities of competing with the Japanese and Europeans. **********People who have seen parts of the code say its strongest statements refer to bans on child labor and the use of prison laborers, actions that most large companies already say they oppose. The code will have deliberately vague language urging companies to respect the right of workers to organize and stops short of asking them to encourage such activities. The fear, several Administration officials said, is that such activity could be viewed in many nations -- including China -- as an effort to undermine national laws that strictly regulate labor activities. **********The principles will be described to corporate executives, members of Congress and human rights groups by the White House on Monday. But the code will make no mention of paying a \"fair wage\" to workers in developing countries and emerging markets, and it sidesteps the question of how companies should treat workers who are prosecuted for engaging in political dissent in countries like China. **********Nonetheless, the code is the biggest effort by the United States in two decades to create a minimum standard of conduct abroad for American companies. The last such effort was the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which bars American companies from bribing officials of foreign governments. That act has been widely criticized by American executives in recent years, who contend that while it is well intentioned, it often places them at a competitive disadvantage when they are bidding against companies from countries without comparable laws. **********\"We're back to the same problem again,\" a senior Administration official said. \"This time we're juggling the interests of the business community and human rights, and discovering that it's an impossible balancing act.\" **********In a declaration issued at the time he made the decision to extend China's trade privileges, Mr. Clinton committed himself to increased broadcasts into China by Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, more support for nongovernmental human rights groups operating in China and \"the development with American business leaders of a voluntary set of principles for business activity in China.\" **********Progress on the first two commitments has been minimal. When the Administration began drafting the code of conduct, the State Department argued that developing such a code only for businesses operating in China would further irritate relations between the two countries. So President Clinton's plan quickly evolved into the development of what Secretary of State Warren Christopher described to Congress last month as \"the promulgation of a worldwide standard for the conduct of American business, not focused primarily on China, but focused on the world as a whole.\" **********Many private companies already have codes of conduct for their operations abroad, including running-shoe manufacturers like Reebok and Nike, which have advertised their standards and used them as a selling point with American consumers. An Administration official who was deeply involved in drafting the new guidelines said that the White House reviewed several of the corporate codes and also looked at standards published by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, whose members have extensive manufacturing operations in China. **********But in the course of consultation with the Administration last year, several executives warned the White House that its early drafts of the code would place a burden on American companies that was not shared by Japanese and European companies -- especially if the code appeared to create a standard for some kind of minimum wage. **********\"I give them credit, because no other Administration has even attempted to do something like this,\" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, which was formerly known as Asia Watch. \"But they waited too long, and the human rights situation in China has deteriorated\" since President Clinton decided to extend what in the trade community is called \"most favored nation\" status to Beijing, he said. **********\"If the President had pulled C.E.O.'s into the Oval Office last May when he issued the M.F.N. decision,\" Mr. Jendrzejczyk said, \"he might have generated broader business support.

It means that Israelis and Palestinians should go their different ways, and its leading exponent is Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. **********Since the latest deaths, mostly of young soldiers, he has made \"separation\" a clarion call and says his Government will start as early as next week to figure out how to do it. He is determined, he says, that people living in Israel proper, his main concern, will no longer be \"vulnerable to terror\" from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. **********Some Cabinet ministers were already talking today about putting up a high fence between Israel and the West Bank, with a few proposing border guards and dogs as enforcers. Newspapers here were filled with supposedly official estimates of how much such a step would cost, how long it would take and exactly where such a wall would be erected, since Mr. Rabin says there is no way he will return to the borders that defined the West Bank before 1967, when Israel captured the territory in war. **********At the least, he reaffirmed on Monday night in a televised speech intended to rally his demoralized country, Israel will hold onto all of Jerusalem and keep land near the Jordan River as its \"security border.\" But beyond that broad outline, a spokesman for Mr. Rabin cautioned, there are few clear details because the idea is still in an embryonic stage, far from being ready for map- and budget-makers. **********Still, fences are not an outlandish idea, given the fact that Israel already has them on its borders with Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt and is finishing a new high-tech model to girdle the Gaza Strip, now under Palestinian control. **********The curving border with the West Bank has no real demarcation and is highly porous, enabling hundreds of Palestinians a day to slip around army checkpoints and enter Israel illegally along back roads. Most do so only to reach sorely needed jobs. But a few are out to kill Israelis, more and more by blowing themselves up in the name of Islamic radicalism. **********After a series of suicide bombings, the one on Sunday was the final straw for many in Israel. They are now ready not just for a separation but for a full divorce. **********Of course, that has been the goal all along of the peace deal between Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat that put the Palestine Liberation Organization in charge of Gaza and Jericho, with promises of much more to come in the West Bank. But it has been a messy parting thus far. Not only is the couple still sharing the same house but their cohabitation arrangements are complicated; the Palestinians' two rooms, Gaza and Jericho, are not even connected. **********The patchwork of Israeli settlements across the West Bank makes separation all the more complex. And economically the partners continue to depend on each other. Tens of thousands of Palestinians feed their families through low-paying jobs in Israel, and many Israeli contractors and farmers have yet to wean themselves from this cheap labor. **********Within hours of the latest bomb attack, the Rabin Government followed a familiar pattern and ordered the borders closed, keeping these working Palestinians at home and frustrated. If the past is a guide, though, the labor flow will resume sooner or later -- until the next time. **********For their part, Palestinian political leaders say separation would be fine with them if it were based on mutual consideration and equality. Instead, they complain, Israel opens and shuts the borders as it sees fit, and looks upon fences and security systems through the eyes of an occupying force, thinking only of its own interests. **********Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel in peace talks that have been on hold since Sunday, said in Gaza today that separation was acceptable if it came with the creation of a full Palestinian state, something Israel opposes. As matters now stand, he said, separation \"really means closure, which means siege and prison to the Palestinians.\" **********So with the couple likely to maintain their painful relationship for a while, attention also turned today to cracking down on militant Muslim groups in the territories: Hamas and Islamic Holy War, which took responsibility for the bombing on Sunday, at a gathering point for Israeli soldiers in central Israel. **********Israeli forces raided mosques and offices in several West Bank towns, arresting about 60 accused militants, according to the Israel Radio. In Hebron, a spokesman for the Palestinian Islamic Society, a clergymen's association, said that soldiers had broken in, seized books and equipment and handed him an order to close the offices for six months. The army called the society a Hamas-linked group fomenting anti-Israel actions. **********\"We are carrying out a war to the end against Hamas and Islamic Holy War,\" said Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, the army commander for central Israel, including the West Bank. **********In Gaza, Mr. Arafat said he would no longer tolerate attacks on Israelis by extremists from the coastal strip, and his Palestinian police officers detained Abdallah al-Shami, chief spokesman for Islamic Holy War. A few hours later, Mr. Shami was back home saying he had been called in for \"consultations.\" **********Similarly brief arrests have become a Gaza routine, persuading most Israelis that Mr. Arafat's promises to get tough are empty words. But many are just as disaffected with their own Government, a trend that is reflected by its slide in opinion polls. **********It is not just because of the bombings. It is also because they feel Mr. Rabin and his ministers seem to vacillate on crucial issues. Many officials, the Prime Minister included, speak scornfully of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, then say they can do nothing about them now. They insist that Jewish areas near Jerusalem must be built up, then back away from that position. They say Mr. Arafat is doing a mediocre job, then say Israel needs him all the same. **********\"The problem is the combination of the terror attacks and what appears more and more to be a loss of way by Rabin,\" said Nahum Barnea, a columnist for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot who often writes favorably of the Government. **********Another commentator, Yoel Marcus of Haaretz, warned that the Prime Minister might be pushed to the political brink if his peace talks collapse. **********\"If I were an insurance agency,\" he wrote today, \"I wouldn't take out life insurance on this Government.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/12/business/a-pay-raise-s-impact.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1995-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Pay Raise's Impact", "print_headline": "A Pay Raise's Impact", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration, which appears to be advocating a higher minimum wage as one of its major policy objectives, is doing so at a time when most economists find less damage from raising the minimum wage than they once did. **********A chief argument against raising the minimum wage, among both economists and politicians, is the fear of job losses. The threat is that employers will dismiss thousands of workers on the ground that they lack the skills to be worth more than the minimum wage, which is $4.25 an hour. But nearly all these estimates of job losses have shrunk as research continues. **********\"The main thing about this research is that the evidence of job loss is weak,\" said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"And the fact that the evidence is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small.\" **********That does not quiet the debate. The new Republican leaders in Congress have vowed to reject any bill to raise the minimum wage, invoking the prospect of job losses as the chief reason. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, House majority leader, said last week that he not only opposed an increase in the minimum wage, but would also like to repeal the law. **********Still, Vice President Al Gore and the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, in recent appearances have publicly supported a higher minimum wage. President Clinton may endorse the move this week or next. **********\"Lifting the minimum wage is one of several major initiatives designed to lift the wages of all working Americans,\" a senior Administration official said. He ranked its importance with the President's recent tax cut proposals for middle-income families. **********For all the political controversy surrounding the minimum wage, economists who study the issue have managed to agree on several key findings. These agreements help to explain why the minimum wage debate, as Mr. Gephardt put it, has become \"a metaphor for the differences between Democrats and Republicans.\" **********Contrary to popular wisdom, for example, economists have found that only one-third of the roughly four million minimum-wage earners are teen-agers. The rest are adults older than 25, a significant number of whom -- some say as many as 45 percent -- provide nearly half of their families' incomes. Raising the minimum by 75 cents an hour, the amount being considered by the Administration, would bring a gain in living standards, but only for those who do not lose their jobs. **********Economists have also found that raising the minimum wage produces a net gain in total income. That is, the total income growth for minimum-wage workers who keep their jobs exceeds the income lost by those who lose theirs. **********The gains in income, for some economists and politicians, can thus outweigh the loss in jobs. \"If your objective is to make work pay well enough so that it takes fewer wage earners in a family to keep the family out of poverty, then raising the minimum wage is a worthy goal,\" said Henry J. Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution. **********That is a goal mentioned by Administration officials. But for many Republicans and for Finis Welch, a labor economist at Texas A & M University, saving jobs should be the higher priority. \"We are in effect telling unskilled people that if they are not worth the wages we set, they cannot work,\" said Mr. Welch, who added that he believed most employers would do little to train low-skilled workers so they could become more valuable and eventually worth the higher minimum wage. **********But Mr. Welch and other economists agree that a higher minimum wage tends to lure people out of idleness and into jobs by making work more valuable than, say, the alternative of government welfare programs. As a result, the cost of low-income workers shifts a bit to business from the public sector. **********Finally, there is agreement that a higher minimum wage has a ripple effect, pushing up wages for those earning as much as 50 cents more than the previous minimum. More than 5.5 million workers, or nearly 5 percent of the workforce, receive wages within 50 cents of the minimum, which rose to $4.25 in 1991 from $3.80. That's one reason that business regularly opposes increases in the minimum wage. **********Yet the principal battle cry against raising the minimum wage -- job losses -- is no longer as powerful an argument as it once was. A decade ago, most studies concluded that 1 percent or more of all minimum wage workers lost their jobs for each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage. The most recent studies put the job losses at less than 1 percent, or roughly 40,000 people if Congress were to increase the current minimum by 75 cents, a jump of nearly 18 percent. **********Some studies go even further. Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend that there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage. Mr. Krueger recently became chief economist at the Labor Department, where he is an adviser to Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor and a principal advocate within the Clinton Administration of lifting wages at the low end of the job ladder. **********By contrast, Mr. Welch at Texas A & M insists that the traditional view about job loss is still correct. His new study, done with two colleagues, Donald Deere of Texas A & M and Kevin M. Murphy of the University of Chicago, was made public on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Washington. It estimated that a 10 percent rise in the minimum wage between 1989 and 1991 produced job losses of at least 1 percent of all minimum wage workers. That would be roughly 60,000 people if the current minimum were raised by 75 cents. **********Alone among the most recent studies, said Charles Brown, a University of Michigan labor economist, \"the Welch findings go back to an older thesis that there was a bigger job impact when the minimum wage rose.\" **********President Clinton promised, in the 1992 election campaign, to raise the minimum wage. But he took no action while he pursued a health insurance bill. Now Administration officials argue that raising the minimum, which has lost a third of its purchasing power since 1979, would help narrow the wage gap between low- and middle-income workers. **********Professor Solow of M.I.T. agrees. \"When the minimum wage has deteriorated so much in purchasing power,\" he said, \"there are probably enough people who would be worth the higher wage and would not lose their jobs.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/12/business/eurotunnel-units-slip-after-sales-report.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eurotunnel Units Slip After Sales Report", "print_headline": "Eurotunnel Units Slip After Sales Report", "body_text": " **********Units in Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, dropped as much as 5.6 percent in early trading yesterday after the company reported second-quarter sales of $:60.3 million ($96 million). **********At the end of trading, units were down 0.05 franc, to 14.3 francs, on the French stock exchange and were unchanged at 179 pence in London. **********The operator has said that this summer represents the make or break period for the company.

A job at a bank, good pay, prestige and opportunities for promotion. But he did something that once would have shocked many Japanese. **********He quit and took a job elsewhere. **********\"Ever since I was a college student, I wanted to do something related to U.S.-Japan relations,\" Mr. Sasaki said. So he found a job at Sony, in the international relations department. \"Sony,\" he said, \"made my dream come true.\" **********Mr. Sasaki, 31, is among the growing ranks of Japanese workers in this land of lifelong employment who have followed their dreams out the office door. While American workers, both the laid-off and the survivors, grapple with cutbacks, one in three Japanese workers willingly walks away from his job within the first 10 years of his career, according to the Japanese Institute of Labor, a private research organization. And many more are thinking about it. More than half of salaried Japanese workers say they would switch jobs or start their own business if a favorable opportunity arose, according to a survey by the Recruit Research Corporation. **********\"People's attitude toward changing jobs has markedly changed,\" said Torao Tanaka, editor in chief of B-ing, Japan's biggest recruitment magazine. \"In the past, we always had difficulty asking people who had changed jobs to appear for interviews, even if their new job was going well. They would feel so sorry or embarrassed for the company they left behind.\" **********But two recent economic developments have made Japanese workers, particularly younger people, increasingly mobile. As Japan's economy boomed in the mid-1980's, many expanding companies aggressively sought experienced workers as well as entry-level college seniors. Then, when the \"bubble\" economy burst in the early 1990's, the same corporations were forced to cast off many employees, through buyouts and dismissals. These trends -- midcareer hirings and midcareer dismissals -- had the same result: a weakened national attachment to one job for life. **********Sometimes, foreign influences further attenuate the old way. For many years, Akitaka Asaga, 38, was one of Toyota's \"most dedicated employees,\" he said. But when he went to business school in the United States, his outlook changed. \"School taught me that I really have to retrain myself as a specialist and otherwise I won't be able to survive in this world,\" he said. Toyota and other Japanese companies, however, shape people as generalists, not specialists. **********Now, Mr. Asaga works in his chosen field -- corporate finance -- at a Ford office near Tokyo. \"I had never thought that there was such a good company like Ford,\" he said. \"My hours are considerably shorter, and I get to set the pace of my work.\" **********But job-switching has its downside, too -- and it goes beyond the predictable risk that the new job won't pan out. **********\"Those who make lateral entries often face discrimination in promotion and other kinds of frustration,\" said Tatsuya Kubo, 37, a former Toyota employee who now works for a large securities company. Many Japanese companies, particularly large ones, \"tend to favor those who rise through the corporate ranks,\" he said. Japanese words like Junketsu-shugi (the principle of \"pure blood\") and Haenuki (true born) prove the point. According to Mr. Tanaka of B-ing magazine, the advantage stems from the valuable familiarity with company culture and a wide network of allies that longtime workers can acquire. **********A fickle reputation is another peril for Japanese job-changers. \"Recruiters of a company would frown upon anyone who changed jobs too frequently, said Naomiki Amano, a counselor at an employment agency run by the Government. \"They would question your personality.\" **********Of course, lifelong employment is hardly dead; it serves the companies and workers' needs in many ways. But mobility is on the upswing. Mika Ishida, 32, who had three different jobs before joining Sony five years ago, said her company had been very open to job-seekers with previous experience. And the numbers show it. About 40 percent of Sony's managers have worked elsewhere. **********And while that number is unusually high, it may not be long before other companies equal it, adopting the attitude of Akio Morita, Sony's retired chief executive. Mr. Morita \"used to say in his address to the new recruits that they should all have a dream,\" Ms. Ishida said, \"and if they find that it cannot be realized at Sony, they should consider leaving for a different job. Because after all, we have only one life to live.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/company-news-olsten-and-hooper-holmes-in-swap-transaction.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLSTEN AND HOOPER HOLMES IN SWAP TRANSACTION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; OLSTEN AND HOOPER HOLMES IN SWAP TRANSACTION", "body_text": " **********The Olsten Corporation said yesterday that it was acquiring Nurse's House Call, the home health care business of Hooper Holmes Inc.

It seeks major revisions in the laws governing freedom of the press, freedom of association, guarantees of basic human rights and the establishment of a constitutional court. **********\"Looking over the whole process of the movement that culminated on June 4,\" it says, \"we think one of the most important reasons for this bloody tragedy is that the ruling authorities could not acknowledge and adapt to the global trend of openness, diversification and democracy and could not solve China's social problems through the process of democracy and the rule of law.\" **********\"Instead, it once again treated the citizens' acts of political participation with hostility and autocracy,\" the document says. **********The detention of Mr. Liu came just hours after the Government spokesman, Shen Guofang, told reporters that Chinese citizens have a right to petition their Government.

They also work with peers in other parts of the university, hooking up, for instance, with students at the medical school to learn ways to bring new technologies to market. And many study and work abroad as part of a global immersion program, immersing themselves as well in Western and Eastern concepts of leadership. **********BY forcing through these changes and more during his tenure, the 53-year-old Mr. Gerrity has turned traditional ways of imparting business education upside down -- and made himself something of the guru of business school re-engineering. And why not? The dean, it turns out, is one of the grand old men of re-engineering, helping to develop many of its core ideas during the 1980's when he ran the Index Group, a consulting company that is now part of the CSC Consulting Group, itself a part of the giant Computer Sciences Corporation. **********In the words of Mr. Champy, an old friend and former colleague at the Index Group who now heads CSC Consulting: \"Tom Gerrity has re-engineered the Wharton School.\" **********And that is hardly an academic distinction. Criticism has been mounting in recent years that business schools have failed to produce the kind of M.B.A.'s who can meet companies' changing needs. Several schools have been wrestling with the issue, and some, like Northwestern University's Kellogg School, made extensive changes during the 80's. **********But Mr. Gerrity has taken Wharton further down the re-engineering road than any other top Ivy League business school. The result, say Wharton boosters, are graduates with stronger teamwork and leadership skills, better equipped to face the challenges of volatile, global markets. Says Lewis Platt, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and a member of Wharton's board of overseers: \"These changes are making education at Wharton much more relevant to the needs of business.\" Students agree. Says William McCoy, chairman of the graduate students' advisory council: \"The changes affect not only the way we are taught, but also the way we will approach problems in the business community.\" **********These days, it seems as if the dean and the school are getting high marks from everyone. A Business Week survey last October of more than 350 companies that regularly recruit M.B.A.'s named Wharton the country's best business school, up from No. 4 in the last survey, in 1992. **********And Wharton's \"customer base\" seems pleased, too. Applications for next fall's M.B.A. class are up 53 percent over last year, running at a pace that would mean 6,000 people vying for about 750 places. There was a similar gain in the number of participants in the school's executive education programs, an index of business confidence and a lucrative source of revenue. In 1993, 266 senior managers took part; last year, 397 did. And earlier this year, the school received one of the largest gifts in its history, $5 million, pushing its endowment to $147 million, compared with $90 million when Mr. Gerrity signed on. **********The dean himself is increasingly sought out to speak on what he has wrought at Wharton, the nation's oldest business school, founded in 1881 by Joseph Wharton, a Philadelphia industrialist and philanthropist. In January, Mr. Gerrity talked about M.B.A. training at the high-profile symposium of business, education and government leaders held each year in Davos, Switzerland. **********To be sure, while Mr. Gerrity has won lots of applause for his re-engineering efforts, the passage has had its rough spots. In the early days, the changes sparked confusion among both students and faculty. In addition, while some faculty members were skeptical about whether the changes would work, others wondered if they were necessary. Most of Mr. Gerrity's associates praise his collegial leadership style, but a few also have complaints. Among them: he works so hard that he has little time to mentor faculty members. Mr. Gerrity himself wishes he had \"three extra days in the week for myself and each of the faculty.\" **********And the re-engineering process has needed its own re-engineering. For example, the foreign study program, which was once supposed to be mandatory, had to be made optional when Mr. Gerrity realized that its cost was too high for some students. **********Still, he hung in there. \"He provided steady leadership,\" said Janice Bellace, deputy dean of the school. \"He truly believes in teamwork. Intellectual arrogance is not his suit at all.\" **********Mr. Gerrity learned how to roll with the punches early on. An Air Force brat, he traveled with his family from base to base every few years as his father rose to the rank of four-star general. He eventually wound up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. He also went out for sports, including wrestling. Mr. Champy, who was a roommate in those days, remembers that Mr. Gerrity, who \"did everything quite well,\" was adventurous and wont to take risks others might consider too daring. During a visit to Wyoming one winter, for example, Mr. Gerrity wandered out among a herd of elk that made its home near Yellowstone National Park, terrifying his friends. \"It was crazy,\" Mr. Champy remembers. \"The herd had thousands of elk who might have stampeded.\" **********After completing his master's degree in 1964, Mr. Gerrity went to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship to study industrial economics. \"I had a wonderful time at Oxford,\" he recalls. \"It was a very different learning experience than M.I.T., which was a very intense, challenging, problem-solving place.\" By contrast, Oxford was relaxed and discursive, where learning occurred almost through dialogue with fellow students. **********Mr. Gerrity returned to M.I.T. to study management at the Sloan School. While working on a field project for his Ph.D. thesis, a business opportunity emerged. Mr. Gerrity had developed one of the first software programs for portfolio managers, and a bank in Chicago was keen on buying it. So Mr. Gerrity and several friends, including Mr. Champy, with guidance from a faculty member, formed their own company in 1969. They called it the Index Group -- playing on the words information and decision systems, or indecs -- and started developing similar software systems for other companies. Mr. Gerrity split his time between the Index Group and M.I.T., completing his Ph.D. in 1970 and then joining the faculty, teaching information management for four years. He was constantly being drawn deeper into business, however, and in 1974 joined the company full time. \"We set out to become a leader in the strategic management of information technology,\" he said. \"We accomplished that by the early 1980's.\" **********In 1983, the Index Group went through a major restructuring. The company spun off some operations and stayed on with a stripped-down consulting business that had $6 million in revenues. Says Mr. Gerrity: \"We went through several days of re-examination of who we were and who we wanted to be.\" Going through that exercise helped the Index Group hone the basic concepts of re-engineering, though there was some dispute about what it should be called. **********\"In one of those discussions, someone suggested calling it business re-engineering,\" Mr. Gerrity said. \"My initial reaction was, 'It's too techie. I don't think that name will work.' There's an important lesson there. If you think you have all the wisdom, you are in deep trouble.\" **********Mr. Gerrity and his partners sold the Index Group to Computer Sciences in 1988. Reason: the company needed scale. \"We went from consulting projects of $1 million or $2 million to $15 million. We needed to put a lot of talent behind implementing these large-scale projects,\" Mr. Gerrity explains. Soon, he became head of CSC Consulting. **********Mr. Gerrity was working at CSC Consulting in 1989 when a search committee from Wharton came calling. Russell E. Palmer, the dean, had announced that summer that he would leave the following July. **********\"We were looking for someone with a business and academic background,\" said Edward Bowman, a professor of corporate management who was on the search committee. \"We went from a list of 200 people to 20 to 6 to 1. He was the 1.\" **********Mr. Gerrity found Wharton's offer attractive because it appealed to his sense of working for a higher calling. \"Here was an opportunity to contribute to an institution that touched thousands of students who go out to thousands of firms all over the world,\" he said. **********For the future, Mr. Gerrity wants to keep building on the Wharton School's forward momentum. Does he have plans to go back to business? Absolutely not, he replies. \"I'm delighted with what I am doing. It's renaissance time for the school.\"Thomas P.

A journeyman metal worker, Mr. Koseki can craft a turbine blade or a shaft to a precision of less than the thickness of a human hair. He has also written books celebrating the Japanese metal-working artisan. But Mr. Koseki, 62, said such craftsmen were now a dying breed. **********In this city's Ota Ward, where he works, many of the small metal-working factories are falling victim to hard times and the soaring yen, leaving a feeling of helplessness, \"like a carp on a cutting board.\" His own employer has only eight workers left, down from 20 a few years ago. **********For all the focus on how the rising yen is hurting powerful exporters like Honda and Hitachi, the impact is far worse on the small, anonymous manufacturers supplying the parts to the brand-name giants. The small factories either cut the prices of their parts to help the big companies maintain their profits or they lose business when the bigger companies relocate factories offshore. **********Yet these small factories have been instrumental in making Japan Inc. what it is -- an efficient producer of high-quality goods. And as their numbers keep on dropping, there is growing fear that Japan is losing some of its fundamental manufacturing know-how and possibly its ability to produce new products in the future. **********National and local officials, as well as the companies themselves, are devising countermeasures. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is offering loans as well as advice to small factories. **********In Ota Ward, the local government formed a special task force to come up with ways to preserve the factories. Tadao Kamiya, a ward official, said the goal was not to keep all the factories but rather a \"manufacturing minimum\" -- enough to insure that know-how gets passed to the next generation. One plan is for the ward to give loans to factories to help master craftsmen train younger workers. **********The ebbing of the manufacturing culture in Japan is being played out in Ota Ward, an area in southern Tokyo that is home to more than 7,000 small, mostly metal-working factories, 80 percent of them with fewer than 10 employees. These are not the direct suppliers to the big companies, but second- or third-tier ones. **********In the last decade, more than 2,000 factories have vanished from Ota Ward, driven out of business, or at least out of Tokyo, by land prices, recession, difficulties in recruiting workers and the rise of the yen. **********In one sense, Ota Ward is to metal working in Japan what Silicon Valley is to electronics in the United States. Just as Silicon Valley has the engineers, programmers and financiers who can join to create electronic products, so Ota Ward has a network of specialized workers to supply virtually any metal part, often quickly and in lots as small as one. **********The factories can share jobs, allowing them to accept bigger and more complex orders than any one shop could handle by itself. **********\"The high level of technology arises because these small factories complement one another,\" said Atsuhiko Takeuchi, a professor of geography at the Nippon Institute of Technology, near Tokyo. \"In that regard, this is the only place where such a concentration exists.\" **********Kuwashi Otomo, who owns a small grinding shop in Ota Ward, cited an instance of such industrial networking -- a complex valve that is part of a machine used to make computer chips in South Korea. Eight companies in Mr. Otomo's neighborhood teamed up to make the valve, with one doing the specialized welding, another the screw, and so on. **********Mr. Otomo said the valve could not yet be made in South Korea or other Asian nations with lower wages. The same is true, experts said, of many high-precision parts used in aviation, electric power generation and electronics equipment. **********But run-of-the-mill parts, like pins and screws, can be made offshore, and such work is leaving Japan. Mitsuhiro Seki, a professor at Senshu University, said that Japan was losing its \"full set\" industrial structure, in which it made virtually all components by itself, and would be more fully integrated with the economies of other Asian nations. **********American parts suppliers could also benefit as the big Japanese companies move more of their manufacturing -- of cars, machine tools and electronics -- to the United States. **********The Ricoh Company, the office equipment maker, is now importing 10 percent of its parts, from China and elsewhere, up from 2 percent a few years ago, although the heart of a copier machine, a specially coated aluminum cylinder, can still be made only in Japan. The company has urged its 350 local suppliers, one- tenth of whom are in Ota Ward, to adopt more sophisticated technology or face losing business. **********Takahide Kaneko, general manager of Ricoh's purchasing division, noted that salaries in China are one-tenth or one-fifteenth of those in Japan. Senior craftsmen in Ota Ward can make more than 5 million yen a year. In the last four months, the dollar equivalent of that has risen to $60,000 from $50,000. **********The pressures on small companies are heightened because many of them borrowed heavily during Japan's speculative boom of the late 1980's to buy new computerized machine tools, which can cost $100,000 apiece. **********\"At the peak I was boasting to people that debt is a barometer of your power -- it shows how creditworthy you are,\" said Norihide Fujita, 50, a factory owner. **********Mr. Fujita's company makes metal molds for one customer, Fujikura Ltd., which uses the molds to stamp out printed circuit boards. The boards are sold to another company making speedometers for Nissan cars. **********But in 1989 Fujikura moved part of its operations to Thailand, even studying Mr. Fujita's shop to set up its own metal mold operation there. **********Mr. Fujita's sales have dropped to 80 million yen, or about $1 million, from 140 million yen a few years ago. Since January, he said, four of his eight workers had quit. And these days Mr. Fujita can afford to pay only interest, not the principal, on his loans. **********\"Actually, we want to quit but we cannot because of the debt,\" Mr. Fujita said. \"Probably most of the factories in Ota Ward are in that situation.\" **********The constant pressure to cut costs has strained what is supposed to be a harmonious, long-term relationship between the big companies and their suppliers. **********Manufacturers are forcing the small companies to bid against one another, and suppliers who cannot meet demands for price reductions are losing business. Mr. Otomo, the grinding shop owner, said the big companies often unilaterally cut prices or changed the terms of an agreement. **********\"They say orally that an order will continue for a year,\" he said. \"It never continues for a year.\" **********Recruiting is another problem. In Ota Ward's heyday -- during Japan's high-growth years of the 1950's through the 1970's -- 15-year-old junior high school graduates known as \"golden eggs\" would arrive in Tokyo from the hinterlands and find work in metal shops. After they became skilled craftsmen, many would go into business for themselves. **********But nowadays, affluent and well-educated Japanese young people shun factory work. At Mr. Koseki's factory, the eight remaining employees are all more than 50 years old. Teiichi Matsuda, the factory owner, said he had given up trying to find young blood. So it is a matter of time before the factory shuts down. **********The real estate boom in the late 1980's created more problems. It forced some factories to move to outlying areas with cheaper rents. Some owners converted their factories to more lucrative apartments. (There are few zoning restrictions in Japan.) Since Ota Ward is in the middle of a big metropolis, defunct factories quickly give way to office buildings or shops. So the area has avoided the fate of Bridgeport, Conn., which turned into an urban basket case when its factories shut down. **********Masahito Ohma now manages an apartment house built on the site of the factory he closed in 1990. The factory, started by Mr. Ohma's father in 1951, made lenses and other camera parts but suffered as Japanese camera makers began buying parts from Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The company, which had 150 employees, could not meet the camera makers' demands to cut its prices 40 percent. **********\"When we said we could not cut prices further, orders stopped coming,\" Mr. Ohma said. \"At our peak we were making 5,000 lenses a month but it dropped to the 1,000 to 2,000 level. The most difficult thing in making the decision was that we felt so bad toward our workers.\" **********To survive, some companies are looking for products they can sell themselves, rather than continue solely as parts suppliers. Here, the networks in Ota Ward come in handy. Mr. Fujita's company and 10 others recently teamed up to develop a nozzle that when attached to a vacuum cleaner sucks the air out of plastic soft-drink bottles for recycling. **********Mr. Fujita said Ota Ward should try to advertise itself as a parts supplier to the world, not just Japan. \"It's so sad to just sit here and see the town losing factories,\" he said. \"We have to move.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/company-news-carson-pirie-may-raise-bid-for-younkers.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CARSON PIRIE MAY RAISE BID FOR YOUNKERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CARSON PIRIE MAY RAISE BID FOR YOUNKERS", "body_text": " **********Carson Pirie Scott & Company said yesterday that it was willing to raise its bid for Younkers Inc. to $20 a share, or $179 million, if an agreement could be signed by July 1.

In this world, Mr. Malone is seen as a behind-the-scenes player, a man with a wily, exasperatingly slippery and imaginative approach to deal making, and a man who is as willing to overpower his opponents as any football lineman is. **********\"If this deal doesn't happen, it's only because of Malone,\" said a senior Time Warner executive who insisted on not being identified. Executives of Time Warner and Turner are hoping to present an agreement to their boards by Thursday night. **********For years Mr. Malone's ownership of the largest number of cable systems in the country, the gateways to consumers' homes, has made him the most formidable figure in cable. Beyond its cable systems, Tele-Communications also owns the Liberty Media Corporation, which in turn has stakes in a panoply of cable services. Its stake in Turner is its most visible holding, but Liberty also has interests in Black Entertainment Television, Encore, the Discovery Channel and others. **********To consummate the deal with Time Warner, Liberty's holdings in Turner would have to be bought out. And Mr. Malone's agreement has a price. Thus far, according to executives involved in the negotiations, he is asking for long-term distribution deals with Turner's cable networks that would give Tele-Communications favorable rates for carrying CNN, TBS and the Cartoon Network. **********Over the weekend, representatives of each of the three main companies involved worked to hammer out an agreement on carriage. But as of yesterday afternoon, one person familiar with the talks said that no agreement had been signed. And executives familiar with the negotiations said that Mr. Malone's terms had changed. **********Originally, he had sought a premium price for converting Liberty's shares in Turner to Time Warner stock. Most Turner shareholders were to receive three shares of Time Warner for every four shares of Turner stock they would exchange. But Liberty would get a premium for some of its shares: four shares of Time Warner for every five shares it exchanged, as well as dividend payments. **********But yesterday, one person involved in the negotiations said, Mr. Malone changed his mind and was hinting that he would seek an even better exchange rate for his stock, instead of a dividend. **********Executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Malone had dropped a demand that Time Warner protect him against tax consequences if he was forced to sell his Time Warner stake because of Federal regulations. **********But in the quicksilver world of John Malone, a concession made yesterday can be a demand tacked on tomorrow. **********\"In most deals, you'll come to a general agreement,\" said a top executive who has sat across the bargaining table from Mr. Malone in previous deals with Tele-Communications. \"But with John, that's the starting point. He then begins to shake the tree.\" **********Mr. Malone has retained his influence even though some media analysts believe that Tele-Communications is in danger of being shunted to the sidelines in a media world that is rapidly consolidating into a handful of giant conglomerates. **********With Time Warner seeking to create an $18.7 billion empire with Turner, and Walt Disney and Capital Cities/ABC becoming a $16.4 billion goliath, some experts contend that Mr. Malone is already isolated. \"Malone's company is now small in comparison to everybody else,\" said John Tinker, an analyst at Furman Selz & Company. \"Disney is four times as large as Tele-Communications in operating cash flow.\" **********Small? Everything is relative. Tele-Communications, which is based in Englewood, Colo., has nearly 14 million cable subscribers in 49 states and will generate $5 billion in revenue this year. And it has steadily added to that base through acquisitions like its recent $2.2 billion purchase of Viacom's cable systems. **********But under Mr. Levin, Time Warner has matched Mr. Malone's cable growth, system by system. Time Warner now has 11.5 million subscribers -- many of them in bigger clusters than those of Tele-Communications. **********So why is Mr. Malone still so potent? **********For one thing, Tele-Communications is only one part of his staggeringly complex portfolio of businesses. In addition to the cable systems, the company has overseas investments like Telewest, a partnership with U S West that is building a combined cable and telephone system in Britain. Tele-Communications has also spent $600 million to $700 million in a joint venture with the Sprint Corporation and two cable operators to build a nationwide wireless communications network. **********Most recently Liberty has turned its ownership of television stations into a new programming venture. Liberty has a stake in Silver King Communications, a chain of 12 UHF stations recently taken over by Barry Diller, the former chairman of QVC Inc. Mr. Malone's support of Mr. Diller is typical of his strategy of spreading his bets. **********In the past, Mr. Malone's strategy of increasing his holdings -- and his options -- has worked well for him. Time Warner's surprise bid for Turner, however, would seem to impair his ability to maneuver. Mr. Tinker of Furman Selz said that Mr. Malone could not afford not to carry CNN on his cable systems. And if Turner Broadcasting were owned by Time Warner, he might have to pay a higher fee for access to it. But Liberty would also walk away from the table with a profit of at least $600 million if Turner and Time Warner reached an agreement. **********\"It's a mixed bag for Malone,\" said one investor who owns stakes in Tele-Communications, Time Warner and Turner. \"Before, he had a blocking in one of the crown jewels of the business. Now he'll have an economic interest in the biggest entertainment company in the world.\" **********The question is whether Mr. Malone would be content with simply a place at the table. Tele-Communications would automatically own 8 percent of Time Warner's stock if the merger were consummated. Together, Mr. Malone; Mr. Turner, who would control 10 percent of Time Warner's shares, and Gordon Crawford, a powerful fund manager at Capital Guardian Group, who would control another 10 percent, could engineer a creeping takeover of Time Warner, much as Laurence A. Tisch did at CBS Inc. in 1986. \"You could see a diabolical scenario like that,\" said a Time Warner executive, who insisted on anonymity. **********As Mr. Malone weighs his options with Turner, he may have less room to maneuver than many people suspect. With Mr. Turner supporting the deal, the only way Tele-Communications could actually block it would be by matching the offer entirely in cash. **********Analysts said that Tele-Communications, which has $13 billion in debt, could scarcely invest in new cable technology -- let alone mount an all-cash bid for Turner -- without endangering its credit rating. **********Some of Mr. Malone's colleagues predicted that he would strike a deal with Time Warner and Turner -- if only because he had little choice this time. But even these predictions come laden with caveats. **********In 1993, Mr. Malone agreed to sell Tele-Communications and Liberty Media to the Bell Atlantic Corporation for $33 billion, in what would have been the largest merger in history. Five months later, the deal was dead -- a victim of Mr. Malone's unwillingness to agree on a final price with his counterpart at Bell Atlantic, Raymond W. Smith, the chairman. **********\"People may have the impression that the broad shape of the deal is completed,\" said one executive who is familiar with Mr. Malone's negotiating style, \"but that is a false impression.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/business/pioneer-mutual-funds-moving-into-russia.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pioneer Mutual Funds Moving Into Russia", "print_headline": "Pioneer Mutual Funds Moving Into Russia", "body_text": " **********The mutual fund manager Pioneer Group Inc. plans to acquire a 51 percent stake in First Investment Voucher Fund.

Aetna hopes that with the increase in its environmental reserves to $1.2 billion, it has set aside enough to pay for environmental claims and will no longer use its profits and capital to pay those claims bit by bit, year by year. **********In recent years, accountants and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been putting pressure on insurance companies to disclose more fully their expected costs for environmental cleanups. Until yesterday, Aetna said those costs were impossible to estimate. But now it joins a growing list of companies that have studied the problem and made large financial preparations.

Such a sale is not needed to pay for the extra reserves, which Aetna executives said could be paid for from profits and the sale of bonds later this year. **********Not everyone is convinced that Aetna has solved its envirnomental problem, particularly since the company was the insurer in the 1970's and 1980's to many small businesses that are not part of the 1300 Superfund sites, and whose environmental costs remain unkown. **********Alan M. Lenin, a managing director at Standard & Poor's Corporation, the rating firm, said the additional reserves were a major improvement, \"though we are still not convinced they will cover the problem.\" Despite the increase in reserves, Standard & Poor's reduced Aetna's claim-paying rating to A from A+ because its property and liability business continued to be plagued by higher costs and higher claims than others in the same business. **********In addition to news reports and rumors that a large part of the property and liability business could be sold to an outside investor group, analysts said Aetna could sell part of its well-regarded health care business. **********\"We are a conglomerate and conglomerates are somewhat out of fashion today,\" Richard Huber, Aetna's vice chairman, said yesterday.

But investors have been loath to believe that the good news will continue as the economy slows, and they fear losses when the next recession arrives. As a result, Chrysler's stock price has risen far less than its profits. **********Kirk Kerkorian, the 77-year-old financier who owns 10 percent of Chrysler, thinks the stock is too cheap, and by all accounts is very frustrated that it has been getting cheaper. So far Mr. Kerkorian has spent about $676 million buying his stake, which was valued at $1.4 billion at Tuesday's trading price, and has collected $95 million in dividends from the company. **********But that considerable profit is on paper only, and if he started selling his shares, the price would tumble. So his offer to buy the rest of the company -- assuming he can arrange the financing -- appears to be an effort to cash in one way or another: **********Either another buyer will appear and top Mr. Kerkorian's bid, enabling him to walk away with a profit of at least $1.3 billion, or in a few years Mr. Kerkorian and his partners will sell Chrysler back to the public at a significant profit, having proved the company can withstand an economic downturn. **********It's a bold strategy, and the risks for Mr. Kerkorian are twofold. If he does not follow through with a serious offer, his credibility in any future deals will be damaged. Cynics were quick to note that no financing had been lined up before Mr. Kerkorian went public, though he did hire Bear, Stearns & Company yesterday as his financial adviser. **********And if Mr. Kerkorian should complete the acquisition, the risk is that Chrysler, financially weakened by his plan to use most of the company's huge cash reserves as partial financing for the deal, could stumble in an economic downturn. Mr. Kerkorian would then be stuck with a company that was posting big losses and was unattractive to buyers. **********The price offered by Mr. Kerkorian appears very low -- if you believe that Chrysler's improvements are permanent. In 1994 Chrysler earned $3.7 billion, or $10.11 a share. Before Mr. Kerkorian's offer, the stock was trading at only 3.9 times those earnings; his bid of $55 a share amounts to 5.4 times those earnings. That is still a very low multiple; many companies trade at 20 or 30 times earnings, or even more. The software giant Microsoft, for example, is trading at 34 times its 1994 profit. **********Why is Chrysler trading at such a low multiple of earnings? First, there is widespread doubt that it will come through the next recession without losing money, the expectations of its fans notwithstanding. John Neff, manager of the Windsor Fund, whose largest holding is Chrysler stock, said Chrysler had done such a great job of restructuring and cutting overhead that even in a recession it would earn about $2 a share. **********That is, of course, not its history. Chrysler lost more than $2 a share as recently as 1991. And it appears that Chrysler's management has its own doubts. It has built a cash hoard of more than $7 billion, in part to give it the financial flexibility to withstand a downturn. **********Mr. Kerkorian proposes to take $5.5 billion of that money and use it to purchase Chrysler shares, clearly betting that the company will not need the cash. But such a buyback could be dangerous if he is wrong and Chrysler finds that it needs cash it no longer has. **********Another reason for Chrysler's low stock price is that investors have doubts about the company's new products. Its latest car models have not had huge success and have faced some criticism about product quality. Its durable, market-leading mini-vans, being redesigned for the next model year, face their first strong challenger in the successful Windstar from Ford. Chrysler's profitable four-wheel-drive vehicles also face increased competition. **********But Chrysler is not alone in selling at a low multiple of earnings; so are General Motors and Ford, with multiples of seven and five, respectively.  Wall Street learned long ago that a company whose profits are heavily influenced by the strength of the economy should not sell at a very large multiple of its earnings at a cyclical peak, which many people believe is now. In an acknowledgment that the future looks less bright, both Chrysler and General Motors this week cut back their forecasts of 1995 auto sales, citing higher interest rates as one area of concern. **********The declining dollar has been a plus for American auto makers, by making Japanese and German imports more expensive in this country. But the share prices of the Big Three have shown no benefit: Chrysler had lost 20 percent of its value before yesterday, while Ford has produced a small gain and General Motors has been about even. **********Mr. Kerkorian first bought Chrysler shares in 1990, during the last recession, when there was much hand-wringing about the future of the company. Big losses were expected for 1991 and Mr. Kerkorian was able to buy 22 million shares at an average price of $12.37. He added to his position in late 1991, paying an average of $10.13 a share, and bought more in 1993 at $38.75 a share. **********Those purchases looked brilliant in early 1994, when Chrysler's stock peaked at $63.50. But share prices then fell steeply. Mr. Kerkorian paid $47 a share for his last purchase of stock, in December 1994, only to see the share price fall to $39.25 on Tuesday, before his offer of $55 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $48.75, up $9.50 on the day. **********So while Mr. Kerkorian has a large paper profit on his Chrysler investment, he has been frustrated that the stock has not moved up in tandem with the company's profitability. In November, when the share price was about $45, he called on Chrysler to declare a stock split and raise its dividend. It increased the dividend, to $1.60 a share a year from $1.20, but the share price rallied only briefly. **********The step he took yesterday is highly unusual in the annals of Wall Street. First, no one has yet committed even $1 to finance the bid. Mr. Kerkorian said he would put up $2 billion, while Lee A. Iacocca, the former chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, would invest $50 million. But those figures simply reflect the value of their current stakes in Chrysler, at a price of $55 a share. The money to buy out the other shareholders is supposed to come from other investors and lenders that have not even been approached. **********In addition, the offer has absolutely no provisions to discourage other bidders. And strikingly, a spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian, Alex Yemenidjian, said other offers were welcome. He also talked of an \"exit strategy\" for Mr. Kerkorian to get out of his Chrysler investment within five years. Presumably, that would involve selling stock to the public again. **********Mr. Kerkorian, having done his best to talk up the price of Chrysler stock, seems to be willing to take on the whole company at $55 a share. It is clear that -- if earnings stay up for a few years -- Chrysler would have no trouble paying back the huge borrowings needed to finance the transaction. And if they do not? Then paying back the debt could be much more difficult. Leveraged buyouts work best in companies that have dependable cash flows. Auto companies do not fit that description. **********Wall Street remains dubious -- doubtful that another bidder will surface and suspicious that Mr. Kerkorian may not really want to do the deal. Even after the price of Chrysler's shares climbed yesterday, it was still 11 percent below the $55 that Mr. Kerkorian said he was prepared to offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/09/business/company-news-anderson-exploration-wins-in-home-oil-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANDERSON EXPLORATION WINS IN HOME OIL BID", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ANDERSON EXPLORATION WINS IN HOME OIL BID", "body_text": " **********Anderson Exploration Ltd. has won a takeover battle for the Home Oil Company with a stock offer valued at $799.6 million (Canadian).

PRIORY, the president and chief operating officer of the Duke Power Company, the huge utility covering much of North Carolina, is loaded for bear. **********He is keeping the utility's balance sheet and borrowing ability strong to be ready to buy weaker and more vulnerable utilities, as the industry enters a more competitive age. **********\"You will see utilities that want to merge and be acquired, and we want to be one of the players,\" he said in an interview last week. **********Utility industry analysts, like Edward Tirello Jr. of NatWest Securities, agreed on the trend. Pressure is building for a period of consolidation when the larger, stronger utilities will acquire their smaller and weaker brethren. **********Every utility is adding up the numbers, Mr. Tirello said. The stronger want to see what others might fit into their systems. The weaker want to determine a fair sale price. **********Some consolidation has already taken place, and it could accelerate in the next two years as some states, notably California, allow more competition among utilities. And a proposal last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to open the country's power grid to more competition could also quicken the changes. **********The uncertainty has forced down the stock prices of many utilities. Investors could benefit, however, if they own utilities that become takeover targets or utilities that become stronger after an acquisition. **********In addition to Duke, huge utilities that Mr. Tirello expects to be on the prowl include the Southern Company of Atlanta, Entergy of New Orleans, Dominion Resources of Richmond and American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. These utilities are giants with customer bases of 1.3 million to more than 3 million, and some serve several states. **********Among the utilities that he sees as possible takeover targets are Dayton Power and Light, Rochester Gas and Electric, Idaho Power, Scana of Columbia, S.C., and Delmarva Power and Light of Wilmington, Del. These utilities are smaller, serving from 350,000 to 600,000 customers, and generally will have a tough time holding onto industrial customers unless they give them lower rates. **********Even after intense cost-cutting, Mr. Tirello predicted, these utilities will still be vulnerable if their states decide to allow outside utilities to compete where they now have monopolies. **********Until now, the few mergers in the utility industry have been for strategic reasons -- two strong utilities have combined to take better advantage of opportunities when states begin to allow more competition. An example of such a combination was the friendly merger last fall of PSI Energy, a utility serving a large part of Indiana, with Cincinnati Gas and Electric to form the Cinergy Corporation, the country's 13th-largest utility. **********PSI, which had plenty of surplus cheap power, greatly broadened its customer base through the merger. Meanwhile, C.G.& E. gained a management team that has geared up to cope with the expected rapid changes in the industry. **********The merger became embroiled in a rare hostile bid by a rival utility, Ipalco Enterprises of Indianapolis, which tried to acquire PSI in an attempt to prevent it from becoming more powerful. The hostile bid was beaten back. **********Future takeovers will generally be friendly, Mr. Tirello said, because they are subject to approval by state regulators, who may frown on hostile bids. **********The larger utilities, Mr. Priory of Duke said, will not look just at neighboring utilities -- the pattern that acquisitions have followed so far. **********Some of the larger companies have invested in overseas utilities; Duke, for example, has invested in companies in Argentina. They have also built power plants in other parts of the United States in their efforts to grow beyond their traditional territories. **********\"We would be comfortable operating generating equipment and transmission systems just about anywhere,\" Mr. Priory said.

They also contend that handing over wide areas of the West Bank to the Palestinian police will endanger Jewish lives. **********Eliakim Haetzni, a lawyer from the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and a leading advocate of civil disobedience, said that the aim of the campaign is \"paralyzing the army\" and that recent protests were a dry run for responding to possible Israeli Government attempts to dismantle Jewish settlements. **********Faced with tens of thousands of resisting settlers and supporters who will arrive to bolster them, Mr. Haetzni says, the army will find it impossible to carry out orders to evict Jews from the settlements. He predicts that some soldiers will refuse orders while many more will shirk duty under various pretexts. **********\"The main front of the civil disobedience campaign is the military, because it is a people's army,\" Mr. Haetzni said in an interview. \"The message to Rabin and the military command is that they don't have the troops for this.\" **********The group that Mr. Haetzni leads has begun a petition campaign to get Israelis to sign a declaration stating that the eviction of Jewish settlers is \"inhuman, anti-Zionist, and violates my conscience.\" Mr. Haetzni said that hundreds of people have already signed, including many officers in the army reserve. **********Literature distributed by the group compares the settlers' campaign to the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War in the United States. **********Unlike Mr. Haetzni, many leaders of the protests are immigrants from the United States. \"We see what protests and sit-downs can do, and it's time we bring these concepts here,\" said Shmuel Sackett, a leader of the group who moved to Israel from Queens five years ago. **********But critics of the settlers say that their actions contradict the idea of civil disobedience. **********\"They're talking about a rebellion, not disobedience,\" said Yishai Menuhin, a leader of Yesh Gvul, a group that supported army resisters who refused to serve in the occupied territories and in Lebanon after Israel invaded it in 1982. **********\"Civil disobedience accepts the legitimacy of the Government and seeks to change specific policies,\" he said. \"The settlers reject the legitimacy of the Government.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will be happy. Because 20 miles down the road from Advance, in Winston-Salem, N.C., is the headquarters of R. J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco marketer -- and the parent of Moonlight Tobacco. **********R. J. Reynolds is moonlighting, you might say, pitching cigarettes under the Moonlight Tobacco label while continuing to sell venerable brands like Camel, Winston and Salem under its own well-known moniker. It's the same ploy that was used to sell Bartles & Jaymes, which is owned not by Frank and Ed but by the huge E.& J. Gallo Winery. **********When conglomerates cloak the corporate connections of products and assume the trappings of smaller -- and presumably more forward-thinking -- concerns, it's a tactic known as faux or stealth parentage. The goal is to persuade consumers that the new brands are produced by iconoclastic, independent spirits rather than calculating corporate minds. **********\"It's a fascinating concept to set up a different kind of corporate brand,\" said James R. Gregory, chairman of the Corporate Branding Partnership, a consulting company in Stamford, Conn., affiliated with the Gregory & Clyburne agency. \"But to reach out to a new audience, to appeal to a different mind-set, you need to try new marketing techniques.\" Other examples of faux parentage include the General Motors Corporation's promotion of Saturn automobiles as \"a different kind of car\" built by \"a different kind of company,\" and the Coca-Cola Company's marketing of OK Soda with a campaign mocking conventional soft-drink sales pitches. **********Practitioners of faux parentage see the benefit of increased sales as outweighing the risk of shoppers feeling deceived or betrayed when they learn an upstart actually has a big parent with deep pockets. Rather than undertaking the difficult task of changing the images of established brands, the behemoths mimic the offerings of successful, less bureaucratic competitors. As with other weapons in the marketing arsenal, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't; in some instances, the products are hits but fade later. **********\"These strategies are probably smart,\" said John Grace, senior vice president of Gerstman & Meyers, a corporate identity and brand consulting company in New York, \"because consumers for the most part don't know who makes what. **********\"If the product delivers, there's no wool over the eyes because you buy the brand, not the parent corporation.\" **********Print advertisements for Moonlight Tobacco use colorful imagery to help mask its parentage. An Art Deco-style logo depicts a crescent moon, smoke rings coming from its mouth, above the slogans \"Working overtime for you\" and \"Smoke 'em if you got 'em.\" The text declares that Moonlight Tobacco's \"mission is to make the most exciting and innovative tobacco products in America today and have fun along the way.\" Although the ads omit mention of any link to R. J. Reynolds, the connection is noted on the cigarette packs and acknowledged in brochures that describe Moonlight Tobacco as \"a separate, independent company within\" R. J. Reynolds. **********\"Here's a chance for people to better identify themselves as opposed to being associated with mass products,\" said Mr. Herrman, who started Moonlight Tobacco in April with Ms. Roberts. He was a senior brand manager at R. J. Reynolds, which is owned by RJR Nabisco Holdings, and she was a research and development specialist. **********By donning disguises, marketing giants like R. J. Reynolds and E.& J. Gallo hope to appeal to consumer sentiment that favors Davids over Goliaths. That is increasingly pervasive among consumers in their 20's and 30's, who regard many big brands as outdated or obsolete. **********\"We're in an era of backlash against bigness,\" said Myra Stark, a senior vice president of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, owned by Cordiant P.L.C. \"It's become a basic belief of ours that when things get too big, they get inefficient and corrupt. **********\"This movement is very revealing of the American consumer,\" she added, because \"we love the underdog coming up a winner, the small company taking on the biggies.\" **********Davids now even have a cigarette named Dave's sold by Dave's Tobacco Company, the creation of \"a guy named Dave,\" according to materials in test markets that describe him as an \"entrepreneur who believes in the value of homemade products.\" **********Truth be told, Dave's Tobacco is actually the Philip Morris U.S.A. unit of the Philip Morris Companies, the biggest tobacco marketer, which is better known for its best-selling brands including Marlboro and Virginia Slims. Dave is \"a fictional character\" meant to symbolize \"a home-style, homespun campaign with a grass-roots feel,\" said Karen Daragan, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris U.S.A. in New York. **********Faux parentage or not, the fact that the two largest tobacco companies are rolling out new brands shows that the industry is pushing ahead despite attacks by Federal regulators and antismoking forces. **********Another arm of Philip Morris, the Miller Brewing Company, is using faux parentage in trying to compete against the so-called microbreweries and their popular brands like Samuel Adams and Pete's Wicked Ale. Miller is marketing two new beers, Red Dog and Icehouse, under the aegis of the Plank Road Brewery, the name under which Miller operated from 1855 to 1873. **********Asked why Moonlight Tobacco is not identified as owned by R. J. Reynolds in its advertising, which was created by a small New York agency named Vernacular Communications, Mr. Herrman replied, \"You can only communicate so much in an ad.\" The parentage is explained in the brochures, he added, which are being inserted into packs of the seven Moonlight Tobacco brands. **********The trade publication Brandweek estimated this week that R. J. Reynolds was spending in the low seven figures to market the Moonlight Tobacco brands, which also carry the names City, Metro and North Star. They are now on sale in Chicago and New York and will be available later this month in Seattle; they are being advertised in publications like Details, Rolling Stone and Spin. **********Diana Temple, an analyst who follows the tobacco and cosmetics industries for Salomon Brothers in New York, praised the R. J. Reynolds foray into faux parentage. **********\"Innovation in advertising is critical,\" she said. \"What people in their 20's today want may be very different from what people in their 20's wanted 30 years ago.\" **********However, she added, \"it all depends on the execution and the image.\" **********Indeed, the track record is mixed. While Red Dog beer is selling well for Miller, Coca-Cola announced this week that it would discontinue OK Soda because it was unprofitable. Saturn, too, has had its growing pains, but research indicates the brand has helped General Motors appeal to car buyers who might otherwise have gone for imports. **********This arm's-length relationship can also be beneficial on the way down, said Mr. Grace of Gerstman & Meyers. **********\"If one of these products doesn't work,\" he explained, \"you pull the plug, and it doesn't hurt the parent company\" in the same way that a new product bearing the corporate name might. **********Dave's, which is in three test markets, seems to be developing into a hybrid example. Dave's Tobacco is now being identified as a division of its parent, Ms. Daragan said, because of \"the quality aspect\" of association with Philip Morris. **********Perhaps the company's next new cigarette will be named Phil's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/business/wall-street-at-cbs-the-shows-are-bad-but-the-stock-is-good.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Antilla", "pub_date": "1995-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; At CBS, the Shows Are Bad but the Stock Is Good", "print_headline": "Wall Street; At CBS, the Shows Are Bad but the Stock Is Good", "body_text": " **********The ratings stink, earnings are off, and a key executive is reportedly shopping for a new job.

The presiding official, Yang Baojing, called it a shining moment in China's fight against corruption. **********The cars, Mr. Yang said, were confiscated from senior officials in a display of the leadership's determination to rein in excesses in the upper ranks of the Communist Party, which long ago lost its reputation for purity. **********Yet the auction was probably more an ordinary money-making procedure masquerading as government virtue than an indication of any zeal in cracking down on corruption. Nearly all the cars, three of them Mercedes-Benzes, had over 100,000 miles on their odometers, and each had seen better days. **********Despite what Mr. Yang said, they appeared to be cars that senior officials -- complying with a new regulation that officials use domestically produced cars -- would be eager to trade in for a new Chinese-made Audi, the current favorite among the leadership. **********If the anti-corruption campaign is netting bigger fish this year than ever before, Chinese officials and Western businessmen say, it is more an indication of corruption's growing pervasiveness than of any official determination to alter the situation that allows graft to flourish. **********\"The network of gift-giving and favors involves the families of almost every senior leader,\" a mid-level Chinese official said. \"So anyone who tries to move against them immediately runs into resistance.\" **********Traditionally, those disciplined for corruption have been people who run afoul of officialdom, while those who preserve connections with ranking officials go unpunished no matter how bad their crime. Since investigators and court officials take instructions from party officials, no prosecution can proceed without approval from the senior authorities, either at a local or central level. **********With an economy growing at breakneck speed and officials involved in many stages of business ventures, corruption has accelerated greatly in the anything-goes economic atmosphere in recent years, the official said. **********Small examples abound. A Chinese chief representative of an American company in Beijing complained that she ran into corrupt practices every week. Getting a telephone installed, having an operating license approved and even registering her office all involve cash payoffs, the executive said. **********\"It's everywhere,\" the executive said. \"I hate it. It's getting worse and worse.\" **********Last week the authorities announced that more than 47,000 officials had been disciplined on corruption charges in the first half of this year, an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period last year. Of those punished, official news reports said, more than 1,801 were division chiefs or magistrates or higher, a 44 percent increase. **********Large cases are more common, too. In July, investigators publicized the outline of the largest corruption scandal yet in 46 years of Communist Party rule, a case involving central Government as well as provincial officials. **********A well-connected woman in Wuxi, 100 miles west of Shanghai, bilked Government officials and private investors of more than $380 million over five years in a pyramid scheme built on imaginary investments, an official account said. **********The woman, Deng Bin, 57, was accused of running an operation that bribed officials in dozens of cities to invest in her company, Xinxing Industrial Corporation, sometimes offering profits in advance. The operation even reached into Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau, where a senior official lured high-ranking customers into the scheme, before it collapsed last summer when the Wuxi authorities arrested Ms. Deng. She now faces the death penalty. **********An even more explosive corruption case came to light in April when the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Wang Baosen, was found dead in a ravine in Huairou, 35 miles north of Beijing, apparently a suicide. **********Mr. Wang was later accused of embezzling $37 million, but a second Chinese official said investigators might find even more by the time they finish looking into a series of Beijing construction projects under Mr. Wang's control that apparently involved huge payoffs to staff at the Beijing Municipal Communist Party Committee, headed by a Politburo member, Chen Xitong. **********\"It's hard to separate corruption from politics in this case,\" the official said. \"No one doubts that Chen Xitong was dirty, but if only he and the people around him are charged, it will look very political.\" **********Mr. Chen has been a rival of the Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, since the latter won his post in 1989, and is said to have complained in meetings that he was better suited for China's top position than Mr. Jiang. **********Mr. Chen's arrest, announced in early July, aroused speculation that Mr. Jiang would open a far-reaching crackdown on corruption, both to clear out political enemies and to earn respect from ordinary Chinese, who almost uniformly express disgust with the level of graft that has spread throughout Chinese society. Yet no more officials have been charged. **********It is not clear why Mr. Wang chose to kill himself in Huairou, where the nongovernmental forum of the United Nations Conference on Women is being held next month. But a popular theory in Beijing is that he chose Huairou because he had arranged several villas for senior Chinese leaders there, and wanted to send a signal that if he was blamed for a huge corruption scandal, his superiors had indirect complicity as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/world/goiania-journal-tourist-site-springs-from-a-nuclear-horror-story.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goiania Journal; Tourist Site Springs From a Nuclear Horror Story", "print_headline": "Goiania Journal; Tourist Site Springs From a Nuclear Horror Story", "body_text": " **********Brazil's only nuclear waste dump is to become a tourist attraction this year, complete with nature trails, a visitor information center and a 100-seat auditorium. **********\"This is going to be an example for the world,\" Paulo Ney, regional director of Brazil's National Nuclear Energy Commission, said of the $4 million toxic tourism project taking shape here. **********\"We already have had 5,000 schoolchildren at the deposit,\" he continued, adding that the area was entirely safe. \"On tour buses, tourists always ask guides to show them 57th Street.\" **********In September 1988, 57th Street, several miles from where the dump lies, burned into Brazil's national consciousness as the site of the worst radiation accident in the Americas.

A laboratory will allow technicians to monitor the waste contaminated by the cesium, which is packed in 6,000 metal barrels, encased in concrete and buried underground. The laboratory will also serve as a regional training center for nuclear technicians. **********Inside the compound's chain-link fence, about 400 acres are to be planted with trees native to the surrounding savannah.

But he said that with conflicting information being received about the fate of the pilot, a search-and-rescue effort was continuing. **********Mr. Perry said the Pentagon has found no proof that the pilot managed to eject from his aircraft before it crashed. As for the contention by Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' military commander, that his forces have captured the pilot, Mr. Perry said, \"He may be playing some kind of cruel game.\" **********American officials said today that they would ask President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to inquire about the fate of the pilot and to push for his release, if he has been captured. **********Mr. Perry announced the increased intelligence cooperation a day after the Administration notified its European allies that it was narrowing the circumstances under which American ground troops could be used to help redeploy United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia. **********In a speech on Wednesday, President Clinton suggested that he was prepared to send American ground troops to assist a reconfiguration and strengthening of peacekeepers. But in a radio address on Saturday, he said American troops would be used only if peacekeepers \"become stranded and could not get out of a particular place in Bosnia.\" **********After severely criticizing President Clinton three days ago for talking about committing ground troops to Bosnia, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said today that he supported the President's current plans to provide American assistance to help rescue beleaguered United Nations peacekeepers. **********Appearing on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Dole said: \"I would support the President's efforts to rescue or to remove some of the United Nations protection forces. We are a member of NATO. What I would not want is American troops there under U.N. command with limited rules of engagement and without consulting with Congress.\" **********Taking President Clinton's lead, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played down the likelihood that the United States would ever have to send ground troops to Bosnia to help redeploy peacekeepers there. **********Appearing on the ABC News program \"This Week with David Brinkley,\" General Shalikashvili said America's European allies have not asked the Pentagon to help move peacekeepers who find themselves in an untenable situation although \"we certainly are now aware that this could come up.\" **********He added, \"After our meeting yesterday in Paris, it is becoming more and more clear that this is not an eventuality that stares us in the face right now.\" **********The general said that the United States would not provide ground troops to serve as United Nations peacekeepers or to join the rapid reaction force being established by Britain, France and other countries. He said that the United States would be willing to provide close air support to the quick reaction force and would be willing to fly British, French or other allied troops into the area, if requested. **********One senior Administration official said today that an American envoy's talks with President Milosevic in Belgrade were deadlocked, and near collapse, as the Serbian leader had stepped up his demands. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia are pressing Mr. Milosevic to recognize Bosnia in exchange for a suspension of economic sanctions against his country. **********\"Milosevic is trying to reopen things that we thought we had settled long ago,\" the official said. He said that Mr. Milosevic was demanding that the United States and other nations recognize Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia, as the official successor state of the former Yugoslavia. The United States has refused to do that on the ground that it would give Serbia a status it does not deserve and would strengthen Serbia's claim over assets that belonged to Yugoslavia. **********Senator Dole reiterated his call for unilaterally lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government and for withdrawing the 22,500 United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia. **********\"I think if you provide the equipment and they're properly trained and they lose, they've given it their best shot,\" he said. \"It's not our problem.\" **********But Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, criticized his position. Ms. Albright, who also appeared on \"Meet the Press,\" said that unilaterally lifting the embargo \"is a feel-good option,\" which \"would undoubtedly lead to an Americanization of the conflict.\" She said the United States would have to supply a large proportion of the arms and train the Bosnian Government forces. **********Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican and like Mr. Dole a presidential candidate, said that if American troops are to be used, they should assist in a withdrawal of United Nations forces from Bosnia. In an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" he said the Administration should work with Congress to arrange for American troops to help withdraw the peacekeepers, who he said are unable to keep the peace or protect themselves."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/business/nellcor-to-acquire-puritan-bennett-in-457-million-stock-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nellcor to Acquire Puritan-Bennett in $457 Million Stock Deal", "print_headline": "Nellcor to Acquire Puritan-Bennett in $457 Million Stock Deal", "body_text": " **********Nellcor Inc. said today that it would acquire the Puritan-Bennett Corporation for about $457 million in stock, expanding its line of patient monitoring and respiratory care systems. **********The acquisition, the latest of many recent mergers in the health care industry, would extend the reach of Nellcor in the respiratory care market by adding respirators and other products to its line of monitors that measure oxygen levels in blood. **********Hospitals and home health care companies that use Nellcor products are consolidating and want to buy from companies that make a wider range of medical equipment, said Michael Downey, the chief financial officer of Nellcor, which is based here. **********\"We had to broaden our product offerings,\" he said.

As a result, Nellcor's shares fell $1.625 today to close at $39.625 in Nasdaq trading. **********Under the agreement, each Puritan-Bennett share will be exchanged for 0.88 Nellcor share.

P.

But Mr. Lemaitre raised his rating on Nellcor's stock today to \"strong buy\" from \"buy\" because he expects cost savings to propel earnings and push the stock to about $50 in 12 to 18 months. **********Puritan-Bennett, which returned to profitability last year, has faced intense shareholder pressure to improve its financial performance after rejecting an unsolicited offer of $24.50 a share from Thermo Electron last year.

This button, because of its strength, size, conductivity and single connection point, has freed the computer chip from its fixed, soldered point on a circuit board. **********All that is required to transfer information contained in the ring to a computer is to touch it with a probe attached to the computer.

The county says it has no money to repay those bondholders and, in their eyes, is doing little to change that. **********Only one proposal has been floated so far, and it is hardly the comprehensive solution that bondholders seek. Some county officials have suggested diverting part of the county sales tax of 7.75 percent that normally goes to the county's general fund and use the money to issue new bonds to pay off the old ones. Such a diversion still faces many legal hurdles and even if approved, might not provide enough money. **********Orange County declared bankruptcy last Dec. 6, after sustaining losses in an investment fund that bet interest rates would fall. The losses have amounted to $1.7 billion, and the financial crisis that followed has made it difficult, if not impossible, for the county to repay the investors who bought Orange County bonds in recent years. **********As the bonds' repayment dates near, bondholders are becoming worried by statements from county officials. The officials have consistently warned that they will not raise taxes to solve the problem and that bondholders may have to delay getting paid back or take less than what they are owed. Even more troubling, county officials have not ruled out a default on the obligations entirely. **********\"The county does not have funds now to make all these payments,\" said Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer. \"It is now exploring every conceivable method of dealing with these bonds without defaulting. **********\"We are looking at refinancing and at renegotiating with existing bondholders,\" he added. \"The unilateral nonpayment of these bonds, defaulting on them, would be the absolute last resort.\" **********Such talk alarms the world of municipal finance. It undermines the basic tenet on which the municipal bond market is built: that municipal borrowers like Orange County are morally obligated to repay their debts, even if it means cutting services and raising taxes. **********Outright defaults are extremely rare in municipal finance and many municipalities with financial problems, like New York City and Philadelphia, solved their problems by raising taxes and taking other hard steps to prevent a default. **********Should Orange County default on its outstanding bonds, it would most likely be unable to ever borrow again in the municipal markets. That has been the fate of the handful of other public borrowers that have defaulted on their bond obligations. **********What is more, it would make investors think twice about lending to all other municipalities and could force municipal borrowers to pay more to entice investors to lend to them. **********No other large municipality has ever declared bankruptcy and none has been as adamant in saying it will not raise taxes to resolve its crisis. The anti-tax stance of the county's board of supervisors has not softened since the crisis began, much to the consternation of bondholders. **********\"It's atrocious,\" said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. \"Orange County has crossed the line and gone into the unspeakable. It was one thing to declare bankruptcy. But the talk about deferring debt payments takes this into the beyond. It's revolutionary and it will stand municipal finance on its head. **********\"The idea that a county as wealthy as Orange County is suddenly balking at making debt payments and is being intransigent on raising taxes has really damaged them in the marketplace. They are saying, 'We won't pay.' And the market is going to say, 'Oh, really?' \" **********David MacEwen, senior municipal portfolio manager at the Benham Group, added: \"They might as well be Mexico. The people in Orange County don't feel that this is their problem and they shouldn't pay. The fact that this is a wealthy county doesn't help if you can't tap the wealth. \" **********Angry bondholders have scheduled a meeting for Feb. 7 in Anaheim, Calif., to air their grievances. The $1.2 billion in debt includes a $600 million short-term note that matures on July 10 and more than $644 million in a number of revenue and property tax anticipation notes that mature in June and July. **********Bondholders were particularly troubled by a decision by the county last month to halt payment of $53 million into a special reserve fund used to pay coming bond obligations. That action put many of the county's bond issues into technical default. **********\"Orange County is waiting for someone else to solve their situation,\" said James E. Spiotto, a bond lawyer with Chapman & Cutler in Chicago. \"They won't raise taxes. They want to share the pain with others and they want to borrow. That's nice, but I'm not sure the world is made that way.\" **********Most troubled municipalities have escaped their problems by converting their short-term debt to long-term debt and coming up with new sources of revenues -- usually new taxes -- to finance the payments on the new debt. The county recently hired Goldman, Sachs & Company and A. G. Edwards & Sons to underwrite any new long-term bonds. **********Several factors, however, will make new bond underwritings difficult. First is the amount of borrowing that will be needed -- several hundred million dollars. Second, the county's bonds are now rated as \"junk\" -- below investment grade -- increasing borrowing costs. And finally, and most importantly, there is the question of how the county will support these new borrowings without new taxes. **********\"The county is going to have to show it has some sort of earmarked tax against this new debt or it will have problems convincing investors that they will get paid back,\" said Jane Eddy, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. **********The lone proposal afoot is to divert 1 percent or so of the county's sales tax to meet the payments on new bonds. Some estimate that could raise up to $140 million a year to cover the new bond payments. Not only is it unclear whether that would be enough to support new borrowings, but that is also money that would otherwise pay for county services. **********\"When you live without this revenue source in the budget, it has implications for people's lives,\" said Karen Kropp, an analyst with Moody's Investors Services. \"I'd love to know how the county is going to come up with more funds.\" **********The diversion would come at a time when Orange County is already facing a budget crisis. From now until July, the county faces a shortfall of $172 million in its general fund budget because of its investment losses. In the fiscal year starting next July, the county is expected to come up short by another $154 million. **********So far, the county has proposed cuts of only $40 million from its budget, and some modest other cuts have been suggested. County supervisors have said they will seek state approval to lower wages on public projects and cut welfare and health programs. **********What about help from the State of California? **********Orange County officials have long stated that they will not seek a state bailout. The State Treasurer, Matthew Fong, said he would be inclined to support the sales tax diversion proposal because it did not put state money at risk. **********\"I'd be concerned that you'd set a precedent that if a local government makes a bad decision, they'll be bailed out by the state,\" Mr. Fong said. \"The state does not want to reward bad performance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/business/for-matsushita-life-without-mca-probably-means-a-return-to-nuts-and-bolts.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1995-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1063, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Matsushita, Life Without MCA Probably Means a Return to Nuts and Bolts", "print_headline": "For Matsushita, Life Without MCA Probably Means a Return to Nuts and Bolts", "body_text": " **********If the flamboyance and extravagance of Hollywood has an antithesis, it may be the penny-pinching tradition of Osaka, Japan, where older folks still greet each other with \"mokarimakka,\" or Have you made money today? **********That difference in attitude and business outlook helps explain the reason for the imminent parting of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the world's largest consumer electronics company, and MCA Inc., one of America's most dynamic movie and music studios. **********When Matsushita, which is based in the commercial center of Osaka, suggested that it would sell a stake in MCA, many people in the business community took it as an admission of failure: there would be no magical synergies between MCA's popular culture and Matsushita's compact disk players and other electronic gadgets. **********\"Matsushita basically gave up,\" said Koichiro Chiwata, a technology analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. \"One thing for sure is that they had a lot of dreams and hoped a lot of things would happen with this acquisition and now they're giving up.\" **********What went wrong? From the start the two companies were an odd couple. Matsushita is a name that few Americans know, but its products -- from televisions and stereos to video systems, washing machines and vacuum cleaners -- are fixtures in homes around the world. Its brand names are household words like Panasonic, Technics, National and Quasar. **********Yet Matsushita is not so much a creator or pioneer as it is a brilliant imitator and marketer, advanced in producing an ever smaller Walkman, clearer television screen or tinier compact disk. **********Moreover, Matsushita is conservative in nearly every way, from the dull blue employee uniforms and company song to the frugal beliefs that pulled the purse strings on MCA's desires. **********By contrast, Hollywood is instinctively ostentatious and extravagant. **********\"It is difficult for them to understand how someone plays a role in a film, that actors should have personal private jets, while the top Japanese executives here will live in condominiums,\" said David M. Benda, a technology analyst at BZW Securities (Japan) Ltd. \"To manage a bunch of people in California -- that was impossible for Matsushita. They basically couldn't talk to each other.\" **********Yet many industry experts say that it was not just a clash of cultures or mishandling of a wayward American subsidiary that led Matsushita to forsake Hollywood. After all, Matsushita has more than 100 subsidiaries all over the world, as well as domestic subsidiaries that sometimes give Matsushita more painful headaches than MCA does. **********\"It sounds too emotional to say that it was a corporate culture clash -- Matsushita is much more shrewd and logical than that,\" said a Japanese entertainment executive who declined to be named. \"They just changed their strategy or business plan and probably they made some sort of priority in their business. They may have reached the conclusion that they don't need the movie business. From the beginning, they never needed the movie business.\" **********To borrow a Japanese saying, the two companies may have been lying \"in the same bed, with different dreams.\" Matsushita had a vague hope of achieving cost-saving synergies by marrying its compact videodisk players and other hardware with MCA's popular culture software. MCA, in contrast, wanted a financial sponsor. **********But even from the start, Matsushita did not know exactly what kind of new product it wanted to create, putting it at a loss as to how to integrate movies and music into a vast electronics empire. **********Indeed, the main reason it bought MCA, many analysts and industry experts say, was because the Sony Corporation had purchased Columbia Pictures. The two Japanese companies compete head on in several markets and Matsushita is always looking over its shoulder at Sony. **********Matsushita thought that it could not go wrong with a prized Hollywood property. It would let MCA run itself, and Matsushita executives, who shone in manufacturing or marketing, would not need to dabble in the entertainment business. **********In contrast, Sony had already been in the music business for years and so getting into movies was just one more extension of its business. Sony was also a more relaxed, California-style company: accountants at Sony might scratch their numbers in the ledgers with music pulsing through a Sony Walkman on their heads. Matsushita employees would probably never do that. **********And from the start, Sony, which has always been more of a risk-taker, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the studio and took an active role in its management. Last year, it said it would write off $3.2 billion from its Hollywood studios, but analysts say that its movie business may turn a profit in the near future. **********Now, Matsushita's sale of a majority stake in MCA represents a significant departure from Sony. **********\"It's a strategic issue,\" said Akihiro Okumura, a business school professor at Keio University. Mr. Okumura said that while Sony was pursuing a future as an audio-visual company, from singers to speakers, Matsushita was choosing to focus instead on its strength as a first-class manufacturer of everything from cordless telephones to LCD's, or liquid crystal displays. **********\"They want to get out of software permanently and concentrate on manufacturing hardware devices, like LCD's or batteries,\" said Joseph A. Osha, technology analyst at Smith New Court (Japan) Ltd. \"Matsushita's path forward is much clearer. They're going to try to become a company much more oriented toward making hard-to-make bits and bobs.\" **********Industry experts say that Matsushita wants to improve its narrow margins in its core electronics businesses. MCA contributed about 9 percent of Matsushita's overall sales in the fiscal year ending in March 1994, but it has significantly higher margins than Matsushita's businesses, which generally eke out returns of under 1 percent. The yen's appreciation, however, has undercut the value to Matsushita of MCA's earnings in recent years. **********Moreover, Matsushita paid a substantial amount for good will, the excess over book value, and continues to amortize that sum. Along with financing costs related to about $2 billion it originally borrowed to pay for MCA, analysts say that MCA was not contributing significantly to Matsushita's overall profits. **********Still, if the sale goes smoothly, Matsushita executives face another, somewhat happier, problem: what to do with all the new cash. Should they invest in personal computers, LCD panels or batteries? **********\"They got plenty of money but they don't need the money; they are not a bank,\" said Mr. Benda of BZW Securities. \"This is not their function in life.

The rating agency in one move changed its credit ratings outlook for six major firms to \"negative\" from \"stable,\" and cited \"uncertainty about the future depth and duration of the earnings downturn currently affecting\" these companies. **********The firms -- the Bear Stearns Companies; CS First Boston; Goldman, Sachs & Company; the Morgan Stanley Group; Paine Webber Group and Salomon Inc. -- are, with the exception of Paine Webber, all businesses that make most of their money in the capital markets. In those markets, revenues have got much tougher to come by in the last year as margins have narrowed and transaction volumes have declined. **********These securities firms are also borrowing much more than they used to -- in some cases as much as twice what they did six or seven years ago, according to one analyst. **********The rating agency's move has few recent precedents. \"Basically you'd have to go back to 1987\" to find a similar announcement from one of the big rating agencies affecting such a large number of securities firms, Perrin H. Long, an analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman, said. **********In a conference call with analysts and investors, Mark E. Bachmann and Jake Newman, respectively a managing director and director for S.& P., indicated that if current business trends continued, an actual downgrade in the firms' credit ratings was likely. \"Ratings may be lowered for individual firms, if profitability worsens or if continued market turbulence persists,\" S.& P. said in its statement. **********Mr. Bachmann and Mr. Newman declined to quantify the cost of any future downgrades for these firms. But after Lehman Brothers, the big investment bank, was downgraded last week by the other big American rating agency, Moody's Investors Service , the firm said the rating cut could add more than $50 million a year to its borrowing costs. **********In announcing its outlook change, Standard & Poor's said that \"turbulent conditions continue to plague the global capital and currency markets, exposing most of these firms to trading results that could further aggravate\" already depressed core businesses. **********The S.& P. officials cited recent financial debacles and difficulties -- including those of Orange County, Calif., Barings P.L.C., Mexico, and the weaker dollar -- as factors influencing their reassessment of the outlook for the firms. The financial environment has become much riskier and less predictable, and these recent events have caught the rating agencies themselves off guard. **********Securities firms in London, Europe's financial center, are also being hurt by the tougher business environment. Moody's yesterday put the long-term debt of S. G. Warburg & Company, an investment bank based there, under review for a possible downgrade. Warburg also has big capital markets businesses. **********\"Clearly the rating agencies are concerned with the capital markets firms,\" said Michael A. Flanagan who follows the brokerage industry for the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. **********The rating agencies have not expressed the same concern about brokerage firms with strong retail businesses, such as Merrill Lynch & Company, Smith Barney, Charles Schwab, Dean Witter Reynolds, A.

The statements seem certain to strengthen the conviction both within the Clinton Administration and in Congress that Iran is determined to become a nuclear power. **********In addition to its oil reserves, Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world, and natural gas is much cheaper to develop than nuclear energy. That makes American officials suspicious that Iran wants nuclear power as part of a weapons program. **********In a clear attempt to answer charges that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, Mr. Amrollahi made his remarks in a two-and-a-half-hour interview at his agency's new six-story building. It is part of a sprawling complex in central Teheran that includes a small nuclear research reactor built for Iran by the United States in the late 1960's, when relations with Washington were close.  Officials offered a brief tour of the complex, including a visit to two radio isotope laboratories for medical research, although they did not allow a tour of the reactor. **********\"In case we get enough money, in case we have enough trained people, we have a plan to take 20 years to get 20 percent of our energy from nuclear,\" Mr. Amrollahi said. Asked whether that could mean about 10 reactors, he said, \"Something like that.\" **********If Russia completes two reactor projects in Iran, and China builds two, it would seem that the Iranian Government intends to build six. **********At the summit meeting in Moscow last week, President Clinton tried without success to persuade President Boris N. Yeltsin to abandon Russia's nuclear energy project with Iran, arguing that the Islamic Government had embarked on a crash nuclear weapons program. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was similarly rebuffed when he made the same point to China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, last month in New York. **********Mr. Amrollahi reiterated that Iran had already invested $6 billion in the project -- which is subject to international inspection and safeguards -- and wanted to finish it. He said the contract with Moscow consists of a $780 million deal in which Russia is to complete one of two reactors that a German firm was building at Bushehr, a southern port city, before the project was halted after the 1979 revolution. If that project goes well, Russia will finish the second reactor. **********The United States opposes the project in part because it will give Iran access to new expertise, technology and training. **********Mr. Amrollahi said that 150 Russian nuclear experts were already working at the site and that 500 would eventually be based there; a much smaller number of Iranians are to be trained in Russia on how to operate the plant, he added. \"Training people is part of that nuclear power plan,\" he said. \"I don't know why they make such a hot fudge of it.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi denied reports that Iran had negotiated -- or even discussed -- a plan to buy a gas centrifuge from Russia that could have rapidly enriched uranium to bomb-grade quality. \"This was a diplomatically made cake,\" he said of reports about a separate albeit tentative agreement with Russia. **********Russia has agreed to supply the enriched uranium to operate the plant it plans to finish, he said. Asked whether Iran was pursuing a program to enrich uranium, at first he said, \"Not now,\" but then added quickly: \"No. Not forever. Not, no, not at all.\" **********Asked why Iran simply does not use natural gas for fuel, Mr. Amrollahi said, \"Natural gas is one of the best fuels, and many countries at the moment need it. So we think it is better to sell it.\" **********The United States and Germany have amassed substantial evidence that Iran is secretly buying components and technology abroad that could be useful only in a determined weapons program. **********Although Mr. Amrollahi has headed Iran's nuclear agency for 15 years, American and German intelligence officials say that he controls only part of Iran's nuclear program and that Iran has created a parallel program through the military that is largely responsible for purchases of nuclear related items. According to this view, the Defense Ministry Organization inside the Defense Ministry uses front organizations like the Sharif University of Technology in Teheran to help buy nuclear-related equipment. **********On the basis of reports by Germany's foreign intelligence agency in 1992 and 1993, Germany began to reject all requests for equipment by the university. Early last year, the German agency said the university's physics research center was involved in buying technology that could be used in making weapons, including nuclear-related materials. **********Mr. Amrollahi strongly denied the claim that he was not fully in charge. \"I am the responsible for the atomic energy of Iran,\" he said. \"Believe it, we don't have any other institutions or departments that pay attention to nuclear issues.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi also denied reports that Iran has secretly been buying nuclear technology and equipment abroad, noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear programs around the world, turned up nothing suspicious during a visit to Sharif University. **********But the official was unfamiliar with intelligence reports about Iran's nuclear-related overtures abroad and asked for copies of news clippings describing the details. **********Asked, for example, about a report that Iran tried unsuccessfully to buy cylinders of fluorine for Sharif University in 1991, Mr. Amrollahi said, \"Wrong. I deny it totally.\" Asked about a report that Sharif University approached the German firm Thyssen in 1991 for specialized magnets he replied, \"No, we never did.\" **********Asked whether Sharif University tried to buy balancing machines from another German firm in 1991, he replied, \"You can go and ask Sharif University.\" **********Asked about a seizure last January by Italian authorities in Bari of high technology ultrasonic equipment that could be used in nuclear reactor testing, he replied, \"Believe it, that's wrong, totally.\" **********Asked about a 1993 seizure by Italian customs of eight steam condensers destined for Iran, he said, \"I don't know really. I don't know. It's totally wrong.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi also denied a recent accusation by Secretary Christopher that Iran tried to buy enriched uranium from Kazakhstan in 1992. Other senior American officials in Washington said that Iran sent a purchasing team to Kazakhstan three years ago, but that it came home empty-handed. **********\"We didn't send any team,\" Mr. Amrollahi said. \"Definitely not. What is the use of enriched uranium for? The Russians do have many, many nuclear weapons but they couldn't use them. I think the bomb age is over. We don't think we need a nuclear weapon.\"                    --------------------       U.S. Unaware of Iranian Goal **********WASHINGTON, May 13 (By The New York Times) -- One of the Administration's leading nuclear experts said late today that he had not heard that Iran had a goal of building 10 nuclear reactors, although he said he was not surprised because of the plans that Iran had already announced. **********Since the Administration had strongly urged Russia not to build two planned reactors and warned that Iran would not be able to pay for them, the official questioned whether Iran could finance 10 reactors. **********\"I think there is a general question about Iran's ability to finance any new project,\" he said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. **********Another official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a plan for 10 reactors was hardly more worrisome than for two or four. The Administration's major concern about the Russian reactors is that they will help augment the expertise of Iran's nuclear specialists, making it easier for them to develop nuclear weapons. **********\"Our concern is about technology and expertise,\" the official said. \"You could argue that they could learn most of what they will learn from the first two reactors.\" **********The Administration also fears that once the Iranians have the reactors, it will be easier for them to import technology to develop either civilian nuclear power or nuclear weapons. The more reactors Iran has, the easier it will be for it to purchase such dual-use technology, one official said. **********The expert also said the Administration already knew that there were 150 Russian engineers in Iran and that China had signed a contract for two reactors. \"Our understanding is the Chinese signed something a while ago, but we're not totally sure it will go through,\" the official said. \"It seems more doubtful than the Russian project.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/business/time-warner-under-its-own-spotlight.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner, Under Its Own Spotlight", "print_headline": "Time Warner, Under Its Own Spotlight", "body_text": " **********Time magazine's dogged coverage of the controversy involving its parent, Time Warner Inc., and gangsta rap music may burnish the publication's reputation outside the company. But it could exacerbate the strains inside Time Warner. **********After years of missed opportunities and pulled punches, Time published an aggressive cover article last week about its owner. In stark black and red type, Time asked: \"Are Music and Movies Killing America's Soul?\" **********Depending on who is discussing it at Time Warner, the article was either a gutsy show of independence or a nasty example of ax-grinding. **********\"What makes the piece terrific is that we had the guts to write about an issue so close to the company,\" said Henry Muller, a former managing editor of Time who is now the editorial director of Time Inc., the company's magazine division. **********Executives at Warner Music, though, say several Time editors have long been sympathetic to critics who say the company should stop distributing gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. The music executives say the Time article reflected this argument. **********\"The piece was tendentious,\" said one senior executive at Warner Music, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********By ratcheting up the pressure on Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, Time's coverage could also aggravate tensions between the magazine group and the corporation. **********Though Mr. Levin has championed the role of the magazines in the corporation, some editorial employees say Time Inc. has become a vestigial part of an entertainment-driven colossus. **********Mr. Levin did not grant an interview to Time, and senior executives of the magazine group said he had not discussed the article with them. The only corporate comment came from Tod R. Hullin, a senior vice president of Time Warner, who said, \"Their persistence is up there with anybody else's.\" **********The Time Warner response to the rap issue underscores that the company is a collection of baronies -- with powerful executives who do not hesitate to air views that conflict with those of the parent company. **********Last week, for example, Time Warner corporate executives said the company was calmly and gradually formulating a response to the outcry over rap lyrics. By the middle of the week, though, they had to quell rumors stirred by executives in the music group that Time Warner might sell off the group as a way to extricate itself from the dispute. **********With its June 12 cover story, Time magazine became both an observer and a player in this corporate drama. **********Several editors attributed Time's aggressive tone to Norman Pearlstine, who became the editor in chief of Time Inc. in January. Mr. Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, was heavily involved in the editing of the article. He signed off on the final version at 1 A.M. on the Sunday before publication, hours after the usual deadline. **********Mr. Pearlstine also made a personal pitch to Mr. Levin and Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, to grant interviews to Time reporters. Both declined. **********\"I think it always looks strange when the chief executive of Time Warner isn't available for comment in the pages of Time,\" Mr. Pearlstine said. \"As an editor, I wanted them to talk to us first.\" **********Several Time editors said it was unprecedented for an editor in chief to show such independence. Indeed, Mr. Pearlstine's predecessor, Jason McManus, made what many journalists considered an infamous decision: that Time should not cover the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications the week it was announced in 1989. **********Other Time Warner executives said Mr. Pearlstine might feel more free to scrutinize the company than his predecessor did. Before the merger, the editor in chief of Time was still a member of the Time Inc. board. So Mr. McManus cast a vote on the very issue that his magazine later had to treat -- or not treat -- as a news event. **********Certainly, Mr. Pearlstine did not seem constrained on the rap coverage. As part of its 14-page cover package, Time examined how Time Warner was responding to the brouhaha over rap lyrics. Quoting \"company insiders,\" the article said Mr. Levin might back off his refusal to stop distributing music by gangsta rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Doggy Dogg. **********\"Never in the history of the magazine have they run such a story,\" said Richard M. Clurman, a former Time editor and the author of \"To the End of Time\" (Simon & Schuster, 1992), which harshly criticized Time Inc. for uneven coverage of its parent company. \"It's the first piece of really candid coverage of their own affairs.\" **********Ray Cave, a former managing editor of Time, said: \"I was impressed by the fact that they did a cover. They didn't need to. It would have been tempting to avoid it.\" **********Mr. Pearlstine denied that he had set the tone for the coverage. He said James R. Gaines, the managing editor of Time, proposed the cover story after Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, made a widely publicized speech on May 31 criticizing Hollywood and Time Warner. **********In 1992, when Time Warner came under fire about the lyrics of another rap performer, Ice-T, Time magazine took note of the dispute in a series of brief articles. But the only large article in the publication was a generally sympathetic profile of the artist. **********Mr. Muller, who was then the managing editor of Time, defended the magazine's treatment of Ice-T. \"You can always argue two or three years later about the coverage of a story,\" he said. \"But the salient point is that we didn't shy away from it then, either.\" **********As for the accusation that Time's editors were venting their opposition to Time Warner's rap policy, Mr. Gaines denied that he had a strong opinion on the issue. But, he added, \"I think journalists are free to dislike Snoop Doggy Dogg just like anybody else, aren't they?\" Chart: \"Two Approaches at Time to In-House News\" 1995 THE STORY: Senator Bob Dole and Wiliam J.

Pretax profit was up by 23.2 percent for the first half of the year, the merger of A & W Brands into its beverage business in the United States had gone smoothly and unusually warm summer weather in Europe seemed to promise a strong sales increase for the second half of the year. **********But in the last few months, the fizz has gone out of Cadbury Schweppes, at least as far as investors are concerned. The stock, which rallied over the summer after having plunged along with the rest of the market earlier in the year, has fallen sharply again since September. **********In London, Cadbury Schweppes closed on Friday at 433 pence a share, 20.6 percent below its 52-week high, reached in January, of 545 pence, and 11.6 percent down from its summer peak of around 490 pence. **********In New York, its American depository receipts, which represent four shares, closed at $27.25, down nearly 16 percent from their high for 1994. **********The culprit, more than anything else, has been a resurgence in the cola wars in Britain. Cadbury Schweppes is 51 percent owner of Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages, the bottler for Coke in Britain. The British beverage business accounts for 24 percent of Cadbury Schweppes's operating profit. **********Coke and Pepsi fight it out here as they do elsewhere, but this year the competition has been complicated -- and intensified -- by the appearance of two potentially powerful new products: private label colas sold by some of Britain's largest supermarket chains, and Virgin Cola, which was introduced by Richard Branson, the entrepreneur who owns Virgin Atlantic Airways. (The largest of the private label colas, J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola, and Virgin Cola are both manufactured under contract by the Cott Corporation of Canada.) **********Coke's sales continue to grow in Britain, but it has been losing market share. Taylor Nelson AGB, a market research firm, reported in December that Coke's market share in supermarket purchases in Britain fell below 50 percent for the first time in November. The firm said Coke had a 42 percent share in the last week of November, down from 54 percent in October. **********The cola war has investors worried that profit growth in Cadbury's beverage business will slow or reverse, especially since the competition has sent retail prices down by 15 percent this year. **********Large supermarket chains, where the fight is currently most intense, account for a relatively small portion of the company's total sales and earnings, said Edouard de Boisgelin, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. Still, he said, the competition is not going to help earnings or investor sentiment toward the stock. **********\"Margins are likely to be negatively affected,\" Mr. de Boisgelin said. \"It will put pressure on part of their business.\" **********Mr. de Boisgelin said Cadbury Schweppes is a \"good, solid, well-managed company.\" But he said the cola wars and other questions hanging over the company make him neutral on the stock, which he said was likely to do no better than to track the overall market. **********Among the other questions swirling around Cadbury Schweppes are the extent to which it will be able to match last summer's strong soft drink sales, helped as they were by unusually warm weather in Europe, and perhaps most important, the company's long-term intentions toward the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, the American soft drink maker in which Cadbury already has a 25.9 percent stake. **********Cadbury has been debating for some time whether to try to acquire the rest of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up in a bid to solidify its position as the No. 3 soft-drink company in the United States and the world. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in the United States in October, the company said it had had \"exploratory\" discussions about taking over Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, but had no firm plans. **********Dr Pepper/Seven-Up has so far resisted Cadbury's calls for a seat on its board, and it is unclear whether Cadbury could make an offer that would not provoke a hostile response. **********Any bid for Dr Pepper would probably require Cadbury to issue more shares through a rights offering to raise cash, a prospect that would force current holders to put up more money or see their holdings diluted. **********\"If they did take Dr Pepper on board at a very large cost, something that would require some form of equity issue, one has to question whether the market would be prepared to accept an issue of the magnitude required,\" said one London-based analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********\"The issue is whether as a result of the reduction in free cash flow that will be the inevitable result of the cola war in the U.K., the group's intention as far as expansion into other markets will be stymied,\" the analyst said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/business/market-place-kodak-taking-the-digital-plunge-will-line-up-with-computer-giants.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1995-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Kodak, taking the digital plunge, will line up with computer giants.", "print_headline": "Market Place; Kodak, taking the digital plunge, will line up with computer giants.", "body_text": " **********DESPITE misgivings by some analysts, the stock market appears to be applauding Eastman Kodak's decision to plunge into digital photography using alliances with some of the big players in the computer world. **********The price of Kodak's shares has been rising since early this year, when it became clear that the company planned to deal aggressively with the new computer-based technology, whatever the repercussions on its still lucrative chemical- film and sensitized-paper businesses.

Fisher, the former Motorola executive who became chairman of Kodak in December 1993, outlined a vision of electronic images, which would be easy to capture, manipulate, transmit and incorporate into documents. Adopting a computer style strategy, rather then the beloved Brownie of Kodak's past, he said most of the new electronic products were aimed at small businesses and home offices, rather than the broad consumer market. **********For example, the new DC 40 electronic camera, intended for use with desktop computers, is to be priced at less than $1,000. But Kodak executives said their eventual goal would be a price below $300, making it a consumer product. **********Mr. Fisher acknowledged that Kodak could not go it alone in the world of electronics and he announced agreements with I.B.M., Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Wang Laboratories to develop ways to move and use images once they have been captured, usually on chemical film. **********Mr. Fisher, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, seemed to take particular delight in the wizardry that can compress the unwieldy mass of information needed to describe a color photograph into a code that could be written onto the magnetic stripe of a credit card or a bar code on a check. This would allow sales clerks to view the photograph of a card's authorized user on a point-of-sale terminal to deter fraud. **********B.

Gustin Jr., the manager of digital imaging operations. **********But they said it was necessary to develop a coherent system for electronic photography to complement film-based picture taking and to encourage people to take advantage of the ease of electronic enlarging, correcting and cropping to do more with their images. Mr. Fisher said fewer than 3 percent of all photographs taken are reprinted and fewer than 1 percent enlarged. If electronics can bump these percentages up by even modest amounts, it will mean important new revenues for the company, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/26/business/uncovered-short-sales-increase-4.3-on-nasdaq.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Increase 4.3% on Nasdaq", "print_headline": "Uncovered Short Sales Increase 4.3% on Nasdaq", "body_text": " **********In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit.

All kinds of rumors spread, including one that the Government had found uranium and that the whole region was radioactive. **********One day a few years later a man appeared at Bertie and Gladys Kerr's farmhouse door. He wanted to take soil samples on their property, maybe do a little digging. Mr. Kerr asked why. Gold, the man said. **********The Kerrs laughed in his face, but said go ahead. **********Much to the surprise of the Kerrs and a lot of other people, several more years of digging and testing panned out, so to speak. There is gold in them thar bogs, and silver too. **********Omagh Minerals, a company formed to exploit the discovery, has already dug several exploratory trenches. In May, after a long battle with the project's opponents, it won approval from the Government to build a processing plant and to begin extracting ore from a trench half a mile long, 300 feet wide and 120 feet deep. Ultimately, the company could apply to open mines in two dozen other nearby sites that, it says, show equal potential. **********Garry Phelan, one of the prospectors who made the discovery and now the manager of Omagh Minerals, said there is enough gold and silver in the rock beneath the area to make Omagh, a town of 25,000 people, the site of the only commercially viable gold and silver mine in Britain or Ireland. The company hopes the mining can get under way next year, producing 12,000 ounces of gold and 15,000 ounces of silver a year, worth around $6 million, Mr. Phelan said. **********But if the discovery was the most astounding thing to happen around here in memory, it also created a split in the community nearly as wide as the Protestant-Catholic rift that has long defined relationships in Northern Ireland. The latest dispute pits two forces that run powerfully through the region -- economic pragmatism and environmentalism. **********\"It's an untarnished landscape, and that's its true value,\" said Ed Winters, a photographer whose home overlooks the site of the proposed open-pit mine. \"To extract a few grams of gold and risk ruining that area is a totally unsatisfactory legacy for future generations.\" **********There's no risk entailed at all, especially not with all the environmental regulation imposed by the Government, Mr. Phelan said. **********There would be dozens of jobs at the mine, he said. Moreover, the project's backers are touting plans to develop a local jewelry-making industry to use the gold and silver, and to use the publicity to bring in tourists, perhaps creating scores more jobs here, in the middle of Northern Ireland 60 miles west of Belfast. **********With the unemployment rate running well into the teens and few new employers in the area, Mr. Phelan said the project could create a windfall not just for the mining company and the farmers lucky enough to own the land, but for the entire region. **********\"This is the beginning of a long-term project and a long-term industry,\" Mr. Phelan said. **********Mr. Winter and other opponents said they would fight on to block the project, though they have few legal options open to them. Even as some of their neighbors tally up their possible riches -- a handful of farm families like the Kerrs have agreed to sell portions of their land to Omagh Minerals for amounts rumored to run well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and others wonder about getting jobs, the opponents continue to emphasize that there is another side to gold mining. **********Though the mining company has pledged to fill in the mines and replant the area after excavation is done, opponents talk of the scars that could be left on the bleakly beautiful countryside by the digging. **********Then there is the use of highly toxic sodium cyanide to help remove the microscopic gold flecks from the rock around them, and the question of how effectively the waste from the process can be cleaned up before being discharged into the Creevan Burn, the river that runs through the area. The biggest employer in the area, Nestle, which makes milk powder at a plant not far from the proposed mine site, has opposed the mining plan, saying it feared the risk of pollution and contamination of the local milk supply. **********With Northern Ireland's sectarian strife as background, the predominantly Catholic nationalist parties, the majority on the city council, oppose the project. The Protestant unionist parties support it. (Among the area's residents, however, religion seemed to have little to do with their position.) **********\"Most people we talk to are happy about it,\" said Mrs. Kerr, who said she and her husband were selling 38 acres to the mining company; she would not name the price. \"I don't know anything about gold mining, but it should be good for the county and good for the town.\" **********Mr. Winters, though, said townspeople were deluding themselves into thinking that mining could be environmentally benign, or even that it would create lots of jobs and lure tourists. **********\"It's not like you're going to have lumps of gold being turned into leprechauns at the local shop,\" Mr. Winters said. \"We're going to be on the map for a different reason, and that's because its going to be a giant disaster.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/21/business/international-business-yielding-us-bows-to-europe-on-trade-chief.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1995-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yielding, U.S. Bows to Europe On Trade Chief", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Yielding, U.S. Bows to Europe On Trade Chief", "body_text": " **********In an embarrassing setback, the Clinton Administration has abandoned a lengthy effort to install its candidate as head of the new World Trade Organization and will announce on Tuesday that it is endorsing Europe's choice, Renato Ruggiero of Italy. **********The move ends a divisive deadlock involving countries on three continents and assures that Mr. Ruggiero, a longtime diplomat who was once Italy's trade minister, will take up the post this spring. **********But under conditions negotiated by the Clinton Administration in recent days, Mr. Ruggiero will be limited to one four-year term, and the major trading partners have agreed that his successor will not be a European, senior Administration officials said. **********Until just a few weeks ago, American officials argued that Mr. Ruggiero was a glorified bureaucrat who embodied the protectionist leanings of European governments on agriculture and a range of other issues. They asserted that he lacked the influence to shape the first years of an organization that is to become, in essence, a United Nations of international trade, with broad authority to set rules and arbitrate disputes between nations. **********The candidate favored by Washington, former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, dropped out three weeks ago, after it became clear that he bore some responsibility for Mexico's economic crisis and when the arrest of his brother in connection with a political killing made his candidacy untenable. **********The White House, after unsuccessfully searching for an alternative and dismissing the idea of supporting the third candidate, Kim Chul Su, a South Korean economist, concluded that it had no choice but to back Mr. Ruggiero. **********\"The race for director general became a hemispheric conflict that was not in the interest of the United States or the W.T.O.,\" a senior official said today. \"We have worked diligently for the past 10 days to get the assurances that we need about the direction of the organization, and in the end we got those assurances, which were critical.\" **********The move will undoubtedly anger South Korea and other Asian allies, who have promoted Mr. Kim's candidacy. But the key to his candidacy was the support of Japan, and in recent days Japanese diplomats, sensing the way the argument was going, have begun to sing the praise of Mr. Ruggiero as a man who had opened some of Italy's most protected markets. **********Mr. Ruggiero, a big man with a deep laugh and skills in half a dozen languages, has campaigned for the job since last June. He quickly secured the support of all the European nations and most former European colonies. But under the ill-defined electoral rules of the new organization, which is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's secretariat, the director general had to be elected by a consensus that was led by the world's largest trading nations. **********At a lunch with American reporters several months ago, Mr. Ruggiero cast himself as an \"honest broker\" among the competing interests of the trade organization's more than 120 nations. He talked extensively of the need to bring developing countries and emerging markets into central roles in the new, Geneva-based group, which will possess, at least on paper, far more power to administer world trade rules than any international group since the end of World War II. **********But Mr. Ruggiero spoke of the need to build an efficient bureaucracy rather than to bring about revolutionary change. That was exactly what had the Clinton Administration worried. \"He's a glorified bureaucrat,\" an Administration official said several weeks ago. **********Today, though, the Administration tone had changed, and Mr. Ruggiero was hailed by a senior official as a man \"who certainly has the experience.\" Another official involved acknowledged, however, that the United States had to give ground because \"we were the ones who came up with the candidate who didn't make it.\" **********Several diplomats here who have monitored the uneasy talks among the United States, Europeans and Asians said today that they expected Mr. Ruggiero to bend over backward in the next year or so to accommodate American interests. **********\"In some ways I think the Administration is better off this way,\" an Ambassador from a Pacific region nation said today. \"He knows that everyone is going to be looking for any evidence that he's protecting European farmers or helping to keep American movies out of France. He's going to be careful.\" **********The World Trade Organization's first responsibility, and Mr. Ruggiero's, will be to apply the complex provisions of the new GATT accord, which embraces more than 20,000 pages and a score of subagreements. **********The accord was approved by Congress last fall, but only after a last-minute compromise with Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, to establish a commission of American judges to review decisions by the trade group that go against American interests. If the panel finds a pattern of such judgments, Congress must review American participation in the organization. **********The race for director general came, over time, to reflect three very different visions of the future of the world economy. The United States pressed for deregulation and change toward the principles of a market economy. The Europeans seemed to seek an organization that gave greater attention to protecting farmers and to individual national sensitivities. Asian nations pursued an Asian model of development -- strong central government leadership of industry, often with a detailed industrial policy. **********In the end, the race turned into a power struggle, in which none of the three regions wanted to give ground. \"Clearly, we were headed for an indefinite deadlock unless someone took the initiative,\" a senior Administration official said. **********Mr. Ruggiero's first test will probably come Tuesday in Washington, where he is expected to appear with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, for the formal blessing of his candidacy. He will also attend meetings with other American officials, who are expected to describe their expectations for the trade organization's early days -- and the informal agreements worked out among trade ministers lately -- in some detail. **********Mr. Ruggiero will be required to walk a fine line between accommodating those in Washington who view the organization as anti-American, and those elsewhere who say that the United States has dominated international economic organizations. **********He will also have to try to persuade the United States to give up the tactic of trade retaliation against individual rivals in favor of multilateral rules, something the Administration has sometimes been loath to do, especially given the visible success of its threats against Japan and China in the last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/10/world/secret-guatemalan-military-unit-linked-to-cia-dies-and-is-born-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1785, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Secret Guatemalan Military Unit, Linked to C.I.A., Dies and Is Born Again", "print_headline": "Secret Guatemalan Military Unit, Linked to C.I.A., Dies and Is Born Again", "body_text": " **********The following article is based on reporting by Clifford Krauss in Guatemala City and Tim Weiner in Washington and was written by Mr. Weiner. **********The enormous building under construction on Seventh Avenue in downtown Guatemala City is supposed to be an icon of reform -- the headquarters of a new civilian intelligence service. **********Officially, that new service will replace the disbanded, despotic unit known as \"the Archivo,\" whose ranks have included the Guatemalan colonel and C.I.A. agent linked to the 1990 slaying of an American citizen. **********But the Archivo -- which for years spied on and sometimes murdered Guatemalans -- is still in business, though under a different name, foreign diplomats and a former Guatemalan Defense Minister say. And death-squad killings, torture and the arbitrary detention of peasants, students, academic figures and political leaders are still going on Guatemala, the United Nations mission there reported in March. **********The half-completed building is a freeze-frame image of where things stand today within Guatemala's intelligence services -- somewhere between brutal repression and unrealized reform. **********The Clinton Administration suspended most of the covert aid flowing from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Guatemalan military last week, preserving only a counternarcotics program. But the deep and tangled connections between the C.I.A. and its \"assets\" in Guatemala continue to enhance the military's dominance as civilians try to secure control of the nation's politics. **********The question of who paid for the building seems to be a sensitive one. A construction company executive working on the project, Jesus Garcia, said it would be a Defense Ministry office. Asked where the money came from, he laughed nervously. Not the Defense Ministry, he said, but \"another agency that I can't identify, exactly.\" A senior State Department official involved in Guatemala policy, asked if any American money went toward construction of the building, replied: \"I don't think I can get into that. There shouldn't be.\" **********The State Department official said the question could only be answered by the Clinton Administration's sweeping investigation of C.I.A. involvement in Guatemala -- an elaborate search for facts that has proved so difficult that one senior White House official called it \"a total nightmare.\" **********The C.I.A.'s direct financial support for Guatemala's military intelligence services totaled roughly $30 million during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations, according to United States intelligence officials. As the cold war wound down and Central America ceased to be a battlefield between the superpowers, it fell from a peak of about $4.5 million in 1989 to about $1 million this year. **********The Administration is now assessing what the agency received in return for its money and what role the C.I.A. should play in Guatemala's future. Partnership  The C.I.A.'s Goal: Trade and Gather **********The C.I.A. and its defenders in Congress and the State Department say the agency's Guatemala station worked hard to instill professionalism and discipline in hundreds of intelligence officers in the Central American nation, which has the worst human rights record in the region. But critics say the agency's efforts were offset by its abundant support for a military that was essentially waging war against civilians. **********The C.I.A.'s role in Guatemala was also to supply information for policymakers in Washington. That effort is now being viewed in a harsh light. **********Faced with appeals in 1990 and 1991 to find the officers who ordered the killing of Michael DeVine, the American innkeeper murdered in Guatemala, the C.I.A. could not provide the information that its own agent, Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, was implicated in the killing. **********In 1992, the C.I.A. turned to its sources inside the Guatemalan military for information on human rights problems. That reliance helped produce an agency report that Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, described last week as \"deliberately designed to mislead\" the United States Congress. **********The same critics in Congress and the State Department who say the C.I.A has undermined human rights policy on Guatemala say the agency did good work when its focus shifted from the war on Communism to the war on drugs in the early 1990's. **********An estimated 70 tons a year of Colombian cocaine flow through Guatemala en route to the United States. Under the agency's guidance, the Guatemalan military has infiltrated cocaine-trafficking organizations and stopped some big shipments, State Department officials say. **********\"The only reason to have a C.I.A. station down there is because of the war on drugs,\" said Thomas F. Stroock, the Ambassador to Guatemala from 1989 to 1992. \"But if you're going to interdict drugs, you have to use the agency involved in the country. Unfortunately, in Guatemala, that's the army. **********\"At the same time you're beating these people over the head because of human rights, you're using them to stop drugs,\" he said. \"It's a dilemma.\" **********The Guatemalan military has the power to stop United States drug operations any time it wishes. At least 10 current and former Guatemalan military officers have been identified by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies as suspects in cocaine trafficking. And \"officers strongly suspected of trafficking in narcotics rarely face criminal prosecution,\" according to a recent State Department report. **********In one recent example, a lieutenant colonel in the Guatemalan Army, Carlos Ochoa Ruiz, was indicted in Florida on charges of shipping more than 1,000 pounds of Colombian cocaine through Guatemala. In March 1994, the highest-ranking justice in Guatemala, Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the Constitutional Court, ruled in favor of Colonel Ochoa's extradition to the United States. A few days later, four men assassinated the justice. Personnel  The Hard-Liners And Their Heirs **********The public revelations about the C.I.A.'s relationships with senior Guatemalan military officers have deepened tensions between two factions in the army, the hard-liners and the modernizers. **********Diplomats and analysts say both groups have poor human rights records and share the goal of maintaining strict order through repression to preserve military control.  Both have long ties to the C.I.A. **********But while some members of the old guard are involved in traditional economic crimes like car theft, smuggling timber and working in concert with drug smugglers, the modernizers tend to steer clear of those areas. \"The hard-liners are out of Godfather I, and the modernizers would fit in Godfather III,\" said a South American diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They prefer clean businesses like telecommunications, banks and property.\" **********The old guard fervently opposes any meaningful form of civilian rule. Although Guatemala has had a civilian President since 1986, the army and military intelligence services still wield power in every domain of public life. **********The modernizers also want to protect the military's immense power but realize that it needs to adapt to the changing political mood in Central America and to the end of the cold war. In the late 1980's, they grasped that international criticism of the army's human rights violations -- it has killed some 110,000 Guatemalans during the last three decades -- required at least the appearance of civilian leadership and skilled use of the language of democracy. **********The idea was that the people need a little political breathing space, although they should be arrested if they got out of line. \"Let the trade unions organize, let students demonstrate and repress them only selectively,\" is how Jennifer Schirmer, an American anthropologist, sums up their philosophy. Ms. Schirmer has interviewed dozens of officers for a forthcoming book on the Guatemalan military. **********A turning point for the modernizers came in the late 1980's, in part from conversations that Hector Gramajo, then the Defense Minister, said he had with the C.I.A.'s station chief. The station chief from 1988 to 1991 was a former National Security Council staffer with a geopolitical flair. The former station chief still serves as a C.I.A. officer but is now based at the agency's headquarters. **********General Gramajo, now retired from the Army said he advised the station chief to win over the hard-liners with money and military equipment. **********The station chief, while still supporting the modernizers, took his advice. After December 1990, when the United States angrily cut off overt military assistance to Guatemala because of the military's stonewalling in the DeVine case, the C.I.A. continued to send covert aid, disbursing an estimated $10 million before that support was suspended last week. **********Based partly on information supplied by the station chief, the policy of the United States evolved to support the modernizers in the military, analysts say. \"The C.I.A. wants information from everybody, but when it tries to promote officers it seeks to promote the modernizers,\" said Gabriel Aguilera Peralta, a political scientist who heads International Relations and Security Studies at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, a Guatemala City think tank. An Administration official who monitors Guatemala agreed with Mr. Aguilera's analysis. **********The modernizers are the reason why \"the Archivo doesn't exist by that name, but it continues to exist,\" Mr. Aguilera said. \"The modernizers in the army want to legalize it and institutionalize it.\" Reshaping  Disbanded Agency Makes a Comeback **********In 1993, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio announced that he was abolishing the Archivo, which kept files on thousands of Guatemalans, tapped their telephones, read their mail and occasionally committed political assassinations. **********\"Officially, the Archivo doesn't exist,\" said General Gramajo, now a conservative presidential candidate. \"But it does exist -- until a new organization replaces it.\" **********He added that the new, supposedly civilian intelligence organization, whose creation still has not been approved by the Guatemalan congress, already \"has too much military orthodoxy\" imbedded in it. **********President de Leon Carpio, who was once the Government's human rights ombudsman, has recently become more supportive of the military -- particularly since the assassination of his cousin, a former presidential candidate. **********Last week he denied what the C.I.A. has tacitly affirmed -- that Colonel Alpirez was in the agency's pay and that the C.I.A.'s Guatemala station penetrated the highest ranks of the military. He rejects repeated reports by human rights groups that clandestine jails still hold political prisoners in Guatemala. **********But the United Nations mission in Guatemala reports that between Nov. 21, 1994, and Feb. 21, it received reports of 22 political assassinations, 10 attempted assassinations and 68 death threats against priests, labor leaders, teachers, public prosecutors and human rights campaigners. **********Meanwhile, hundreds of workers toiled on the enormous building one block south of the old Archivo headquarters, where death-squad vans have come and gone through military and civilian governments for the last two decades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/business/spending-it-minding-your-business-breaking-up-doesnt-have-to-break.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1995-06-25", "snippet": "Q.

Some of my friends have gone through very expensive divorces. Unfortunately, it's now my turn. Isn't there a cheaper way?R. MITCHELLNew YorkA. Yes, there is. And it's not just cheaper but often better, although it's not necessarily simpler. It's called divorce mediation, and despite some disadvantages for those bent on getting even, it's even winning over those matrimonial lawyers who would have the most to lose should mediation replace the adversarial system. Who knows, maybe someday mediated divorce will take its place alongside that other socioeconomic phenomenon, the smoke-free restaurant. **********Here's how it works: husband and wife select a single mediator, either a lawyer or a nonlawyer professional. Over several sessions in the mediator's office -- anywhere from 6 to 20 hours -- the partners work out the terms of their apartness. **********The angrier the couple and the more complex their assets, the longer it will take. If need be, specialists are called in to help clarify and settle issues like the sale of a house or the custody of children. **********After all issues have been resolved, a settlement is drawn up and signed by both parties. This legal document -- the cost varies with complexity -- is submitted to the court with other required papers, where it becomes part of the final divorce. **********Surprisingly, even though the mediation process is not binding and spouses can walk away, really angry couples can still benefit from it. \"Most couples, regardless of their level of animosity, can utilize mediation,\" says Margorie L. Engel, author of \"Divorce Help Sourcebook.\" The best mediators, she points out, are \"trained to deal not only with the legal but also with the emotional aspects of divorce.\" **********To Lenard Marlow, a Long Island divorce mediator, this approach is far superior to the unmediated variety, which he contends some of his fellow lawyers have turned into a game of legal chicken. \"In too many traditional divorces, the goal is for one side to come out a 'winner' and avoid being the 'loser,' \" he argues convincingly in his book \"Divorce and the Myth of Lawyers.\" He says, \"Lawyers can turn reasonable people into embittered enemies, not because they want to but because that's all they know how to do. The adversarial process makes it impossible for either side to reach an agreement, which forces the dispute into court where the judge then imposes an agreement which will please neither.\" **********Besides giving parties control over the outcome, a mediated divorce can be economical. While high-priced lawyers can cost $350 an hour or more and demand a five-figure retainer, many mediator-lawyers charge roughly $200 an hour and sometimes waive the retainer. Nonlawyer mediators generally charge less. Most mediators figure on an average of 10 sessions, plus document drafting, court fees and certified transcript. About $5,000 total, give or take. **********And cooperation can make things still cheaper. \"The more information you and your spouse voluntarily share, the less expensive divorce is likely to be,\" Ms. Engel writes. And remember, she warns, \"money spent for services solely to obtain ego satisfaction comes from money available to you, your spouse and your children.\" **********An even cheaper way to split up: forget the mediators and get the divorce yourself for less than $350 -- carfare included. Ms. Engel's book lists sources for do-it-yourself divorces in all 50 states. In New York, for instance, call the the Julius Blumberg company at (800) 529-6278 for a kit of divorce forms ($44.50 for New York City, $48.95 for elsewhere) and manuals like the \"Guide to Uncontested Divorce.\" **********Less confident do-it-yourselfers can buy the forms and kits and turn them over to paralegals to fill out. Steve Malkin, who runs a New York City firm called Divorce Kit Law Guides, will take you through the Blumberg kit -- including the filing -- for $175 plus court costs and optional transcript (212) 687-5790. **********Mr. Malkin's firm is one of a growing number of paralegal enterprises, listed in telephone books, whose clientele are mainly low-income couples with few assets to divvy up or fight over. \"They simply want to end their marriage, period,\" he says. He does not recommend the do-it-yourself divorce to those with children, 401(k) retirement plans, pensions or real estate. **********A \"successful divorce\" may sound like an oxymoron. After all, if divorce doesn't feel like failure, what does? But mediation can help avoid bad endings, even if it cannot answer that timeless question: \"So why did you marry the jerk in the first place?\" **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

But the man who met with President Clinton in Washington today has changed all that in his three months as Ireland's Prime Minister. **********In an interview before he left on Tuesday, Mr. Bruton said his primary mission on his weeklong visit to the United States would be to advance a political settlement of the 25 years of sectarian guerrilla violence in Northern Ireland, to \"get a few messages into the political system about the need to get a balanced approach to this problem, to recognize the rights of both communities\" -- Northern Ireland's Protestant majority and its Roman Catholic minority. **********\"I think I'm realistic enough to know that people in America don't wake up every morning and ask what's happening in Ireland,\" Mr. Bruton said, discussing the timing of his visit. \"They think about Ireland maybe twice or three times a year in a serious way.\" St. Patrick's Day, he said, \"is one of those times.\" **********Mr. Bruton's meeting with President Clinton today was his first, but it was upstaged by another first encounter, that between the President and Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army. **********Since he became Prime Minister quite unexpectedly last December in a maelstrom over a domestic issue in Irish politics, Mr. Bruton has become instrumental in trying to advance a settlement in Northern Ireland. **********But before he became Prime Minister, Mr. Bruton was a frequent critic of Mr. Adams and of the I.R.A.'s violent struggle to end British rule over Northern Ireland. The tall, balding, 47-year-old lawyer and gentleman farmer from rural County Meath was often described by Irish nationalists like Mr. Adams as a unionist -- a supporter of the Protestant leaders who want the North to remain part of Britain. **********Mr. Bruton, a Catholic, denies this, and he is generally considered to have moderated his views. But much of what Mr. Bruton said in the interview would seem likely to make Irish nationalists and their Irish-American supporters grind their teeth. **********Discussing Mr. Adams's refusal to make a categorical denunciation of the I.R.A. \"armed struggle\" even though the I.R.A. has observed a cease-fire for six and a half months, and Mr. Adams's hesitancy to discuss I.R.A. disarmament in the peace negotiations, Mr. Bruton said, \"The insistence on the maintenance of substantial amounts of arms is not consistent with saying you are entirely and exclusively willing in all circumstances only to use political, nonviolent methods.\" But he said the British and the unionists must also make concessions. **********Mr. Bruton's view of the republicans is a legacy of his party, Fine Gael. The grandfathers of many Fine Gael supporters defeated the republicans in the civil war that followed Irish independence from Britain in 1922, under a treaty that left the six counties of the North part of Britain. Today, Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, gets about one-third of the Catholic vote in the North, but not quite 2 percent in the Irish Republic. **********In polls taken a few weeks before Mr. Bruton took office, only 10 percent of the voters who responded said he was their choice to lead the country, and his party had not led a Government since 1987. But he was vaulted to power when Mr. Bruton's predecessor, Albert Reynolds, was forced from office after a scandal in which his Government was accused of failing to act in the case of a Catholic priest accused, and later convicted, of sexually abusing children in Northern Ireland. **********In recent weeks, the polls show him gaining in popularity and that more than half of the people are satisfied with him. **********He has been accused, mostly by political enemies, of being gruff with his party colleagues, some of whom had tried to oust him, and stiff and uncharismatic in leading Fine Gael in Parliamentary debates. His critics said he was unable to focus on a single issue for very long, but his supporters noted his intelligence and dedication to the art of government, which he has learned in 25 years as a member of Parliament. **********He also knows politics. When Mr. Reynolds's Government fell, he was able to make a deal with the Labor Party and the Democratic Left to form a center-left Government. He came into office charged not only with trying to advance the peace effort, but also with dealing with serious difficulties in the economy. While economic conditions have been improving, Ireland still has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe -- about 16 percent. **********He is generally considered a liberal on social affairs, and his Government overcame strong opposition over the last two weeks to win final approval in Parliament for a measure guaranteeing women access to information about foreign abortion clinics. Mr. Bruton has indicated, however, that his Government will not take on a revision of the country's constitutional ban on abortion. Abortion is legal only if the woman's life is in danger. **********Asked whether his trip -- which includes visits to New York, Chicago and St. Louis -- was primarily to seek economic aid in Washington, he said: \"This is not a poor country. We have plenty of resources, education, talent. What we need from the United States is political support, political recognition, political encouragement. We're not going to the United States in any mendicant mode.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/for-salomon-a-return-to-old-methods-on-pay.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1995-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Salomon, A Return to Old Methods on Pay", "print_headline": "For Salomon, A Return to Old Methods on Pay", "body_text": " **********Salomon Brothers Inc., which tried to forge a new standard for compensation on Wall Street last year by adopting an unpopular pay plan, told its senior executives yesterday that it would return next year to more tried-and-true methods of calculating pay. **********At a meeting yesterday with managing directors in New York, Deryck C. Maughan, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers, and Robert E. Denham, the chairman and chief executive of its holding company, Salomon Inc., said executives' compensation in 1996 would be based on a combination of the firm's return on equity, the profits generated by their particular business unit and individual productivity. **********That has been the standard for determining compensation for top executives on Wall Street for as long as anyone can remember. And Salomon's return to it demonstrates how difficult it is for securities firms to tinker with pay, which eats up roughly half of their revenue and amounts to almost two-thirds of their annual costs. **********The return to the old system is also a defeat for Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who owns roughly 20 percent of Salomon and has championed the notion that Wall Street executives should not expect to walk home with seven-figure salaries each year if shareholders failed to get a minimum return on equity. **********A spokesman for Salomon, Robert F. Baker Jr., said the firm had not abandoned its commitment to aligning the interests of its managing directors with the interests of shareholders. Rather, it has decided that \"business unit performance and individual performance are also important determinants of a person's compensation,\" he said. **********The compensation system put in place last October set a base salary of $400,000 for managing directors who work in businesses driven by client demand and promised them a bonus only if the firm achieved a return on equity of 7 percent. In most Wall Street firms, a professional's base salary is only a small fraction of his annual compensation, the bulk of which consists of a bonus. **********Many managing directors who were used to living on $1 million or more a year doubted that the firm would achieve the minimal return-on-equity requirements in 1995. **********Another source of tension was that managing directors in the proprietary trading unit, which trades about $2 billion of the firm's capital to generate the bulk of its annual earnings, were paid under a separate system that gave them a direct cut of the profits they generated without regard to return on equity. That meant that last year, when Salomon Brothers had an after-tax loss of $399 million, seven managing directors in proprietary trading took home a total of about $175 million. **********Furious over the perceived inequity, more than two dozen senior managing directors left this year. **********Earlier this month, the board voted to scrap the pay plan it adopted last fall, but yesterday was the first time Mr. Maughan and Mr. Denham sketched an outline of its replacement. They did not describe specifically how much a managing director could expect to make under the new plan, one managing director who attended the meeting said last night. **********They also told the managing directors they planned to unify the firm by bringing the proprietary trading unit under the same pay system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/business/media-business-advertising-software-makes-strange-bedfellows-britain-microsoft.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 760, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Software makes strange bedfellows in Britain as Microsoft and Murdoch team to push Windows 95.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Software makes strange bedfellows in Britain as Microsoft and Murdoch team to push Windows 95.", "body_text": " **********IN the computer software business, the Microsoft Corporation is not known for treading lightly.

The company is beginning an advertising campaign with the Rolling Stones song \"Start Me Up\" in most major markets around the world today. And it has devised a series of promotions more reminiscent of the recording industry than the computer business, complete with parties and midnight store openings for consumers who cannot wait an extra minute to get their hands on the product. **********In the United States, the promotional frenzy includes an appearance by Jay Leno as host of the introductory ceremonies at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., television infomercials, newspaper supplements and the lighting of the Empire State Building in the logo colors of Windows 95. **********Heavy advertising by Microsoft and other computer companies and retailers has clearly helped to generate media attention for Windows 95. But only in Britain is Microsoft sponsoring an entire newspaper. **********What Microsoft hopes it will get, in addition to the chance to place its advertising in front of 1.5 million readers and reap the benefits from the publicity, is what it hopes will be \"fair and balanced\" coverage of the product in the editorial supplement to be carried by the paper, Mr. Lees said. **********Mr. Lees said that he had not yet seen the supplement, and that Microsoft had no editorial control over it. The supplement, though sponsored by Microsoft, was largely prepared by freelancers hired by The Times under the paper's direction. **********Mr. Lees probably does not need to worry.

Already Mali faces a destabilizing conflict involving Tuareg tribesmen in the north, but any settlement has been thwarted by a lack of resources. **********At the same time, Mali's debt burden, contracted under years of dictatorship, consumes so much of the country's revenues that there is little left for development needs. **********Even though they have already sharply pared back their civil service, Malian officials say that giving priority to debt servicing, a requirement of staying in the good graces of Western financial institutions like the World Bank, has turned each month into a frantic juggling exercise to meet Government payrolls. **********\"Today our foreign debt is higher than our gross domestic product,\" said the Minister of Finance, Soumaila Cisse, who said 60 percent of fiscal receipts were used to service debt obligations. **********\"If we didn't have aid, we could not pay salaries. If we can't pay salaries, that means social disturbances, that means no scholarships for students, that means we give up on preparing for the future.\" **********In the current climate in the West, few expect large new infusions of aid to countries like Mali. Many development experts say debt forgiveness, particularly for payments owed to the World Bank, the biggest lender to Africa, will go a long way toward helping some of Africa's poorest countries get back on their feet economically. **********Officials with the World Bank say that they have long been in discussions with its leading contributors over debt relief, but that Western capitals have been unable to agree on a plan. **********Already, many experts in the United States say inaction in the early part of this decade by the West may have squandered a crucial opportunity to help consolidate democracy in Africa. **********\"When you looked at Benin and Mali and Zambia and the experiences of several other places, it appeared at the beginning of the decade that what was happening in Africa would just overwhelm despotism,\" said Makau wa Mutua, director of the human rights project at Harvard Law School. **********\"The values so long preached by the West were being realized in fact, and many of us naively thought that the West would have shown patience in nurturing democratic movement, not just in Eastern Europe but in Africa too.\" **********Instead, he and other critics say, after a burst of enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the continent, Washington and other Western capitals turned their interest elsewhere. **********Experts like Mr. Mutua said the West's short-lived attention to Africa has had a doubly negative impact. On the one hand, dictators who might have been persuaded to make way for democratic systems interpreted the relative silence as acquiescence in their continued rule. The result, many say, has been a strengthening of autocratic leaders in Nigeria, Kenya, Zaire, Togo and Cameroon who have been able to hold out against the democratic trend. **********On the other hand, the failure by the West to relieve economic misery in many newly democratic countries has discouraged Africans on democracy, and may ultimately fuel takeover attempts by new military or civilian dictators. **********\"In most of the countries where they have had elected democratic governments, the fundamental problem is that they are left with precisely the same economic and social problems they had before,\" said L. Gray Cowan, an expert in African affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. **********\"When people see that the new democratic systems are not capable of resolving their problems, the risk is that they will quickly grow disillusioned.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/26/business/international-briefs-debt-revamping-plan-at-aerovias-de-mexico.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Debt Revamping Plan At Aerovias de Mexico", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Debt Revamping Plan At Aerovias de Mexico", "body_text": " **********Aerovias de Mexico S.A., the largest airline in Mexico, is trying to restructure $137.5 million of debt due on June 10, the company said in a statement yesterday.

Indeed, according to the 1994 American Information User survey, the number of part- and full-time telecommuters in the United States reached 9.1 million in 1994, up 20 percent from 1993. **********If this trend continues, in 50 years we will probably look back on our current commuter society as only a blip in history, an artifact of the industrial age sandwiched between the cottage industries of the last century and the information age of the next. As sociological, technological and environmental forces converge, we will no longer need to go to work. Our work will come to us. **********But a close examination of the A.I.U. statistics and several backup interviews indicate that the pace of change may be overstated. Most people are only inching toward their virtual offices, at times under duress. Telecommuting requires some significant adjustments, and the human factor is often a big obstacle. Consider these examples: *********** One woman said she had intended to continue telecommuting after her maternity leave, but found that she too often had to be at the office for meetings, files or last-minute projects. She also said her husband expected the laundry to be done more frequently when she was at home. Now, she rarely telecommutes. *********** A journalist with two preschool children recently bought a house about an hour-and-a-half commute from her job. When I suggested she set up a home office, she told me at length why it would never work for her. Not if you want to be a player. *********** A sales manager who tried tele commuting found that his staff hesitated to call him at home, kept their calls short and even apologized for the intrusions. He soon returned to working at the office every day. **********Additional data indicate that these workers are not alone. The A.I.U.'s statistics are based on a minimalist definition of a telecommuter as someone who works from home as little as one day a month during usual business hours. The group's finding that telecommuters work at home an average of 39.6 hours a month -- or only about 12 weeks a year -- means that most work is still done at the company office. **********Many companies were initially encouraged to use telecommuting by changes in the Federal Clean Air Act in 1990 that were intended to reduce pollution from autos. Their efforts were buoyed by concerns about commercial real estate costs -- telecommuting allowed them to eliminate office space -- and were applauded by a new generation of workers looking for family-friendly employers. Clearly, telecommuting must make economic sense. **********Most companies already profit by some work similar to telecommuting. Many salespeople enter orders on laptop computers directly from the customer's office. Also, people who work extensively with colleagues away from the office have already made many of the logistical adjustments to fax, E-mail and teleconferencing. For them, tele commuting is a simple and reasonable next step. **********Interviews have revealed few complaints about the technology.  But over and over people say that while telecommuting is a great idea, it is not for them. They need access to files, or have career concerns (\"out of sight, out of mind\"), or want to be available for impromptu meetings, or feel they can't supervise employees they can't see. **********To overcome these human factors, organizations must address more than technology and policy. In time, companies will rethink their work processes and human resources systems to reflect telecommuting as the standard rather than an exception to the rule. **********A national effort called Telecommute America -- whose founders include AT&T;, the Commerce Department and the Environmental Protection Agency -- is devoted to that goal, and this week it begins a national drive to convert another million workers into telecommuters by the end of next year. But it will be a real challenge. **********For, as with any other major change, managers and employees will creatively resist. And our work norms, culture and management systems will all need to be realigned. **********Personally, I know how hard it will be. When my husband moved into my home office a few months ago, his files and speaker phone calls were somewhat annoying. But what really set me off was his subtle expectation that I make lunch. I recently jested to his boss that, along with a laptop, fax and phone line, his company should provide marriage counseling for dual-career telecommuting couples. **********But who knows? Perhaps 50 years from now, the home office will be the standard. And the occasional grisly commute downtown may leave us saying, \"Tell me again why I need to do this.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/business/apple-stock-falls-on-chip-supply-concern.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apple Stock Falls on Chip-Supply Concern", "print_headline": "Apple Stock Falls on Chip-Supply Concern", "body_text": " **********The shares of Apple Computer Inc. dropped nearly 8 percent yesterday on concerns about possible shortages of chips for its new lines of desktop and notebook computers. **********Apple has said it will introduce the products, based on the Power PC microprocessor, in late March or early April.

That is because employee compensation costs rose overall just 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the narrowest year-to-year increase for civilian workers since the Government began publishing such figures in 1981. **********\"This confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,\" Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said in an interview. The slight rise in benefits costs reflected employer scale-backs in coverage and greater reliance on health maintenance organizations, as well as requirements that employees shoulder a greater proportion of health costs. **********But although growth in pay and benefits was being held to no more than the inflation rate -- retail prices also climbed 2.9 percent over the last 12 months -- bond traders found something else to worry about in indications that the economy might not be as weak as some of them had thought. **********The price of long-term Treasury bonds ebbed after the Conference Board, a business-oriented research group, reported that that consumer confidence had jumped in April after a marginal March rise. **********\"The latest confidence readings show a strong increase in expectations for the next six months,\" Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said today in announcing the latest findings. \"Over the years, this component of the index has proven to be a reliable forecaster of economic trends.\" **********Based on a survey of 5,000 households, the consumer confidence index rose to 105.5 in April, its highest point in nearly five years, from 100.2 in March. Expectations for the next six month jumped to 97.8 from 90.1 after three straight declines. Assessment of the current situation edged up to 117 after the initial March figure of 117.1 was revised down to 115.3. **********Confidence ebbed, however, in four of the nation's nine regions, including the Middle Atlantic states. **********Another expansionary sign, at a time when many believe economic growth to be sharply slowing, was a report by the National Association of Realtors showing that sales of existing homes climbed 5.8 percent in March to an annual rate of 3.62 million, as milder weather encouraged buyers. **********\"The consumer still has some vigor,\" said Daniel Laufenberg, chief domestic economist at American Express Financial in Minneapolis. \"Maybe he hasn't landed yet,\" Mr. Laufenberg added, alluding to the so-called soft landing that policy makers are seeking to produce in the economy at large after more than a year of rapid growth. **********For many economists, though, the surprisingly tame Employment Cost Index warranted the most attention. **********Although wages and salaries rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, slightly more than the December quarter's six-tenths of 1 percent, this was more than offset by the sharp slowdown in benefits costs -- to two-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent the previous quarter. **********Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence/ Deutsche Bank was particularly impressed by American business' increasing ability to keep its costs under control. Not only did overall compensation costs show the skimpiest increase on record last quarter, he said, but \"the benefits-inflation rate has been more than cut in half since 1990.\" Pay and benefits account for more than two-thirds of total business costs. **********According to Albert Schwenk, economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, somewhat more than half the benefits deceleration in the January-March period reflected lower costs for health care. In industries producing goods, benefits fell three-tenths of 1 percent, primarily because workers were paying a larger share out of their own pockets. Often, this takes the form of extra premiums or higher deductibles before insurance kicks in. **********Another way that companies save money is by inducing more of their employees to use the less expensive health maintenance organizations, rather than remaining in medical plans with no cost deterrent on which doctors they visit. **********In addition, companies saved money was through lower payments to funds that provide for workers injured on the job, Mr. Schwenk said. **********The other main benefits area is pension plans, where employers have been rapidly switching from traditional plans providing specific regular benefits for retirees to defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, in which companies often make matching contributions to employee accounts and leave the responsibility for investment decisions to the employee. **********Joseph Liro, an economist at S. G. Warburg, called the latest reading of the Employment Cost Index \"extraordinarily reassuring\" evidence that inflation was likely to remain subdued through the rest of the current business cycle. He suggested that the past pattern of rapidly rising costs in fringe benefits had perhaps been \"permanently broken.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/world/diplomatic-moves-pressed-by-paris.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIPLOMATIC MOVES PRESSED BY PARIS", "print_headline": "DIPLOMATIC MOVES PRESSED BY PARIS", "body_text": " **********After a pitched battle between French peacekeepers and Bosnian Serbs, France and its NATO allies renewed diplomatic efforts today to stop the violence and asked Russia to help persuade the Serbs to free United Nations troops seized as hostages. **********Although more than 150 French troops were among the 220 surrounded or held as human shields, France did not publicly repeat earlier threats to withdraw its three battalions from Bosnia. **********But the new French President, Jacques Chirac, authorized his troops to shoot back if they were attacked again.

Mr. Mitterrand cultivated it himself, but unlike de Gaulle, who led the Free French from exile in London, he had compromised himself during the war. **********Only last year, Mr. Mitterrand acknowledged publicly that he had received a decoration from the collaborationist French Government in Vichy during the war for his work with veterans and former prisoners of war. He had been wounded and taken prisoner himself by the Germans in 1940, escaping in 1941 and making his way to Vichy because before the war he had shared many of the extreme-right nationalistic ideals supported by its leader, Marshal Philippe Petain. **********It was only in 1943 that Mr. Mitterrand joined the Resistance, though he never reconciled himself to its leader, de Gaulle. **********Mr. Mitterrand today continued the process of handing over the Government to his successor by accepting the resignation of his Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, who lost out to Mr. Chirac for the presidency. Mr. Mitterrand asked Mr. Balladur to stay on as a caretaker until the new Government is formed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/25/business/staking-claim-in-alternative-software-on-the-internet.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1995-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 563, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Staking Claim in Alternative Software on the Internet", "print_headline": "Staking Claim in Alternative Software on the Internet", "body_text": " **********James Gosling wants to make the computer software world safe for diversity. **********In his view, and in the view of many other people in the industry, the software giant Microsoft is close to crowding out all its competition. **********\"As far as the software business goes, Microsoft has become like death and taxes,\" said Mr. Gosling, the 40-year-old software wizard who is the mastermind behind the Java language. He contends that Sun Microsystems, by distributing Java freely over the Internet, will create an alternative software world that Microsoft will be unable to dominate. **********A Canadian who came to the United States to attend graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University in the late 1970's, Mr. Gosling had been a hacker from the days he discovered computers while hanging around at the University of Calgary at age 13. **********He had always been an electronics tinkerer.  \"I was always interested in building things, but in order to build things you have to have parts,\" he said. Software, whose parts are just digital ones and zeros, liberated him. **********The Java programming language is Mr. Gosling's second effort at transforming computing with a software design that permits programs to operate over computer networks. The first project, which he began shortly after arriving at Sun in 1984, was known as NEWS, or Network Extensible Windowing System. The idea -- radical at the time -- was to enable any computer screen on a network to display a program running on any other computer on the network. **********While NEWS never caught on as a commercial product, it did demonstrate the potential for distributing computer-processing power across a network. And it helped pave the way for today's so-called client/server computer networks, in which a network of desktop client computers can share programs that run on centrally located server machines. **********\"He has skills of making code very compact and very fast,\" said David Rosenthal, a software designer who joined Mr. Gosling's NEWS project after initial skepticism. **********Despite its technical success, the commercial failure of NEWS taught Mr. Gosling some valuable lessons. So did the near-failure of Java, which Mr. Gosling began working on as a secret project in 1991. Conceived as a programming language for interactive television and the consumer electronics industry, the Java project was originally called Oak and was at the heart of Sun's attempt to create software for set-top television controllers. **********\"We got seduced by the dark side of interactive television,\" he said. **********But by mid-1994, as the industry hype over interactive television was deflated by economic realities and a realization that neither the audiences nor the technology was ready for prime time, Sun and Mr. Gosling steered Java toward the Internet's World Wide Web -- where most of the real \"information highway\" action was starting to take place. **********Even if Java takes off and becomes an Internet standard, Sun Microsystems may receive little direct financial benefit, Mr. Gosling acknowledges, since most people will be getting it free. But indirectly, the overall growth of the Internet is a boon for Sun, whose network server computers are the most popular way for companies, agencies and universities to connect to the global computing web. \"Anything that contributes to the health of the Internet contributes to Sun's health as well,\" Mr. Gosling said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/business/company-news-delcor-ends-bid-for-national-gypsum.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DELCOR ENDS BID FOR NATIONAL GYPSUM", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DELCOR ENDS BID FOR NATIONAL GYPSUM", "body_text": " **********After having had two acquisition offers rejected, Delcor Inc. dropped its takeover bid for the National Gypsum Company, the nation's second-largest wallboard manufacturer.

The proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission would allow long-distance providers and cable television operators to compete with Pacific Bell and GTE for a $6 billion market. **********Several states -- including New York, Michigan and Illinois -- have allowed new competitors into their local markets. But the regional Bell operating companies retain key marketing advantages over their new rivals; for example, they can force customers to change telephone numbers to switch to a competing carrier. Such loopholes would be largely scrapped under California's plan. **********California's proposal -- if it becomes law -- would be a setback for Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis. The plan would throw open the company's core franchise, but it would not allow Pacific Bell into the long-distance market. Pacific Telesis's share price lost 12.5 cents yesterday, closing at $30.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********\"This is a real challenge for us,\" said Lee Bauman, the vice president in charge of competition issues at Pacific Bell. \"We believe that all markets should be opened to all players.\" **********Pacific Bell, GTE and their would-be competitors have 30 days to respond to the proposal. After that, the Public Utilities Commission will issue final rules -- as early as June 21. Most telephone executives said they did not expect the commission's final regulations to differ substantially from the rules issued yesterday. **********To a certain extent, Pacific Bell is a victim of jurisdictional boundaries. California's Public Utilities Commission has authority over the state's local phone market, which comprises both local and toll calls. But the long-distance market is governed by Harold H. Greene, the Federal judge who ordered the breakup of AT&T's Bell System in 1984. **********California has aggressively sought to open up its markets: the state allowed long-distance companies to compete for toll calls starting in January. Judge Greene, however, has been extremely wary of allowing the regional Bells into the $66 billion long-distance business. **********\"This certainly puts Pacific Bell at a competitive disadvantage,\" said Ronald Altman, a telecommunications analyst at Furman Selz & Company. \"Given that all the competitors are there and are ready to go, they're going to lose share in the local market quickly.\" **********The commission said that the state's local market could be open to new competitors as early as June. But MCI executives said they did not expect to be able to offer local service in California until early next year. A spokeswoman for AT&T said the company was still studying the California rules, and that it was too early to say when AT&T might make a move. **********Mr. Bauman said that Pacific Bell objected to the plan because it would allow long-distance providers and cable companies to \"cherry pick\" business and affluent residential customers without guaranteeing that poorer residential customers would continue to receive reasonable phone rates. **********Pacific Bell and other regional Bell companies contend that they subsidize residential rates with revenue from more lucrative business and toll services. If Pacific Bell were to lose those profits to a long-distance provider like AT&T or a cable company like Time Warner, Mr. Bauman said, it might no longer be able to provide low, basic rates. **********Not surprisingly, the long-distance companies said they were generally pleased with the proposal. **********\"The commission has taken an important first step, and they plan to do this on a pretty reasonable schedule,\" said Stephen Bowen, a lawyer for MCI, and the spokesman for the California Telecommunications Coalition, a group of companies seeking to enter the state's local telephone market. **********Consumer-advocacy groups were more guarded in their appraisals. Thomas J. Long, a lawyer for Towards Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer watchdog group based in San Francisco, said that the proposal still allowed the local telephone company to charge customers for the right to keep their phone numbers if they changed carriers. **********\"We still have some reservations over whether these rules will allow true competition to develop,\" Mr. Long said. **********California's local market is considered a plum. And a spate of competitors are lining up to enter it. In addition to AT&T and MCI, they include Sprint and so-called competitive access providers like the Teleport Communications Group and MFS Communications. **********Industry analysts estimated that Pacific Bell controlled 80 percent of the local phone market and GTE 10 percent. **********Recent history shows that rivals can make quick inroads in the California market. Although long-distance companies have been allowed in the toll, or short-haul long-distance, business for only four months, Pacific Bell said that it had already lost 5 percent of that market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/world/a-leak-in-ulster-peace-plan-stirs-a-storm.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Leak in Ulster Peace Plan Stirs a Storm", "print_headline": "A Leak in Ulster Peace Plan Stirs a Storm", "body_text": " **********Prospects for peace negotiations in Northern Ireland hit a snag today when details of a British-Irish plan to guide the talks were leaked to the press and published, provoking a storm of protest from unionist politicians of Ulster. **********The Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, said the plan went too far in giving the Irish republic a role in running the affairs of the six counties of the north. In particular, they objected to a proposed joint north-south Irish authority that would have strong executive powers in certain areas and would deal directly with the European Union. **********To the unionists, this was too large a concession and it conjured up the slippery slope that is their ultimate nightmare, a trail of events leading to Irish unification. **********The publication of key sections of the draft document in The Times of London turned into a sudden crisis for the Government of Prime Minister John Major and threatened the delicate, 13-month search for a way out of 25 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. **********\"If this document were agreed by the British Government it will be regarded as a sellout,\" said David Trimble, a Member of Parliament from the dominant and moderate Ulster Unionist Party. \"It is completely unacceptable to unionists.\" **********Mr. Trimble said the unionists might not only refuse to join in negotiations on Northern Ireland, but they might also withdraw their support from the Conservative Government in Westminster, reducing Mr. Major's working majority in Parliament into a minority. **********The gravity of the response to the report was signaled by a special debate this afternoon in the House of Commons and by a televised address by the Prime Minister this evening. **********In his five-minute speech tonight, Mr. Major pleaded with the people of Northern Ireland not to jeopardize hopes for peace that have been raised by nearly six months without violence. He said talks with Dublin were continuing and promised that there was nothing to fear because \"nothing is going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\" **********\"The Government is working for a peaceful future in Northern Ireland,\" Mr. Major said. \"Tonight I ask for time, and I ask for trust and I promise to pursue a lasting peace.\" **********Throughout the day, the Government was trying to put out fires ignited by the unionists, who represent the province's 950,000 Protestant majority. Government officials pointed out that the leaked document was only a draft, that it had not yet been signed and that even if the agreement had been struck, that the unionists could turn it down at the negotiating table or reject it in a referendum. **********\"This is not some blueprint to be imposed on the people of Northern Ireland,\" Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said in the House of Commons. He reiterated the Government's insistence that the document in no way envisioned joint authority over Ulster between Dublin and London. **********This was not enough to assuage the unionists. The Rev. Ian Paisley, whose Democratic Unionist Party is more extreme than the Ulster Unionist Party, thundered that it was all a sellout. \"The Secretary of State cannot expect any self-respecting unionist to sit down at the table if that is going to be on the agenda,\" he said. **********The document was, he charged, \"the price\" paid to get a deal with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A. **********James Molyneaux, who heads the Ulster Unionist Party in Parliament and controls its nine votes, which are crucial to Mr. Major, was more restrained. But even he indicated that he felt there had been double-dealing and that the parties of Northern Ireland have \"all been effectively excluded from discussions.\" **********Mr. Mayhew's job was made more difficult by the approach taken in The Times article. The first paragraph said that the document \"brings the prospect of a united Ireland closer than it has been at any time since partition in 1920.\" **********In a radio interview, Mr. Mayhew denounced that interpretation as \"rubbish.\" The Times was soundly thrashed on the floor of the House of Commons by several Members of Parliament for \"scandalous behavior\" that could derail the peace process. The newspaper said it had obtained the document \"from sources in Dublin,\" but several M.P.'s regarded that as a subterfuge. **********The new Irish Prime Minister, John Bruton, warning that the leak could damage \"the entire process towards peace and reconciliation,\" stood before the Irish Parliament and insisted there was no sign it had come from \"an Irish quarter.\" **********The document emerged from countless hours of talks between British and Irish officials. It is called a \"joint framework\" and is intended to provide an outline for negotiations involving all the parties of Northern Ireland, including the Protestant unionists and Sinn Fein. **********The central point, as disclosed by The Times, was the Irish authority with powers in such areas as agriculture, trade, education and health. It would contain representatives from both the Irish republic and the proposed reconstituted Northern Ireland Assembly. **********Particularly galling to the unionists was a provision that members of the Northern Ireland Assembly could not boycott the authority but would have to participate as a \"duty of service.\" They also objected to the ideas that the authority might handle much of the combined $2.2 billion in European Union assistance funds and that it was not clear what would happen if the authority broke down. **********Underlying their concerns was language in the document that said \"the body should be dynamic, enabling progressive extension of its functions to new areas.\" This aroused the fear that the authority could grow, hydralike, into something powerful enough to eventually bring about unification. **********Other points in the document suggested that Britain would change the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, which paved the way to partition, in exchange for the Irish Republic amending its Constitution to drop a territorial claim to the north. **********The document also pledged \"rigorous impartiality\" on the part of the British Government and a declaration of \"the birthright\" of everyone born in either jurisdiction to be part \"as of right\" of the Irish nation.

Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, that his bank will no longer be the largest in the United States. In recent remarks to reporters, Mr. Reed cracked that if Richard M. Rosenberg, the chief executive of the BankAmerica Corporation, made one more acquisition, the San Francisco bank would leap from second to first. **********The name is different, but the outcome for Mr. Reed is the same. The combination announced Monday between the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Chemical Banking Corporation would create a bank with $297 billion in assets, jumping ahead of Citicorp at $257 billion. **********Yet given that Mr. Reed, who declined to comment for this article, said he would not be concerned if BankAmerica surpassed Citicorp, presumably he would have a similar reaction about Chase. **********\"Size has become totally irrelevant,\" said Frank R. DeSantis, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"It hasn't been the issue that has been holding either Chemical or Citi back.\" **********Size in banking is generally measured in assets, which total the bank's loans, its securities holdings and its buildings and equipment. Increasingly, banking assets are seen as an albatross rather than a benefit because they entail risk; thus, regulators require banks to hold capital as a cushion against the assets going bad. Many banks now prefer businesses like bond underwriting and home mortgage lending where money can be provided to a borrower, but the asset is sold to an investor. **********Indeed, Mr. Reed recently decreed that Citicorp would slash assets in its corporate banking unit to $80 billion from $95 billion, because the returns on corporate loans and investments are too low. Chemical, by contrast, boasts that it is the No. 1 player in corporate banking. **********Assets, moreover, have only a loose correlation to profitability. Citicorp's profits last year of $3.4 billion surpassed $2.5 billion for Chemical and Chase combined. Those banks, however, figure they can cut $1.5 billion in annual expenses, which would lift their after-tax profits by about $900 million, putting their total on par with Citicorp's. **********More significant to analysts, Citicorp was the top bank last year in return on equity -- profits as a percentage of shareholders' investments. Citicorp earned 23 percent on its equity, compared with 16 percent for Chase and 12 percent for Chemical. The new Chase says it wants to earn 18 percent on equity. **********The combination of Chemical and Chase may have the most immediate effect on Citicorp in New York. Chemical, after its 1992 merger with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, tied Citicorp, the longtime leader in New York. The new Chase will be far ahead. But other than through mergers, market share moves at a glacial pace in banking, and thus Citicorp's franchise is hardly vulnerable. What's more, the merger may well allow all the banks to raise their fees. **********\"In New York the merger benefits all of them because it removes one competitor,\" said James M. McCormick, president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group. **********But the two banks' strategies are very different. Mr. Reed could be assured that Citicorp would fall behind in the size rankings, because he had decided that the bank would avoid the merger frenzy that is reshaping the banking business in the United States. Similarly, Mr. Reed has said that Citicorp will not buy an investment bank, if laws are changed to permit it. **********Instead, he has concentrated on milking Citicorp's unmatched global reach into more than 90 countries. Citicorp is the only bank that is trying to build a worldwide consumer banking franchise, and it has a strong penetration into developing countries. **********\"Citibank is the largest bank that is based in the United States, but a number of banks do more business in the U.S. than Citi does,\" Richard L. Huber, a former Citibank executive who is now the vice chairman of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, said. **********In another area of competition -- credit cards -- the new Chase will be the third-largest issuer of Visas and Mastercards, but analysts say that it will be no more threat to Citicorp than the raft of new card issuers emerging in recent years, as diverse as AT&T and General Motors. Both Chemical and Chase have lost market share to these newcomers, but Citicorp has been able to keep its No. 1 position. **********The proposed merger could be a threat, though, to another of Citicorp's leading positions: foreign-exchange trading. Chemical is one of the leading currency traders with other banks, while Chase has strong relationships with corporations that need to exchange money. Yet in this business, Citicorp's trading revenue was higher than the two others combined. **********\"To dig Citibank out of its top spot will be extremely tough,\" said Klaus T. Said, head currency trader at J. P. Morgan & Company. **********In other dealings with large corporations, bankers expect that Chase will benefit from the added cachet of being the country's largest bank, but that Citicorp will not lose much. **********\"When the new Chase comes calling, it will have more pizazz or clout than it did the day before yesterday,\" Mr. McCormick, the consultant, said. \"Some companies, especially outside of the United States, will say, 'Gee, should we have them in our set of banks?' But I don't think that Citi will be the loser; it will be the banks in the bottom half of the top 10.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/07/world/conflict-balkans-hostages-108-un-soldiers-have-been-freed-serbian-aide-says.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1995-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "108 U.N.

Signals that American trackers thought might be coming from the pilot ceased, and a senior Bosnian Serb official, Jovan Zametica, told the CNN television network that the Serbs were not holding the pilot. **********The hostages released today were the second group to be freed; 121 were freed on Friday. Of the more than 320 seized after NATO planes launched bombing raids against Bosnian Serb arms depots last month, some were disarmed and held as hostages while others were surrounded and their movements restricted. It was unclear what, if any, the political significance the release of a second group of hostages would be. **********[ In Washington, a Clinton Administration official said \"we are not in a position to confirm\" that the peacekeepers had been released. The official repeated the United States position that the United Nations forces should not have been detained in the first place. **********[ In New York, United Nations officials said they were aware of the reports of the release but could not confirm it until the peacekeepers were delivered to their custody. United Nations officials did say, however, that the Government of Spain had confirmed the release of a Spanish soldier. ] **********News that more hostages were to be released on Tuesday came from Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters. The release was delayed for several hours. **********One bus carrying 58 hostages -- 43 Ukrainians, 14 Frenchmen and one Spaniard -- arrived in Zvornik on Tuesday. The remainder, which also included some British soldiers, arrived in a second bus at the border hours later. **********Among the factors that evidently persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to begin releasing hostages was the appearance in Pale of Mr. Stanisic, one of President Milosevic's most powerful aides. **********Mr. Stanisic commands fear as well as respect among Serbs, and the President's decision to use him as an emissary was a signal that he considers this matter gravely important. **********President Milosevic has staked his personal prestige on Mr. Stanisic's mission, announcing publicly that he expected all the hostages to be released soon and making the same promise in a telephone conversation with the French President, Jacques Chirac. **********Two Greek negotiators, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis, held a seven-hour session with Bosnian Serb leaders at their Pale headquarters on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Greece is the only NATO ally, and one of the few countries in the world, that maintains good relations with the Bosnian Serbs. **********Spokesmen for the Bosnian Serbs refused to confirm reports that they had promised the Greeks that they would soon release all the hostages they hold. Foreign leaders have insisted that all be released unconditionally. In Paris on Tuesday, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe reiterated the demand. **********\"I want to remind the Bosnian Serb leaders that we hold them directly and personally responsible for the fate of each one of the hostages, whether French or not, and this is no idle warning,\" Mr. Juppe said during an emergency debate in Parliament."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/business/goldman-struggles-to-produce-revenue.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1995-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldman Struggles To Produce Revenue", "print_headline": "Goldman Struggles To Produce Revenue", "body_text": " **********While other Wall Street firms have reaped the rewards of a marketplace ripe with underwriting activity and huge mergers, a recent document shows that Goldman, Sachs & Company struggled to produce revenue and retain capital during the six months that ended on May 26. **********At $1.99 billion, the firm's revenues net of interest expenses were flat compared with the comparable period a year earlier, which was by all accounts one of the worst in Wall Street's history. **********Only by reducing its expenses by about 4.5 percent, to $1.49 billion, compared with $1.56 billion in the first six months of the previous fiscal year, did Goldman, Wall Street's last private partnership, wring out profits before taxes of $506 million, a 13 percent increase over the corresponding period a year ago. Sharply lower provisions for taxes, likely a result of the states in which Goldman is making its money in a particular quarter, also helped. **********Despite the better profits, Goldman's capital dropped slightly, to $4.71 billion, from $4.77 billion at the end of last year. Capital has become increasingly critical to firms on Wall Street because, as profits from their traditional advisory businesses decline, they are being forced to use their capital for investment purposes, or principal investing. That in turn forces them to accumulate additional capital to protect their balance sheets against the risk of such investing. **********And its return on net capital, similar to return on equity in a public company, halfway through this year is roughly 5 percent -- the same as it was last year, the firm's worst year ever. Partners could make a better return on their capital if they invested in Treasuries. **********The drop in return on capital stands in contrast to the return at the end of November 1993, the end of its fiscal year, of 22 percent. **********But Goldman partners said yesterday that while the firm had a difficult first half, its profits before taxes in the third quarter, which ended in August, almost equaled its profits before taxes in the first half. **********The document, an offering memorandum for $350 million of notes the firm is selling, raises a curtain on Goldman's performance that the public is rarely allowed to peek under. Its circulation comes against a backdrop of Goldman's bitter fight for control of Rockefeller Center, which has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, in Corporate America and among institutional investors. **********The firm, through its Whitehall Street Real Estate L.P. V, a fund that invests in distressed real estate, is squaring off against one of its biggest clients, the General Electric Company, by bidding for control of Rockefeller Center. General Electric is part of an investor group led by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier who is another Goldman client, that has struck a deal to acquire control of the real estate investment trust that is poised to acquire the trophy property once it emerges from bankruptcy protection. **********Goldman's efforts to unseat its clients is considered bad form on Wall Street, where client relationships are handled with kid gloves. **********But in the offering memorandum, Goldman makes it clear that principal investments, which run the risk of pitting investment bank against client, are becoming a more important part of its business. \"Goldman, Sachs has increasingly used its capital and funds under its management in a variety of activities that can be described as principal investing,\" the firm says in the document. **********The battle for Rockefeller Center is a prime example of that strategy. Whitehall and Goldman put up a $225 million loan to the real estate investment trust, Rockefeller Center Properties, that holds the mortgage on the center. To protect its investment and the investment of the clients for whom it manages money, Goldman is making clients it serves in an advisory capacity furious. **********\"The Goldman role in Rockefeller Center is rife with conflict,\" Mr. Zell said yesterday. At the same time Whitehall is fighting him in Rockefeller Center, Goldman investment bankers are working to sell Mr. Zell's mall holdings and to underwrite a bond offering for one of his public companies, for which it will receive handsome fees. **********But the trend toward principal investing is likely to increase as the firm continues to feel pressure to bolster profits. **********The offering memorandum gave a few glimpses of how that pressure may be increasing. Bankers and analysts were mystified, for example, by the precipitous drop in Goldman's net interest income, the interest a bank or investment bank makes on its investments less its interest expenses. **********The firm's net interest income plummeted in the fiscal first half, falling to $12.7 million from $283.6 million in the comparable period last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/29/world/mideast-accord-the-politics-score-one-for-clinton.html": {"writer_name": "R.

Despite President Clinton's early inclination to shun it, it has been a frequent visitor, and lately an increasingly welcome one, not least because he has managed a series of visible accomplishments overseas. **********Whether progress abroad will continue, whether the Administration will find ways to develop broader foreign-policy themes in place of improvisations, whether Mr. Clinton will derive any political benefit in his re-election campaign -- those questions hung in the air this afternoon as he promised to press forward in the Middle East \"until the circle of peace is closed.\" **********By itself, foreign policy is not often decisive in American Presidential elections. Occasionally, like Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, Presidents stumble so badly that they are unre-electable. But other Presidents have triumphed in foreign wars and still lost, like George Bush in 1992. **********Still, foreign policy is a major element in the subtle process by which the electorate takes the measure of a President. If he seems out of his depth in dealing with other countries, if he seems unfit to handle a crisis, if he allows the United States to be embarrassed abroad, he is sure to pay a price. That happened to Harry S. Truman early in his term, and it happened to President Clinton too as he endured mishaps in Somalia and Haiti. **********Mr. Clinton has never been highly regarded in this department by the American voter. In New York Times/CBS News polls that began in March 1993, his second full month in office, his foreign-policy approval rating has never risen above 53 percent (in the first poll), and it has most often been under 40 percent. Last month, before the latest burst of activity, the figures stood at 36 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval, the rest undecided. **********In the South, his home region, where considerable emphasis is placed on the President's role as Commander in Chief, Mr. Clinton has fared even less well. That is one big reason why he seems unlikely to carry many states there. **********The 1996 election is more than a year away, of course, and voters can change their minds in a hurry. But Mr. Clinton will need good luck and then some if he is to get a political bounce out of his improved foreign-policy fortunes. **********Thus far it has been one step at a time for Mr. Clinton, with little drama. So this afternoon's event marking limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, like the one on the White House lawn two years ago that produced the famous handshake of reconciliation, provided some badly needed political theatrics. **********Today's set-piece celebrated the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in grand style, with a visit to the Oval Office by Yasir Arafat, a man who until recently was regularly denounced there as a villainous killer. Most of the credit, no doubt, accrues to the principals, but the United States played the midwife's role with skill and without too much self-praise, and the moment had the genuine aroma of history. **********The agreement was incremental, a single step on a long path. A last-minute dispute over tiny details delayed the signing. Two peoples who hate each other as much as these two have (and in some cases still do) could easily career off that path before they reach the goal: peace. **********Even if they do not, it is hard to see how such deeply rooted disputes as those over the status of Jerusalem and the creation of a unitary Palestinian state will be resolved. **********One reason for caution was the absence of the leaders of Syria and Lebanon. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan joined Mr. Arafat, Mr. Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel at the White House, but the others will be needed for a comprehensive settlement of the hostilities that have marred the region since the end of World War II. **********But in the post-cold-war world, partial solutions seem to be the norm. The days of sweeping agreements, like those between the United States and the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons, seem to have passed, at least for the moment. **********Even the Western Europeans, negotiating as it were among close relatives, find the road to unity remains open only if it is traveled at low speed. Responding to the energy and intensity of Richard C. Holbrooke, the American negotiator, the combatants in Bosnia have edged closer to agreement. But they are still fighting, and there is no consensus yet on exactly how the contested lands should be divided. **********China has agreed not to sell nuclear reactors to Iran, but in a spectacular instance of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, China has rejected the long-sought invitation for a meeting between Mr. Clinton and President Jiang Zemin because it did not come with a promise of 21-gun salutes, a state dinner and Chinese flags fluttering along Pennsylvania Avenue. China's abysmal human-rights record continues unbroken, but at least Beijing is talking. **********Despite its historic links to the Serbs, Russia has stayed involved with the Bosnian peace effort, even when it included NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions. But trouble may lie ahead in trying to blend Russian with NATO troops in any peacekeeping force, and it is not clear whether Moscow will sit still for NATO expansion into central Europe on the American model. **********For a President who came to office with little knowledge of the world, chose a Secretary of State whose strength lies in quiet backroom dealings and not in bold actions, and picked a national security adviser who has alienated many longtime colleagues with his deviousness, Mr. Clinton is not doing at all badly. **********Somalia and Haiti are both calm, as Somalia and Haiti go, and the recognition of Vietnam, closing a chapter of pain, has occasioned little outcry.

As the first step, you grab the latest version of Quicken, the best-selling personal finance software from Intuit Inc. **********Quicken, you've heard, is the most user-friendly product of its kind. But doubt creeps in as you start to pore over its 300-page user's guide. **********No need to fear, though. In just an hour or so, you can get the hang of the software and use it to print checks, pay bills and -- starting sometime this fall -- even do your banking from home. Spend a few more hours tinkering with Quicken, and you'll see its wide range of investment tools, which are not being used to full advantage by nearly 40 percent of buyers. **********Now accounting for almost 80 percent of the market for personal finance software, Quicken long ago outran its competitors, including Microsoft Money, which will soon introduce a new version. A distant third in the market is Managing Your Money, recently acquired from H & R Block by Nationsbank and Bank of America. **********Since last fall, Quicken's market lead has been enhanced by certain budgeting, forecasting and tax planning features. Intuit's goal is to help users understand not only where they have already spent their money, but also where their money will go down the road. Users can now create forecasts for specific financial situations -- like the purchase of a new mini-van. Before, Quicken offered forecasts for only five matters, including saving for college and refinancing a mortgage. **********While Quicken has never given technophobes much reason to moan, the latest version is clearly more user-friendly, offering everything from advice on how to use a computer mouse to an icon bar that you can customize to go to a frequent transaction. A new \"snapshot\" feature allows users to get an instant picture of their bottom lines with a single keystroke. This eliminates the task of having to run a series of financial reports and charts. **********So where do you start with Quicken? Like most products of its kind, Quicken just about installs itself. Users are ready to go in less than five minutes. After that, it's worth hooking into the 10-minute overview. The best way to get a quick read on Quicken's investment prowess, though, is to set up an investment account and start generating financial reports or charts with it. **********Try creating a \"where am I spending my money?\" report, as outlined in the \"101 tips and tricks\" booklet that comes with the new version, Quicken Deluxe. It will sort your financial transactions from the largest expenditure to the largest source of money. **********Quicken still has one serious drawback: there is no very fast way to get an overview of what it can do. Instead, you have to scan the instruction manual, pull down each menu option and explore. While Intuit is trying to address the problem, for now, the best way to learn about Quicken's uses is to go to the \"homebase,\" which was added last fall and offers information on popular features. **********To avoid wasting time, remember that everything put into Quicken needs to go into one of six basic \"accounts.\" One account is for banking transactions (for checking, savings and money market purposes), and the other accounts are for credit cards, cash, assets, liabilities and investments. While a single data file in Quicken can hold 255 related accounts, anyone who wants to use the software for both personal and business finances might be better off keeping separate files, each with separate accounts. To save time, assign a \"quick key\" to zip into an account used often. **********Quicken does have a number of relatively underappreciated features. For example, its loan planner can help you compute monthly mortgage payments, compare adjustable-rate loans, figure out the tax advantages of a mortgage, determine when a mortgage will be paid off and even make a mortgage fit a budget by making adjustments in other spending areas. **********Quicken still can't compute taxes for you. But it does contain a tax planner that lets you move tax information from Quicken to an external file that can be read by a tax-specific product like Intuit's Turbotax.  Quicken Deluxe also comes with a guidebook from tax experts, as well as a feature for assigning tax line items to various categories to make tax preparation faster and more accurate. **********To make the most out of Quicken's financial help, it's worth plunking down an extra $20 for Quicken Deluxe. While the standard version of the product is the one that Intuit claims is geared for novice investors, anyone looking for even simple portfolio management help would be better off sticking with the deluxe version. In addition to new tax tools, it contains a home inventory feature that tracks household goods and can generate detailed reports for insurance purposes. **********If you have a modem, Quicken Deluxe is also handy for retrieving the prices of more than 100,000 stocks, mutual funds and options, by either accessing a special \"900\" telephone number or using the basic services account on Compuserve. A portfolio can be updated daily. **********Quicken Deluxe comes in a CD-ROM version as well. Spring for it and you'll get not only multimedia tutorials on Quicken, but also a mutual fund selector that can be tailored to your financial goals. Or, if you prefer, use the CD-ROM to enter a computer-generated \"conference room\" and get interactive advice from the tiny, seated images of two personal finance gurus, Jane Bryant Quinn and Marshall Loeb. How's that for hand-holding? **********When it comes to more complex investment information, however, Quicken has its limits. It doesn't keep track of every change in tax law, for example, nor does it track aspects of certain sophisticated transactions like commodities trading. As for the mutual fund selector, while it keeps tabs on the historical performance of a fund, it can't be updated on-line unless you have a Compuserve account. Instead, users have to buy quarterly updates on floppy disks at $13.95 each, or $39.95 for four. **********To get the most out of Quicken's investment abilities, keep in mind that the best advice isn't in the hefty user's guide but in the tips booklet that comes with Quicken Deluxe. There, you'll find hints on recording stock buyouts and spinoffs, as well as tracking foreign currencies, employee stock options and family medical expenses. **********As you grow ever more confident with Quicken, you may look for new financial territories to conquer. One option might be to wait until this fall, when the next version of Quicken comes out. Or you could spring for Pocket Quicken, the pint-sized version used mostly by traveling business people to track travel expenses and to generate expense reports.  Pocket Quicken is loaded into one of the new devices called personal digital assistants and does not have any investment features. Data can be transferred, however, to a parent Quicken program at home. Come fall, Pocket Quicken will be available on its own handheld unit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/company-news-shelton-bancorp-stock-jumps-12-on-takeover-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHELTON BANCORP STOCK JUMPS 12% ON TAKEOVER PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SHELTON BANCORP STOCK JUMPS 12% ON TAKEOVER PLAN", "body_text": " **********Shares of Shelton Bancorp vaulted 12 percent yesterday after it was announced late on Tuesday that the company, based in Shelton, Conn., would be acquired by the Webster Financial Corporation of Waterbury, Conn., for about $29.4 million in stock.

Last year American oil companies were the largest purchasers of Iranian oil, buying about one-fourth of its supplies, worth upward of $4 billion worth on the open market.  Mr. Christopher's recommendation has met with fierce opposition from senior officials at the Defense, Commerce, Treasury and Energy departments. Representatives of those departments argued at the recent White House meeting that curbing American trade would have little effect on Iran and could hurt American companies instead. **********The Commerce Department, which has aggressively promoted American business interests abroad, is urging only those actions that the allies can reasonably be persuaded to join, and Iran's European and Japanese trading partners have no interest in a trade ban. **********The President's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, is expected to preside over a higher-level meeting next week in which the issue will be debated at the White House. The State Department's recommendation has a strong chance of succeeding, in part because Mr. Lake is also said to believe the current strategy needs to be strengthened. **********Mr. Christopher's move reflects his belief that the Administration's international campaign to thwart Iran's ability to rebuild its military economy has been undercut by the oil companies, and that if the Administration does not impose a trade ban, Congress will do so. **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican, has introduced legislation to prohibit American companies or their foreign subsidiaries from doing business with Iran, arguing that the United States is \"subsidizing Iranian terrorism by purchasing their oil.\" **********The issue of the Iran trade ban poses a particularly difficult dilemma for the Administration because it represents a clash between two pillars of its foreign policy: its desire to promote American business around the world and its determination to punish countries it considers \"rogue states.\" **********The United States bans imports from Iran, but Iran is allowed to buy a wide range of nonlethal American goods, including consumer items, oil drilling and engineering equipment, chemicals and gas turbines. The United States is the eighth-largest exporter to Iran, far behind countries like Germany, Japan, France and Britain. **********Nearly two years after it unveiled a policy of \"dual containment\" to isolate both Iran and Iraq, the Administration still considers Iran an \"international outlaw\" that sponsors terrorism worldwide, opposes Middle East peace efforts and is involved in a crash program to develop nuclear weapons. **********Mr. Christopher has opened an international campaign to deprive Iran of equipment useful to its military and to oppose international lending and the rescheduling of Iran's debt. The Administration has also tried unsuccessfully to block a Russian deal to sell Iran two nuclear power reactors. **********As for Iraq, the United States has successfully headed off efforts by France and Russia to ease economic sanctions imposed after the country's forces invaded Kuwait more than four years ago. **********But acute economic deprivation has not eased President Saddam Hussein's firm grip on power in Iraq. And Mr. Hussein has challenged the international community once again by imprisoning two Americans who crossed into Iraqi territory this month. **********The State Department recommendation comes after President Clinton's executive order this month to block a $1 billion project by Conoco Inc. to develop two offshore oil and gas fields with Iran. Mr. Christopher is asking for a broader executive order that could perhaps be followed by legislation, a senior official said. **********The current rift in the Administration reflects the positions taken by various agencies last year over whether to sell Boeing 747's to Iran. The Commerce and Treasury departments and some senior officials in the Pentagon strongly favored the deal, but Mr. Christopher opposed it and ultimately prevailed. Iran bought European Airbus planes instead. **********When Administration officials are asked why, if Iran is truly an outlaw state, the United States does business with it at all, the answer is a practical one: If we don't trade, someone else will. **********The State Department has not decided whether to recommend a ban on exports to Iran, which totaled $328 million last year, down from $750 million in 1992. Nor has the department decided whether the trade ban should cover trade by foreign subsidiaries of American firms. **********Over the last several months, Mr. Christopher and Martin S.

Authors tour less, and many New York publishing houses shut down on Friday afternoons, with editors and executives wafting between holidays and the Hamptons. While books sell steadily, most bookstore owners and customers still look forward to the publishers' fall lists for the freshest, strongest titles of the year. **********This summer has been something of an exception, especially for fiction. Instead of waiting for the fall, trade-book publishers released a number of new novels by best-selling authors between June and August, including \"Beach Music\" (Talese/ Doubleday) by Pat Conroy; \"Memnoch the Devil\" (Alfred A. Knopf) by Anne Rice, and \"Rose Madder\" (Viking) by Stephen King. **********The publishers were hoping to get a head start on the fall competition. They were also copying the strategy of mass-market publishers, whose smaller, less-expensive paperbacks (the kind found in supermarkets and airports) enjoy wide distribution in summer, the peak beach-reading season. **********Consequently, this fall's hardcover roster is dominated by nonfiction -- biographies and memoirs being the largest category. **********Though the balance of fiction and nonfiction books varied among publishers, many houses have especially large nonfiction lists this fall, with fiction titles making up just a third of the releases from some publishers who normally split their lists evenly. **********Bookstores have been carrying more books from university presses, which tend toward more scholarly histories and biographies. **********That publishers experimented by moving fiction rather than nonfiction titles to the summer lists is not surprising. **********When it comes to summer sales, nonfiction is not nearly as popular as the romances and thrillers that are typical of mass-market lists. **********\"People just don't want to get themselves all worked up in the summer,\" said Carolyn K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division. \"They'd rather relax. That's why summer has always been a big season for mass-market fiction.\" **********Nonfiction books have generally been considered to be more reliable Christmas gifts than fiction titles, so nonfiction sales are particularly strong in the fall. And since nonfiction authors do not generally give public readings, publishers look to television talk and news shows, which often suspend production in the summer, for their best publicity. **********But book publishing is not scientific, and with every rule comes exceptions and counterexceptions. There are many strong novels and books of poetry coming out this fall, for example. **********An informal poll of more than 30 publishing houses offered a picture of general trends for this fall. **********Leading the lists were autobiographies, biographies and memoirs, which will be competing for shelf space with books on religion, values and spiritual journeys, as well as on self-help and business. And with an election year around the corner, publishers are also focusing on politics. **********On the fiction front, readers will find books by commercial authors, like Michael Crichton, as well as by so-called literary novelists, like Kazuo Ishiguro. **********But the big heave this fall is in nonfiction, where doorstop volumes will carry list prices as high as $50. **********Among the most anticipated memoirs are \"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs\" by Elie Wiesel (Alfred A. Knopf) and \"My American Journey\" by Colin Powell (Random House). **********Biographers, for their part, will chronicle the ups and downs of actors (Humphrey Bogart, Tom Cruise, James Dean, Betty Grable, Burt Lancaster, Barbra Streisand, John Wayne), musicians and composers (Noel Coward, Cole Porter, Buddy Holly, Alan Jay Lerner, Frank Sinatra, Kurt Weill), writers (Tennessee Williams, James Thurber) and politicians and celebrities. Senator Bob Dole is the subject of three books being published or republished. **********The fall lists also include big books about public policy, AIDS, terrorism and race. **********Among the most anticipated of these titles are \"It Takes a Village\" (Simon & Schuster), in which Hillary Rodham Clinton reflects on children's needs, and releases by Lamar Alexander and Mario Cuomo, who offer new visions of government with \"We Know What to Do\" (William Morrow) and \"Common Sense\" (Simon & Schuster), respectively. **********On race issues, Dinesh D'Souza's \"The End of Racism\" (Free Press) contends that racism is not the main obstacle for blacks today, and \"Facing Up to the American Dream\" (Princeton University Press) by Jennifer L. Hochschild, compares the successes of blacks and whites. **********There are also histories of the Vietnam War, immigration, the Romanov family and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. **********On the fiction front, though some best-sellers defected to the summer list, readers can expect new books from Ann Beattie, Ken Follett, Carlos Fuentes, James Michener, Phillip Roth, Danielle Steel and Amy Tan, to name a few. **********First novels and books by lesser-known literary writers will get extra shelf space this fall, some of it left by the summer defectors. **********Random House, for instance, is hoping to do well with \"Range of Motion\" by Elizabeth Berg.

Today, Dell ships its machines directly from its factories to buyers instead of through retail middlemen. **********\"People have predicted that the direct channel would shrink for years, but we see great opportunity in our business model,\" said Michael S. Dell, the company's 29-year-old founder and chairman. **********Dell, based in Austin, Tex., reported net income of $60.3 million, or $1.36 a share, for its fourth quarter ended Jan. 29. That compares with a profit of $17.7 million, or 39 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales rose 39 percent, to $1.03 billion. **********While the profit exceeded Wall Street's expectations, the company's shares closed down $1.25, at $44.50, in Nasdaq trading. Analysts attributed the decline partly to an announcement yesterday that Dell plans to pay a cash premium for converting preferred stock to common shares. The move is intended to strengthen the company's balance sheet by reducing dividend payments, but it could increase the number of common shares. **********The recovery of Dell's once-troubled notebook computer business bolstered the company's results. In the fourth quarter, notebook sales accounted for 14 percent of revenue, up from 9 percent in the third quarter and 2 percent early last year. **********The portable notebook machines typically afford manufacturers higher profit margins than desktop personal computers. Mr. Dell says the company plans to lift notebook sales to 25 percent or more of total revenue by adding new lines with larger screens, faster microprocessors and multimedia capability. **********Dell moved quickly last year to offer desktop machines using the Intel Corporation's new Pentium microprocessor. So its fourth quarter provides a good gauge of how much buyers were scared off by concerns that arose after Thanksgiving about flaws in the Intel chip in performing some calculations. **********Most buyers, Mr. Dell said, seemed to be \"unfazed by the Pentium flap,\" with Pentium-based machines accounting for 44 percent of Dell's sales. **********Repairing its basic business was a solid strategy for Dell in 1994 but, analysts say, it does not necessarily lay the groundwork for future growth. In the industry, PC shipments to consumers are growing at 30 percent annually, about twice the growth rate of the business market. At Dell, PC shipments to consumers represent just 15 percent of its sales. **********\"Dell can't forever turn its back on the consumer market and stay with the leaders in the PC industry,\" said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, an analyst for the International Data Corporation, a research firm. **********According to I.D.C.'s preliminary numbers for 1994, Dell's worldwide PC shipments increased only 7 percent in a year when shipments grew 27 percent for the industry. The growth for Dell, the seventh-largest PC maker, was the worst of the top 10 companies except for I.B.M., whose shipments declined 4.7 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/28/business/big-3-and-japan.html": {"writer_name": "James Bennet", "pub_date": "1995-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big 3 and Japan", "print_headline": "Big 3 and Japan", "body_text": " **********Of all the exaggerated claims made by both sides in the trade dispute, among the least credible is that the Big Three auto makers have earnestly attempted to penetrate the Japanese market, only to be blocked at every turn. Despite statements by the United States Government and the companies' own trade organization to the contrary, even Big Three executives concede they have barely tried. **********\"The biggest strategic mistake that we made over the last 30 years was not aggressively attacking the Japanese market -- from the standpoint of understanding the people that have become your key or toughest competitors,\" said G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of North American operations at the General Motors Corporation. **********\"Clearly, it has cost us,\" he said. \"Today we could be very competitive selling vehicles in Japan. We're working on vehicles that can be sold there.\" Mr. Wagoner's comments were published last month in Automotive News, a trade weekly. **********And, indeed, the Big Three are working on vehicles that can be sold there. As that implies, however, they generally do not have such vehicles now. **********\"We've got to get more serious fast in the export business,\" Jim Donaldson, a vice president of the Ford Motor Company, said last week as he discussed company plans to start shipping right-hand-drive Taurus sedans to Japan. To hear the Clinton Administration tell it, however, the companies were already deadly serious. **********Just in the last two days, Ford and the Chrysler Corporation took steps to sharpen their competitive edges in Japan, in the process undercutting the Administration's position that any improvement in the Big Three's competitiveness must come from the Japanese Government. **********Today, Ford announced that it was cutting prices in Japan for replacement parts, like bumpers, to bring them in line with Japanese prices. On Monday, Chrysler said it was spending $100 million to buy a distribution company in Japan and expand its network of dealers. **********Of course, the fact that the Big Three have not really tried to export to Japan does not mean that the Japanese market is open. Indeed, Big Three executives argue that Japan's trade barriers discouraged them from trying. But that is a different argument from the one the Clinton Administration is making. **********The Administration has evidently decided it is better to argue that the Big Three tried and failed. Despite the barriers, \"the Big Three have made earnest efforts to compete in the Japanese market,\" read a memo that Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, recently circulated to members of Congress. **********In the memo, Mr. Kantor pointed out that the Japanese companies held 24 percent of the United States market; the Big Three, he said, have 1.5 percent of the Japanese market. But that latter, dismal number could reflect lack of trying, rather than lack of access. **********In fact, the costs of fighting their way into the Japanese market always seemed too high to the Big Three. In explaining his decision to buy the Japanese distributor today, Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said he was now optimistic enough to gamble that the Japanese would open their market. \"After all, we're business people -- not missionaries,\" he said. **********The Japanese have spent billions of dollars studying American tastes and building plants here to manufacture cars and trucks that suit them. The Big Three have generally confined their efforts in Japan to exporting the same cars and trucks they manufacture here. None have the tiny engines that Japanese prefer, and few are equipped for driving on the left-hand side of the road, as the Japanese do. **********Consider the Saturn small car, which the world's biggest auto company, General Motors, created as its import-beater. G.M. proudly boasts that the Saturn has delighted educated, exacting buyers who would have otherwise bought Japanese products. As a result, the car, which has a small, low-displacement engine, seems a natural fit for the Japanese market, compared with, say, the Cadillac Fleetwood or the Buick Century. But while it sells the Cadillac and the Buick in Japan, G.M. does not sell the Saturn there. It does plan to start exporting right-hand-drive versions of the car -- in 1997. **********The American car companies have made investments overseas comparable to those the Japanese made here. But they made them in Europe, not Japan. Over decades, Ford and G.M. built factories and dealer networks to sell cars and trucks with the characteristics, from low fuel consumption to high performance to right-hand drive, that different groups of Europeans prefer. Combined, the two companies control almost 25 percent of the European market. **********To counter the Administration's criticism, the Japanese companies point to the success of European auto makers in penetrating the Japanese market. The Europeans are foreigners in both markets, and aside from a new BMW plant in South Carolina, they do not manufacture in either. As a result, their performance in both countries permits something of an apples-to-apples comparison. **********The Clinton Administration, however, scoffs at the notion the Europeans have succeeded in Japan. \"We remain puzzled by Japanese claims that European automobile manufacturers have been 'successful' in Japan,\" read the memo from Mr. Kantor. \"All of the European manufacturers combined have only a 2.8 percent market share.\" **********What the memo failed to mention, however, was that in the United States all the European manufacturers combined have only a 3.1 percent market share."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/22/business/company-news-retailer-in-japan-to-sell-packard-bell-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RETAILER IN JAPAN TO SELL PACKARD BELL COMPUTERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; RETAILER IN JAPAN TO SELL PACKARD BELL COMPUTERS", "body_text": " **********Daiei Inc., Japan's largest chain retailer, said yesterday that it would sell personal computers made by Packard Bell Electronics Inc. of Sacramento, Calif.

Hamburg, the city Health Commissioner, says. **********Among the efforts was a daylong drill after a simulated attack involving a bacterium, anthrax. **********City officials, including Dr. Hamburg, expressed confidence that the city could cope effectively if a saboteur attacked the New York City subway system with poison gas. But, she said in an interview, additional steps are needed to strengthen the city's ability to deal with terrorism. **********More than a year ago, at the invitation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was evaluating the ability of the Federal Government to work with state and local agencies, representatives of several agencies met to test their response to a hypothetical terrorist attack. The situation involved a car going through a red light, a police chase, an arrest, the finding and spilling of an unknown substance in the car and the subsequent fatal illness of a police officer who handled the material. **********As the participants asked questions and sought clues, it became apparent that those arrested were part of a conspiracy and that the officer died of anthrax, which can be spread through bacterial warfare. As the exercise proceeded, Penn Station was evacuated, food and water were contaminated, city officials sought the aid of specialized tests in Government laboratories, and the Governors of New York and New Jersey agreed to ban interstate travel. **********Morrie Goodman, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, did not comment on the effectiveness of the drill. He said his and other Government agencies had decided that it was inappropriate to discuss the health and medical aspects of the country's preparations to respond to terrorist attacks. **********Anyone exposed through skin or inhalation to a large enough amount of pure sarin or a similar nerve poison would probably die within minutes, officials agree, before front-line emergency crews arrived. But if emergency response was rapid enough, rescue workers could inject atropine, 2-PAM and other antidotes to those who were exposed to smaller amounts of the poison. **********Health officials point out that the city has a number of emergency workers trained to wear special body suits and masks to respond to chemical or biological exposure. **********The city's Emergency Medical Service conducts several drills each year in conjunction with city and state agencies, simulating disasters.  \"But we don't specifically simulate poison attacks or other terrorist attacks because the scenario would be the same: how to get our people to safety as soon as possible,\" said Charles DeGaetano, an E.M.S. spokesman. **********Several months ago Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani met with Federal and other officials responsible for a government response to man-made disasters and experts in chemical and biological warfare. **********Dr. Frank Young, who directs the office of emergency preparedness and national disaster medical system for the United States Public Health Service, said it was one of several meetings held with state and local government leaders to help prepare for potential catastrophes. **********The city has also strengthened liaison with agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And it has assembled a cadre of medical and toxicologic experts in the city to advise on preparations and to be available in case of an attack. **********A critical factor in handling such attacks is making a quick and accurate identification of the toxic agent. **********\"The city has around-the-clock laboratory services that would enable it to make a diagnosis fairly rapidly, but perhaps not immediately because of the uncertainty of what to look for and the limitations of science,\" Dr. Hamburg said. **********Once a diagnosis of sarin or similar poison was made, the Health Department would send faxes to every hospital in the city to alert them and to advise on care for victims. The city is planning to survey all hospitals, pharmacies and health offices to determine how much atropine, 2-PAM and other antidotes are stockpiled throughout the city. **********Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel Prize winner and former president of Rockefeller University in New York, who is interested in the city's preparedness for such emergencies, said the ability of the nation's public health system to cope with such threats was spotty. **********\"We're leaving ourselves very vulnerable because the infrastructure of public health has been allowed to decay,\" Dr. Lederberg said in an interview, alluding to reports from several panels of experts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/26/world/rio-verde-journal-americans-home-on-the-booming-range-in-brazil.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rio Verde Journal; Americans Home on the Booming Range, in Brazil", "print_headline": "Rio Verde Journal; Americans Home on the Booming Range, in Brazil", "body_text": " **********Out here in Brazil's big sky country, where the cows outnumber people and the billboards tout weed killers, Douglas Ferrell looks through the window of his air-conditioned tractor cab and sees dollar signs stretching to the horizon. **********\"I buy new land every year -- you can make 40 percent on your investment out here,\" said the 40-year-old soy and cotton farmer from Pennsylvania. Starting with a 1,200-acre farm a little over a decade ago, Mr. Ferrell has increased his holdings fivefold, bought 1,100 head of cattle and the latest in tractors and combines, and started construction on the tallest farmhouse -- two stories -- and the biggest grain silos ever seen in these parts. **********One of his Mennonite neighbors recently cautioned that Mr. Ferrell was getting a \"big head.\" But his success is part of an agricultural boom that is thrusting Brazil into the world's top ranks of food exporters. **********Often overshadowed by Brazil's coastal industries, farming has been the country's fastest-growing sector since 1980. Over the last 15 years, farm production increased by 47 percent, while industrial production increased by just 11 percent. **********This farming boom has made Brazil one of the world's top five \"food powers\" despite the fact that since 1980, the acreage under cultivation in Brazil has remained the same, and Government subsidies have been cut in half. **********The productivity increases are a result of heavy investment in mechanization, typified by the brand new tractor and combines on Mr. Ferrell's farm. **********Critics note that Brazilian agribusiness grows food for export while a large portion of the country's 154 million people go hungry at home. **********\"How can it be that, in one of the largest grain-exporting nations in the world, we have 32 million people going hungry and 8 million rural workers without land?\" asked the Rev. Ricardo Rezende, a Roman Catholic priest who promotes the distribution of land to small Amazon homesteaders. **********The World Bank estimates that about 7 percent of Brazilian children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition. **********Big farmers respond that their efficiency keeps domestic food prices low and that their exports earn Brazil needed foreign exchange. **********Brazilian farmers are so successful that they trample national borders in search of cheap land. Today, Brazilian colonists plant and harvest one-third of the soy planted in Bolivia and Paraguay, and own 4 percent of Uruguay's land. **********But the region's \"Green Revolution\" is most visible here in the table-flat lands of the country's midwestern savannah, or cerrado. **********\"In 20 years, Brazil will be exporting throughout the world food produced in the cerrado,\" predicted Norman Borlaug, 81, the American agricultural scientist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for research that helped bring about Asia's \"Green Revolution.\" **********Over the last 25 years, grain production in the cerrado has quadrupled to 20 million tons. And farmers only till 15 percent of the arable land in a region with an area equal to that of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain combined. **********\"I could never have done this back in the States,\" said Mr. Ferrell, a straightforward man who monitors truck weights from a gauge in his farmhouse kitchen. \"Last year, I bought a grain dryer. This year, I'm putting in the two storage bins.\" **********As a North American pioneer in a South American wilderness, Mr. Ferrell played it safe by buying a farm next door to 100 American Mennonite farmers in Rio Verde. **********\"People used to be kind of rough around here,\" he recalled of his first visit to Goias state in the 1970's. \"You know -- if you don't like 'em, shoot 'em -- that kind of thing.\" **********Posting a farm sign, a plow disk inscribed \"Filadelphia Ranch,\" Mr. Ferrell started farming surrounded by peace-loving neighbors with names like Koehn, Hibner, Mininger and Warkentin. He has seen his land values increase fivefold from the $100 an acre he and his father paid for their initial stake in 1981. **********\"I have been planting for 13 years, and I have never had a crop failure,\" Mr. Ferrell said. \"Some of the Mennonites have been here almost 30 years and they have never had a crop failure.\" **********With land fertile and cheap, and dependable rains, soy is grown more cheaply in Brazil's midwest than in the American Midwest. But there are considerable obstacles. **********\"We have a lot of trouble with transportation -- we are awful far from the ports,\" Mr. Ferrell said, referring to the Atlantic port of Santos, 600 miles southeast of here. Because of poorly maintained highways, a ton of Brazilian soy arrives at Santos costing more than a ton of American soy costs in New Orleans. **********Like farmers everywhere, Mr. Ferrell has little use for the flash of big cities. For their annual trip to the States, his family drives five hours to Brasilia, to catch a flight north. **********\"I went to Rio once, on my honeymoon,\" he said, referring to Rio de Janeiro, a beach metropolis viewed by many rural Brazilians as their country's sin city. \"They stole my pickup truck.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/16/world/returning-tutsi-herders-add-to-rwanda-s-strains.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1995-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1052, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Returning Tutsi Herders Add to Rwanda's Strains", "print_headline": "Returning Tutsi Herders Add to Rwanda's Strains", "body_text": " **********\"On this road, wildlife is a priority,\" reads a huge billboard at the entrance of Akagera National Park. But not a single zebra or gazelle is to be seen on the paved road that winds for miles along the park border to the rolling savannah -- just two cranes hiding behind a bush. **********Instead, the hills and plains are dotted brown with long-horned cattle -- hundreds of thousands inching across the tawny grass, prodded by dogs and young boys with sticks. **********The cattle herds have arrived from Uganda in recent months with their owners, ethnic Tutsi who have lived in exile since fleeing massacres in Rwanda in 1959. These families have been returning since a rebel force dominated by the Tutsi minority came to power in Rwanda last summer. **********For decades, the struggle for arable land contributed to ethnic hatred between the Tutsi and the majority Hutu. Again and again, Hutu and Tutsi refugee groups have moved across borders, abandoning land to the other ethnic group until another ethnic uprising reversed the cycle. **********With arable land at a premium, the Government of this tiny, densely populated country has had little choice but to let returning families settle on this arid savannah bordering the 925-square-mile park. **********If it looks like an idyllic grazing area now, the area will soon bear all the signs of a catastrophe, Western relief officials warn. As the influx has gathered momentum in the past month, the herds have advanced 15 to 20 miles into the park, threatening its fragile ecosystem and pushing many of the wild animals into neighboring Tanzania. **********Alternating between swamp, savannah, forest, valleys and hills, Akagera National Park's remarkable topography has fed a diverse ecosystem of wildlife, from lions and leopards to gazelles, giraffes, elephants and birds. Herders say their cattle have been attacked by lions. **********More than 250,000 people and 700,000 head of cattle are now grazing in the Domaine de Chasse, a 130-square-mile hunting area bordering the park. **********Dry and infertile, this land can only support one-tenth of the present cattle population, wildlife officials say. Already it is infested with tse-tse flies, hoof and mouth disease and many other threats to the animals. And when the rains end next month, the water holes and the savannah will dry up, and the cattle will begin dying, Rwandan Government and relief officials say. **********There are no easy solutions. No arable land is available for these Rwandans, and the Government lacks the money to provide the basic services to support them here. Most are living in thatched huts covered by bright blue plastic tarpaulins issued by the United Nations. **********The returnees do not want to go back to Uganda, and the n Government there does not want them back. **********One idea would be to start slaughtering the cattle now and sell their meat. But there are no slaughterhouses here in Nyagatare, and no way to transport the meat. In any case, the herders are pastoralists whose culture is based on their cattle, and they are resisting efforts to cull their herds. **********\"Eventually the cows will be dying in thousands,\" said Chris Kille Kigezo, a Rwandan field assistant for the World Food Program whose own family fled to Uganda in 1959. \"Here everything is seen in cows. A man would rather have five sick cows than three healthy ones. Cows are the center of life.\" **********Their dilemma is a reminder that land shortages are one of the biggest problems facing Rwanda's leaders. **********Reintegrating the more than one million Tutsi who fled to Burundi, Uganda and Zaire in 1959 and have now returned with some two million Hutu who fled the advancing Tutsi rebel army last summer is the immediate challenge for the Rwandan Government. **********Sixty percent of the houses in the capital, Kigali, are still occupied by Rwandans who moved in after the city fell to the Tutsi army in July, officials say. The Government has said the previous owners can reclaim their houses, but residents are resisting, and for now there is no legal remedy for the dispossessed. **********With one-seventh of Rwanda's territory consisting of national parkland, the Government has begun to resettle some returnees in forests previously used by the military and in the Akagera hunting area. The Government acknowledges that the influx threatens the land and wildlife but insists that any delay in resettling people will only aggravate tensions. Ultimately, they say, the park might well be a necessary victim. **********\"We are saying this is a mother to all the problems,\" said Christine Umutoni, the Deputy Minister of Rehabilitation and Reintegration. \"It is very urgent to resolve if we are to avoid other social clashes. Our objective is not to destroy the park but to resettle people. We might be forced to use the park. **********\"It is not easy to settle people in virgin areas,\" she added. \"We need money for roads and water.\" **********The northern section of Akagera National Park was a front line during the civil war, and the border remains heavily mined -- another problem for the returnees. The park is still closed to tourism, and the main hotel is a military base. **********The Rwandan Government has begun a campaign to convince the pastoralists to cull their herds in exchange for larger plots of land. If there was a big slaughterhouse and a way to transport frozen beef, that might prove a success. The rest of Rwanda has hardly any cattle, and the Government is thinking about using some of the beef to feed the army. **********The beef could also be exported to Burundi and to Uganda. Since the Rwandan Tutsi started leaving Uganda with their herds, the price of meat in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, has more than doubled, relief officials note. **********For the moment, the problem is startup money. **********One 20-year-old returnee, Alex Nkubana, each day herds his 20 cattle and about 50 others belonging to friends to the nearest river, walking one and a half hours each way. **********\"The problems will start when the rains finish and the grass dies,\" he said. \"We will have to move our home and follow the water.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/28/business/philip-morris-annual-meeting-snubs-protests.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1995-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Annual Meeting Snubs Protests", "print_headline": "Philip Morris Annual Meeting Snubs Protests", "body_text": " **********At an often combative annual meeting of the Philip Morris Companies that was a magnet for anti-tobacco activists who tried to transform the proceedings into a cigarette circus, stockholders voted overwhelmingly today to elect management's slate of 14 directors. The victory trounced a symbolic protest vote that had been spearheaded by some of the company's large institutional shareholders. **********In addition, voters rejected by a wide margin six shareholder proposals that had been opposed by Philip Morris management. **********It was a showcase for a new, publicly confrontational, Geoffrey C. Bible, who ran his first annual meeting as the company's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Bible, keeping the two-hour meeting under firm control from the podium, not only used the opportunity to try to reassure investors about legal and regulatory challenges to tobacco, but also inveighed against \"plaintiff lawyers looking for clients, and for new ways of lining their purses.\" **********The company produces popular cigarette brands, including Marlboro and Virginia Slims, as well as food and beverage brands including Miller beer, Maxwell House coffee and Post cereal. **********An optimistic presentation by Mr. Bible was met with often hostile questions at the meeting, involving inquiries about the potential of risk for tobacco investors. Such concerns have spurred a battle with the pension funds, and are likely to keep doing so. **********\"We are going to keep close tabs on how the directors will be acting next year,\" said Anne Hansen, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of 100 pension funds whose assets exceed $800 billion. She called it \"gratifying\" that nearly a quarter of the shareholders voting had supported a resolution to scrutinize the pensions paid for outside directors. **********The council's largest member is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, the nation's biggest public pension fund and the largest institutional shareholder of Philip Morris among the public funds, with $365 million worth of stock. **********Its deputy executive director, Richard H. Koppes, led the movement to reject the company's slate of directors as a symbolic protest against Philip Morris's refusal to schedule a meeting between outside directors and institutional shareholders. **********But the company's choices for the 14-member board were resoundingly approved by 96 percent of the shareholders voting. \"Our purpose was to send a message,\" Mr. Koppes said in a telephone interview, \"and I hope we did.\" **********The company has, in fact, attempted to mend its shareholder fences. After several representatives of the big public funds walked out of a Manhattan meeting with management and several outside directors last September, DeDe Bartlett, the company's corporate secretary, was reassigned, and G. Penn Holsenbeck, a lawyer, replaced her. Fund managers say he has been trying to smooth relationships by visiting larger investors to hear their concerns. **********Industry executives say the board has been divided in its discussions of an appropriate response to the protesting shareholders. According to executives outside the company, the Philip Morris management has even offered a lucrative corporate-governance job to Mr. Koppes of Calpers, who turned it down. He and company spokesmen declined comment, and another spokesman for Philip Morris declined to answer questions about its board. **********During the meeting, members of Infact, an anti-tobacco group, held up pictures of people they said had died from smoking-related illnesses, and also presented 720 arriving shareholders with a spectacle: 22 protesters holding a 100-foot-long \"tobacco wall.\" It was a banner displaying photographs of \"cigarette victims and their families,\" a spokeswoman said, outside the company's sprawling manufacturing center here on Commerce Road. **********The tobacco opponents also made much of an impromptu remark by Mr. Bible that \"it would be sensible for pregnant women not to smoke.\" **********He made the comment in response to a question from Dr. Lori D. Karan, an assistant professor at the Medical College of Virginia, who asked, \"If your wife or daughter was pregnant, would you want her to smoke?\" **********It was \"the first time a tobacco company chief executive has admitted that there is a health problem with one group of smokers,\" said one of those at the meeting, the Rev. Michael Crosby, coordinator for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in Manhattan. \"He's opened the door to a Pandora's box of more and more litigation.\" **********Company spokesmen played down Mr. Bible's statement, saying tobacco manufacturers had long said that pregnant women concerned about smoking should consult their doctors. **********\"For years there has been a warning on cigarette packs that smoking 'may complicate pregnancy,' \" said Steven C. Parrish, who was named by the board today as Philip Morris's head of corporate affairs. **********News of the statement may have concerned Wall Street, as shares of Philip Morris edged down 12.5 cents to close at $67.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The annual meeting was held in a friendly hometown auditorium equipped with soft maroon seats fitted with chrome ashtrays for the numerous smoker-stockholders in the audience. **********The meeting would ordinarily have been an occasion for dignified self-congratulation, since it took place only a week after the company had announced strong first-quarter gains in sales and market share.

It buys bills from the previous day's prescription sales at a slight discount, paying the pharmacist immediately and eliminating weeks of cash flow delays for drugstores. The Pharmacy Fund then collects from the health plans. **********Consumers with plastic cards that identify them as members of a health plan that pays all or part of a prescription now purchase roughly half the $40 billion in prescription drugs sold each year. As more drugs are paid for by third parties rather than by the customer standing across the counter, problems with slow and incomplete payments have become a $100 million headache for the nation's more than 50,000 pharmacies. **********While millions of other merchants are paid within days after credit card sales are approved by the bank that issues the card, pharmacists and others in the health care business are forced to endure long delays. The computer links connecting health plans and pharmacists are used to approve the dispensing of drugs, but not to speed payments. So, if the quick payment method catches on with drugstores, the owners of the Pharmacy Fund also hope to apply it to doctors, dentists and even hospitals. **********For now, the company -- founded by Fred B. Tartar, owner of the largest newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Vocero, and Jeffrey M. Green, the former head of a Citibank business that hoped to track consumer purchases and sell the information -- is operating a pilot project with about 100 pharmacies. **********But the company has partners with deep pockets -- a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance last year invested $5 million for a 5 percent ownership stake -- and Smith Barney is nearing completion of a private sale of $75 million of three-year notes. By June 1, Mr. Tarter said, the company plans to take on new customers. **********Small pharmacies, struggling to compete with the big chains that buy large quantities of prescription drugs at bargain-basement prices, are particularly vulnerable to the late payments and frequent errors that plague the industry. **********\"It used to take an average of 30 to 45 days to collect, and that tied up a ton of our money,\" said Louis J. Giannotti, the director of the pharmacy division at the Mayfair food store chain in Elizabeth, N.J. Now that the Pharmacy Fund makes it possible for him to collect only a day after a prescription is filled, \"a lot of the smaller chains like us have more ability to compete for contracts and take advantage of special merchandise offerings.\" **********There are other advantages for pharmacists in the accelerated payment system. Roger Malerba, owner of the Hylan Medicine Cabinet on Staten Island, said it was now easy to match, using his computer, the payments received from Pharmacy Fund with the prescriptions dispensed the previous day. When payment and paper printouts of drug sales were received weeks later, that accounting often kept two employees busy nearly full time. **********For the two or three of every 100 prescriptions that involves some problem, Pharmacy Fund reviews records to correct clerical mistakes. The remaining problems, such as large prescriptions of several hundred dollars or more that are not approved for payment because they are placed under review, the Pharmacy Fund does not advance funds to drugstores. But its computerized record system enables pharmacists to spot problems quickly so they can work to overcome them. **********Another aggravation for drugstores is the \"shrinkage\" that occurs when a pharmacy is paid less than it is entitled. Pharmacists usually just throw up their hands in despair at tracking down the cause and getting it corrected. **********\"You see lots of little discrepancies for 50 cents or a few dollars and I don't know any store owner who wouldn't consider them paid,\" Mr. Malerba said. \"You would spend more money chasing them down than it is worth.\" **********The payment plans that stand between pharmacists and insurers or managed care providers operate outside the regulated insurance industry. They range from giants like PCS, which was bought last year by Eli Lilly for $4 billion, to hundreds of small companies with little more than a few computers and a modem. **********PCS says it pays pharmacists within 14 days. But many health plans and the companies they hire to handle pharmacy bills take far longer. Mr. Greene said the Illinois Medicaid plan, for example, typically took 100 days to pay. Others may pay most bills in a few weeks, but hold up expensive prescriptions for a review that could last weeks. **********And then there are the claims that never get paid. Prescription Drugs Inc., a pharmacy plan administrator in Maryland, for example, went out of business in 1993, owing Rite Aid more than $929,000. **********To avoid such losses, Pharmacy Fund does its own evaluation of delays and risk of default at 3,500 insurers and health plans. It charges higher fees to pharmacies whose business depends more heavily on risky health plans; less for more reliable bill payers. On average, the Pharmacy Fund fee is 2 percent what the drugstore is owed. **********Mr. Tartar concedes that his idea could be imitated, but he says that would-be competitors should find it hard to catch up. Not only has Pharmacy Fund arranged financing through Smith Barney, but it also has an exclusive arrangement with the National Data Corporation, the Atlanta-based company with computer links to 48,000 drugstores that account for 70 percent of the electronic messages between drugstores and pharmacy payment plans. **********\"We can't take our business to anybody but National Data,\" Mr. Tartar said, \"and they can't handle other customers competing in our business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/13/world/serb-says-files-link-milosevic-to-war-crimes.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serb Says Files Link Milosevic To War Crimes", "print_headline": "Serb Says Files Link Milosevic To War Crimes", "body_text": " **********As Western governments seek to turn President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia into a peacemaker, a former senior member of the Serbian secret police has come forward with documents that could incriminate Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal. **********The former agent, Cedomir Mihailovic, 45, escaped from Serbia last October with a temporary passport provided by the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade, where officials believed his life was in danger. **********One document, dated May 24, 1992, appears to include directions from the Serbian state security services in Belgrade on running concentration camps in Bosnia. At that time, tens of thousands of Muslim civilians were already being tortured and sometimes killed in the camps, and the Milosevic government was beginning to deny active involvement in the conflict in Bosnia. **********\"It is urgently necessary to reduce the number of camps and to concentrate on two to three camps,\" says the order, which bears a signature of the head of state security at the Serbian Interior Ministry and is addressed to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. **********Another document includes orders from the state security services, which are in almost daily contact with Mr. Milosevic, to the Serbian paramilitary leader known as Arkan about the \"ethnic cleansing\" of the Bosnian town of Bijeljina and the killing of some Muslims there. **********In a dozen interviews, in which his accounts were consistent, Mr. Mihailovic presented a view from inside of the Milosevic government diametrically opposed to the Serbian political leaders' explanations of how 750,000 Muslims came to leave the 70 percent of Bosnia now controlled by Serbs. **********The Serbian President has always denied any such responsibility and has progressively sought to distance himself from the Bosnian war. He and Dr. Karadzic have claimed that Serbian militias may have done terrible things to Muslim civilians, but the forces were under no political direction and were responding to Muslim provocation, they add. **********No final word exists on the authenticity of the documents. \"The documents look pretty good, but we are not ready to give a final judgment that they are authentic,\" a senior United States official in Washington said after showing copies to the Central Intelligence Agency. **********The documents were delivered last October to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, and examined by the court and then by the Dutch internal security services, only to disappear. **********Those mysterious dealings between the tribunal and the Dutch agency might suggest concern by Western governments about the documents' possible effect at a time when President Milosevic stands center stage in international negotiations to end the war in Bosnia. **********\"If the originals have disappeared, there must be sufficient concern about their possible veracity for somebody in Western governments not to want them waved around in public,\" said an American official familiar with the case. The Documents Killings Ordered From the Top? **********On Oct. 6, 1994, the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade issued a temporary passport to Mr. Mihailovic, a former senior member of the Serbian secret police who said he possessed documents incriminating President Milosevic in war crimes in Bosnia. **********The decision to give him a Dutch passport was unusual, reflecting the embassy staff's conviction that he might be killed by the Serbian secret services he had just deserted. **********On Oct. 10, Hubertus van Schip, the administrative officer in the Dutch Embassy, traveled to the Macedonian capital, Skopje, where he met Mr. Mihailovic. They picked up the incriminating papers at Invest Bank, where, Mr. Mihailovic said, he had deposited them in a safe. **********Mr. Mihailovic and Mr. van Schip then took the documents to a Skopje pizzeria, where they were given to a United Nations official for dispatch to the International Tribunal in The Hague. **********\"We did not feel it appropriate that such sensitive documents should travel by diplomatic pouch, so we contacted the United Nations,\" a Dutch official said. **********If authentic, the documents are explosive. The five most sensitive include the one dated May 24, 1992, that appears to issue directions from the Serbian state security services in Belgrade on running concentration camps in Bosnia. It says 10 agents were to be sent from Belgrade to \"be distributed as prisoners in camps and prisons on your territory.\" These agents apparently would have gathered intelligence for the Serbs. **********That order, marked \"State Secret\" and carrying \"top secret number 778-11-3588-V-78/5-92,\" adds that six other agents were to work with the Bosnian Serb authorities to check prisoners' identities and select those to be transferred from Bosnia to Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia. **********Regarding the decision to reduce the number of camps, it says, \"Based on the findings of our services, there are indications that Western intelligence services may have passed information on the existence of the camps to their media so they may be exposed.\" **********Another document, dated April 3, 1992, and bearing \"top secret number 675-11-428-V-8/4-92,\" purports to be an order from the same state security section of the Serbian Interior Ministry to the Serbian paramilitary commander known as Arkan. It concerns the eviction and killing of Muslims in the Bijeljina, which was \"cleansed\" of Muslims at the start of the war. **********It says: \"The leadership of the S.D.A., Muslim members of MUP and the organizers of Muslim paramilitary formations should be arrested and transferred to Erdut. **********\"In order to frighten the Muslim population, a smaller number should be executed.\" **********The S.D.A. is the Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action of President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, and MUP is an acronym for the Bosnian Interior Ministry police. Erdut, a Croatian town captured by the Serbs in 1991, is the headquarters of Arkan, whose real name is Zeljko Raznatovic. **********As Serbian militia leaders rampaged in Bosnia, they grew rich. How they did so is suggested in another of the documents. Dating from Nov. 19, 1991, this order from Sector V includes instructions to Arkan on what to do with booty seized from the fall of Vukovar. **********\"For the needs of the unit, keep 2,500,000 German marks and 15 kilograms of gold,\" it says. \"3,876,000 German marks, 375,780 dollars, 430,600 Swiss francs and 38 kilograms of gold will be taken by our agents in Erdut. **********\"All the fighters who have taken part in cleansing have to be searched and everything not belonging to them should be taken away.\" **********Mr. Mihailovic said he was one of the S.D.B. agents who went to Erdut at that time to collect money. Hooded prisoners were being killed with arrows fired from bows by Arkan's forces, he said. He shook his head. **********\"After a while, it's not just Croats,\" he said. \"It's not just Muslims. You see your own friends being killed for dirty reasons, and you can't stand it anymore.\" The Defector An Agent's View From Belgrade **********Nobody contests that Mr. Mihailovic held an influential position in the Serbian secret services, where he held identity number MUP 2675 and worked from 1991 until September 1994. **********American officials, and the chief prosecutor and his deputy at the United Nations Tribunal -- Justices Richard Goldstone and Graham Blewitt -- all agreed that Mr. Mihailovic had indeed worked as a Serbian agent. He was engaged principally in the financing of the Serbian war effort through Cyprus and the circumvention of an international trade embargo by dealing arms through Ukraine and elsewhere. **********Mr. Mihailovic said the initial Serbian onslaught on Bosnian Muslims, and the earlier attack on Vukovar, in eastern Croatia, were directed through President Milosevic's handpicked agents at the Center of the Department of State Security, in the Interior Ministry. This department was known in the former Yugoslavia as the Sluzba Drzave Bezbednosti, or S.D.B. **********The S.D.B. agents, Mr. Mihailovic said, trained, paid and issued orders to Serbian militia leaders like Arkan. These militiamen in turn terrorized the Muslims and so set \"ethnic cleansing\" in motion in Bosnia. **********\"From the beginning, Milosevic wanted his people in the S.D.B. to be the channels for Greater Serbia,\" said Mr. Mihailovic, who speaks good English. \"Unlike the army, this was Milosevic's handpicked apparatus, and he wanted the minimum of people to know. By using paramilitary groups, the appearance of disorder in Bosnia could be maintained.\" **********Under Mr. Milosevic, the Serbian police force has grown to about 130,000 people. Those who work for the S.D.B., and particularly Sector V, which deals with intelligence and counterintelligence, are the elite. **********\"The S.D.B. Sector V supplied the weapons and the training for the militias,\" Mr. Mihailovic said. \"Arkan himself was on the S.D.B. payroll from 1986, as a killer in the West able to obtain a passport in whatever name he wanted.\" The militias included the Serbian Volunteer Guard, nicknamed the Tigers, run by Arkan, and the Kninjas of Dragan Vasiljkovic (Captain Dragan). **********Mr. Mihailovic identified Jovica Stanisic, the overall head of the S.D.B. and a man who was heavily involved in Serbia's onslaught on Vukovar in 1991, as the most important official in the Serbian operation. Mr. Stanisic is the nacelnik, or chief, whose signature is on some of the documents, all of which emanate from Sector V of the S.D.B. **********Western diplomats in Belgrade said Mr. Stanisic speaks to Mr. Milosevic almost daily. **********Because the possession of top-secret documents of the kind Mr. Mihailovic claims to have is punishable by imprisonment in Serbia, it was impossible to present the papers for comment to the Serbian government or to the people named by Mr. Mihailovic. The Authenticity The Originals Have Disappeared **********The documents were delivered to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, which was established in 1993 to try people accused of war crimes. They were examined by the court and then by the internal security services, but have not been seen since. **********\"The formats are accurate, but we are hesitant to say they are real because the documents could be reconstructions of things Mr. Mihailovic did see,\" said a senior American official in Washington who has seen copies of the documents. The official, who plays a central role in the formulation of the Administration's Balkan policy, added, \"What seems clear is that the guy was in a position to know this information.\" **********One senior court official said one of the documents \"does not appear to be what it purports to be.\" The official would not say which of the documents or why, and no court official in The Hague was prepared to produce the results of forensic tests on the documents. **********In what seems to be a case of negligence or malfeasance, the original documents were lost in murky transactions between the tribunal and the Dutch secret services, for whom Mr. Mihailovic was put to work for several months. **********On Oct. 17, 1994, according to a statement from Justice Goldstone, the head of the tribunal, questioning of Mr. Mihailovic began in The Hague. This interrogation went on \"over a period of weeks\" while Mr. Mihailovic was housed at the court's expense. **********On Nov. 18, 1994, Simon Leach, the investigator on the Mihailovic case, acknowledged receipt of the documents in a letter and stated, \"The originals will be returned to Mr. Mihailovic or his agent in the near future.\" **********Instead, Mr. Leach said in a telephone interview, the documents were passed on to the Dutch internal security services, which took charge of Mr. Mihailovic after Dec. 1, 1994. Mr. Leach said that after that date he did not know where Mr. Mihailovic was and so could not return the documents directly to him. **********Justice Goldstone said that after Mr. Mihailovic came under the supervision of the \"Dutch authorities,\" the tribunal received a request from them saying Mr. Mihailovic required the original documents. **********\"These documents were in turn handed to the Dutch authorities in separate bundles on 12th January 1995 and 20th January 1995,\" Justice Goldstone wrote. **********And what did the Dutch secret services do with the original documents? **********Justice Goldstone, after repeated questioning, forwarded a copy of the receipt that the Dutch secret services say they obtained when handing back the documents to Mr. Mihailovic. That receipt is undated and faintly signed on a blank piece of paper. **********Shown the receipt, Mr. Mihailovic said: \"I have never seen this piece of paper, never signed it and never received my documents back. They are afraid because they know the documents are 100 percent genuine. Why on earth would I conceal the original documents if I had them?\" **********In a telephone conversation on March 20 between Mr. Leach and Mr. Mihailovic, Mr. Leach promised \"to do everything I can\" to return the documents. **********Yet, according to the tribunal, the documents had been handed back in January, two months earlier. It was only on April 4 that Judge Goldstone produced the \"receipt\" from the Dutch secret services. **********Mr. de Vries, the Dutch Interior Ministry spokesman, said, \"I can confirm that the Dutch authorities returned the documents.\" Asked if it was not unusual that a service of a Dutch ministry would issue an undated receipt, Mr. de Vries said, \"It could happen.\" The Fallout A Message No One Wanted to Hear **********Mr. Mihailovic's story -- of intrigue and arms smuggling -- clearly led the tribunal to view him with circumspection, possibly even as a double agent sent to provoke the court into action that could later be ridiculed. **********But in the interviews, Mr. Mihailovic presented a generally convincing picture of a man with a message nobody wants to hear. **********His flight from Serbia, he said, followed the killing in Zvornik, in northeastern Bosnia, of a close friend, Risto Djogo, the head of Bosnian Serb television in Pale, the headquarters of the Serbs in Bosnia. **********The killers have never been found. But Mr. Mihailovic said the killing, which took place on Sept. 10, was the work of Arkan's Tigers militia, which was in Zvornik on the night of Sept. 9 for a concert by the Serbian singer Ceca, who later married Arkan. **********For more than a month before his death, Mr. Djogo had been mocking Mr. Milosevic on Pale television for his decision in August to blockade the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to sign an international peace accord. **********Mr. Djogo and Mr. Mihailovic had also been jointly collecting videos and documents, some already deposited in the Skopje bank, that they thought might one day incriminate Mr. Milosevic. **********Most of the documents came from a childhood acquaintance in the security services who is the chief of the archive and had financial difficulties, Mr. Mihailovic said. He identified the acquaintance as Zoran Vukelic, and said he paid him the equivalent of more than $7,000. **********Mr. Mihailovic said he believes that before Mr. Djogo was killed, he was tortured and spoke of their collaboration. **********Mr. Mihailovic's apartment at Omladinskih Brigada 208 in Belgrade was raided by the Serbian security services on Sept. 11. A private and diplomatic passport and the equivalent of more than $1.3 million in cash were taken, according to a report of the raid Mr. Mihailovic said he obtained from Mr. Vukelic. **********The raiders did not capture Mr. Mihailovic because he was already in hiding. He quickly approached the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade. \"Deeply in my heart I believed in the United Nations tribunal,\" he said. \"This was my main reason to go to the Dutch rather than the Americans.\" **********Mr. Mihailovic explained his decision to go public as stemming from deep frustration at his treatment by the United Nations tribunal and later by the Dutch secret services. **********From Dec. 1, 1994, until he fled the Netherlands in March, these Dutch services provided Mr. Mihailovic with an apartment in the hope of gaining intelligence on the Serbs, Mr. Mihailovic and several officials in the Netherlands said. **********The only complaints Mr. Mihailovic heard about the documents from Mr. Leach, the investigator, were that they appeared to have been typed on the same typewriter and were not in the Cyrillic script now increasingly used in Serbia. But official documents from the 1991-93 period were mainly typed in the Latin script, several Serbian officials said. **********Some questions were also raised about the timing of the Bijeljina document in that by April 3, 1992, some parts of the town were already under Arkan's control. **********Mr. Mihailovic offered on several occasion to take lie-detector tests, but the offer was declined. **********Paul de Vries, a spokesman for the Dutch Interior Ministry, confirmed that \"Dutch authorities\" had dealt with Mr. Mihailovic. Bert Ten Wolde, the Dutch agent in charge of Mr. Mihailovic, did not return several calls. **********On March 9, after concluding he had no future in the Netherlands, Mr. Mihailovic left and went into hiding with his wife, Tatjana, and their 1-year-old daughter. He lives in the tiny apartment of a distant cousin. **********Mr. Mihailovic says he wants to get to the United States, where his son by a first marriage lives on Long Island. He says he is broke and feeding his little girl on Red Cross milk."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-019095.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1995-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Harvey Electronics, Secaucus, N.J., to J.

The switch can be costly for the funds as well as investors because it can send them lower in the closely watched fund rankings, she explains. In Kiplinger's list of top money funds, for example, the Benham Prime fund sank to ninth place among taxable money funds, after having held the top spot for six consecutive months. **********The article also reports on the status of fee waivers at several top-ranking funds. The Strong money market fund will guarantee its waiver just to June 1, for example, while Olde Premium Plus says it will continue its waiver until 1997. **********Elsewhere in Kiplinger's: Bargains are the watchword for the success of the Twentieth Century Value fund, according to Steven T. Goldberg. Sears, Roebuck, Union Pacific and Dillard Department Stores are among the top holdings of the fund, which buys companies whose managers have been scorned. The reasoning? \"Management is considered no damn good when things are difficult,\" and when that conclusion is wrong a bargain is in the making.  Dan Moreau and Marc L. Schulhof take a look at the Chubb Corporation, one of the property and casualty insurers that have been gravely threatened by the many earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and other disasters of the last decade.

Ratko Mladic, the commander of the military. **********\"We feel betrayed by everyone,\" said a 35-year-old soldier who was home from the front for a five-day break. \"Karadzic is accusing Milosevic, Milosevic tarnishes Karadzic, and we are only the pawns in their game.\" **********Adding to the confusion is the spectacle of a cold-blooded public brawl between the once-unified Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic. Last week, Dr. Karadzic demoted the military chief, but when General Mladic refused to step aside and all 20 of his generals backed him, Dr. Karadzic unceremoniously reinstated him. **********Each has accused the other of being mad, said officials who were present while the accusations were flying. **********Dr. Karadzic, a psychiatrist by profession, said last week that General Mladic was certifiably crazy, an official who was present said. And General Mladic told Dr. Karadzic recently that he had \"spent too long with his patients,\" one of the general's aides said. **********What this demoralized spirit in the ranks and the cracks in the hierarchy will mean on the battlefield or at the negotiating table as the United States pursues new peace proposals is hard to discern. **********Dr. Karadzic said in an interview published on Saturday in the Bosnian Serb government newspaper Glas Srpski (Serbian Voice), \"I prefer that the international community spits at us while we win and we fulfill our aims than the international community pities us and spits at our enemies who, God forbid, would be winning.\" **********General Mladic, who was said by his supporters to be at the battlefront for the last two days, knew that public support for the war effort was very low, an aide said. **********The general will try to restore confidence by gaining a battlefield victory in the coming days, the aide said. When that is achieved, he said, General Mladic will settle his score with Dr. Karadzic. **********But while the two leaders were getting back to business as usual, at least publicly, the tone was completely different among the people in the cafes, restaurants and homes of Banja Luka. **********In this city, the site of some of the most vicious \"ethnic cleansing\" by the Bosnian Serbs, many Muslims and Croats have fled, leaving behind Bosnian Serbs very loyal to their cause. **********On the main street today, a jeep bore a grisly hood ornament -- a human skull with a blue United Nations helmet propped on top. **********But beneath such shows of defiance, there was plenty of evidence that faith in the war has been ruptured. **********A medical assistant who has worked in the surgery wards of the Bosnian Serb military field hospitals for the last four years said all his army colleagues and civilian friends in Banja Luka wanted the war to end immediately. **********\"If it's not over in a month, we've all said we are leaving and going away as far as possible -- to New Zealand,\" he said, showing badly bitten fingernails. \"Karadzic has no support; people turn off their television sets when they see him.\" **********An official who accepted the entreaties of Dr. Karadzic to come from Belgrade to help run a governmental department here said that he had set a deadline, Jan. 7, the day Serbian Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas. \"If the war is not finished by then, I will be out of here by the following Christmas,\" he said. **********The economy has crashed so badly, the official said, that the average wage in Banja Luka is now the equivalent of about $60 a month. The embargo imposed by President Milosevic on Serbian-held areas of Bosnia a year ago has worsened an already weak economy, the official said. Factories are at a standstill and jobs are scarce, he said. **********Apparently in response to the people's desire to leave -- an estimated 200,000 Bosnian Serbs have fled to Serbia since the war started -- Dr. Karadzic said in a speech in the town of Prijedor last week that further emigration would be banned. He criticized local Serbs who had smuggled themselves into the columns of refugees from Krajina who passed through Banja Luka on their way to Serbia. **********\"In the future, no one will go anywhere,\" Mr. Karadzic said. \"People must share the common destiny with their army.\" **********But soldiers, who a month ago were being told that the Bosnian Serb fighting machine was strong enough to take on NATO, were openly dispirited, and cited the failure of Serbia to intervene and help Serbs hold on to Krajina. **********\"The fall of Knin had catastrophic effects on the army,\" said a soldier, referring to the capital of Krajina. \"We are afraid we may be betrayed in the same way Knin was. Then we'll have no control over our destinies.\" **********Another soldier, asked if he was ready to accept a peace plan, said he would have voted to do so last year, but the leadership had told them to vote against it in a referendum.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, only a week after its parent, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Company, announced disappointing first-quarter earnings and declining tobacco sales. The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest maker of cigarettes, confirmed late in the day that it was matching the Reynolds price increase. **********David Adelman, a tobacco analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said yesterday that Brown & Williamson, the dominant American manufacturer of discount brands, had informed its distributors that it would increase prices by the same amount. He attributed the information to his father, Lawrence, also a tobacco analyst at Dean Witter. **********A spokesman for Brown & Williamson in Louisville, Ky., Tom Fitzgerald, said, \"We only discuss prices with our customers,\" declining to confirm Mr. Lawrence's report.

Reynolds price increase, the first since November 1993, when the company raised prices 4 percent, is effective immediately and affects all its premium and discount brands. The price rise is the company's second since \"Marlboro Friday\" in April 1993, when Philip Morris cut cigarette prices by 40 cents a pack in an effort to compete more aggressively against discount brands, and RJR Nabisco followed suit. **********\"Certainly the price increase will be beneficial to the Reynolds earnings,\" said Roy D. Burry, a securities analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. \"They couldn't raise their prices due to the health care debate in Washington, but now things have cooled off, and they feel they can increase their prices by this amount.\" **********He referred to calls by Democrats for health care legislation that would have included increased taxes on tobacco to pay for the proposed health benefits. With a Republican majority in Congress this year and the failure of the Clinton Administration's health care proposal, tobacco companies no longer fear a tax increase that would raise prices to consumers. **********R. J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest cigarette maker, also announced the resignation of James C. Schroer, its executive vice president for marketing and sales. \"I think this was inevitable, given the missteps the company has made over the last 9 to 12 months in their marketing programs,\" said Gary Black, a tobacco analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Mr. Schroer was second in command to the president and chief operating officer, Andrew Schindler. No successor has been named. **********\"Rather than cut prices to stunt share losses, RJR is more inclined to make management changes,\" Mr. Black said. **********Karen Daragan, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris USA, said the price increase was intended \"to help recover inflationary costs.\" It will affect the company's premium cigarettes like Marlboro, as well as its Basic and Cambridge discount brands. **********Mr. Burry of Oppenheimer referred to the tobacco industry as a \"price oligopoly, following the industry's restructuring, returning to the way it was before Marlboro Friday.\" **********Smokers may face another general price increase down the road as well. \"They usually raise prices around the middle of the year and then again at the end of the year,\" Mr. Burry said. Should there be another price rise \"that would be a total of more than 6.8 percent, too much of a price increase all at one time,\" he said. **********RJR announced its price increase early enough to affect the market, and Wall Street seemed to approve. RJR Nabisco was up 12.5 cents, closing at $28.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris closed at $71.50, up 87.5 cents. Its announcement came after the New York market had closed. **********The price increases by R. J. Reynolds amount to 3.4 percent a pack for the company's premium brands, or 3.7 percent including excise taxes, Mr. Black said. **********Brown & Williamson will benefit most from an increase, Mr. Burry said, since 3 cents a pack at wholesale amounts to a 4.9 increase on its principal discount brand, GPC. Another increase at the end of the year would mean close to a 10 percent price rise for the year. **********An increase of 3 cents a pack at the wholesale level could amount to a 6 percent rise for private-label manufacturers, Mr. Black said, adding that \"having the first price increase in 18 months is good for the industry.\" **********Nationally, the retail cost of premium brands averaged $2.25 before Marlboro Friday, $1.85 afterward, then $1.89 after the November 1993 increase. The cost, after yesterday's rise, will be $1.92. **********Mr. Adelman of Dean Witter said analysts would be watching to see how much of the price increase \"will stick.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/25/business/continuing-its-advance-dow-closes-at-4011.74.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continuing Its Advance, Dow Closes at 4,011.74", "print_headline": "Continuing Its Advance, Dow Closes at 4,011.74", "body_text": " **********Stocks reached record highs yesterday for a second consecutive session, led by rallies in food and beverage issues. **********The Dow Jones industrial average again closed above 4,000 points, rising 8.41, to 4,011.74.

But because her employers had helped provide for her medical insurance, she received good care, averted financial disaster and returned to work a week later. **********\"For me the insurance has been a really big deal,\" said Ms. Sullivan, who is 21 and works in Montclair, N.J. \"I'm still getting doctors' bills.\" **********Jenny Healy, a full-time nanny in Manhattan, also places a premium on health insurance and says she won't take a job without it. \"A lot of families I interviewed with were appalled by the idea that I would ask for insurance,\" said Ms. Healy, 22. \"When the people I now work for were willing to do it, it showed a commitment on their part. It was a big factor in my taking the job.\" **********Qualified caretakers increasingly make such a demand -- and eventually get it in what has become a competitive market for child care. Parents who cover at least part of the cost of medical insurance, which can be expensive, say the benefit helps instill a professional attitude in their nannies, with pleasant side effects like better child care and less turnover. **********\"All the better agencies urge employers to at least go 50-50 on medical insurance,\" said Mary Clurman of Apple Pie USA, a nanny placement agency in Princeton, N.J. \"It's a wonderful hiring tool.\" **********To be sure, these nannies are still in the minority. Most nannies do not get medical benefits from their employers -- even if those employers consider coverage an essential component of their own compensation. The Nanny News, a newsletter in Hopewell, N.J., asked its readers, both nannies and their employers, if the employer contributed some portion of the cost of the nanny's health insurance. Although the survey was not scientific, the newsletter found that about 1 in 4 employers paid some part and slightly more than 1 in 10 paid the full freight. According to people who specialize in household help, the cost typically ranges from 10 to 20 percent of the nanny's overall pay, though both salaries and insurance premiums vary widely. **********If employers do not chip in for insurance, nannies often find monthly premiums out of their reach and choose to go without a medical safety net. \"Very few people get insurance for their nannies,\" says Jane McIntosh, the editor of the newsletter. \"But they should understand that they're at risk if their nanny gets sick.\" **********For starters, parents might find themselves in the lurch for child care. Perhaps an even bigger concern is the well-being of someone who has become a member of the household. Cut off from friends and family, many live-in baby sitters turn to their employers in a medical emergency. **********Richard Eisenberg, an insurance broker in Newton, Mass., and the insurance representative of the International Nanny Association, described a client who bought insurance for his children's first two nannies, who never needed medical care. So he didn't insure the third nanny. When she complained of eye trouble, he referred her to his doctor. The doctor discovered a detached retina and sent her to the hospital for surgery; he assumed her employer would pay the bills, which came to $30,000. The employer, who had more than modest means, did pay them. **********Monetary considerations aside, health benefits can promote a certain stability and security in any workplace. Ms. Sullivan's employers, Liz Byrnes, a managing director at a bank, and her husband, Carey Africk, a marketing executive, considered insurance an obligation. \"My husband and I both have health insurance at our jobs, so we felt she should, too,\" said Ms. Byrnes, the mother of two girls, 5 and 7. \"I want her to feel she is respected and has a professional job.\" **********If Ms. Sullivan's life is running smoothly, the couple reason, she will also be better able to care for their children. \"I don't want her to have tons of bills and responsibilities and worries that would affect her work,\" Ms. Byrnes said. **********Hiring a nanny raises many thorny questions: Will she fit in with the household? Is she responsible? Can you afford to pay her $300 a week or more? How will you handle all the taxes and paperwork? There are so many issues that anything to stem turnover and foster a good working relationship is welcomed by some parents. \"My wife and I want to have confidence in the person taking care of our children,\" said Michael Gray, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston. \"Part of that confidence is that she's well. Our nanny shouldn't feel that she can't go to a doctor for strep throat because she doesn't have the money.\" **********For his nanny, Mr. Gray pays $180 a month for a preferred provider health plan from John Alden Life Insurance. His nanny can go to any doctor in the network for about $10 a visit or pay 30 percent of doctors' visits outside the network, after she has paid the $250 annual deductible. **********WHEN shopping for a nanny's insurance, cost is always a factor. In New York, New Jersey and a handful of other states, it can be particularly difficult. These states require insurers to use a community rating system, which means that the young and the old, the sick and the healthy all pay the same for individual insurance policies. **********Inexpensive policies for young nannies are not so hard to find elsewhere. In states without a community rating, Mr. Eisenberg said, young nannies should be able to get either major medical or preferred provider plans for $75 to $150 a month, depending on the city. In states with a community rating, he recommends turning to a health maintenance organization, which covers visits to doctors in its network. Otherwise, the monthly premium for a preferred provider or major medical policy can run $250 or more. **********Instead of choosing a policy for her, Ms. Sullivan's employers give her $100 a month toward medical insurance. Ms. Sullivan uses this toward the $136 a month for coverage on her mother's policy. **********A nanny coming from another state to New York or New Jersey should get insurance at home before she moves, Mr. Eisenberg added, because it will probably cost substantially less. Older nannies should probably stick with H.M.O.'s no matter where they live. \"For older people, an H.M.O. is great because everybody is charged the same rate,\" he said. **********In New York, H.M.O. coverage costs $160 to $200 a month for individuals. For $163 a month, Oxford Health Plan's Freedom Plan allows individuals to go to doctors in the network for a nominal fee, or it will pay 20 percent of the cost of visits to outside doctors. The Health Insurance Plan of New York, another H.M.O., costs about $200 a month. Because insurance brokers rarely want to bother with an individual plan, it's a good idea to call a company directly and request an information packet. **********Short-term plans are an inexpensive option, and typically cost half of what permanent plans do. They are not legal, though, in New York, New Jersey or a few other states. The Time Insurance Company of Milwaukee sells a short-term policy for $40 to $60 a month, depending on the city and the deductible. Administration Associates Inc. in Washington has a short-term plan specifically for nannies. It is available for three years or until age 35, whichever comes first. On this major medical policy, the annual premium is about $800. **********\"Short-term insurance is designed to take care of one major catastrophe, not to take care of a long-term health condition,\" Mr. Eisenberg said, \"because once you are sick, it's impossible to renew.\" **********FOR employers who don't want the paperwork problems that may come with a nanny -- quarterly state tax filings or health insurance forms -- Pacific Benefits of Salt Lake City will do it all. The company essentially puts the nanny on its own payroll and pays her salary, taxes and insurance for a fee. The company's insurance plans, developed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Utah, are rather inexpensive. For a New York nanny under 30, a standard policy with minimal coverage and a $300 annual deductible costs $139 a month. \"This is limited and reasonable coverage for people who find most health insurance too expensive,\" said Sidney Marion, who leads the company's underwriting group. The plan excludes maternity benefits and remains active only while the person works as a nanny, and for 90 days thereafter. **********Illegal aliens are another touchy subject.  Any foreigner can get coverage through global insurance companies, though some aliens may be wary about applying. WASA International Insurance of London offers a major medical plan costing about $1,520 a year for a 30-year-old. The insured has to pay a $1,000 deductible and receives up to $25,000 in maternity coverage. Routine doctors visits are not covered. **********Employers with a household staff of three or more can try to get a group rate for insurance. But business owners should avoid the common practice of sticking a nanny on the company payroll, financial advisers said. \"Telling the I.R.S. that your nanny works for your company when in fact she works in your house is illegal,\" said Alan Goldberg, president of Nanny Tax, a Manhattan company that handles payroll taxes for families with domestic help. \"It's tax evasion, because the presumption is it's a business expense when it's not.\" **********If a nanny is not on the payroll of a business, the employer is advised not to pretend she is for insurance purposes. \"We've seen a lot of problems with groups,\" said John Kelly, a spokesman for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. \"We check the tax records, so don't try to make a small group with a nanny and a few relatives.\" **********In most states, families with full-time nannies should be paying workers' compensation insurance, since many insurance policies won't cover injuries on the job. And it's wise to make sure the household has sufficient liability coverage, which can be bought inexpensively along with homeowner's insurance. Ms. Clurman of Apple Pie USA told of one couple whose nanny broke her leg while running down the stairs of their house. Since she was working illegally, she was not eligible for workers' compensation. And she had no health insurance. So she did the logical thing: she sued."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/world/world-news-briefs-bosnian-forces-battle-rebel-muslims.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; Bosnian Forces Battle Rebel Muslims", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; Bosnian Forces Battle Rebel Muslims", "body_text": " **********Government troops and the forces of a renegade Muslim leader fought today for control of Bosnia's northwestern Bihac enclave, ignoring a United Nations call for an immediate cease-fire. **********The fighting began at dawn when the rebels apparently launched an offensive to reclaim territory the Government forces had recently captured. **********Muslim-led Government troops are concentrated in the southern part of the enclave, around the town of Bihac.

Medical teams said 14 of the wounded were in critical condition. **********Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who immediately flew by helicopter to the scene of the blast, said, \"There is very strong suspicion of an attack.\" A police statement said later that an explosive device of \"several kilos\" was involved. **********So far, no group has taken responsibility for the explosion, but antiterrorist units were immediately sent to investigate. France is engaged in a number of conflicts that have the potential for violent reprisals, and speculation here tonight about possible attackers included groups involved in the fighting in Algeria or Bosnia. **********If it is confirmed that the attack was politically motivated, it will be the first case of large-scale terrorism here since pro-Iranian groups carried out a series of bombings in Paris in 1986 that killed 13 people and wounded more than 100. **********The bomb exploded at 5:30 P.M. local time inside a train from the suburban express system known as the R.E.R. while it was standing at the St.-Michel-Notre-Dame underground station on the Left Bank close to the Seine. French press reports quoted police sources as saying the device had been placed under a seat in one of the cars. **********Witnesses said they saw a flash followed immediately by a loud explosion. \"Black smoke began to come through the station and there was panic as people fled,\" said a young woman who escaped injury. A man who was also on the train said, \"People ran in all directions, but they weren't shouting.\" Another witness said the windows of the affected car were shattered by the blast. **********Witnesses also said that the train's doors were still closed when the bomb exploded, and most of victims appeared to have been standing or sitting nearby. While the police said the explosion was in the sixth of nine cars, however, several witnesses said it took place in the last car. All agreed that a fire followed. **********Within minutes, the area beside the bridge that crosses the Seine and leads to Notre Dame Cathedral was transformed from a sunny plaza filled with tourists sipping coffee in outdoor cafes to an emergency aid center packed with ambulances, fire trucks and the police. **********Lori Hodges, a visitor from Clio, Ala., said she was resting in a nearby hotel when she heard sirens. \"It was awful,\" she told The Associated Press. \"It makes me worry.\" **********Jacky Oneir, an employee at a nearby bookstore, said he saw \"six or seven people who were wounded, bleeding from their faces and legs.\" **********Firemen said that they quickly controlled the fire on the train, but that two passengers were trapped and could only be released two hours later. Medical teams also attended the most badly wounded at first-aid posts set up in the station. They said several victims had lost limbs. **********\"It's carnage in there,\" a fireman told reporters as he emerged from the station. **********Nearby, with the police screening off the area, dozens of passengers from the train could be seen undergoing treatment for minor injuries and shock. The most seriously wounded victims were taken to the hospital in helicopters that landed in front of Notre-Dame. The last victims were taken from the station three and a half hours after the explosion. **********Packed with bars, restaurants and movie theaters, the Left Bank area around St.-Michel is very popular with tourists and many were in the crowd watching rescue teams carry out the injured, but it was not known if any tourists were hurt in the bombing. No victims have yet been identified. **********The train, which was headed south toward St.-Remy-les-Chevreuse, a few miles outside the perimeter of the City of Paris, is normally crowded with commuters, carrying some 400,000 people to, from and within the city each day. Trains belonging to the R.E.R., the Reseau Express Regional, or Regional Express Network, are longer than normal subway cars and they travel faster and make fewer stops inside Paris. **********Their stations are also deeper than those used by the Paris metro system. At St.-Michel-Notre-Dame, passengers can change to the metro, although the St.-Michel subway stop is not immediately adjacent to the station where the blast took place. **********President Jacques Chirac as well as the Transport Minister, Bernard Pons, and the Mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, were among officials visiting the scene of the explosion, although only Prime Minister Juppe spoke to reporters, noting that presumptions of a bomb blast were \"very strong.\" **********The Interior Minister, Jean-Louis Debre, called the Government's antiterrorist advisory group to a meeting that lasted late into the night. Mr. Debre also ordered a reinforcement of security measures at Paris's two main airports, Orly and the Charles de Gaulle International Airport at Roissy. **********Tonight, Adm. Jacques Lanxade, Chief of Staff of the French armed forces, said it was too early to point the finger at any suspects, but French television immediately began speculating as to what groups might be motivated to carry out such an action. **********France has angered Algerian Islamic fundamentalist groups by clamping down on their support network in France. Algerian militants have pledged not to bring their war against Algeria's military Government onto French soil. But an Algerian religious leader and fundamentalist sympathizer was slain outside a Paris mosque earlier this month. **********France has also recently taken a strong stance against the latest Bosnian Serb offensive in Bosnia, although it did not win American and British support for its call for a buildup of United Nations troops in so-called \"safe areas\" of eastern Bosnia. **********Further, Mr. Chirac has angered several governments as well as worldwide environmental groups by deciding to resume France's nuclear testing in the Pacific. A French consulate in the Australian city of Perth was firebombed last month, apparently in reprisal for the planned tests, but most antinuclear protesters are pacifists. **********There was even speculation that the bombing could be linked to remnants of the group once headed by Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos, the Venezuelan-born international terrorist who was extradited from the Sudan to France last year to face trial for murder."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/15/business/company-news-paine-webber-is-said-to-be-considering-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAINE WEBBER IS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING JOB CUTS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PAINE WEBBER IS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING JOB CUTS", "body_text": " **********Paine Webber Group Inc. may eliminate as many as 500 jobs, or 3 percent of its total work force, in an effort to cut its compensation costs, traders at the brokerage firm said yesterday.

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has been hiring journalists to produce a section of its planned on-line service that will gather and package news for its computer users from a variety of electronic sources. **********Some members of the Internet group opposed the idea of permitting the Microsoft employee, John Callan, to join. Other members said they needed to know more about the news-gathering strategy of Microsoft. **********\"I think it's a fundamental issue for the journalism profession,\" said Bill Densmore, president of the Newshare Corporation, an electronic news publisher in Williamstown, Mass. \"This is about how we as independent observers maintain our independence in the face of the business interests of our employer.\" **********Executives at Microsoft say they have still not decided on the shape and content of their news service, which will include reports generated from traditional news suppliers like USA Today, but they insist that Microsoft employees will not be gathering or writing news directly. **********\"We have no plans to directly report the news,\" said Steven Ballmer, who works in the office of the president. He added that Microsoft had not hired anywhere near the 60 journalists that members of the Internet discussion group have asserted are part of the news service. **********Mr. Ballmer acknowledged, however, that there were important editorial decisions inherent in how and where news is displayed on a computer screen. **********He said the company was working on policies to govern the gathering and organizing of news and the handling of editorial material from outside providers. **********Microsoft, which is battling the Federal Government over a controversial antitrust suit, is certain to be watched carefully for any sign that the company is influencing the news coverage on the Microsoft Network. **********\"If they are going to have editors of professionally generated news, there will be questions,\" said Ben H. Bagdikian, a media critic and a former editor at The Washington Post. \"When you get a powerhouse like Microsoft and this kind of wide distribution to a high-demographic audience, lots of issues are raised.\" **********If Microsoft does become a news provider it will not set a precedent. NBC, for example, is owned by the General Electric Company. And the Prodigy Services Company is a joint venture of I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company. Prodigy uses professional editors to edit its news service, but the company has set up policies to prevent its owners and advertisers from influencing editorial decisions. **********Some of Microsoft's toughest rivals say they have decided on a strategy for providing electronic news that is different from the one used by Microsoft because they will maintain the independence of news-gathering organizations. **********\"There is no reason why I would want to compete with the people I'm going to provide technology to,\" said Farzad Dibachi, vice president of the new-media division of the Oracle Corporation. \"That is a stark contrast to Microsoft.\" **********Oracle is reported to be negotiating with the AT&T Corporation to offer a service that would permit many kinds of information vendors, including news providers like Reuters and CNN, to publish on an AT&T computer network. **********Mr. Dibachi said Oracle's strategy would be virtually identical to the company's current business practices, in which software is licensed to customers for a specified number of users. That is, Oracle plans simply to license the software to distribute the news, and thereby avoid the issue of editorial control over content providers. **********In contrast to Oracle, \"Microsoft's strategy is the same one which I.B.M. employed in the 1960's and 1970's,\" Mr. Dibachi said. \"They tell their customers, 'We'll do everything, don't you worry your pretty little head about a thing.' \" **********Mr. Bagdikian says he is also concerned about whether Microsoft can be trusted as a news provider. \"It's not being paranoid to ask if such a company that has goals of its own in public policy is a good entity to create news for the general public,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/24/world/israeli-premier-sees-no-alternative.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1995-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Premier Sees 'No Alternative'", "print_headline": "Israeli Premier Sees 'No Alternative'", "body_text": " **********Against a chorus of demands that he halt peace talks with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said tonight that he would not let negotiations be disrupted by a wave of Islamic suicide bombings, including the one on Sunday that killed 18 Israeli soldiers and a civilian. **********\"We shall continue on the path of peace -- there is no alternative,\" Mr. Rabin said in an unusual televised speech to a nation still reeling from one of the deadliest episodes in its history. \"We will achieve peace because that is the solution in the long run to the terrorist attacks.\" **********But despite his commitment to forge ahead, peace talks seemed to be frozen for now, with no clear sign of when they might resume. **********Israeli officials acknowledged that public confidence was badly battered by the attack on Sunday at a rural junction in central Israel, where one or more suicide bombers detonated two explosions near a bus stop crowded with soldiers traveling to their bases. **********This time, it was not just the rightist opposition that demanded a break in the talks, as it usually does after such incidents. Even a committed dove like President Ezer Weizman stretched the confines of his largely ceremonial position and, to Mr. Rabin's dismay, issued his own call for a suspension, an appeal echoed today in many newspaper commentaries and editorials. **********The fact that the Prime Minister went on the air tonight to speak directly to Israelis for nearly 15 minutes reflected his concern about plummeting support for the course he had charted with Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********\"We must break the cycle of hatred,\" he said. \"And we shall, so that we, as mothers and fathers, and I as a grandfather, will not have to mourn our beautiful children.\" **********The target of the explosions was a heavily trafficked transfer point for soldiers, especially on Sundays, when they are returning to duty after spending the Jewish Sabbath at home. The blasts hit hardest at young people in or near a snack bar, sending bodies flying through the air and slicing many of them to pieces. **********Altogether, according to updated police figures, 19 Israelis were killed, all but one of them men and women in uniform, and 65 others were wounded. About 30 people, again mostly soldiers, remained in several hospitals today, including 13 said to be in serious condition. **********Responsibility for the attack was taken by the group known as Islamic Holy War, which said it had been carried out by two Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and which warned today that its campaign \"will continue and will not stop.\" **********Israeli police officials said, however, that they had yet to determine if there was more than one bomber.  They said they were convinced that the attacker had carried explosives or strapped them to his body, based on the many body fragments found that clearly were not those of Israelis. Soldiers were easily identified because of the identity tags and uniforms, they said, but they added that they would need more time to determine whether more than one Palestinian was involved. **********Even before the bombing, the peace talks were in fragile condition, weakened by growing ill will and repeated disputes over rights to Jerusalem, Israel's expansion of West Bank settlements and mutual accusations of bad-faith bargaining. A question widely asked here today was how many more blows the negotiations could absorb. **********For Israelis, the acid test is whether they feel safer in their new partnership with the P.L.O. The answer for most is no, certainly not after a series of attacks inside Israel that have killed 54 of them and wounded nearly 200 others since last April. **********For Palestinians, the test is whether they feel Israel is sincere in wanting to expand their autonomy beyond Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho to include the entire West Bank. Given the fact that planned elections are more than six months overdue and Israeli troops have yet to budge in the West Bank, the answer for most of them, too, is no. **********If anything, their grievances mounted today when the Israeli Army put up roadblocks to keep more than 50,000 of them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza Strip for jobs in Israel. Such restrictions have become a standard Israeli response after major attacks, one aim being to keep the peoples apart until tempers cool. But Palestinians call it collective punishment, and some Israel officials acknowledge that it inflicts economic harm while doing little to improve security. **********On Sunday, the Government also suspended plans to free Palestinian prisoners and other measures intended to push the talks forward. **********Today, it demanded that Mr. Arafat extradite Gaza-based militants wanted by Israel and take other actions that would prove he is serious about forestalling attacks. It was not clear, though, if this was an Israeli condition for the resumption of talks. **********For his part, Mr. Rabin pledged a stronger fight of his own against \"lunatics\" who strike at Israel. \"The whole nation is an army, the whole country is a front line until we overcome this problem,\" he said. **********In Gaza, senior officials of Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority promised to take a tougher stand against militants, adding that this time they meant it -- tacit acknowledgment that past efforts were inadequate. **********\"Anyone with incriminating evidence of his responsibility or involvement will be held accountable,\" said Nabil Shaath, the P.L.O.'s chief negotiator with Israel. \"This time it will not be a show for two or three days.\" **********But at the same time, Palestinian officials protested that they could not be expected to stop all terrorists ready to commit suicide when Israel has itself failed, despite giving a looser rein to its security forces after the bus bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 22 passengers in October. **********Mr. Rabin acknowledged on Sunday that Israel now had to contend with \"a kind of terrorism we didn't face two or three years ago -- only in Lebanon.\" And with the Islamic Holy War and Hamas groups both threatening new attacks, other officials said that there may be no way to block them all. **********A big problem, some specialists said, is that the Israeli Army's withdrawal last May from Palestinian towns and refugee camps in Gaza has made it more difficult to infiltrate radical groups to gather intelligence. **********\"If you don't have precise advance information on the time and place where an attack will be carried out, you cannot prevent it,\" said Ron Ben-Yishai, a military writer for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. \"The suicide attacker and the planners will always find a soft spot.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/business/bond-prices-fall-on-fears-about-dollar.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 384, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Prices Fall on Fears About Dollar", "print_headline": "Bond Prices Fall on Fears About Dollar", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, as investors sold because of concern about the dollar and fear that the Federal Reserve might be forced to push up interest rates to support it. **********The Treasury confirmed in early trading that it was supporting the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and in some cases was acting with other central banks. **********A weaker dollar can accelerate inflationary pressures by making imported goods more expensive, and it can also make dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors who convert their returns into other currencies.

His speeches help sell his books and vice versa -- he's a walking, talking version of the success principles he lists in \"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive.\" **********At the moment, Mr. Mackay is swimming in a very profitable tide. Even in this day of electronic connections, the old-fashioned business of business speaking is booming. The number of business and trade conferences is growing, more people are becoming speakers, and fees are rising. While few industrywide numbers are available, most speakers bureaus -- companies that provide speakers to banquets, conferences and other corporate events -- report revenue growth of around 20 percent a year. **********The National Speakers Association, a trade group for professional speakers, has grown by 30 percent in the last five years to 4,000 members, most of whom speak to business groups. In the same period, the Conference Board, a global business-research group, has doubled the number of its conferences to more than 100 a year, requiring about 2,000 speakers. **********With the summer holidays behind it, corporate America is getting back to work -- and shopping around for speakers like Mr. Mackay to inspire the troops. \"The number of platforms available for business speakers has easily doubled in the last decade,\" said Robert Dilenschneider of the Dilenschneider Group, a public relations firm in New York. \"Everyone wants a speaker these days and when they sit around in meetings, they are all looking for the Norm Schwarzkopf of today,\" he added, referring to the retired Army general and Persian Gulf war hero. **********Mr. Schwarzkopf may add glitter. But when it comes to speakers with more corporate knowledge than marquee value, a review of their latest themes provides a window into the current mood of business. **********Today's public speakers have a more upbeat message for American business than the one they pitched just five years ago, specialists say. The emphasis has shifted from managing corporate cutbacks and revampings to coping with growth and changes. A recent survey by the National Speakers Association shows that two of the hottest new topics are finding opportunities in the global marketplace and developing strategies for the future -- nonexistent categories in a similar survey in 1990. **********\"Business wants to know what to do with the corporation now that it's re-engineered,\" said Robert Falcey, vice president for conferences at the Conference Board, referring to the popular term for cost-cutting. \"Re-engineering ground up business and took out the fat. Now businesses are having to start again and build anew.\" **********Gurus of the moment on these topics are Tom Peters, the former McKinsey consultant and best-selling author, who discusses ways for corporations to cope with change; Roger Blackwell, the Ohio State University marketing professor who specializes in how to do business in a global marketplace, and Daniel Burrus, the futurist who talks about how a vision of times ahead can shape business decisions today. **********The more optimistic attitude can be measured in another way -- the return of humor. \"As business becomes more stable, people are letting their breath out and relaxing a bit,\" said Brian Palmer, vice president at the National Speakers Bureau, based in Chicago. **********Business groups looking for public speakers basically have three choices. They can hire high-powered types like Mr. Peters or Mr. Mackay, who combine business expertise with polish. Or they can get lesser-known specialists whose main purpose is to impart information, whether the topic is mutual funds or chemicals. **********Finally, companies wishing to make a big impression can go for celebrities with high marquee value. In this category, No. 1 on almost everyone's list is the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who gives fewer than six speeches a year for up to $100,000 each. Her topic is always foreign affairs. **********Running close behind is Gen. Colin L. Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Three former Presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford -- are also stars, along with Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State. And the speaker of the hour is James Lovell, commander of the Apollo 13 space flight that is the subject of a hit movie. **********What can Colin Powell tell business? At $60,000 or more a speech, he delivers anecdotes about growing up, insights into leadership and thoughts about the military experience. \"He doesn't pretend to know the organization well,\" said Thomas Fiske, manager of special events at Andersen Consulting, who hired Mr. Powell to speak at its annual partners' meeting last October. \"But he speaks about his experiences and the experiences of the gulf war.\" **********Some business motivational speakers are legends. These are typically sports figures hired to pump up sales meetings. Lou Holtz, the Notre Dame football coach, is considered the undisputed master. But others in his league are the basketball coach Pat Riley, who has moved from the New York Knicks to the Miami Heat, and Tommy Lasorda, the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. **********\"Holtz gets them weeping and cheering in their seats,\" Mr. Dilenschneider said. \"He delivers a speech about self-realization and how if you believe in yourself, you can make it.\" **********Betsy Berg, head of the lecture division at the William Morris Agency, said: \"Pat Riley is in huge demand. People bring these guys in to get the sales force revved up.\" **********Among businessmen who are speakers, the big draws include the economist Henry Kaufman, for his \"inside baseball\" view of the Federal Reserve System, and Malcolm Forbes Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine, because, according to Ms. Berg, \"people assume he knows what's going on.\" **********Richard Branson, head of the Virgin Group, is also popular, as is C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, for his views on health care. **********It also helps to have a best-selling book or to appear frequently on television. \"When television first came around, people thought it would end the speaker business,\" said Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency. \"But the more people are on TV, the more they are in demand. People want to ask questions eyeball to eyeball and see these people in the flesh.\" **********As for books, Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau said they \"propel you into the arena of celebrity, even if the book didn't do well.\" **********Chief executives are in high demand, but few speak to outside groups. John F. Welch Jr., chief executive of the General Electric Company, is the most sought after, but he is \"really difficult\" to get, said Mr. Falcey of the Conference Board. And while no one would turn away Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman, or Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, they rarely give speeches, except to trade groups. **********Appealing to core business concerns can be a hit with specialized groups. Jack Florin, director of advertising and promotion at the Kelly-Springfield Tire Company in Cumberland, Md., recalls how the tire sales force was mesmerized by Mr. Blackwell of Ohio State. **********\"He held the audience for three hours by talking about the future of retailing,\" Mr. Florin said. \"Three hours is a lot.\" **********In speaking before business groups, lesser-known names sometimes fare better than the stars. \"Those that receive the best reviews are those who aggressively personalize their presentation,\" said Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau. \"Prominent speakers sometimes come with such a high level of expectations that they leave their audiences disappointed.\" **********Mr. Mackay parlayed his success as a businessman into a set of sales tips that are articulated in his books.  His audiences sometimes measure in the thousands -- including, once, a group of 10,000 Century 21 real estate agents, all in their company's distinctive gold jackets. **********Mr. Mackay, who also runs an envelope manufacturing company with $50 million in sales, jumped on the speech bandwagon after \"Swim With the Sharks\" became a best seller. The book is a paean to aggressive sales techniques and describes how business needs to be focused on the consumer in order to succeed. **********Following the techniques he outlines in his book, Mr. Mackay hits up the companies that hire him to speak to buy envelopes from his company. \"I have the unusual opportunity to walk into wonderful companies, share information with them and get an obscene honorarium,\" Mr. Mackay said, \"and then I get a chance to do business with them for the rest of my life. It's a dream.\" **********If business is still a mostly male domain, so is the world of business speakers. Only a handful of women can be pitched to men's groups -- notably Margaret Thatcher and Barbara Bush and, on a less-exalted level, Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, and Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises. **********Among businesswomen's groups, one of the hottest tickets is Ivana Trump, who speaks on \"how I had it all, lost it all, got it back and now am doing terrifically on my own,\" according to Ms. Berg at William Morris. Other current favorites are the television star and pitchwoman Candice Bergen and the entertainer Lily Tomlin -- sought for their image as strong, successful women. **********But sometimes women are a tough sell -- at least at first. Mr. Dilenschneider remembers proposing Ms. Hefner as a speaker for a world economic forum in Switzerland a few years ago. \"A lot of the heavy guys in the group said, 'no way,' \" he recalled. He booked her anyway, assigning her to a small room with only 40 chairs. **********By the end of the conference, he said, 500 people signed up to hear her -- more than for any other speaker."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/business/viewpoints-clarifying-those-complex-car-leases.html": {"writer_name": "S.

In 1990, it accounted for 13 percent of all transactions for cars and light trucks. In 1993, it reached 25 percent. And in 1994, it should gain several more percentage points. **********But despite the accelerating popularity of leasing, the costs remain hard for consumers to gauge. If, however, the leases' most misleading feature -- the monthly payment -- is standardized, much complexity can be dispelled for both lease-only customers and those who buy when the lease has expired. **********Typically, the monthly payment is the central selling point of these leases, the number in big print in the ads. But the leases also require many other cash payments, often exotically titled.  There is the bank fee, delivery charge, acquisition fee and capital-cost reduction payment, for example. Also, leases frequently have complicated financing arrangements -- several payments up front, say, or large refundable security deposits. These myriad and differently timed payments will confuse anyone without an advanced degree in finance. **********A sensible solution is to calculate a standardized Equivalent Monthly Payment for auto leases. The E.M.P. will do two things. First, it will combine all payments over the lease's life into one easily comparable number. **********And, by making certain assumptions about the time value of money, the E.M.P. will account for the different timing of payments under different leases. If a consumer had to pay $500 at the start of a two-year lease, for instance, that payment might be the equivalent of a $564 payment due at the lease's end. The E.M.P. will adjust for this forgone interest. **********The E.M.P. may sound complex, but similar calculations are already used to make consumers' lives simpler. One common example involves adjustable-rate mortgages. **********In such mortgages, customers often get a low introductory interest rate -- 2.75 percent, say. But, just like auto leases, the mortgages have varying features that affect the attractiveness of this teaser rate. The mortgages may differ, for example, in how often the interest charged, including the teaser rate, can be changed; common adjustment periods are 3, 6 and 12 months. Also, the mortgage might have a cap on how much the rate can be raised at one time; a maximum of 2 percent is common. Many mortgages have lifetime rate caps as well. **********Under the rules of the Federal Reserve, banks must roll all these factors together and, using common assumptions about interest rates, figure out the mortgage's overall annual percentage rate. This A.P.R. -- used for other loans and for credit-card balances, too -- allows consumers to compare the costs of different mortgages without relying on enticing but misleading teaser rates. **********Auto leases can be similarly shorn of mystery. Imagine that the same model car is offered in a two-year lease in two different ways. In one deal, the driver can pay $139 a month, along with a $1,500 capital-cost reduction charge and a $278 refundable security deposit. The second deal calls for $170 a month, with a $170 refundable security deposit, a $400 bank fee up front and a $350 delivery charge at the lease's end. **********The deals seem impossible to compare. But if the regulatory authorities adopt my suggestion, advertising for these leases will feature an E.M.P. to consolidate these varying charges into one number. At a discount rate of 0.5 percent a month, for example, the E.M.P. is $208 for the first lease and $203 for the second -- clearly a much different picture than the one the ads paint. Yes, the calculation involves financial technicalities like \"discount rate\" and \"present value,\" but consumers need only focus on the end result. **********Auto leases have other confusing elements, too. Some states, for example, are examining possible dealer misrepresentations over the \"capitalized cost,\" or basic price, of a car. Together with these and other regulatory efforts, the use of E.M.P.'s can lend bewildered consumers a helping hand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/world/election-campaign-in-haiti-splits-allies.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Election Campaign in Haiti Splits Allies", "print_headline": "Election Campaign in Haiti Splits Allies", "body_text": " **********The midday election rally was drawing to a close, and Senator Turneb Delpe of the National Front for Change and Democracy was about to move on to his next campaign stop when a small plane appeared. Suddenly, hundreds of leaflets for a rival electoral slate endorsed by the President began raining down on Mr. Delpe and his supporters. **********Mr. Delpe, whose party also supports Mr. Aristide, gestured to the sky and smiled ruefully. \"I wish we had the money to do that,\" he said. \"But we don't, so we are just going to have to rely on the people remembering that without the Front, Aristide could not have come back.\" **********After a slow start, the campaign for Haiti's legislative and municipal elections on Sunday is moving to a contentious finish. Some 10,000 candidates representing 28 parties are running in more than 2,200 races, but much of the attention has focused on the deepening rivalry between the National Front for Change and Democracy and the official pro-Aristide group, the Lavalas Political Organization. **********For more than four years, the two parties were allies, the chief members of the coalition that struggled first to elect Mr. Aristide to the presidency. After he was overthrown in a military coup in September 1991, the parties worked together to help return Mr. Aristide to power. **********But the return of democracy splintered the alliance, turning the two parties into bitter competitors, each claiming to be the sole heir to Mr. Aristide's mantle and popularity. **********When Mr. Aristide ran for President in 1990, he did so on the slate of the center-left National Front and adopted its emblem, a crowing rooster. Proud of that association, the party retained the rooster as its symbol, potentially a wise choice in a country where three-quarters of voters are illiterate. It also continues to use the word Lavalas, which means flood or avalanche, on its campaign posters and stickers. **********\"Until the moment President Aristide's term finishes, the Front supports him, regardless of whether or not he now supports the Front,\" Mr. Delpe said. \"For us, it's a question of morality, of political ethics.\" **********But many of Mr. Aristide's supporters further to the left have now decamped to the Lavalas Political Organization, which has replaced the popular crowing rooster with the slogan \"Gather around the table\" and an emblem of four people seated at a table. **********National Front candidates, including Mr. Delpe, have complained in their campaign speeches that \"there is no room at the table, because all of the seats are already taken\" by Lavalas partisans. **********Tensions rose last week when Evans Paul, Mayor of Port-au-Prince and the most widely known figure in the National Front, suggested that Lavalas opportunists were trying to lead Mr. Aristide astray and urged the President: \"Come back to your base.\" **********But at a meeting of Lavalas candidates today in Port-au-Prince, the party's most fiery orator, Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, leader of a powerful peasant movement, issued a mocking reply: \"Aristide never left his base. His base is the people.\" **********On the stump, National Front candidates and others who remained in Haiti during the three years of military dictatorship also stress that they experienced brutal political repression firsthand while some prominent Lavalas candidates joined Mr. Aristide in exile in the United States. **********Mr. Delpe is one of 24 candidates for two Senate seats in the Western Department, which includes the capital. His former ally in the Senate, Wesner Emmanuel, is running on the Lavalas ticket this time, and stands to benefit the most from his connection with the President. **********Thomas Figaro, 32, a farmer who came to the market here today, could not recall Mr. Emmanuel's name when asked to identify the Lavalas candidate, but argued that it did not matter. **********\"I don't need to know,\" he said. \"Any time I see the table, that's what I'm voting for.\" **********President Aristide's own role in the campaign has been the subject of some controversy. During a visit here in February, former President Jimmy Carter thought he had extracted a promise from Mr. Aristide to refrain from a partisan role in the campaign; Mr. Aristide told reporters he would be \"the President of every citizen, every candidate, every political party, creating the space where we can meet together.\" **********But as the election draws closer, Mr. Aristide's speeches, including one he delivered Monday in Gonaives that has been replayed frequently on state television, have been replete with images of tables and chairs and references to Lavalas. Today, as candidates of other parties made their final campaign swings, Mr. Aristide sponsored a reception at the National Palace for the entire Lavalas slate, which was also broadcast nationwide."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/19/business/media-business-advertising-move-over-norma-desmond-postum-coffee-substitute.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Move over, Norma Desmond.

A campaign by FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York includes print advertisements, radio commercials, recipe promotions and cents-off coupons. **********Those efforts, which began in February, market the brand as a caffeine-free alternative to hot beverages like coffee and tea. The campaign coincides with the 100th anniversary of Postum, the initial product sold by the Post Cereal Company. Post was later absorbed by General Foods, a predecessor of Kraft Foods, the $17 billion grocery giant that now sells Postum. **********For decades, Postum, made from roasted wheat, bran and molasses, has dominated the market for coffee substitutes. That's partly because of hyperbolic campaigns promoting it as a healthful antidote to the dreaded coffee-nerves character. In a 1934 newspaper ad, a husband suffering from indigestion, headaches and sleeplessness beamed after his wife switched from coffee to Postum; Mr. Coffee-Nerves, retreating, glowered, \"Postum, curse it, has driven me out of another home!\" **********Postum had 87.7 percent of the coffee-substitute market in the 52 weeks ending Dec. 10, according to data from large supermarkets compiled by A. C. Nielsen. And Kraft Foods estimates that two million people a year buy the product. **********But that market has been moribund, to say the least. The 52-week sales, according to Nielsen, totaled only $7.5 million, down 5.4 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier; by contrast, the most popular coffee brands enjoy annual sales of several hundred million dollars. **********Postum is \"a brand with a very stable franchise and a lot of loyal users,\" said Tate Lacy, senior brand manager for Postum at the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies in White Plains. But now Kraft Foods is \"thinking about ways to leverage the historical presence the brand has had,\" he added. **********The Postum push is indicative of widespread initiatives by consumer marketers to investigate whether so-called ghost brands -- older, unadvertised products -- can be revived. The increasing scarcity of shelf space, and consumer perceptions that there are too many brands, mean that venerable, vulnerable products must grow or die. **********In the last year, for instance, Kraft Foods has discontinued one small coffee brand, Brim, and combined its Sanka line of decaffeinated coffees with the far larger Maxwell House brand family. **********Postum \"deserves its chance to be aggressively marketed and see how high is up,\" said Tom Cotton, senior vice president and group management director on the Kraft Foods account at FCB/Leber Katz, part of True North Communications, which was awarded the account in June. **********The sales slump \"is more a function of having no marketing support for a decade plus,\" he added, \"than anything to do with the product.\" **********The Postum campaign, describing the brand as \"the truly soothing hot beverage,\" emphasizes its attributes as \"naturally caffeine-free.\" The humorous radio spots present Postum as the answer to a question on a test for airline flight attendants: \"Coffee, tea or . . . ?\" **********The ads suggest that \"you add Postum to your portfolio of drinks,\" Mr. Cotton explained, because it \"would be unrealistic\" to assert that Postum should supplant coffee or tea. The campaign is aimed at consumers aged 55 and older, he said, because that's a logical extension of the brand's traditional strength among shoppers 65 and over. **********\"Postum has no business being a product only for retired people,\" he added, yet \"we're not going on MTV tomorrow, because you'd have your loyal audience saying 'What are you doing?' and a credibility problem with a 21-year-old.\" **********Mr. Lacy said the goal was to \"seed Postum with younger groups, particularly the baby boomers,\" because \"people tend to look for hot-beverage alternatives more and more as they get older.\" **********Postum sales have increased by double-digit percentages, Mr. Lacy and Mr. Cotton said, since Feb. 6, when the radio ads began running in test markets and the print ads began appearing nationally in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens, Modern Maturity, Prevention and Woman's Day. **********\"We've got a yearlong effort,\" Mr. Cotton said, \"and we're looking forward to more gains.\" **********Both executives declined to discuss the campaign budget. According to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending, Kraft Foods has spent $983,900 on Postum ads so far this year. **********The Postum assignment is significant for FCB/Leber Katz because it is the first account the agency has received from Kraft Foods since joining the company's roster in 1993, when Kraft Foods bought Shredded Wheat and other cereals from RJR Nabisco, a longtime FCB/Leber Katz client.

You will probably want to construct a \"special needs trust\" specifically for the teen-ager and then make a bequest or trust for the others. But get ready to make a considerable investment of time: estate planning, never easy, is even more complicated when beneficiaries are not able to manage their own legal and financial affairs. **********Although the Dustin Hoffman-Tom Cruise film \"Rain Man\" was fiction, the underlying message of estate mismanagement is all too real.

The book shows how parents can convey crucial information, beyond finances, to future care givers to help insure the realization of their hopes for their child. **********But the authors also explain how the parents can prepare for their own needs as they age -- ways to protect property from nursing home expenses, for example, and strategies for reducing estate taxes and probate costs so as not to deplete the estate. **********Here are some of their recommended steps: *********** Write down your hopes for the child so that future care providers will have a road map. In this \"letter of intent,\" discuss what you want for your child in various areas: social, medical and residential. You can also discuss employment, religion, even final arrangements. Samples of such letters can be found in both books. *********** Decide who will be the future advocate or guardian for the child -- in other words, the decision-maker who will make sure your wishes are carried out. While most people would probably start by naming another of their children, it is probably wise to list a successor or successors, or to ask the advocate to appoint a successor, since the arrangement may last for many years. *********** Estimate the future costs of caring for your child. You may want to ask a financial planner for help in juggling government benefits, family assistance and your own investments and life insurance policies. *********** Ask a lawyer to prepare estate planning documents. This is when you can establish a special needs trust to manage the future resources of the heir and protect his or her government benefits. Upon completion, organize your documents in one binder, including the letter of intent, copies of legal documents and records of bank and brokerage accounts, as well as information about the child, like the birth certificate, Social Security number, medical records and any admission papers to a residential home. Make sure that future care givers are aware of the binder and have access to it. **********Lifelong care can run into the millions of dollars. Typically, arrangements are made to get medical and residential assistance from the government, and to use the trust to cover other needs and to enrich the child's life. For instance, the trust may cover dental work. But it can also provide gifts at birthdays and holidays, or pay for plane tickets for relatives who want to visit. **********When a special needs trust is in place, the advocate's job is usually not terribly difficult and brings its own rewards. **********Mr. Russell's brother Jon has a mild retardation and mental illness, and one day Mr. Russell will be his primary advocate. The only problem he foresees is Jon's vacation. Every summer, around the time of his birthday, Jon loves going to Nashville to hear country and western music. Mr. Russell goes along and truly looks forward to the trip, but he despises the music."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/business/marcus-cable-pursues-cencom.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marcus Cable Pursues Cencom", "print_headline": "Marcus Cable Pursues Cencom", "body_text": " **********The Marcus Cable Company is in talks with certain limited partners of Cencom of Alabama L.P. to acquire the interest in Cencom that Marcus does not already own. **********Marcus Cable's unit called Marcus Cable of Alabama Inc.  is general partner of Cencom, a cable television system serving about 83,000 customers in the Birmingham area. **********The purchase would be for about $150 million in cash and equity securities. **********Marcus Cable, based in Dallas, said it planned to use proceeds from the sale of its San Angelo cable system, about $65.5 million, as well as new equity from its limited partners, to pay for the Cencom purchase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/28/world/rwanda-calls-for-others-to-join-massacre-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1995-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rwanda Calls for Others To Join Massacre Inquiry", "print_headline": "Rwanda Calls for Others To Join Massacre Inquiry", "body_text": " **********The Government said today that it would organize an international inquiry into a massacre last weekend at a refugee camp, but then promptly began digging up the corpses, a move that drew sharp criticism from diplomats and senior United Nations officials. **********\"What's the point of establishing a commission and then pre-empting the work of the commission and starting digging?\" said Shaharyar Khan, the United Nations special envoy to Rwanda. He said that the United Nations welcomed the inquiry but that it stood by its figure of 2,000 killed in the camp. **********The Rwandan Government dug up several mass graves at the camp at Kibeho in southwest Rwanda, displaying bodies to United Nations officials and foreign ambassadors it had invited to the site. Government officials said they had counted 338 bodies, close to the original Government estimate of 300, but they avoided questions on whether the tally was final. **********The United Nations says some 2,000 ethnic Hutu refugees were killed -- shot, trampled or hacked to death -- when Rwandan Government troops opened fire Saturday on a surging crowd in Kibeho. Many bodies were buried before the United Nations gained complete access to the site early Sunday, so the figure is an estimate based partly on its survey of the carnage on Saturday. **********Diplomats and United Nations officials said the exhumation today was counterproductive and a mistake. **********The gathering at Kibeho was part of an effort by the Government to control the damage that the killings have done to Rwanda's image abroad. All the top Government officials were there, including President Pasteur Bizimungu and the Defense Minister, Gen. Paul Kagame. **********The American, German, Belgian and French Ambassadors were also there, along with Mr. Khan and top officials of relief organizations. The meeting began with a moment of silence in honor of those killed. **********\"This exercise is painful,\" President Bizimungu said about the exhumations. \"But for any steps toward reconciliation, there must first be a truce.\" **********He said the Government would assemble a 10-member international panel to investigate the killings at Kibeho. He invited Western nations, the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations to join Rwanda in nominating its members. **********In New York, the Security Council today condemned the \"killing of numerous civilians\" at Kibeho but said it was encouraged by the Rwandan Government's decision to conduct an investigation and bring those responsible to justice. **********The massacre occurred during a Government operation to close down camps in the southwest sheltering about 350,000 members of Rwanda's Hutu majority. Most of the camps were set up last summer by French troops as a safe zone for Hutu fleeing a victorious rebel army led by the Tutsi minority. **********The Tutsi-led Government insisted that the camps were sanctuaries for armed Hutu militias seeking to destabilize the country. **********For months many of the refugees refused to leave the camps, saying they feared they would face reprisals from Tutsi soldiers. Many of the Hutu militiamen in the camps are believed to taken part in ethnic massacres last year in which some 500,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsi, were killed. **********Soldiers opened fire on the crowd at Kibeho when it panicked and tried to break through military cordons on Saturday. **********Members of the United Nations peacekeeping force were not allowed immediate access to certain areas of the camp. United Nations officials say the Rwandan Army began immediately burying bodies in shallow graves and dumping them in pit latrines. **********About 1,000 Hutu took refuge in a school and hospital compound in Kibeho and are now refusing to head home, asking instead for safe passage to Zaire. There are many women and children in the compound, as well as armed men, United Nations officials say. **********The Rwandan Government has not allowed water or food to be delivered, and the Hutu are living in squalor among the wounded and dead. The Government has tried unsuccessfully to persuade them to leave. **********Today Government officials spoke to the crowd with bullhorns, appealing to the Hutu to exit from the camp in the presence of United Nations officials and diplomats. The diplomats offered to escort people in their own cars to their homes, and the Red Cross and the United Nations provided trucks.

His former Soviet backers are gone, Israel has made peace with the Egyptians, Jordanians and Palestinians, and the Israelis have a new leader who has been proclaiming his longing for peace from every podium and hinting that it could well include returning the whole of  the Golan Heights and an endorsement of Syria's control over Lebanon. **********But Mr. Assad recently celebrated 25 years in power, and all of them have been in a state of active or dormant conflict with Israel. He has rebuffed many  an invitation to the peace table before -- twice in the last year alone. **********Though Israeli newspapers all greeted the announcement by Secretary of State  Warren Christopher on Saturday that new talks would start this month, one Israeli commentator thought it apt to recall a meeting Henry A. Kissinger had with Mr. Assad 22 years ago when he was preparing the Geneva Conference after the 1973 Middle East war. **********As Mr. Kissinger told it in his memoirs, he showed Mr. Assad the letters of invitation he had prepared, and to his surprise the Syrian leader approved the entire text, with no reservations. Mr. Kissinger was delighted -- until the very end of the meeting, when Mr. Assad noted in passing that Syria had no intention  of attending the conference. **********Recalling that story, Hemi Shalev of the newspaper Maariv joined many other Israelis in the sentiment that \"before we start announcing peace with Syria as an accomplished fact, we had better wait until Assad has said his final word.\" **********Yet is is also a fact that the new Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, has  been around even longer than Mr. Assad, and that he was the man most responsible for making peace with Yasir Arafat, something few Israelis thought could ever happen. **********A protege of David Ben-Gurion, the founder of the Israeli state, Mr. Peres, 73, has been at or near the center of Israeli politics from the beginning, and he has declared unequivocally that a full Middle East settlement will be achieved by the end of this century. **********\"It's a new game, it's a new time, it's a new beginning,\" Mr. Peres said on Saturday. If he is right, a \"declaration of principles\" between Israel and Syria could be ready early next year. **********The fact is that the outline of an Israeli-Syrian peace has never been a great mystery -- Syria wants to get back the Golan Heights and to receive an endorsement of its control over Lebanon. Israel wants air-tight security, normalization of relations and a comprehensive peace. **********There are many issues that would require considerable work, to be sure, most  notably the sharing of water sources in the Golan. But as the Palestinian negotiations demonstrated, technical problems can be worked out once the political decision is made to strike a deal. **********Yet the fact that the outlines of an agreement are relatively evident has not made reaching one any easier. On the contrary, it has often turned attempted negotiations into contests over who should be first to make a concession. **********Since a peace is really all he has to offer, Mr. Assad has been more prone to make procedural questions into bargaining chips. He has insisted in the past that Israel give a public assurance of its readiness to return the whole of the  Golan Heights even before sitting down to talks. **********On his side, the previous Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, ruled that ambassadors and military officers from the two sides must first resolve security matters before talks can begin on broader issues. **********The upshot was that the Syrians walked out of talks twice during the last year. One reason was that Mr. Assad evidently did not believe that Mr. Rabin was really intent on making peace -- nor that he could sell it to the Israeli public. **********In his very first speech to the Israeli Parliament on taking over the Government after Mr. Rabin's assassination on Nov. 4, Mr. Peres signaled an entirely new approach, inviting Mr. Assad to join in talks with any format, without any preconditions and about all issues. He also indicated that he was prepared to publicly proclaim the concessions Israel was prepared to make if Mr. Assad made public his readiness to seek peace. **********Even more important, Mr. Peres challenged Mr. Assad to take the lead in concluding a comprehensive peace, dangling before the Syrian leader a central role in the Arab world that he has long coveted. In his speech to the United States Congress last Tuesday, Mr. Peres did his best to make that carrot as enticing as possible, saying, \"Surely nothing would capture the imagination of young people everywhere than a gathering of, say, 20 Middle East leaders, all of us standing together with you, our American friends, and others, and declaring the end of the war, the end of the conflict.\" **********He did not need to spell out that Mr. Assad would be standing on one side of  the American President, a place the Syrian leader has long believed was his by right. **********There is no doubt that Mr. Peres will prod Mr. Assad as forcefully as he can. He has already announced that his delegate to the talks will be Uri Savir, a close lieutenant of the Prime Minister who led the negotiations with the Palestinians and is the second-ranking official in the Foreign Ministry. **********For his part, Mr. Assad has been characteristically cautious, and his representative in Washington will probably be his Ambassador there, Walid Mualem. **********But his very agreement to enter a new round of talks, coupled with the positive coverage the Israeli initiatives have received in the controlled Syrian press and the positive signals Mr. Christopher heard from him, have convinced the Israelis and Americans that Mr. Assad is really prepared to talk. **********Beyond the status that he could gain among Arabs and the opening to the Western world that he would achieve through a peace with Israel, the Israelis say they believe he must be aware that Mr. Peres offers the best chance he has to retrieve the Golan Heights, and that if he waits until Israel concludes a final settlement with the Palestinians, the Israelis might move on to a comprehensive agreement with much of the Arab world without waiting for Syria to come on board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/15/business/international-business-paris-court-rejects-appeal-by-the-chairman-of-alcatel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 528, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paris Court Rejects Appeal By the Chairman of Alcatel", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Paris Court Rejects Appeal By the Chairman of Alcatel", "body_text": " **********A court today rejected an appeal by Pierre Suard, the chairman and chief executive of Alcatel Alsthom, of a temporary injunction that prevents him from working at the company. **********With the appeal having failed, French press reports suggested that Mr. Suard, who has been accused of misusing funds of the giant transportation, telecommunications and energy company, could be asked to stand down when Alcatel's board of directors meets next Tuesday. **********The ban was ordered on March 10 by the Parisian magistrate, Jean-Marie D'Huy, who is looking into claims that Mr. Suard misused company funds to remodel his house and that Alcatel overbilled its biggest client, France Telecom, by more than $100 million. Although Mr. Suard has not been charged with any offense or imprisoned, French magistrates have the power to detain suspects, or, as in this case, keep them from working, when the suspects have been placed under official investigation but have not been indicted. **********At a hearing on April 5, Mr. Suard, 60, asked the Paris Appeals Court to lift the month-old injunction, under which he is barred from managing the company or communicating with its employees.

He declined to discuss its contents, other than to say that it did not contain an invitation for a meeting when Mr. Jiang travels to New York for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. **********\"It would be very difficult for me to envisage any circumstances in which President Jiang Zemin would be able to come to Washington to meet the President if Harry Wu is not released,\" he said. **********Mr. Christopher's statement was a significant toughening of his position just hours earlier, when he repeatedly told reporters that Mr. Wu's detention on charges of stealing state secrets was just \"one of the factors\" in deciding whether a summit meeting would occur. But later in the flight, Mr. Christopher and his aides apparently grew concerned that the Administration would be perceived as taking a weak line on a critical issue of human rights, and open itself to further criticism in Congress that it was too soft on the Chinese leadership. **********The question of how to handle the detention of Mr. Wu, who was arrested on June 19 when he tried to enter China from Kazakhstan, has become an extremely delicate one for the Administration as Mr. Christopher prepares for his meeting on Tuesday with Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister. It is the first such meeting since a flare-up between the two countries over the decision to allow Taiwan's President to go to the United States on a private visit. Since then, China has arrested Mr. Wu, who was born in China and is a naturalized American citizen. **********Mr. Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, has been a thorn in Beijing's side because of his efforts to document the treatment of prisoners there. **********Administration officials say they are fearful of hinging the near-term future of the already badly strained relationship with China solely on the question of his release, or taking any action that would fuel Beijing's oft-stated fears in recent months that the United States is trying to contain China's power. **********But the invitation to Mr. Jiang, which the Chinese President is thought to be eager to receive, is one of the few cards the Clinton Administration now holds to alter China's behavior. Some officials clearly hope that the release last week of a tape of Mr. Wu, appearing to concede that some of his reports on the treatment of dissidents were wrong, was a prelude to his release in coming weeks. But they have little evidence that is the case. **********During the last Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton attacked President George Bush for being too soft on China's treatment of dissidents.  Since then, Mr. Clinton's policy has come to closely resemble Mr. Bush's, and last year he decided to \"de-link\" human rights issues from the annual renewal of China's preferential trading status. After some furious behind-the-scenes negotiating last week, the Administration and some Republican leaders managed to derail an effort in Congress to re-link those issues in this year's renewal of China's most-favored-nation status. **********Mr. Christopher said today that he would try to impress on the Chinese that Congress had \"a number of reservations and concerns\" about China's recent actions, and had the power to override Mr. Clinton on issues regarding China policy. **********\"I certainly will not be making any threats to the Chinese,\" he said. But he quickly added that \"you have to be realistic about the situation\" and said he was concerned that Chinese leaders did not fully understand the nature of Congress's power. **********This issue has tripped Mr. Christopher up once before, earlier this year. At a previous meeting with Mr. Qian he suggested that the Administration was not inclined to give a visa to Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to attend a reunion at Cornell University. Mr. Clinton was forced to issue the visa, however, after a nearly unanimous vote in Congress to let Mr. Lee visit. Some in the White House feared that failure to respect the vote could lead to a revision by Congress of the Taiwan Relations Act, which recognizes only the People's Republic as the true government of China, and keeps relations with Taiwan \"unofficial.\" **********China's leaders were outraged by the issuance of the visa, and suggested that Mr. Christopher had misled them.

Because the House approved a different version of the bill on Feb. 21, a group of House and Senate members will try to work out a compromise bill in the coming days and then resubmit it to each chamber for another vote. **********The Senate vote was a setback for Viacom Inc., the New York-based media company. Viacom agreed last year to sell its cable television systems for $2.3 billion to a group of investors led by Frank Washington, a black entrepreneur in California, who had financial backing from Telecommunications Inc., a large cable company. **********The minority communications tax break currently allows a company to avoid capital-gains taxes if it sells a broadcasting or cable system to a company controlled by members of a racial or ethnic minority. **********But that program came under strong criticism in Congress following reports that Viacom would receive a tax break worth $400 million to $600 million. **********Mr. Washington and Viacom both reacted with dismay to the senators' willingness to change the law. \"I've been totally unsuccessful in trying to figure out what these people do and why they do it,\" Mr. Washington said. **********Mark A. Harrad, a spokesman for Viacom, said the deal with Mr. Washington's group was contingent on Viacom's obtaining the tax treatment available under existing law. But the company remains committed to finding a buyer for its cable systems in any case, he added. **********The lack of serious opposition to the bill in the Senate reflected not just the current mood of skepticism in Congress toward affirmative action programs but also the tremendous political power of self-employed Americans. An estimated 3.2 million self-employed Americans deducted 25 percent of their health insurance premiums last year under the tax break that today's bill would revive and extend. **********The House bill calls for 25 percent deductibility. The Senate version allows 25 percent deductibility for health insurance costs in 1994 and 30 percent deductibility thereafter. **********The political influence of self-employed Americans had prompted a push in both houses to pass the bill and send it to President Clinton for his signature before April 17 so taxpayers could include the deduction in income tax filings then. If the deduction is not passed by then, self-employed people will have a choice of either filing immediately and possibly amending their returns later, or filing for an extension. **********The White House had tried to save the tax break for minorities in broadcasting and cable transactions by proposing ways that the program might be modified, including changes that would have raised the threshold for minority ownership of broadcasting and cable operations. **********Under the current law, the minority-owned company can qualify for the program even if it supplies almost none of the capital for the purchase and holds only 20 percent of the voting stock. **********Mr. Washington wrote in a recent letter to Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, that his plans called for borrowing $2.2 billion of the purchase price from Viacom while putting up $100 million in equity. Mr. Washington said that he would put up 21 percent of the equity, including $2.1 million of his personal money and the $18.9 million balance in borrowed money. Telecommunications Inc. would hold a smaller ownership stake but might lend part of the $2.2 billion, he wrote. **********After today's Senate vote, senior White House officials said the question of whether Mr. Clinton would fight to protect the tax break was now tangled in the Administration's review of affirmative action programs. They said it could be some weeks before the President and his aides decide whether the program and others should be protected. **********The White House has been reluctant to threaten a veto because of the popularity of the health insurance deduction. **********Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, led supporters of today's legislation. While minorities have had trouble raising money to buy cable and broadcast companies, there is not a problem of people refusing to sell such properties to them for discriminatory reasons, so the tax break is not needed, he said. **********But Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, disagreed. \"We have yet to fully and honestly confront the fact that racism is an evil that is not simply a stained chapter in our history books,\" he said. \"It still flourishes in many overt -- and, I would suggest, even more subtle -- ways.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/business/executive-testifies-to-many-clashes-with-perelman.html": {"writer_name": "Debra West", "pub_date": "1995-07-13", "snippet": "After five days of testimony in a lawsuit brought by a dismissed executive against Ronald O.

He later helped Mr. Perelman, now 51, form the First Gibraltar Corporation from the purchase of five insolvent savings and loan associations. **********Mr. Tepperman was well rewarded for his work. In 1989, he signed a 10-year contract that guaranteed him a salary beginning at $1.1 million a year. In 1990, his salary package, including bonuses, was $2.5 million. When he was fired a year later, he was stripped of his pension and benefits and had to return his company car, a Mercedes-Benz. **********The trial began June 27 and promised to illuminate the conflict between job and family obligations that is familiar in many workplaces.

When Mr. Tepperman did not return to work, he was dismissed. **********In his opening arguments last week, Mr. Slotnick referred to that letter as \"the final trick, the final deception\" that revealed just how mean-spirited Mr. Perelman and his top aides could be. **********But in cross-examination by Mr. Arkin on Tuesday, Mr. Tepperman admitted that he had received the letter before he left New York. Mr. Tepperman's own handwritten notes showed that he had discussed the letter with his secretary and with his wife's doctor and then proceeded to take the Christmas vacation anyway. **********Faced with the contradiction, Mr. Tepperman, a courtly, gray-haired man, maintained his calm demeanor. **********\"I guess the best I could say at the moment is that I'm confused by it,\" he said. \"It would appear that we had some kind of conversation before I left.\" **********In another surprise, Mr. Tepperman said on Tuesday that despite their legal battle, he approached Mr. Perelman just 45 days ago with a business deal that he thought would be \"bigger than First Gibraltar.\" The deal, apparently, did not go through. **********Judge Samuel G.

Growing frustrated with Mr. Buthelezi's refusal to participate in a constitutional conference, and his minister's calls on supporters to \"rise and resist\" the central Government, the President last month threatened to cut off funds to the KwaZulu/Natal provincial government, a move that critics said would be unconstitutional. **********Political observers here say that Mr. Mandela's changes in of the traditional chieftancy were designed to gain the upper hand in KwaZulu/ Natal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/business/l-in-defense-of-heart-transplant-device-261195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 334, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Defense of Heart Transplant Device", "print_headline": "In Defense of Heart Transplant Device", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********John Bray poses legitimate questions about the dissemination of an expensive new health-care technology, but his suggestion that approval of third-party reimbursements for Thermo Cardiosystems' Heartmate as a bridge to heart transplants may be a \"bridge too far to cross\" is narrow and shortsighted. **********While the device is expensive, potential heart transplant recipients who are denied the device will continue to receive costly but less-effective medical management in an intensive-care unit until they die or receive a transplant.

It is a fight to make sure that the United States does not make the same mistakes with China that it made for decades with Japan. **********Whether Washington prevails this time may not be clear until 2010 or so, but as Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the other day, \"you have to start somewhere.\" **********Throughout most of Japan's post-war rise, Washington found every reason possible not to make trade -- and America's own economic health -- the No. 1 issue with a close ally. The cold war was on, and the Japanese islands were America's unsinkable battleship in the Pacific. By the time anyone realized the enormity of the American mistake, it was already far too late. **********In some respects, China today is about where Japan was in the late 1960's, a powerhouse of growth, a huge exporter, and the leading candidate to overtake the United States someday as the world's largest economy. To get there, Beijing's economic planners have surveyed the world and found their role model -- Tokyo. **********So while the argument over the last few weeks was ostensibly about pirated copies of the movies \"Jurassic Park\" and \"The Lion King,\" the real worry was about the future of McDonnell Douglas jet technology and Chrysler designs for mini-vans in a country that seemed determined to let 1,000 pirates bloom. That is why American business stuck by the Administration, even if it meant angering the same Chinese officials with whom they were striking deals left and right. **********\"Everyone realized that piracy is not just a problem, it is a fundamentally ingrained part of China's economic plan,\" said Gregg Mastel, a senior fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a specialist on trade with China. \"And that is why so many people are skeptical that this agreement, or any agreement, can stomp this out. But you have to give the Administration credit for recognizing the problem and getting serious about it.\" **********By sticking to its guns, the Administration has won a series of remarkably specific commitments requiring the Chinese authorities to inspect every compact disk factory and software house, and to close down the offenders or force them to license the technology they use. **********It is a far more invasive procedure than China would ever allow an outside power to dictate in other realms -- human rights, for example -- and all the more remarkable because so many of the factories are enormous sources of revenue for the Chinese Army and the families of the leadership. That is why so many people inside and outside the Administration suspect that new piracy factories may spring up as quickly as old ones are closed. **********But the reason the Administration won this round, at least on paper, is that it holds the keys to something Beijing's leaders want desperately: entree into the World Trade Organization, the newly created United Nations of commerce. Beijing has insisted that it be admitted on special terms, exempt from many free-trade rules because of China's status as a huge but still developing nation. Mr. Kantor has said no way. **********The only choice, he has said, is for China to join \"under commercial, not political terms,\" an issue he probably will take up in an expected trip to China next month. And without protecting the intellectual property of Americans and others who operate in China, he said, the country could kiss the W.T.O. goodbye. **********\"We're determined not to get into the same position we got into with Japan,\" Mr. Kantor said in a telephone interview yesterday. \"We had a cold war strategy with the Japanese and Europeans that worked, making them bulwarks of democracy by letting them export freely to our markets even while their own were closed. But those sanctuary markets soon became a matter of entitlement. And it's been hard, to say the least, to break that.\" **********By some measures, it may already be too late in China's case. Its trade surplus with the United States grew by 30 percent last year, to about $30 billion, making it half the size of Japan's. China already exports to the United States four times the goods, measured in dollar terms, that the United States sends back to China. The ratio of imports to exports with Japan has never come close to a gap that large. **********Moreover, America's dealings with China in the last year or so have left Washington's economic leaders so bruised that they are pining for the simplicity and predictability of dealing with Japan -- preferring, in short, to clean the teeth of a wily old crocodile than an unpredictable lion. \"We've done this for so long in Japan at least we know who is making the decisions and how they are likely to react,\" one senior Administration official said. **********\"In China, we get one intelligence report after another,\" the official added, \"and we still don't really have a clue who calls the shots on these kinds of issues.\" The problem will only worsen, many experts suspect, if the country's political succession crisis deepens. **********For Mr. Clinton, who has made international trade the linchpin of his strategy for economic expansion, there is probably limited joy in the agreement reached yesterday. He is bound to be criticized for holding China's feet to the fire on intellectual property in a way that he never did on human rights. (Mr. Kantor, however, says the new agreement will also help the human rights cause, because China has agreed to accept an unlimited number of American movies and to open more markets to American companies. The process, he says, is likely to spread understanding of democracy's reach.) **********And if Mr. Clinton succeeds in changing China's economic behavior, the evidence will not be clear until well after his Presidency is over, even if he serves two full terms. **********He would hardly be the first President to discover that prying open China's markets is not a big political victory in the heartland. One of Mr. Clinton's predecessors, Mr. Kantor noted at a news conference yesterday, wrote to the Chinese that if companies on both sides of the Pacific \"will trade, there should be rules, so that they shall not break your laws nor our laws.\" The letter was sent by John Tyler in 1843, and resulted in a historic first treaty with China the next year. **********It didn't help him much: Tyler failed to get his party's nomination for a second term."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/world/in-england-all-s-sunny-except-the-dispositions.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In England, All's Sunny, Except the Dispositions", "print_headline": "In England, All's Sunny, Except the Dispositions", "body_text": " **********In usually damp, gray England, where complaining about the weather is a national pastime, the sky is blue, it's warm, and it hasn't really rained all summer. **********Naturally, everyone is miserable. **********The temperature in most of the country has been well into the 80's most days this month, which does not sound stifling except to people whose offices are not always air-conditioned and whose homes and cars almost never are. In London, the Underground, which is ventilated but not air-conditioned, provides indisputable evidence during the evening rush hour that antiperspirant makers have not fully exploited the market here. **********\"You try sitting in a hot cab all day, mate,\" one London taxi driver snapped the other day when asked why all his countrymen were so grouchy. **********The parks and beaches are packed with sunbathers, normally pale skin turning a luminescent pink despite well-publicized warnings from doctors that sun block is not just for use on holidays in Spain. **********Water companies have banned use of hoses in much of the country, a heavy blow to a nation of enthusiastic gardeners. In Wales, reservoirs around Cardiff and Newport are so low that tap water is running green, forcing the local water company to distribute bottled water. **********Fearful of a serious drought, some regions have drawn up plans for water rationing. In the city of Bradford, the water company has installed communal standpipes in case it has to cut off residential users. **********The heat and drought are killing off crops, pushing prices for fruits and vegetables up sharply. There have been reports of muggers holding up motorists as they sit with convertible tops and windows down. **********\"We are hot, and we are bothered,\" The Independent on Sunday newspaper said in an editorial this week. \"The sunshine we craved for so long, now it is here in such abundance, does not fulfill us or relax us; instead, it shortens our tempers and aggravates our tensions.\" **********In historical terms the British have some cause for complaint. The average daily temperature in central England since June has been 63.3 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Meteorological Office. That makes this summer the third-hottest since the Government began keeping records in 1659, following 1976 at 64.1 degrees and 1826 at 63.7 degrees. **********The driest summer since the Government began tracking rainfall in 1727 was 1800, when 74 millimeters fell. So far this summer rainfall has totaled 71.8 millimeters, so there is a good chance of a new record. **********The public is looking for someone to blame. The regional water companies, whose managers have been collecting better paychecks since the industry was privatized a few years ago, have been one easy target. Alan Smith, the group managing director of Anglian Water, cashed in some stock options the other day, netting him $250,000 in profit and the scorn of overheated, thirsty customers. **********\"There can be no justification for someone picking up this sum of money at a time when millions of people are not getting the water they pay for,\" said Nigel Griffiths, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on industry. **********This being animal-loving Britain, concern runs deep here about weather's effects on wildlife. **********\"I have treated at least a dozen distressed hedgehogs in the last week,\" Alan Brockbank, who runs a wildlife rescue service, told The Daily Telegraph the other day. \"In a couple of bad cases we had to inject fluid directly into the skin of very dehydrated hedgehogs. The problem is that they cannot find moisture or earthworms.\" **********Mr. Brockbank suggested that people leave bowls of water and cat or dog food outside at night to help the hedgehog community and other parched creatures. **********Some people have benefited from the weather. Seaside resorts reported a surge in visitors as the warm sunshine persuaded people to remain in Britain for their summer vacations rather than traveling, as many usually do, to Spain, France, Italy or points even further distant. **********But most people don't quite know how to handle the weather. **********\"The British are a strange breed,\" said Sean Clarke, a spokesman for the Meteorological Office. \"You'll hear our weathermen now saying things like: 'Unfortunately, the sunshine is going to continue.' We crave the sun but when we get it for any length of time, we start complaining and we get all sorts of problems along with it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/world/burden-of-strikes-increases-but-france-bends-just-a-bit.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 817, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Burden of Strikes Increases but France Bends Just a Bit", "print_headline": "Burden of Strikes Increases but France Bends Just a Bit", "body_text": " **********A wave of strikes that has paralyzed much of France swept into a third week today as miners fought with the police in the east of the country and the Government abandoned a position of unyielding aloofness by opening negotiations  with striking rail workers. **********There was no immediate sign of a breakthrough, and it appeared certain that the strikes -- staged to protest France's attempts to streamline its overburdened state sector, trim social programs and cut chronic budget deficits  -- would continue at least until Tuesday, when labor unions are planning demonstrations. **********Twenty-eight miners and a policeman were injured in violence today in eastern Lorraine, where 4,000 striking miners wielding crowbars and hurling rocks set fire to an office building at a mine and invaded a power station. The  police fired tear gas and stun grenades at the miners, who are protesting cuts in subsidies that would lead to layoffs. **********A Government-appointed mediator opened talks with railroad unions and appeared to make a first concession by agreeing to delay the signing of a contested five-year plan to reform the state-owned railways, which are losing about $2.4 billion a year. The plan would end some rail services and overhaul the company's pension scheme. **********But the postponement seemed unlikely to have any immediate impact on the strike. **********Beyond the strikers' specific complaints, there seems to lurk a far deeper malaise. **********\"The Government tells our people that the only objective is to fight against  deficits and debt,\" Charles Pasqua, a former Interior Minister with a keen sense   of the sentiment in the French heartland, told the weekly magazine L'Express. \"But you cannot run this country as you would run a board of directors. The French need dreams, they need hope and they need passion.\" **********At present the integration of Europe, the project in whose name the budget cuts and reforms of Prime Minister Alain Juppe are being presented, seems to offer very little in the way of dreams, hope or passion. **********Indeed French workers increasingly see the Maastricht Treaty of European Union, which calls for the introduction of a single European currency by 1999, as synonymous with job cuts, austerity, declining benefits and general joylessness. **********Today, for the 15th day, there were no trains, and public transport was at a  standstill in Paris, Marseilles and Bordeaux. There were delays of up to two hours at both major Paris airports as air traffic controllers staged intermittent strikes. **********Postal services continued to function at a fraction of their normal capacity, and about one-third of school teachers were on strike. But the strike showed little sign of spreading into the private sector and the violence remained   isolated. **********In an extraordinary expression of support for the strikers, given the disruption they have caused, 58 percent of French people say the strikes are justified, according to a poll published today by the weekly magazine Le Point.  Of the 841 people questioned, 56 percent said they felt \"sympathy\" for the strikers. **********Such support suggests the degree to which France is now divided. **********On the one hand, there is a generally affluent class still favorable to European integration and a strong franc. The franc's strength and France's ability to meet the rigorous German standards set for a single European currency are in turn dependent on reducing the deficit and paring the huge state sector. **********On the other hand, a growing number of people have the dim but troubling sense that the old values of France are being eroded by the slogan of \"Europe,\"  and by the sort of revolution in communications and business that can leave a country's policy captive to international currency dealers. **********Prime Minister Juppe seems to have done little to assuage these fears. His Government today announced an advertising campaign aimed at explaining the planned reforms. But Mr. Juppe has declined to meet with union leaders, although meetings between them and the Labor Minister have now been scheduled for this weekend. **********Marc Blondel, the head of the leftist union Workers Force, was skeptical today about these meetings. **********\"We are going to see the movement grow with a new action day on Tuesday,\" he  said, \"since Mr. Juppe does not want to understand that the only solution now is a global negotiation directly with him.\" **********By \"global negotiation,\" Mr. Blondel seems to mean that everything from stagnant salaries to rising unemployment must be discussed, and new solutions found. **********At the heart of Mr. Juppe's reform proposals lies an attempt to cut spending  in France's comprehensive social security system, whose deficits are mounting as people live longer and unemployment becomes more widespread. Mr. Juppe has proposed, for example, that most state employees be required to work 40 years instead of 37 1/2 before collecting full pensions. **********The Prime Minister left today for Bordeaux, where he is Mayor.

And even within that category, it appears to be among the riskiest. **********Largely because of its aggressive investment style, the fund has gained a stunning 15.2 percent already this year, compared with 4.9 percent for all growth funds. It rose 14.8 percent in 1994, while the group lost 2 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago. **********Such performance does not go unnoticed. The fund's assets have nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, from $5 million, to $9 million, though that total keeps it below the $30 million cutoff for listing in this newspaper. **********The Perkins fund specializes in the smallest companies, many of which are not tracked by Wall Street and which are thinly traded. The median market capitalization, or the number of shares multiplied by the share price, of the stocks it owns is $70 million. Only four of the 1,620 diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar own smaller stocks. Stocks of small companies tend to be more volatile than their large counterparts. And very small companies, sometimes called micro-caps, are more volatile still. **********\"We've always been more interested in micro- and small-cap stocks,\" said Richard W. Perkins, who manages the fund with his son, Daniel, from Minneapolis. In total, their firm manages $200 million in assets. **********The managers are fond of shopping for penny stocks, a bit of a misnomer since the classic definition is a stock that costs less than $5 a share. By this measure, more than a third of their portfolio is in penny stocks. **********The companies that issue such stocks often have erratic revenue and earnings histories, if they have any record at all. Many of these stocks do not trade on the major exchanges either, meaning the fund may have trouble finding a buyer when it decides to sell. **********The fund's largest holding is Innerdyne Inc., a maker of surgical equipment based in Salt Lake City. The company went public at $11 a share in 1992 and leaped to $17 on its first day of trading. By the fall of 1993, its stock had fallen to $1.25. **********Although Innerdyne has yet to have a profitable quarter, it has been a winner for the Perkins fund. It paid an average of $2.65 for the company's shares, which have risen in value to $4.38, and the stock accounts for 3.6 percent of the fund's holdings. Innerdyne's market capitalization is $72 million, typical of a Perkins stock. **********In another attempt at bottom fishing, Mr. Perkins bought shares of the Cooper Companies, whose chief executive was convicted of fraud and whose board recently paid a multimillion-dollar fine to settle charges of lax oversight brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund paid $2.02 a share for Cooper stock, now trading at $2.13. **********\"This is a forgotten, down-trodden company,\" the senior Mr. Perkins said of Cooper, which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., and makes ophthalmic supplies. \"New management came in, saved it from bankruptcy and is fixing it.\" **********A stock that has not proved profitable is General Magic Inc., a computer software company. The fund bought it at $22 a share, but the price now hovers at $13.38. \"I wish I hadn't bought it,\" Mr. Perkins conceded. **********Perhaps the most notable thing about the Perkins fund besides its small-company bent is its technology fascination. About 45 percent of the fund's assets were invested in technology stocks in June 1994. Such shares now account for roughly a quarter of the portfolio, Mr. Perkins said. **********Technology and small companies add up to volatility in the stock market. But the volatility has all been positive for shareholders of the Perkins fund -- so far. **********The fund \"is lucky enough to have been around in an environment that hasn't punished really small-cap technology funds,\" said John Rekenthaler, who edits the Morningstar 5 Star Investor, an investment newsletter. **********The fund dabbles in restricted securities and warrants. Restricted securities, which accounted for nearly 3 percent of the fund's assets on Sept. 30, cannot be sold on stock exchanges, and their prices are determined by the fund's trustees. What the fund would actually get for them if it needed to sell is impossible to know. **********With warrants, investors get the right to buy a certain amount of common stock at a fixed price for a period of time. If the stock never reaches that conversion price, the warrants expire worthless. The Perkins fund carried warrants for Work Recovery Units of Tucson, Ariz., which makes equipment and supplies for medical rehabilitation, on its books at $33,000 on Sept. 30 but has since marked them down to nothing. **********While not a good fit for the timid, the Perkins fund does have one big advantage. Its small size allows it to buy and sell stocks in companies without driving the price up or down the way a behemoth Fidelity fund would. **********On the flip side, the Perkins fund owns only 56 stocks. That highly concentrated portfolio means declines in just a few stocks could send the fund reeling. **********\"If we have too many stocks, we will have market performance,\" rather than above-average performance, Mr. Perkins said of his strategy. Acknowledging the risk, he said that investors might want to put only a portion of their assets, perhaps 5 percent or 10 percent, in the fund. **********One final caveat for investors. The Perkins fund's expenses are sky high, perhaps because the fund is so small and cannot reap economies of scale. Expenses exceeded 5 percent of assets on Sept. 30, leading the fund to pay more than 2.5 percentage points of those costs itself to comply with various state laws. Should annual returns decline from their double-digit levels, those expenses could be a big drag on performance. **********Of course, Mr. Perkins expects the fund to grow and expenses to wane. And there's little danger of this fund turning investors away anytime soon. How big would be too big for a fund that specializes in the teeniest companies? About $100 million, Mr. Perkins ventured."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ally-gargano-plans-reorganization.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ally & Gargano Plans Reorganization", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ally & Gargano Plans Reorganization", "body_text": " **********After a series of large account losses, Ally & Gargano, the New York agency founded in 1962, said yesterday that it would sell three divisions, dismiss half its employees and reorganize itself as a smaller, retail-oriented agency with a different name. **********\"It's necessary to reduce our overhead and pay our debts to be able of having any hope to go forward,\" said Bill Luceno, chairman and chief executive of Ally. \"We're doing what we can.\" He disputed a report in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age that said the agency would close. **********In the last four and a half months, Ally has lost an estimated $80 million in billings from longtime clients, including the Lorillard Inc. unit of the Loews Corporation, the Weight Watchers Food Company unit of the H.

A Marketing Coup; At 50, Mountain Dew Manages To Tickle Innards of Young Men", "body_text": " **********And now, as the soft-drink industry gears up to quench our summer thirsts, what is the trendiest, hottest new contender in America's beverage wars?  Mountain Dew. **********Mountain Dew? Yes, this 50-year-old brand -- its name born in backwoods whisky stills, a drink once marketed as \"zero-proof hillbilly moonshine that will tickle yer innards\" -- is on a roll. For two years it has been the fastest-growing soft drink in the fastest-growing corner of a $50 billion national industry. **********For all its rustic beginnings, Mountain Dew, which is owned by Pepsico, is now such a hit that \"it is the phenomenon of the nonalcoholic beverage marketplace,\" said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter in Old Greenwich, Conn. \"It's a real surprise, given that it flies in the face of the lighter, low-calorie ethic.\" **********Mountain Dew, with $2.7 billion in annual sales, ranks No. 6 in popularity in the nation, behind Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Diet Coke, Dr Pepper and Diet Pepsi. By the end of the year, some Pepsico executives predict privately, Mountain Dew could unseat Diet Pepsi to break into the top five. **********Despite -- or maybe because of -- its caloric wallop (Mountain Dew has 170 calories, compared with 150 for Pepsi and none for Diet Pepsi), huge numbers of teen-agers and Generation-Xers are gulping down Dew, as it is known in the industry. The phenomenon is a classic marketing success story, a demonstration of the way a giant consumer products company took a tiny local brand with an edge flavor and broadened it to national popularity through brute-force distribution accompanied by a succession of inventive and irreverent advertising campaigns. **********The real surprise, though, has been apparent during just the last few years. Realizing that it owned a distinctive product that its competitors were too slow, or too distracted, to counter, Pepsico figured out how to surf the wave. With high-impact television ads, the company used its marketing muscle to take over a targeted audience of its highest-consuming group: 12- to 24-year-old male soda chuggers. **********Although Mountain Dew has a mere 5 percent share of the carbonated beverage market, it scored its second year of double-digit growth in 1994, up 17.9 percent to 458 million cases. That is the fastest growth of any of the top 10, according to Beverage Digest. **********And Mountain Dew is king of the \"heavy citrus\" sodas, a fast-growing category that distinguishes Dew and its competitors from lighter fruit-juice sodas like Sprite, Fresca and Slice. Marketers refer to the heavier sodas as \"neon citrus,\" so named for their typical greenish-yellow color. **********Mountain Dew has provided a lot of the growth kick in what is a mostly stagnant soft-drink industry. And it is by far the biggest contributor to Pepsico's gains in recent years, accounting for 66 percent of its United States sales growth of soda beverages. Today, Dew represents about 10 percent of Pepsico's worldwide carbonated-beverage volume and a powerful 17 percent of its domestic sales. Dew, says Andrew Conway, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, is \"critically important to Pepsico's volume numbers.\" **********So, you might ask: Just why, as the company's slogan puts it, do so many soft-drink consumers want to Do the Dew? **********After all, this is a high-calorie, tart, sticky-sweet, lemon-lime beverage with a hint of orange juice and a caffeine kick. In short, it's the utter antithesis of the lighter caffeine-free drinks that have been all the rage in today's dietetically correct world. **********The answer reveals a lot about the increasingly segmented beverage market. **********\"There is a dichotomy among beverage consumers today,\" Mr. Meyers explained. **********Older consumers and younger women are making a big business out of teas, waters and juices, he said. **********\"But the younger consumers, generally male,\" he said, \"are looking for as many calories and as much carbonation as possible, and their favorite is Mountain Dew.\" **********Calories they get, and caffeine they also get: Mountain Dew delivers 54 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce serving, compared with 38.4 in Pepsi and an average of 240 in a cup of coffee. Brian Swette, Pepsico's executive vice president for marketing, attributes the product's popularity not to caffeine but to its unique taste and \"gulpability.\" But Mr. Conway, the analyst, said the caffeine kick, while below that delivered by soft drinks like Jolt cola, may well be part of the attraction. **********Mountain Dew's core consumers seem indifferent to such trivial concerns. \"I'm not one of those health nuts who worries about the calories or the caffeine,\" said Marc Ritter, a 19-year-old Indiana University sophomore, who has been downing Dew since the age of 14 and who currently has a case in his closet. \"I want something that does the job on my thirst.\" **********Given that the target is young males, Mountain Dew now makes the openings on some of its bottles a third larger than the norm. That's \"to enhance chugability,\" Mr. Meyers said. \"The idea is: I want it -- now. Instantaneous gratification takes too long.\" **********Another reason for Mountain Dew's popularity has been 30 years of Pepsico's marketing chutzpah. \"If you judge advertising creativity and dollars spent in direct relationship to sales,\" Mr. Meyers said, \"Mountain Dew has to be one of the great campaigns of all time.\" These days, according to analysts, the company spends about $40 million a year to hawk the brand. **********Three cities claim to be the site of Mountain Dew's birth -- Marion, Va., Knoxville, Tenn., and Johnson City, Tenn. Whatever the truth of their claims, it is indisputable that Pepsico bought the brand in 1964. The company gave it national visibility with cartoony depictions of Li'l Abneresque characters decked out as moonshiners. The label actually depicted an outhouse. **********Among Pepsico's slogans through the years -- and who, despite one's best efforts, can forget some of them? -- was the early \"Ya-hooo! Mountain Dew!\" intoned by the original cartoon character Willy the Hillbilly (Ya-hooo was, by Pepsico dictate, always spelled with three o's). That was followed by, among others, \"Get That Barefoot Feeling\" (1969); \"Hello Sunshine, Hello Mountain Dew\" (1974); \"Give Me a Dew\" (1980); \"Dew It Country Cool\" (1986); \"Get Vertical\" (1992); \"Do Diet Dew\" (1992), and \"Been There, Done That, Tried That\" (1993). While a frequently changing slogan can be the sign of a troubled brand, for Mountain Dew the tactic appears to have worked to keep the name fresh in the minds of its target audiences. **********More recently, Mountain Dew has bet its marketing bucks on the \"Dew Dudes,\" that sky-surfing, bungee-jumping, mountain-biking gang of Generation-X grungers. And even more recently, the icon for Dew in television commercials has been the Velvet Fog himself, the 69-year-old crooner Mel Torme. Pepsico is hoping that, for Generation-Xers, he will be the Tony Bennett of soda pop. **********Thanks to this decades-long successful marketing legacy, and the brand loyalty it engendered, Mountain Dew controls 85 percent of the $3.7 billion heavy-citrus market, Mr. Conway said. **********Coca-Cola's Mello Yello is a distant second at about 11 percent; Dr Pepper/Cadbury's Sundrop is at 3 percent and Royal Crown Cola's Kick trails at 1 percent. (An even tinier competitor is a Southern brand called Kickapoo Joy Juice, named after the sobriquet for moonshine in the Li'l Abner cartoons.) **********Mountain Dew is such a category killer -- a product that overwhelmingly dominates its market -- that its competitors are trying to use it as a bull's-eye. \"We are taking on Mountain Dew, head-on,\" said Joe Payne, director of marketing for Royal Crown Cola, which has just reformulated and re-introduced its Kick citrus soda. \"We're a bit meaner, tougher, bolder and, well -- funner.\" **********That is what he says, anyway. And speaking of fun, many industry executives eye heavy-citrus drinks fondly as the most off-the-wall, loosey-goosey part of the beverage business. The intensely competitive advertising climate and the rock-and-roll marketing frenzy surrounding \"neon citrus\" make it \"kind of like the old cola wars,\" Mr. Payne said wistfully. **********Coke, an abysmal also-ran to its archrival Pepsi in neon citrus, is re-introducing its Mello Yello brand, which it has marketed since 1979 but has only managed to place in 60 percent of American markets. The sedate new tag line: \"Let it out!\" **********And for its part, tiny Royal Crown is now doing its humble best to add to the understated elegance of heavy-citrus advertising by marketing its Kick soda as \"the hard-core, psycho, nitro drink in a can.\" **********Mr. Payne sees weakness in Mountain Dew's apparent strength: \"Kids are looking for something they can own -- that's unique to them. They see Mountain Dew as stodgy and old.\" **********It hardly comes as a surprise, then, that Kick has been thumbing its nose, so to speak, at Mountain Dew with print, television and outdoor ads proclaiming: \"Your little sister drinks Mountain Dew.\" **********That has led to a blizzard of complaints against Kick from parents, not to mention little sisters. Royal Crown has thus far stood firm against its detractors. **********But Mr. Swette of Pepsico has a rather direct response to Royal Crown and to Mountain Dew's other competitors. \"Consumers know an imitator,\" he said. \"But they want the genuine article, and they're incredibly loyal to Mountain Dew.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/business/company-news-sdl-shares-surge-12-in-initial-public-offering.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SDL SHARES SURGE $12 IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SDL SHARES SURGE $12 IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING", "body_text": " **********Shares of SDL Inc., which makes integrated circuits and semiconductor lasers, rose $12, to $28, in Nasdaq trading yesterday, after its initial public offering of 2.4 million shares of common stock.

Relations between the United States and Vietnam have been warming for several years, with the most important step toward the establishment of full diplomatic relations taken last February, when President Clinton lifted a 19-year-old American trade embargo. **********Under today's agreement, the United States will also take custody of the old Saigon embassy, although diplomats say that it is unclear whether the crumbling structure, which until last month was used as offices by the Vietnamese state oil company, can again be made habitable. The liaison office in Hanoi is the first American diplomatic mission in this city since December 1955, when an American consulate here was closed.

Ted Bates created familiar slogans like \"Melts in your mouth, not in your hands\" for Mars's M&M's candies. **********John Murray, staff officer for franchise at Mars in McLean, Va., who is responsible for worldwide marketing, said that BBDO would join D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Grey Advertising to become the company's \"core international agencies.\" **********The three shops were awarded the accounts after a six-week review that was prompted by the ouster in December of Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi. Mr. Saatchi is a longtime associate of John F. Mars and Forrest E. Mars Jr., who control Mars, a confectionery, pet products and food company. Mars is one of the largest private companies in the world. **********The withdrawal of the Mars account is by far the biggest loss for Saatchi & Saatchi since turmoil erupted when the company's board, prompted by angry shareholders, sought to oust Mr. Saatchi. He left the company a month later, and last week he was followed by his brother, Charles, with whom he founded Saatchi & Saatchi in 1970. **********The billings that Saatchi & Saatchi lost yesterday are almost 10 times as much as the billings the company lost last week, when two of its longtime clients from the London office of its flagship agency left for Maurice Saatchi's breakaway agency, tentatively named the New Saatchi Agency. **********The Mars loss also dealt a devastating blow to Bates because it was the only big client the agency had represented around the world in almost all of its offices. Until now, Bates had emerged virtually unscathed from the tumultuous changes roiling Saatchi & Saatchi because the losses had been suffered by the company's other large agency network, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising. **********Though Mr. Murray declined to disclose the names of the other agencies that had competed for the account, advertising trade publications have reported that there were at least nine participants, including Bates, which is based in New York; Bozell Worldwide in New York; Deutsch Inc. in New York; Earle Palmer Brown in Bethesda, Md., and New York, and Merkley Newman Harty in New York. **********Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York said in a statement early yesterday that it had withdrawn from the review after final presentations were given Friday, citing conflicts with current clients like the Hershey Foods Corporation, which competes against Mars in the American chocolate candy market. Trade publications had speculated that Ogilvy might have been assigned some of Mars's pet food brands rather than chocolate candy accounts that would have conflicted with Hershey's. **********Bates handled the bulk of the Mars business, including brands like M&M's, Snickers and 3 Musketeers in the United States, while Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising's London office handled brands like Snickers in Britain. **********Judy Torello, a spokeswoman for Bates in New York, said: \"We wish them much continued success in their future endeavors. We take great pride in the strength of the brand franchises we have created with them over the years.\" **********Ms. Torello said it was \"too early to tell\" whether any employees would be laid off as a result of losing the account.

The clients were the Gallaher Ltd. unit of American Brands Inc. and Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. Other Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising clients, like British Airways -- with billings estimated at $125 million -- and the Dixons Group, a retail electronics chain, are currently reviewing their accounts. **********The addition of the Mars account adds another blue-chip client to the roster of BBDO Worldwide, which is based in New York, joining companies like Apple Computer, General Electric and Pepsi-Cola.

Some wept openly, others sang the old party anthem, and a few leapt on their chairs to throw out their right arms in one last demonstration of the Fascist salute. **********By Saturday morning, the Italian Social Movement -- a party formed in 1946 by Benito Mussolini's last followers -- was gone, replaced by the National Alliance. As an embryonic umbrella organization, the Alliance passed its first test in Italy's elections last spring, with 13.5 percent of the vote. **********\"It was our family,\" explained Antonio Pezzella, a 46-year-old deputy from Naples, as he emerged from the congress hall Friday night with tears in his eyes. \"Today, we are abandoning our fathers' house and moving into our own. Tonight, I thought of my father, and all these emotions came rushing out.\" **********Various events conspired to give birth this weekend to the National Alliance as a full-fledged party, the first mainstream right-wing party to emerge in Italy since World War II, and one that many now consider a formidable contender in its ever-shifting political sweepstakes. **********It took the political upheaval of the last few years, which began with a wave of corruption scandals and ended with the collapse of the old party system. It took Gianfranco Fini, a suave 43-year-old leader who had the diplomatic skills to build a modern party without alienating an old guard still openly nostalgic for Mussolini. Most of all, it took time -- five decades, to be exact, from the time that Italy's last true Fascists were flushed from the Italian political system, leaving behind a troubled legacy that their heirs have only now been able to shake off. **********\"This congress was historic because after 50 years, it was able to resolve the whole Fascist question, which had been open until now,\" said Gennaro Malgieri, editor of Secolo d'Italia, the party newspaper. **********The charter of the new party makes a commitment to democratic values, which, it says explicitly, Fascism had \"trampled underfoot.\" It condemns racial hatred as a \"form of totalitarianism,\" and \"all forms of anti-Semitism even when they are hidden under the sheen of anti-Zionism and anti-Israeli polemic.\" The old anthem, \"Hymn to Rome,\" was replaced by new one, \"Liberty.\" **********In his closing speech to the National Alliance congress today, Mr. Fini again drew the line against any echoes of Fascism. \"Nobody ever again will be able to say that the right is synonymous with nostalgia,\" he said. \"There are no nostalgics here. The nostalgics are those who want to deny the evidence.\" **********Not all the old \"missini\" -- as members of the Italian Social Movement were called for the party's initials in Italian, M.S.I. -- could stomach these changes. Pino Rauti, a 68-year-old \"missino\" stalwart, walked out of the congress Friday in protest against the changes and met today with other disaffected members to discuss the formation of a new party. **********But for most of the approximately 1,600 delegates who gathered this weekend in this spa town, known for its healing waters and gentle hills, the transformation of the old party was a welcome transition that at long last would release them from the uncomfortable associations of the past. **********\"This will eliminate a confusion that had been forced upon us with the purpose of discrediting us,\" said Luigi Natali, an 80-year-old member of the Italian Senate. \"We were falsely called undemocratic.\" **********Yet the definition of the Italian right still remains nebulous for many of its members. When asked to define their beliefs, many revert to formulas that would warm the heart of the Christian right in the United States; \"God, Country and Family\" is the most common. **********But for most delegates, the appeal of the right remains its opposition to the left. \"We are the social right, and we have greater respect for the individual,\" said Stefano Di Magni, a 29-year-old architect from Rome. \"They want a type of Communism, to make all people equal.\" **********The biggest opportunity for the National Alliance -- and its allies in the coalition that governed Italy for most of last year -- comes from the widespread disgust with the political system that governed Italy since World War II. Under that system, the governing centrist party, the Christian Democrats, held onto political power through a series of compromises with the old Communist Party. The result was not only corruption, but also a state administration that became bloated, costly, inefficient and unpopular. **********\"The Italian system after World War II was a system that began with the center and moved to the left,\" said Lucio Colletti, a noted Marxist philosopher at the University of Rome. \"The crisis of the public deficit, of high taxes and bad services has freed up a public opinion that is favorable to the right, as long as it is liberal and constitutional.\" **********As a member of Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance, which won Italy's elections last spring and governed the country for seven months, the National Alliance, which includes some other small parties on the right, has already succeeded on a national scale. On the eve of the congress, some polls indicated that as many as 17.5 percent of voters supported it -- more than triple the roughly 5 percent the Italian Social Movement used to win in pre-1994 elections. **********The National Alliance continues to have its troublesome elements. Most of the \"missini\" who were giving the Fascist salute on Friday were members of the new party by Saturday. But many observers are convinced that the lure of future political victories will prove stronger than any tugs to the past. **********\"Sentiments have little to do with politics,\" Mr. Malgieri said. \"The Italian right wants to work in an environment with values that are shared by everybody.\" **********Mirko Tremaglia, a former hard-liner who has embraced the new party, said: \"We are not dying.

But that is easier said than done. **********Now, with the passage of its version of the budget bill, the Senate has put the main components of the pending tax legislation into useful focus. It's not necessarily time yet to take action. Still, it probably makes sense to refrain from a few actions, like putting money into an individual retirement account or buying an annuity, for the time being, since all the rules on savings and taxes are up for grabs. New types of accounts and new rules on existing ones could change your way of thinking by early next year. **********In the category of things not worth delaying might be the sale of some financial assets to realize long-term gains, particularly if you're skittish about the financial markets and their increasing volatility. There are savvy ways to do such sales to make sure any future cut in capital gains tax will come your way. **********On saving accounts, capital gains and other central tax issues, the final legislation will no doubt emerge only after a Senate-House conference, an anticipated veto by President Clinton and subsequent negotiations by all. **********There is near unanimity on a few fronts.  C. Clinton Stretch, of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, and other tax professionals consider a tax credit for each child a near certainty. The credit, probably $500 for each child under age 18, will probably apply to people under certain income limits and take effect in January 1996. **********Next most likely, many tax advisers say, are a reduction in capital gains taxes and the creation of what the Republicans call American Dream savings accounts, which would provide a tax-advantaged way to save for something other than retirement, say a house or college tuition. **********You will probably be able to exclude from taxation 50 percent of any gains on assets held more than a year. The top rate would drop from 28 percent now to an effective rate of 19.8 percent under both the House and Senate proposals. The provision is likely to kick in Oct. 14, though it might be later this year or Jan. 1, 1996. Indexing assets for future inflation, a provision in the House bill, will probably be dropped, while profits on baseball cards, coins and other collectibles are expected to remain subject to a 28 percent rate. **********David M. Bradt Jr. of Arthur Andersen & Company predicted that the cut would take effect no later than mid-October, but suggested that investors who want to play it safe sell now in such a way that defers recognition of the profits until next year. **********For stocks, which have generated hefty gains for many people this year, the tactic is called shorting against the box, a common way of locking in gains by borrowing and selling the same number of shares you already hold. Sometime next year after the legislation's effective date, you would deliver your stock to the party from whom you borrowed. Not only would your profit be taxed at the new, lower rate, but the tax would not be due until 1997. Why pay now when you can pay later? **********Anyone who sold assets before mid-October of this year, on the other hand, may need to earmark some of the profit for taxes due next spring. **********And anyone with losses on stocks or other investments will want to think about selling them before year's end. This is because both bills call for doubling the amount of losses needed to offset each dollar of ordinary income, up to the $3,000 maximum, effective Jan. 1. **********For real estate, consider tailoring a transaction as an installment sale, with some or all of the proceeds to be paid next year. The risk is that the buyer might become unable to pay or, because of some real or imagined flaw in the property, unwilling to pay. **********Before making such shifts wholesale, remember that under the Senate bill half of all capital gains would be added back to taxable income for purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax, which trips up many taxpayers. \"Watch out that you don't realize a lot of capital gains only to find out you don't capture it all because you're bumping up against the A.M.T.,\" counsels John A. McGraw, a vice president in the Washington office of Loomis, Sayles & Company, a large investment adviser. **********In theory, a steep cut in the capital gains levy would make some other tax-advantaged products, like individual retirement accounts, less attractive in relative terms. But specialists dismiss the suggestion that taxpayers focus on capital gains instead of I.R.A.'s as wrongheaded. \"Tax-free is always better than taxed at half rate,\" said Mr. Stretch of Deloitte & Touche. **********I.R.A.'s will probably gain wider appeal in new legislation. Both the House and the Senate suggest that nonearning spouses be allowed the full $2,000 deduction for contributions, a perk now confined to the employed. If one spouse works and one does not, the maximum contribution is now $2,250 for the couple. More people are expected to qualify for the I.R.A. deduction because of higher income ceilings. Households could also gain financial flexibility, namely the ability to make penalty-free withdrawals for certain purposes, including medical and college expenses. **********The American Dream savings account, probably taking effect in January, would have no initial tax advantage, but the contributions, unlimited in both House and Senate bills, would compound tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after five years. Earlier withdrawals would be permitted without penalty for designated expenses. **********These accounts are considered so appealing, in fact, that advisers expect a surge of popularity that would come at the expense of the annuity business, which has boomed in recent years as Americans wake up to their long-term retirement needs. **********Annuities, which merely defer taxes on growth until withdrawal and provide no tax benefit for contributions, would become less attractive, Mr. McGraw said, but he added, \"I don't think it would be crippling.\" **********Various other provisions of the House and Senate bills have a most uncertain fate. Some would not merit much financial attention even if the outcome of the legislative marathon were known, because taxpayers can do so little to prepare for them. **********Among these items are a marriage credit of up to $145, credits for adoption and interest paid on student loans, repeal of the 1993 increase in taxation of Social Security benefits, creation of medical saving accounts and an increased exclusion from estate tax. **********So the wisest course seems to be to keep an eye on the general direction of tax policy but avoid being paralyzed by uncertainty. **********\"If there's a valid business or investment reason to do a transaction now,\" said Mr. Bradt of Arthur Andersen, \"I'd be very reluctant to defer doing it for tax reasons.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/business/company-news-quaker-selling-a-pet-foods-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Ringer", "pub_date": "1995-02-04", "snippet": "The Quaker Oats Company, continuing to shed nonstrategic food businesses, agreed today to sell its European pet foods division to Dalgety P.L.C. of London for $700 million in cash. \n\nThe sale helps put Quaker on target for selling an expected $1 b...", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nQuaker Selling a Pet Foods Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nQuaker Selling a Pet Foods Unit", "body_text": " **********The Quaker Oats Company, continuing to shed nonstrategic food businesses, agreed today to sell its European pet foods division to Dalgety P.L.C. of London for $700 million in cash. **********The sale helps put Quaker on target for selling an expected $1 billion worth of assets.

One possible divestiture, he said, is Quaker's pet food business in the United States.

Bottrell said: \"There is no indication that we would be selling other parts of the portfolio.

William A. McIntosh, a managing director and a member of the brokerage firm's executive committee until April, said yesterday that he would leave. His decision, after 34 years at Salomon, is a measure of the continuing dissatisfaction among some of the firm's top executives. **********Mr. McIntosh, 56, declined to comment on the reasons for his resignation, but colleagues said he had been stripped of much of his power in a reshuffle earlier this year when he was replaced as head of the firm's fixed-income business. He has no new job, but has told colleagues that he intended to work elsewhere. **********There had also been increasing friction between Mr. McIntosh and Deryck C. Maughan, Salomon's chairman and chief executive, present and former colleagues said. Known for his direct approach, Mr. McIntosh had even suggested to Mr. Maughan that he should consider resigning for the good of the firm. **********Mr. Maughan's stewardship of the brokerage firm has become increasingly controversial, as it has had after-tax losses of almost $400 million in 1994, a recent exodus of as many as 30 managing directors, and a now-abandoned pay plan that sharply cut compensation for many of the managing directors. **********Through a company spokesman, Mr. Maughan said: \"Bill McIntosh made a great contribution to the firm over a long career. However, we think that the right thing for the fixed-income business is to have John Haseltine run it.\" **********In the April shuffle, Mr. McIntosh, who had headed Salomon's fixed-income department, was replaced by John L. Haseltine. As part of that makeover, Mr. Maughan also disbanded the firm's 13-member executive committee and replaced it with a five-member management committee.

At the height of the Treasury auction scandal of 1991 -- regulators have accused Salomon of submitting false bids -- Mr. McIntosh told the then-chairman, John Gutfreund, at a meeting with colleagues that he should resign for the good of the firm.

But beginning in a couple of weeks, viewers will be excused for believing they mean Quite a Voluble Channel. **********QVC, owned since February by Comcast Inc., is undertaking an elaborate integrated communications campaign that includes its first sponsorship agreement, with the country singing star Clint Black; plans to introduce interactive shopping as part of the on-line service being developed by the Microsoft Corporation, and the largest budget for advertising since the network began operations in 1986. The campaign begins in July and runs through the end of the year, timed to peak during the important holiday shopping season. **********Research among consumers has found \"there is really a perception that televised shopping is 'not for people like me,' \" said Fred Siegel, senior vice president for marketing at QVC Inc. in West Chester, Pa. \"But QVC has become so broad-based.\" **********\"While there is high awareness of QVC, it doesn't go much deeper than that,\" added Mr. Siegel, who joined QVC in 1993 after working for the McCann-Erickson New York unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Ketchum Advertising Philadelphia unit of Ketchum Communications. \"Yet once people know about us, they find they like us.\" **********Hence the campaign, which includes television commercials and print advertisements, created in-house; they will run in media time and space that are valued at $10 million to $15 million. The commercials, which will run as a test on broadcast stations in three local markets as well as on cable television, feature QVC employees in departments like customer service and quality assurance and the print ads feature merchandise; both are meant to burnish the image of QVC as much as to sell cubic zirconia jewelry. **********Aha! There's an example of the opinions the campaign is intended to change. \"Less than a third of our air time is devoted to jewelry,\" Mr. Siegel said, \"and less than 5 percent of our jewelry is cubic zirconia,\" the fake diamonds that have come to symbolize the purported downscale appeal of home shopping. **********Jay Coleman, president and chief executive of EMCI, an event marketing company in Stamford, Conn., which signed QVC to sponsor Mr. Black's coming concert tour, said: \"The baggage they have is of being the 'cubic zirconia network,' but QVC has been moving to sell a broad offering of product to appeal to a cross section of the population. Last fall, we produced a show for them, 'Video Game Headquarters,' and their numbers among teens and young adults rose significantly.\" **********The goals of the sponsorship of the Clint Black Summer's Comin' Tour, named for the first single released from his new recording, \"One Emotion,\" is to \"reach out to people who watch the channel,\" Mr. Coleman said, \"and to reach out to potential record buyers who are not necessarily browsing at Tower Records all the time.\" **********QVC has become a sizable seller of recorded music and related paraphernalia; a Father's Day program on Sunday sold Beatles and Rolling Stone merchandise, and acts like Led Zeppelin, Kenny Loggins and Pink Floyd have also been featured. A line of apparel and other items, like a Clint Black signature guitar perhaps, are elements of the QVC agreement to sponsor Mr. Black's 70-city tour from July 4 through December, which Mr. Coleman estimated was \"a low-seven-figures deal.\" **********QVC sought to join forces with an entertainer who Mr. Siegel hopes will help combat, not reinforce, its image woes. That's why the selection of a popular \"new generation\" country performer rather than one who represents the country-music stereotype of, as the song goes, red necks, white socks and Blue Ribbon beer. **********\"In working with Jay, his message was to get a relationship with someone very contemporary,\" Mr. Siegel said, \"and Clint Black cuts across a really wide spectrum.\" Mr. Coleman included Mr. Black on a list of country stars like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Tricia Yearwood who have \"crossed over\" into the mainstream and thereby enhanced their appeal to consumer marketers. **********\"Clint's management company has extensive research on Clint's audience that shows it skews younger, more educated and highly female,\" Mr. Coleman said, \"and the match with QVC is incredible.\" And Mr. Black will also benefit QVC with another constituency, he added, the operators of cable systems; Mr. Black will \"create a commercial about the tour and in major markets will customize it with tags touting the local cable operator.\" **********On the interactive front, QVC, which has an interactive shopping division named iQVC, signed a strategic agreement in May with Microsoft to offer on-line retailing in the fall on the Microsoft Network, scheduled to be introduced with the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system. **********\"It's a different medium,\" Mr. Siegel said. \"The challenge is to develop a service that takes advantage of the medium and addresses how the consumer uses it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/business/voices-viewpoint-creating-gain-without-pain.html": {"writer_name": "Graef Crystal", "pub_date": "1995-07-23", "snippet": "IN his short 15-month tenure as chief executive of the Scott Paper Company, Albert J.

Dunlap has left both cheering and misery in his wake. **********His shareholders couldn't be happier.  Now that Kimberly-Clark has offered to buy out their shares at about $45 each, the value of their investment has tripled in a tad more than a year. But ask his employees how they feel and you may get a different answer; since he took over, some 11,000 jobs have been cut. For that matter, ask how city officials in Philadelphia feel: until Kimberly-Clark came along, Mr. Dunlap had been planning to move the company's headquarters from Philadelphia to Florida. **********The experience at Scott Paper is not unique. A few years back, another chief executive, William A. Anders, was brought in to turn around General Dynamics. When he quit a few years later, shareholders were also cheering while some employees and ex-employees picketed the company carrying signs reading \"We'll work for food!\" Other companies that in recent years have seen a combination of high shareholder returns and declining employment include Harcourt General and Sonat. **********Lately, many companies, responding to intense shareholder and Government criticism, have redesigned executive compensation plans to place much more emphasis on pay for performance. But the performance they have decided to encourage has been, almost uniformly, total shareholder return -- that is, stock price appreciation and dividends. That emphasis has caused some critics of executive pay to contend that chief executives, who always tended to favor shareholders anyway, will now forget about employees entirely. Scott's Mr. Dunlap, for example, stands to reap some $44 million from stock options and free share grants, almost all of which he got as he walked in the door and began slashing jobs. **********If a company emphasizes maximizing shareholder return, does that necessarily result in more employees getting the ax while simultaneously making top executives rich? The answer is a resounding \"no,\" provided that the time window of shareholder return is sufficiently wide. **********I recently looked at the 425 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that have been publicly traded for 10 or more years. Then I ran a correlation between 10-year shareholder return and the change in total number of employees in the company. The result: there is a positive and significant relationship between the two series. **********To illustrate, a company whose shareholder return over 10 years ranks it at the 90th percentile (that is, a company that has outperformed all but 10 percent of other companies) will, other things being equal, generate growth in its work force equal to the 74th percentile. **********At seven years, there continues to be a robust relationship between shareholder return and work force growth. But by the time the time window is narrowed to five years, the relationship begins to soften. And it disappears altogether when the time window is either three years or one year. **********So offering incentives for executives to maximize total shareholder return during a sufficiently long period of time -- say, more than five years -- is not only not antithetical to job creation but actually supports it. **********But when the time window is very narrow -- as was the case with Scott Paper and Mr. Dunlap -- anything is possible, including, as in this case, a combination of shareholder exultation and employee lamentation. **********Unfortunately, many companies blithely adopt so-called long-term incentive plans and then gut their very purpose by permitting executives to pull out large sums of cash at early intervals. For example, an executive is granted an option on 100,000 shares of stock at a time when the stock price is selling for $50 a share. He is given the right, but not the obligation, to buy those shares at $50 each during the next 10 years.  Because all the shares are fully exercisable two years after the grant, the executive can take advantage of a short-term spike in his company's stock price and cart off a great deal of money after, say, three years. **********This sort of opportunistic behavior needs to be stopped because it not only is failing its purpose of rewarding for the longer term, it is also breeding unneeded cynicism among the less well-off players in the American economy. **********A better way of handling stock options would be to make no shares exercisable for, say, five years and then make all exercisable by the end of the eighth year. By the same token, grants of other long-term incentives, like restricted (or free) share grants and grants of so-called performance shares, ought to require relatively long periods of time to elapse between grant and payout. **********If these simple prescriptions were followed, executives would then have a true long-term incentive, and the probability of both shareholders and employees winning would be materially heightened."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/09/business/talks-to-acquire-turner-skid-into-a-barrier-john-malone.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1995-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 715, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talks to Acquire Turner Skid Into a Barrier: John Malone", "print_headline": "Talks to Acquire Turner Skid Into a Barrier: John Malone", "body_text": " **********Negotiations over Time Warner Inc.'s takeover bid for the Turner Broadcasting System have stalled, people close to the talks said yesterday, and several were increasingly doubtful that John C.

Time Warner owns 18 percent. **********The person close to the talks said Mr. Malone was not objecting to just one outstanding issue. \"It is not one thing,\" this person said. \"It is the whole package that he is grabbing. It is very simple. Time Warner and Turner are ready to do a deal and John Malone is not. He is in no hurry.\" **********This source added: \"The talks have not broken down, but they are no more dead or alive than they were three days ago. Something will have to happen or it won't be done in the terms in which it was being discussed.\" **********That comment may indicate that Time Warner has an alternate plan, and indeed there was speculation that Time Warner had changed the proposed terms of the buyout on Thursday in a move that angered Mr. Malone. Liberty executives did not return phone calls yesterday. **********Under the proposed deal, Turner Broadcasting shareholders would get three-quarters of a Time Warner share for each Turner share. **********For Mr. Malone, there are pluses and minuses to going along with the sale of Turner Broadcasting. A sale would give Liberty a profit of about $670 million for its Turner stock. And some media executives argue that it would give Mr. Malone potential power at Time Warner. **********The deal would give Liberty control of about 8 percent of Time Warner's stock, and Mr. Malone could form an alliance with Ted Turner, the chairman and biggest shareholder of Turner Broadcasting, as well as with other big Turner shareholders like Capital Research, an investment management unit of the Capital Group. **********But under the proposed deal, Mr. Malone would lose his control over Turner Broadcasting, a leading supplier of cable programming. **********Assessing Mr. Malone's agenda is never easy. But one person close to the Turner side said yesterday that he thought Mr. Malone actually wanted the deal done, judging by how far the talks had gone and Mr. Malone's intense involvement. \"If he really didn't want it to happen, why would he be negotiating so hard?\" this source said. **********Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, is the architect of the proposed Turner buyout. If the deal fell through, it would represent another failed negotiation, since Time Warner has been unable to restructure its relationship with U S West Inc. Mr. Levin has been trying to persuade that regional phone company to swap its 25 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment for a greater holding of Time Warner's cable businesses. So far, the negotiations have gone nowhere. **********But some Time Warner investors might be delighted to see the purchase of Turner Broadcasting scuttled. Some say it is far too costly for a company already loaded with more than $15 billion of debt. **********For example, Gary Langbaum, manager of Kemper Financial Services' Total Return Fund. has sold the fund's Time Warner holdings. \"They don't seem to care about price and how it affects shareholder value,\" he said yesterday. He did not say how much stock his fund had controlled. **********Turner Broadcasting's class B shares closed yesterday at $29, up 50 cents.

Citron, whose management of the county's investment fund led to more than $2 billion in losses and touched off the county's bankruptcy and current financial crisis. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Merrill for possible fraud in connection with its dealings with Orange County. In addition, holders of some of the county's notes underwritten by Merrill have filed suit against the Wall Street company, which had done business with Orange County for more than two decades. **********While the documents shed some new light on the relationship between Merrill and Mr. Citron, they also raise new questions and leave others unanswered. **********Merrill for the first time released some of the correspondence between Mr. Citron and Michael G. Stamenson, the Merrill salesman whom some blame for masterminding the county's ultimately disastrous investment strategy. **********The key to the strategy was to borrow heavily against the fund's assets, making big bets that interest rates would remain low. The fund also bought derivatives, which are financial instruments whose value depends on the performance of underlying assets like stocks or bonds. **********The correspondence discloses that Merrill warned Mr. Citron as early as 1992 that he might be taking too great a risk with the county fund. In March 1993, Merrill offered to buy back at a profit to the fund all the derivative securities that Merrill had sold to it. **********The derivatives purchased by Mr. Citron were extremely vulnerable to large losses if there was a sharp jump in interest rates. But Mr. Citron, in his April 26, 1993, response, declined Merrill's offer, saying that he was aware of the volatile nature of the fund's investments. **********\"It is typical -- but nonetheless disingenuous -- that some now maintain that they were not aware of the potential risks involved in the county's investment strategy,\" Daniel P.

If Merrill was aware of the risks the fund was taking, why did it agree to underwrite the notes?

Iacocca, Kirk Kerkorian, the secretive billionaire investor who is the biggest shareholder of Chrysler, astonished Wall Street and the automotive industry today by saying that he would bid for complete ownership of the auto maker. **********The deal, valued at $22.8 billion, would be the largest takeover since RJR Nabisco was bought more than six years ago for $25 billion. Mr. Kerkorian said he would offer investors $55 for each of their shares, 40 percent higher than the closing price of $39.25 on Tuesday. At the proposed price, the 10 percent stake that Mr. Kerkorian holds in Chrysler would be valued at nearly $2 billion. **********Mr. Kerkorian, who is 77, may be more interested in driving up the value of his shares than in running an auto company, some analysts said. Shares of Chrysler soared to more than $50 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, before falling to close at $48.75, up $9.50 on the day. **********Chrysler said tonight that its board would review the proposal. But at a meeting today to consider a letter from Mr. Kerkorian outlining the deal, the board concluded that the company was not for sale, Chrysler said. The board noted that Mr. Kerkorian had lined up almost no financing and was threatening to drain the company's cash reserves. **********\"We don't want to put Chrysler at risk,\" said Robert J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler. **********Some auto analysts and investors said they were skeptical that the takeover would help Chrysler, which has made one of the biggest corporate turnarounds of the 1990's. In three years Chrysler has gone from an industry disaster to the most profitable auto company in the United States. It has learned to produce stylish vehicles -- like Dodge Ram pickup trucks and Chrysler Cirrus sedans -- far faster than its domestic competitors. It has Dodge Ram pickup trucks and Chrysler Cirrus sedans -- far faster than its domestic competitors. It has reorganized, shedding thousands of jobs and selling nonessential businesses. **********Further, the proposal by Mr. Kerkorian could hobble Chrysler with debt when the company most needs the freedom to maneuver. Industry sales have slowed and some competitors are gaining on the biggest Chrysler money-makers like the Jeep Grand Cherokee. **********Associates of Mr. Kerkorian said it would not cost him or Mr. Iacocca, who as the retired chairman and chief executive of Chrysler holds $50 million of Chrysler stock, another penny to buy the company, the No. 3 auto maker in the United States. Instead, the two men plan a leveraged buyout reminiscent of the easy-money takeover deals of the 1980's. To buy the company, they hope to line up other investors, possibly including another auto company; borrow more than $10 billion and raid the cash reserves of Chrysler. **********Mr. Kerkorian's lieutenants emphasized that he was delighted with Chrysler's management and performance. He offered none of the traditional reasons investors give to justify a buyout offer, like the need to improve efficiency, cash management or product strategy. Thus, many experts speculated that the takeover offer might simply be a grand attempt to increase the stock price of Chrysler and make more money for Mr. Kerkorian and the Chrysler stockholders. **********\"We believe the market continues to undervalue Chrysler stock,\" said Alex Yemenidjian, an executive with Tracinda, Mr. Kerkorian's company in Las Vegas, Nev., which holds his Chrysler stock. **********Until today Mr. Kerkorian had a handsome profit in theory of about $737 million from first buying Chrysler shares five years ago, when the company was again in distress. But those profits exist only on paper, because Mr. Kerkorian could not sell his 10 percent stake without causing the stock price to plummet. **********Like all auto stocks, shares of Chrysler have languished -- on Tuesday the shares were trading near their 52-week low -- because of the perception that the auto market is weakening. Last fall Mr. Kerkorian pushed the Chrysler board to raise the dividend and buy back shares. Chrysler capitulated and the stock price rose briefly, but then resumed its descent. **********If he buys the company, Mr. Kerkorian could sell it to other investors or take it public again in two to three years and cash in on his investment, possibilities that Mr. Yemenidjian acknowledged today in a lengthy briefing for reporters. **********Some auto stock analysts said they believed that the goal of Mr. Kerkorian was to force Chrysler to buy him out at a premium or draw other companies into the bidding, allowing Mr. Kerkorian to sell his stake at a substantial profit. **********\"I suppose there is a number at which we would be sellers rather than buyers,\" Mr. Yemenidjian said during the conference call with reporters today. But, he added, \"We're not focused on an exit strategy.\" **********Other analysts and investors said Mr. Kerkorian truly wanted to buy the company. \"I think there's a 90 percent probability that it's a sincere offer,\" said Chet Needelman, chief executive of Palley-Needelman Asset Management, a firm in California with more than two million Chrysler shares. **********Mr. Needelman said it would be difficult for the Chrysler board to turn down the offer. \"If the board doesn't accept, and another bidder does not come forth, the price of the stock will fall,\" he said. **********Mr. Kerkorian has retained Bear, Stearns & Company to advise him on his bid, according to Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear, Stearns. Chrysler has retained CS First Boston, a unit of CS Holdings, as an adviser. Bear, Stearns has worked closely with Mr. Kerkorian in the past, handling his investments in Viacom, the entertainment company, as well as Chrysler. **********Indeed, Mr. Kerkorian has a strong record for making money from his raids on companies. He has built and controlled many companies, but he has also pressed executives until they bought back stock from him at fancy premiums, as were the cases at Western Airlines and Columbia Pictures. **********Shares of Chrysler, which soared in early trading today, fell as the news briefing by Mr. Yemenidjian continued and analysts and traders questioned the Kerkorian plan. **********The Chrysler board could decide either to accept Mr. Kerkorian's offer or invoke the company's anti-takeover mechanism, which is activated when a hostile buyer purchases more than 15 percent of the company's stock. If that occurred, Mr. Yemenidjian said, Tracinda might sue Chrysler to invalidate that mechanism, which dilutes the shares held by the hostile party. **********If not enough shareholders agree to tender their stock, he said, Tracinda would seek a merger with Chrysler. **********Mr. Yemenidjian repeatedly said that Mr. Kerkorian did not intend to intervene in managing the company. He said Mr. Kerkorian would not lay off workers, and might even seek a new stock ownership plan for employees. Mr. Iacocca, he said, would only advise, and would not become the chairman of Chrysler or an officer of the company. Mr. Iacocca is 70 years old and retired as chairman at the end of 1992. Mr. Yemenidjian said Mr. Iacocca and Mr. Kerkorian would not comment. **********\"The last thing we want to do is interfere,\" Mr. Yemenidjian said. In fact, he said, \"This management team can function a lot better if it doesn't have to worry about quarter-to-quarter results for Wall Street.\" **********But Mr. Yemenidjian also endorsed strategic changes that conflicted with the often repeated goals of Mr. Eaton, the chairman and chief executive of Chrysler. Mr. Eaton has repeatedly said that he shuns joint ventures or other alliances among auto makers, because the fortunes of the companies inevitably diverge. **********Mr. Yemenidjian, however, said Mr. Kerkorian intended to form such alliances. \"The company has to diversify globally through strategic alliances,\" he said. **********Mr. Eaton has assiduously stored $7.6 billion in cash to see Chrysler through the next downturn without once again swerving toward bankruptcy. But Mr. Yemenidjian said Chrysler was efficient enough to survive a recession, with $2 billion in cash and $2 billion in credit. **********Mr. Kerkorian has not lined up financing for the deal, but anticipates no problems doing so, Mr. Yemenidjian said. If approved by Chrysler, the deal would take about six months to complete, he said. **********To take over Chrysler, Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. Iacocca intend to contribute their shares, lining up at least $3 billion more in equity from other partners, Mr. Yemenidjian said. They would also use $5.5 billion from the Chrysler cash cushion. And they would borrow $10.7 billion, with a \"significant amount\" of it coming from banks, he said. **********Mr. Yemenidjian argued that the takeover had nothing in common with the disastrous leveraged buyouts of the 80's. \"This is not a deal of the 80's,\" he said. \"In fact, this is the way deals should have been done in the 1980's.\" **********But analysts said they were worried that Chrysler would stagger under the debt of the takeover. \"Is it really wise to add this much debt to a highly cyclical company at the top of the market?\" asked Maryann N. Keller, auto industry analyst with Furman Selz in New York. \"There is certainly a high level of skepticism about it on the Street.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/14/business/international-briefs-ricoh-bids-to-buy-rest-of-gestetner-shares.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Ricoh Bids to Buy Rest of Gestetner Shares", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Ricoh Bids to Buy Rest of Gestetner Shares", "body_text": " **********Ricoh, a leading worldwide office equipment supplier, said yesterday that it would seek to buy the shares outstanding of Gestetner Holdings P.L.C. for about $:115 million, or $182 million.

But he also made it clear that Haitians must bear the primary burden of building a just and prosperous society. **********\"The tasks ahead will not be easy,\" he told a crowd that had begun gathering at dawn in the main square in front of the National Palace. They had amused themselves during a long wait under a blazing tropical sun by singing, dancing and donning free T-shirts emblazoned with images of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aristide. **********\"You must work hard; you must have patience; you must move forward together with tolerance, openness and cooperation.\" **********Mr. Clinton's arrival in Haiti came barely six months after more than 20,000 American troops landed here and brought an end to three years of military dictatorship. Beginning Saturday, Haiti's security will be guaranteed by 6,900 soldiers and police officers from more than 30 countries, including the United States, Bangladesh, Canada, Nepal, the Netherlands and Pakistan. **********The warm, festive atmosphere stood in sharp contrast to the violence and political tension that dominated the days preceding Mr. Clinton's arrival. On Tuesday, a prominent opponent of Mr. Aristide, Mireille Durocher Bertin, was killed by three gunmen as she drove her car down a busy main street here. **********Shortly afterward, American officials disclosed that they had warned Mr. Aristide last week both of a plot to kill Ms. Durocher Bertin and of the possible involvement of his Interior Minister, Gen. Mondesir Beaubrun. The issue threatened to derail the visit and make a mockery of Mr. Clinton's assertion that American troops have established a \"safe and stable environment\" here. **********During a ceremony at the National Palace this morning, however, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Aristide were full of compliments for each other. Mr. Clinton, who towered over the slight Haitian leader when they stood side by side behind a bulletproof screen, called Mr. Aristide a man of \"tremendous courage\" whose \"strength in the face of great challenge reflects the unbreakable will of the Haitian people.\" **********\"We respect him as the President you elected freely and fairly, and for his leadership of all Haitians since his return,\" Mr. Clinton said. **********In his remarks, Mr. Aristide, turning to the preaching style he used as a Roman Catholic priest, led the crowd in a call-and-response chant that thanked the American President for sending troops here and ending three years of repression. \"Has President Clinton been good to us?\" he asked in Creole, to which the cheering multitude responded with a fervent \"Oui!\" **********It was \"thanks to the nonviolent resistance of the Haitian people and to you,\" he told Mr. Clinton, that \"on Sept. 19 Haiti moved from death to life.\" The American presence here, he said, \"has forged a tunnel of hope through the mountains of suffering\" and made Haitians eager to offer the American President \"the warmth of the light of a welcome never before seen.\" **********Mr. Clinton's trip was the first to Haiti by an American President since Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Cap-Haitien, a northern port, on July 5, 1934, to take part in ceremonies mark the end of an American occupation that lasted of 19 years.  No major agreements were reached during the 11-hour visit, but Mr. Clinton announced plans to help rebuild Haiti. He said the Peace Corps would come here later this year \"to help to organize the planting of millions of trees\" in the badly deforested country, and he also pledged assistance in paving 700 miles of Haiti's primitive roads. **********During the ceremonies, no direct mention was made of Ms. Durocher Bertin's killing or the allegations against General Beaubrun. But at the start of a private meeting between the two leaders at the National Palace after the morning festivities, both men referred to the case in responding to reporters. **********\"They're doing an investigation,\" Mr. Clinton said, alluding to Mr. Aristide's request this week for an F.B.I. team to lead an inquiry into the killing. \"I think we should applaud his quick and decisive action and let the investigation proceed and not presume its results.\" **********\"This is a day of celebration, and nothing can cast a cloud on it,\" he continued. \"It's a day of mission accomplished for the United States, a day of celebration for Haitians.\" **********After denying that General Beaubrun was in any way involved in the killing, Mr. Aristide took a similar cooperative tone. \"We welcome help from the international community and from the United States, who is helping us find truth about violence,\" he said in English. **********After the meeting, the American delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, said the two Presidents had \"discussed the problem of having an event of this type take place\" and the \"necessity of investigating it.\" But she said that economic and political issues made up the \"major part of what they talked about.\" **********Haitian officials would not say if General Beaubrun had been ordered to stay away from the transition ceremonies to avoid embarrassing Mr. Clinton, though foreign officials said there was no sign of him in the section of the dais reserved for members of the Haitian Cabinet. In any case, American officials said, protocol required Mr. Clinton to shake hands only with Mr. Aristide, Prime Minister Smarck Michel, Foreign Minister Claudette Werleigh and the presidential chief of staff, Leslie Voltaire. **********Early in the day, a large banner proclaiming, \"President Clinton: Haitian people believe in you for a New Haiti,\" was strung on the main square. But by the time Mr. Clinton's helicopter landed on the lawn of the National Palace shortly after 11:00 A.M., the poster was removed. **********The formal transfer of authority from American troops to the United Nations took place in the afternoon, after a lunch-hour meeting between Mr. Clinton and members of the Provision Electoral Council that will supervise elections here this year. Mr. Clinton strongly endorsed the multinational presence in Haiti, saying it \"demonstrated the effectiveness and the benefits of international peacekeeping.\" **********In his speech accepting the peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, struck much the same tone that Mr. Clinton had earlier in the day. \"The people of Haiti must maintain their commitment to rebuild their nation,\" he said, adding that \"continued cooperation will bring later achievements.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/28/business/business-travel-american-express-travel-centers-should-help-make.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1995-06-28", "snippet": "WELL KNOWN as a potentially difficult experience, visiting China should be easier with the opening this month of an American Express business travel center in Beijing.\n\nSituated in the Swissotel Beijing Hong Kong-Macao Center, the new center is a ...", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Travel;\nAmerican Express travel centers should help make visiting China a little less difficult.", "print_headline": "Business Travel;\nAmerican Express travel centers should help make visiting China a little less difficult.", "body_text": " **********WELL KNOWN as a potentially difficult experience, visiting China should be easier with the opening this month of an American Express business travel center in Beijing. **********Situated in the Swissotel Beijing Hong Kong-Macao Center, the new center is a cooperative effort between American Express and China International Travel Service, or Cits, the Government-owned travel agency; the Cits connection enables American Express to issue airline tickets. The center also sells rail tickets, and arranges conferences, hotel reservations, leisure excursions, airport transfers, and visa and ticket delivery. **********Besides the new business travel center, American Express already has four travel service offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Guangzhou that do not sell air tickets but perform tasks like reconfirming flights, replacing lost credit cards, and holding travelers' mail; all but Xiamen also have automaticteller machines that dispense United States dollar traveler's checks, in addition to local currency. American Express also has 23 representative offices throughout China that cater to leisure travelers. **********According to Ian Marsh, American Express International's senior vice president for Hong Kong and China, the company plans to open additional business travel centers in Shanghai and Guangzhou by the end of this year, and probably others in Shenzhen and Xiamen. **********Harold Seligman, a travel consultant based in Stamford, Conn., predicted these centers would appeal not only to corporate executives who must book with American Express because of their employers' ties to the travel management company, but also to independent business travelers without partners -- travel or otherwise -- in China. \"They'll know they can get in and out of the country now without too much hassle,\" he said.CNN Airport Network **********As of July 1, the CNN Airport Network will double its program cycle from one to two hours.

It also features highlights from previously shown interviews by the CNN celebrity-interviewer Larry King. **********The network, part of Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting empire, has recently broadcast certain events -- like the National Basketball Association playoffs and Kato Kaelin's testimony at the O. J. Simpson trial -- live and in their entirety, in place of normal programming. The general manager, Deborah Lunn-Cooper, said these special broadcasts were so well received that the network was now considering offering them during future football, golf and other sports competitions. **********Also in the works: CNN-International European programming, to be started at Delta Air Lines gates at Frankfurt International Airport by early next year; new Asian airport programming in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Singapore by mid-1996, and localized programming at United States airports, which receive eight minutes each hour to fill as they desire, even with advertising.Help in the Air **********British Airways is developing a \"telemedicine\" satellite link, through its new in-flight information and entertainment system, that will enable it to better monitor passengers who become ill in transit, such as a woman whose life was dramatically saved on a Hong Kong-London flight last month by two doctors operating on her collapsed lung with a coat hanger and urinary catheter. **********Dr. Michael Bagshaw, British Airways' senior aviation physician, said the carrier was designing a monitor it could attach to sick passengers that would measure temperature, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart activity. This information will be transmitted, via two channels reserved on the satellite entertainment system, to British Airways' medical staff in London, as well as to specialist physicians, if needed. The airline plans to test the telemedicine link once it introduces the entertainment system on a trial basis later this year. **********The airline's motives are not entirely humanitarian: diverting a plane when a passenger falls ill can cost it almost $65,000. It can also be unwise to divert an aircraft to a remote region with poor medical facilities.A 'Green' Room **********The Embassy and Windsor Inns, two small, European-style hotels near Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., have come up with a $50-a-night (plus tax) \"green\" room rate for the summer.

Initially, profiles will be available for a stock, bond and money market fund from each of eight big companies working with regulators on the project. **********Although the profiles will be distributed along with the traditional prospectuses for now, the hope among some regulators and all the fund companies is that the streamlined documents will be able to stand on their own eventually. The fund companies, with Federal and state rule makers, will conduct a survey of profile recipients to see whether the documents contain enough information for an investor to make an intelligent decision. **********If the profiles are found to be sufficient and are approved for all funds, they could radically change how mutual funds are bought and sold. **********Now, fund companies are required to distribute a prospectus to investors and ask if they have read the document before selling fund shares. That leaves investors to wade through what often turns out to be a 50-page tome written in legalese. If the new approach takes hold, an investor will merely have to consult the slender fund profile and its 11 brief sections, easily digested in minutes. To insure comprehensive disclosure, the fund company will deliver the full prospectus with a confirmation of a fund purchase. **********For fund companies that sell their shares directly to the public, the potential benefits are great. If the short profiles are approved as stand-alone documents, they could easily be reproduced in newspaper and magazine advertisements. That would allow consumers to buy a mutual fund after reading an ad -- a proposal made three years ago by the Securities and Exchange Commission and greeted with vehement opposition by state regulators and some members of Congress. **********The latest proposal has been received guardedly by state regulators, a fractured group whose individual members offer vastly differing opinions of what constitutes adequate risk disclosure. **********But following intense lobbying by Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the North American Securities Administrators Association, which represents state securities regulators, agreed two weeks ago to a one-year test of the document \"in the interest of significantly improving the understanding of investors.\" **********Mr. Levitt has made a simplified prospectus a priority. \"It's my hope and expectation that as a result of using the profile prospectus that for the first time most investors can read and understand\" the disclosure document, he said recently. **********Philip A. Feigin, Colorado Securities Commissioner and president of the state regulators association, still expresses some reservations about the profiles, but said he is committed to the project. **********\"This will guide how mutual funds disclose things for the next 20 years,\" Mr. Feigin said. \"A lot of the information, and the way it's presented, in the current prospectus is counterproductive. It's dense and very dry.\" **********Nevertheless, he and other state regulators are concerned that the shortened forms won't tell investors enough about the risks they face and the types of securities a fund might own, among other matters. **********\"There are a lot of things about liability and redemption of shares, for example, that cannot be handled in the profile document,\" Mr. Feigin said. \"Those are things someone might want to know. Some people love to pore over the details in a prospectus.\" **********To those who fear crucial information in the full prospectus will fall by the wayside, supporters point out that the fund profile is intended to be a prelude to, not a replacement for the complete document. **********They add that so many people tune out when handed a prospectus now that anything might be an improvement. \"Even if it is theoretically true that most people would make a better investment decision after reading the full prospectus, the fact is that most people don't read it,\" said Matthew P. Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group in Washington, which strongly supports the plan. **********The profile offers information on fund goals or objectives, investment strategies, risk, appropriateness for a particular investor, fees and expenses, past performance, investment adviser or fund manager, and details about purchases, redemptions, distributions and other services. **********FOR example, a prototype fund profile supplied to The New York Times last week by a fund company answers this question, \"Is the fund appropriate for me?\" The profile, for a growth and income fund, states: \"The fund may be appropriate for investors who are willing to ride out stock market fluctuations in pursuit of potentially high long-term returns. The fund is designed for those who seek a combination of growth and income from equity and some bond investments. The fund by itself is not a balanced investment plan.\" **********It is true, of course, that the fund profile does not contain all the information that an investor might want before buying a fund's shares. As a gesture in this direction, the participating companies agreed not to use \"prospectus\" at all to describe the new document, and simply to use \"fund profile.\" **********An example of the type of informationlikely to be absent from the fund profile can be found , oddly enough, in a brochure published by the I.C.I. and called, \"Reading the Mutual Fund Prospectus.\" **********The full prospectus contains information about the tax implications of switching funds, writing checks against a fund balance and withdrawing funds in an emergency -- details not likely to be included in the profile. **********Bank of America, Capital Research and Management, Dreyfus, Fidelity Investments, IDS Financial Services, T. Rowe Price, Scudder and Vanguard are putting the finishing touches on their fund profiles. A few variations are expected among their documents, but the general form of the prototypes is clear. **********Despite some missing information, like what portion of a fund can be invested in illiquid securities or low-rated bonds, the profiles will include some features that could improve disclosure. **********For example, they will contain one item that the fund industry is pushing as a universal standard for risk disclosure: a bar chart of total return for each year. Unlike the common mountain charts that show how an initial investment of say $1,000 would have grown over the years, this bar chart shows gains and losses at a glance. Investors can readily see that they would have lost money in some years and how much. **********And whatever the arguments against allowing investors to buy funds directly after reading advertisements, the fund profile satisfies a greater need. It puts investors who do their own research on more even footing with those who buy funds through brokers. **********Funds can now be sold through brokers without an investor seeing a prospectus of any kind -- the idea being that the trained sales representative will tell the investor everything he needs to know. With the fund profile, investors could get useful information conveyed in a simple format -- much as it would be in a conversation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/18/business/small-rise-gives-the-dow-its-3d-record-of-the-week.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1995-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Rise Gives the Dow Its 3d Record of the Week", "print_headline": "Small Rise Gives the Dow Its 3d Record of the Week", "body_text": " **********It was a bad day for the dollar, but Wall Street did not notice as the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up to new records for the third time this week. **********The dollar fell against most leading currencies, as rumors of Spain's imminent withdrawal from Europe's currency system prompted a flight to German marks. **********But in the United States, even the quarterly expiration of stock options, which typically prompts a flurry of buying and selling, failed to budge the major stock indexes very far.

The company says it was embezzled, but some executives are offering another script entirely: that Archer paid millions -- illegally and off the books -- to a number of executives through foreign bank accounts. If that's true, the \"embezzlement\" becomes a scheme to let top executives indulge in that all-too-common pastime: evading income taxes. What's true? Stay tuned. EXECUTIVE PAY Ted Turner, Wage-Earner What made Ted Turner give up the power of running his own show? Surely it wasn't money. There's only so much one person can spend in this world. But at a certain level -- way, way up beyond paying the bills -- salary figures take on a life of their own. Mr. Turner's pay is clearly up in that never-never land -- especially for a No. 2 executive. With options and such corner-office goodies, he's said to be making more than $100 million over five years -- far more even than Gerald Levin, his boss at Time Warner. Then again, even that fantasy paycheck seems almost incidental, for Mr. Turner is getting $2.6 billion in Time Warner stock.  BUDGET CUTS  They're Saying the 'S' Words  No, that rumbling you heard last week was not an earthquake, or New Jersey being replaced by a golf course. It was -- brace yourself -- the budget-cutters saying the \"S\" words. Normally, politicians would kick babies before they'd cut Social Security, but these are not normal times -- austerity is such a passion that babies across the land are surely being named \"Newt Smith\" or \"Budget Cut Jones.\" So sure enough, senators from both parties suggested shaving cost-of-living increases -- a panel of economists just said, after all, that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation. Pat Moynihan said $281 billion could be saved over seven years that way. \"The money is sitting there,\" he said, \"asking to be picked up.\" If they pick it up, though, will they be pummeled by retirees? DEBT COLLECTION Your Taxes or Your Kneecaps If Congressional Republicans have their way, it won't just be the I.R.S. knocking on your door wondering if, pretty please, you could pay your taxes. It could be practically anyone. The legislators want to turn over some dunning tasks to private bill collectors to see if they can do it better -- raising all sorts of nasty privacy issues. It's all, of course, part of the whole budget mess -- the Administration wanted to increase the I.R.S. budget nearly 10 percent; Republicans want to cut it. To Margaret Milner Richardson, the I.R.S. Commissioner, this budget-trimming is misguided, for it's accepted wisdom that tax enforcers bring in far more than their salaries. \"No sound business person,\" she said, \"would not spend money to make money.\"  TRANSPORTATION A Slippery Road There must be a better way, drivers mutter as they inch through exhaust-fouled air, past perpetual construction, to drop coins in a state toll basket. But are we ready for private highways? Well, ready or not, they're here, with a 14-mile road linking Dulles Airport and Leesburg, Va., opening this weekend -- the first privately financed toll road built this century. With the public sector \"just tapped out,\" as one executive put it, this may sometimes be the only way to build a road. But just think what today's maniacal marketers could do with this. There could be rival thruways, each bombarding drivers with ads for, say, wider lanes, smoother surfaces, better views, free meals, toll sales -- perhaps even drive-by movies, but that sounds risky. EDUCATION Cheaper Than a Luxury Car The bad news: college costs keep rising faster than inflation -- 6 percent last year, the College Board said last week. With total costs at top colleges nearing $30,000, and with Federal grants and loans tight, students face \"a deeply mortgaged future,\" said the head of the College Board. But there's good news too. \"There are some tremendous bargains out there,\" said an official of the American Council on Education. Two years ago, \"61 percent of all American college students spent less than $3,000 in tuition and fees.\" EXECUTIVES An 'Odd Meal' at I.B.M.? It takes a tough man to make a tender computer? No, that doesn't work. A PC in every pot? Oh, never mind. Let I.B.M. figure it out. Louis Gerstner certainly knew what he was doing last week when he picked J. Bruce Harreld, president of Boston Chicken, as chief strategist. Still, one analyst couldn't resist saying, \"That's an odd meal -- cookies with chicken, sprinkled over silicon chips.\" THE PAPAL VISIT The Priceless and the Profane You can't put a price on something like seeing the Pope, an experience presumably far beyond worldly matters. That's why most tickets to this week's Mass at Giants Stadium were given out by lottery at local churches. And yet, in this imperfect world, few things can escape: ads were spotted in New Jersey papers last week offering to swap those priceless tickets for coin of the profane realm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/20/world/autopsy-fails-to-settle-manila-singapore-dispute.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 362, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Autopsy Fails to Settle Manila-Singapore Dispute", "print_headline": "Autopsy Fails to Settle Manila-Singapore Dispute", "body_text": " **********A joint autopsy conducted by Philippine and Singapore pathologists on a Filipino maid who was killed in Singapore in 1991 and for whose murder another Filipino was executed last month ended today with both sides reporting \"irreconcilable differences\" over their findings. **********The joint autopsy, held under heavy guard at a private hospital in a Manila suburb, ended with experts from Singapore's Institute of Science and Forensic Medicine, accompanied by three American consultants, sticking to the findings of the first autopsy held in Singapore in 1991, which found that the victim, Delia Maga, died of asphyxiation caused by strangulation. **********But the Philippine panel insisted the Mrs. Maga was beaten before she was strangled, affirming an autopsy conducted last month by Philippine pathologists who said that the victim had injuries on her ribs and spine.

It helps him deflect negative coverage of incidents like the book deal flap, the House historian flap and the orphanage flap. **********Taking the offensive against journalists works, too, as the Connie Chung affair proved. Mr. Gingrich's counterattack on Ms. Chung resulted in so much debate about journalistic standards that it virtually obscured what Mrs. Gingrich said her son had said about the First Lady. **********For the moment, too, Mr. Gingrich makes such \"good copy\" that the news media are showering attention on him. And even if much of the attention is negative, the sheer volume of coverage has helped establish him as \"King of the Hill,\" in the words of Time magazine. **********But perhaps most important, since Mr. Gingrich has been covered by reporters for years, he benefits from what might be called journalistic inoculation, which shields him from aggressive coverage of some controversies in his past because journalists have come to regard them as old news. **********During his first image-forming weeks at the center of national attention, reporters and editors have appeared hamstrung by their view that everyone already knows about several issues that some of Mr. Gingrich's harshest critics say define him. **********During these weeks, the press has covered -- but sometimes seems to have handled with kid gloves -- subjects that might have hurt Mr. Gingrich much more than his mother's whispered epithet. **********Mr. Gingrich is a family-values politician who fought through a bitter divorce that some former associates have said raised questions about his character. He is a military buff who benefited from student and family deferments during the Vietnam War. And he presented himself as a champion of House ethics, though his own fund-raising has raised questions and brought complaints. **********Alan Murray, the Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was asked recently why news reports about Mr. Gingrich have referred to those issues so gently. He noted that The Journal and other news organizations had published just after the election some critical articles reviewing Mr. Gingrich's life. But, Mr. Murray added, \"How many times can you hit a story?\" **********Ask President Clinton or former Vice President Dan Quayle. When both were in the critical period of defining themselves to the American public, the press hammered at hidden corners of their histories. **********Mr. Clinton's draft avoidance and his \"I didn't inhale\" background were among the biggest stories of the campaign. And that was before Whitewater, Gennifer Flowers and the Rose law firm were made into household names by the news media. And Mr. Quayle was surely seen in that old snapshot as a member of the privileged Indiana National Guard more often than he was pictured as a statesman in the weeks after he was chosen to be George Bush's running mate. **********One explanation may be that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Quayle had received far less press attention than Mr. Gingrich before each of them materialized as a national figure. Years of what Mr. Gingrich sometimes called nagging coverage may actually have protected him when he took center stage. **********Mr. Clinton's real estate dealings and other incidents that occurred when he was governor of a small state without an aggressive news media fit the journalistic definition of new when they were discovered by national reporters. And as a little-noted Senator from Indiana, Mr. Quayle and his military-draft history did not qualify as national news until Mr. Bush pushed him into the national limelight. **********But Mr. Gingrich has been covered since the 1970's. As a rising politician in the sights of the sophisticated news organizations of Atlanta, Congressman Gingrich of Georgia received extensive attention from his hometown press. **********Then, as Mr. Gingrich climbed the leadership ladder, he became a national figure and then a would-be Speaker. In the process, his life has been picked over by the country's biggest news organizations and some serious smaller ones, like Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, and Mother Jones, the counterculture journal. **********The effect has been that the kinds of anecdotes that sometimes feed the press for weeks landed gradually in news reports during the period of more than a decade before Mr. Gingrich became Mr. Speaker. **********Journalists trade in \"newness\" or the perception thereof. A tough multipart profile of Mr. Gingrich in The Washington Post described him as possessing \"in some cases a ruthlessness.\" **********But The Post series dealt rather lightly with what some of his critics cite as the best evidence of this trait: his visit to his first wife's hospital room to discuss divorce while she recovered from cancer surgery. Mr. Gingrich has denied the version of those events that his first wife, Jackie Gingrich, gave years ago in published interviews. **********By the time they began working on The Post's profile, said Dale Russakoff, one of the reporters who wrote the series, the hospital room tale was no longer fresh. \"It had been repeated to the point that it had become a cliche and it didn't mean anything anymore,\" she said. **********The same can be said of what are now old questions about the financing of a televised course, Renewing American Civilization, taught by Mr. Gingrich and about Gopac, his political action committee. **********\"Gopac, in the Washington reporter's mind, is old news,\" said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia who frequently criticizes the press for what he calls \"frenzies\" of excessive criticism of public figures. Mr. Sabato wrote the widely cited book, \"Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism Has Transformed American Politics\" (Free Press, 1991). **********But sometimes, Mr. Sabato said, the public does not know all the information that has been gathered by reporters during years of coverage. Journalists' own definition of what is new -- meaning new to them -- affects the emphasis they give to information that might be new to readers and viewers. **********\"When they have known it, and when it has been in the headlines, it becomes less newsworthy,\" Mr. Sabato said. \"Reporters forget who they are reporting for.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/29/business/sec-settles-with-7-charged-with-grumman-insider-trades.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1995-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 431, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Not much, when it's a Government measure of on-time performance of the nation's airlines, says Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers. **********The problem with the monthly statistics, which the airlines that come out on top use widely in their marketing campaigns, is that they measure flights that are delayed more than 15 minutes. Mr. Maldutis says that a better measure of reliability is the percentage of flight-miles canceled, because a canceled trip irks travelers far more than minor delays. **********Mr. Maldutis analyzed data from Government filings that show that in the first nine months of 1994, T.W.A, USAir and Continental had the worst cancellation records among the major airlines. T.W.A. canceled 2.3 percent of its scheduled miles, USAir dropped 2.4 percent and Continental canceled 2.7 percent. **********Those percentages may seem low, he said, and although many cancellations are because of bad weather, hundreds of flights are canceled on many days, sending thousands of travelers scrambling to find alternatives. **********\"Our members are so used to delayed flights that they build extra time into their schedules,\" said David S. Stempler, executive director of the International Airline Passengers Association. \"But canceled flights can ruin an entire day.\" **********History also suggests that high cancellation rates can lead to financial problems. In their final years of business, for example, Eastern Airlines canceled 3.9 percent of its flights and People Express canceled 4.4 percent. **********\"It is a much better measure because it tells you more things about the airlines than an artificial on-time statistic,\" said Mr. Maldutis, who started gathering the data in 1988 when he noticed that airlines that were in financial difficulty were canceling a lot of flights. Analysts, he said, are always searching for early indicators. **********As of January, the Transportation Department requires airlines to include delays due to mechanical problems in on-time statistics. The new statistics for January have not yet been published. **********The airlines disagree about the merits of the new system. Northwest Airlines, among others, has opposed the counting of mechanical delays, saying that airline personnel might feel under pressure to dispatch unsafe airplanes to improve on-time reporting. **********American Airlines disagrees. In a rare break with standard industry practice not to compete on safety, American wrote in a Government filing, in response to Northwest's petition, that excluding mechanical delays would only benefit \"carriers that have an inordinately high level of mechanical delays, and penalizing carriers that through superior maintenance programs have a low level of such delays.\" **********The average age of American's jet fleet jets is 7.6 years. Northwest, whose fleet is 16.8 years old on average, said including mechanical delays would not affect its on-time performance. **********Mr. Maldutis said the Government's new standards were an improvement over the old system, but added that they still did not measure what most concerned travelers -- cancellations. **********\"That is the central issue,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/06/business/international-briefs-in-brief.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; In Brief", "print_headline": "International Briefs; In Brief", "body_text": " *********** The Nippon Data Kiki Company, once a favorite of Japanese and foreign stock market investors, said yesterday that it had gone bankrupt, with accumulated debt of $595 million.

To prevent the collapse of the Mexican economy, the United States and the International Monetary Fund pumped nearly $40 billion into support for the peso. **********Over the last decade, bond issues have tripled, securities transactions have increased more than tenfold, and foreign exchange transactions have quadrupled to $1 trillion a day, according to the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based institution that tries to help countries in financial trouble. **********\"We cannot simply expect those famous currency speculators to shut off their computer terminals, hang up their red suspenders and get a life,\" said Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, the host at the three-day summit meeting. \"But what we can do -- what we must do -- is take effective, concrete action to minimize the vulnerability of national economies.\" **********Among measures the leaders will look at are ways to improve the early-warning capabilities of the I.M.F. to respond more quickly to crises and to increase its resources to permit faster such response. **********A senior Canadian official said the measures would mean that \"various surprises in the market will be much less likely in the future.\" **********Another idea on the front burner, Canadian and American officials said, is the creation of a kind of international bankruptcy court in which the I.M.F. could stop debt payments by insolvent nations, organize new borrowing, and approve a plan to pay off creditors, much as courts now do under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings with private corporations. **********Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin accompanied the President here, along with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor. **********In an attempt to reassure investors that Washington supports a stronger dollar, Mr. Rubin said after a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, that he and Mr. Takemura had reaffirmed a finance ministers' assessment that exchange rates in Group of Seven countries were \"out of sync with the fundamentals.\" **********Japanese officials attribute their country's weakening economic performance this year to the persistent strength of the yen. **********At the April meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, a closing statement spoke of the need for an \"orderly reversal of exchange rate movements.\" **********The leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- arrived at Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base near here. In separate entourages, they sailed across one of the world's deepest harbors into Halifax. **********The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, joins the Group of Seven leaders on Friday for political discussions that are almost certain to include conditions in Bosnia, where more than 15,000 Bosnian Government troops are massed around Sarajevo for what looks like preparation for a major offensive. **********President Clinton's party took 20 minutes to cross the harbor aboard a brilliantly orange-colored 300-foot Canadian icebreaker, the Sir William Alexander. **********As they neared a wharf in the restored waterfront, a bagpiper pealed out a Scottish ballad from a bluff on nearby St. George's Island. A squad of eight police boats, equipped with twin 150-horsepower engines, flanked the Presidential vessel. **********Although security is tight around a downtown square kilometer known as the \"red zone,\" where the meetings are being held, there was an air of festivity and celebration, which had all the trappings of a giant Nova Scotia kitchen party. **********Two outdoor rock bands drowned out the bagpipes.

The leading Mexican stock index tumbled 106 points, or 6.85 percent.

The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, declined to 7.47, percent from 7.52 percent on Friday. **********Despite the shakiness in world markets, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, with 285.8 million shares changing hands, compared with the three-month average of 319 million. Declining issues on the Big Board outnumbered gainers, 1,608 to 632, for the first time in four sessions. **********American depository receipts for shares of Japanese companies were particularly hard hit because the Barings losses stemmed largely from trading in Japanese futures contracts on the Nikkei stock index. A.D.R.'s for the Sony Corporation dropped 1 7/8, to 42 5/8; those for the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company fell 2 3/8, to 139, and those for the Kyocera Corporation slumped 2, to 129. **********Transportation issues fell significantly, as the Dow Jones transportation index slipped 17 points, to 1,577.99. Among the railroads, Conrail shares were off 1 7/8, to 54; Burlington Northern down 1, to 55 3/8, and shares of the Union Pacific Corporation dropped 1/2, to 52 1/2. **********Among the airlines, the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, was off 3/4 a share, to 95; the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, fell 1 1/4 a share, to 60 1/2, and Delta Air Lines was off 1/8 a share, to 57 1/4. **********Many bank stocks also wound up on the down side after a recent upsurge, amid concern that the Barings failure could create similar instability here. Bankers Trust of New York closed at 62 3/4, down 3/4 a share, and J. P. Morgan closed at 63 5/8, down 1/2. **********One of the biggest declines in the Dow industrials was in shares of the General Electric Company, which fell 1 1/8, to 53 5/8. The Supreme Court yesterday let a group of Philadelphia residents proceed with a lawsuit to recover environmental contamination damages against seven companies, including G.E. **********The ITT Corporation dropped 3 1/4 a share, to 96 3/8, with some analysts indicating doubts about the company's heavy debt load. And Salomon fell 7/8, to 35 7/8, after it said more charges from accounting errors had been uncovered, increasing its 1994 loss to $399 million. **********Some companies managed to buck the trend yesterday. Shares of the Promus Companies rose 1/2, to 35 3/8, after a bill was introduced in the Pennsylvania Legislature to legalize riverboat gambling. Those of the Boston Scientific Corporation increased 7/8, to 21 3/8, after the approval on Friday by the Federal Trade Commission of its merger with two other companies.

His three new investments are funds of funds, which buy funds that Mr. Markman says will outperform their peers. Since February his Markman Multifund Trust, with three portfolios of funds, has attracted $45 million. **********John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, argues that investors are foolish to search for a fund manager who can outsmart the market for any length of time. He is a longtime proponent of index funds, which buy a fixed basket of stocks and deliver market returns. Roughly three-quarters of the fund managers trying to beat the Standard & Poor's 500 index the last 10 years have failed, he is fond of pointing out. **********Neither man seems to tire of trying to convince anyone who will listen of the virtues of his own investment philosophy. But now they have put some money on the table -- a $25 bet on whether Mr. Bogle's Vanguard Index Trust, which invests in the S.& P. 500, will outperform Mr. Markman's Multifund Trust the next five years. \"We're talking real money,\" said Mr. Bogle, whose penurious ways are well documented. **********Mr. Bogle, who wrote to Mr. Markman suggesting the wager, isstepping down early next year as chief executive of Vanguard, but he shows no sign of tempering his outspokenness about what he considers the follies of the fund industry. He argues that Mr. Markman's funds operate under a significant handicap. Investors must ante up twice for the funds of funds -- once to Mr. Markman for picking the funds and again to the funds directly. The investors will end up paying annual expenses that total nearly 2 percent of assets, compared with expenses of just 0.19 percent of assets for the Vanguard index fund. **********\"My own view, as you know, is that when one starts to pay large management fees -- and indeed management fees that are double or more in your trust -- the challenge of beating the index becomes even greater,\" Mr. Bogle wrote to Mr. Markman. **********Apparently sensing a marketing opportunity, Mr. Markman has taken up the challenge. \"You have most perceptively pegged me as a sporting fellow who is always ready to rise to an ennobling challenge,\" he replied. His investment company, based in Edina, Minn., controls nearly $300 million in mutual funds for individual clients, and he says he is confident that he can pick exceptional funds. **********In the last four years, his \"moderate\" portfolio of funds gained an average of 12.7 percent a year, compared with the 12.3 percent return of the S.& P. \"Given our wager, I am hoping that past performance will be indicative of future results,\" Mr. Markman wrote back. **********What has Mr. Markman picked as most likely to beat the market right now? His moderate portfolio has 10 funds, including notable names like Crabbe Huson Special; Longleaf Partners; Mutual Beacon and Discovery; Seligman Communications and Information; Sogen International, and the Yacktman fund. **********Mr. Markman seems able to attract both media attention and investors, but his bet with Mr. Bogle will not be settled until April Fool's Day in 2000. By then, Mr. Markman has to prove that he can pick winning funds -- and that his skill is worth nearly a percentage point of investors' assets every year. He also has to overcome some natural skepticism from people who remember Bernard Cornfeld, whose notorious fund of funds lost millions of dollars of investors' money in the 1960's. **********The Markman portfolio has beaten the market the last four years but underperformed the average equity fund, said John Rekenthaler, associate publisher for Morningstar Inc., the funds researchers in Chicago. In the last 15 years, the Vanguard index fund has edged out the diversified equity fund average in eight years based on annual returns. For Mr. Markman, \"I think it's going to be tough,\"Mr. Rekenthaler said. \"I'd bet on Jack.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/business/calpers-calls-bankers-trust-unresponsive.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Calpers Calls Bankers Trust Unresponsive", "print_headline": "Calpers Calls Bankers Trust Unresponsive", "body_text": " **********The California Public Employees' Retirement System contends that Bankers Trust New York Corporation is overpaying its chairman and ignoring requests to make its board more responsive to stockholders. **********James E.

Then he laid eyes on a Twingo, a perky little car built by Renault of France. **********\"Twingo's a really intelligent car,\" Mr. Grimaldi said, still giddy a year after buying one for the equivalent of $8,200. \"It's got a small baggage space, but you can enlarge it, and when you have no baggage you move the seats, and you've got more legroom in the back than in front.\" **********Mr. Grimaldi is not the only one who is smitten. After decades of buying bigger cars, Europeans are being forced by congested city streets, mounting gas prices and a desire to do something about the environment into taking another look at little cars. **********Indeed, the small car is making it back to the big time in Europe, recalling for many the golden age of the 1950's and 1960's, when Germans flitted around mostly in the Volkswagen Beetle, Italians in Fiat's tiny 500 and the French in the austere Citroen 2CV. **********After a slow start in 1993, Renault is now selling Twingos about as fast as it can make them -- nearly 20,000 a month. A tiny jelly bean of a car in splashy hues, the Twingo can seat four people comfortably, despite being only 11 feet 2 inches in length. That makes the Twingo about 2 feet shorter than a Volkswagen Beetle and roughly half the length of a Cadillac Fleetwood, the world's longest automobile made on a production line. **********Fiat of Italy has a winner, too, with its Cinquecento, an updated version of its classic 500. Fiat has sold more than 500,000 of the little round cars -- four-seaters that are only 10 feet 6 inches in length -- since they were introduced three years ago. Buoyed by the success of that model, Fiat is also updating two other small models, the Ypsilon 10 and the Panda. **********The European division of the Ford Motor Company announced plans in March to begin manufacturing next year a chopped-down version of the Fiesta, its smallest model, and Volkswagen says that within two years it will have a tinier model of its little Polo on the market. **********Not to be outflanked, the General Motors Corporation has decided to bring out a reworked version of its little Corsa in time to meet the competition from Ford and Volkwagen. **********And even Mercedes-Benz is getting into the act. By 1997 the German company, a unit of Daimler-Benz, plans to introduce a model now known as the Vision A, an elegant city car, which at 11 feet 4 inches in length will be the smallest Mercedes-Benz ever built. **********In addition, Mercedes-Benz has linked with the Swiss watch maker Swatch to produce an even smaller two-seater, known as the Micro Compact Car, but often called the Swatchmobile. That car is set to go into production in France in 1997. **********Because of advances in production, small cars have become cheaper to build, helping to shake their reputation for anemic profits. But so many auto makers are rushing in that industry experts are already worrying about a glut. **********\"What you could see is too many products, too much capacity,\" said Daniel T. Jones, a professor of auto industry management at the Cardiff University school of business in Wales. \"You will have tough competition, and the pricing will be terribly competitive.\" **********\"A lot of people are not going to make a lot of money in this sector,\" he added. \"But dare they not be there?\" **********There are no plans, however, to sell the cars in the United States, where fewer of the pressures exist that are driving the European market. American cities generally are less congested and have wider roads, with more parking. **********Also, the greater distances between cities in the United States make the greater comfort of large cars desirable to American drivers. Moreover, the price of gasoline in the United States is a fraction of what it is in Europe, which has heavy taxes. In Britain, for instance, unleaded gasoline costs $3 to $3.45 a gallon, and in Italy it costs $4 to $4.30. **********Traditionally, too, small European cars have often failed to meet the safety standards in the United States, though Kay Francis, a spokeswoman for Ford in Britain, said that was increasingly less so. \"A lot of the safety features of larger cars are built into this new generation -- side-impact bars, standard air bags,\" she said. **********The sales volume is modest for the smallest car now sold in the United States, the Geo Metro by General Motors, which is 12 feet 5 inches in length and is made in Canada in a joint venture with Suzuki. \"In general terms,\" Ms. Francis said, \"Americans are simply more interested in large vehicles.\" **********Europe, by contrast, has a history of being hospitable to small cars. But as European cars have grown during the years, along with Europeans' pocketbooks, the lowest segment has been left vacant and is now crying to be filled. **********What is going on, said Karl E. Ludvigsen, an auto consultant in London, \"is not so much the decision to create new niches as the need to continue to fill the gap at the bottom.\" **********Professor Jones of Cardiff University said manufacturers saw markets for the cars as trendy \"yuppie runabouts\" for northern Europeans and, in stripped-down versions, for drivers in southern and eastern Europe and farther afield in places like Latin America. **********The trend is a reversal of the industry's wisdom that until recently had caused auto makers to eschew small cars for generating small profits. **********What changed was that the European car makers learned to make small cars more quickly and with tooling that was less expensive. **********\"It's not only that the design is basic, but the tooling is simple as well,\" Professor Jones said. \"You take existing platforms, for example, and use more simple panels that require fewer strokes to press, say, three instead of five, which saves cost.\" **********Low-wage manufacturing sites also help to depress costs. Ford chose to build its new model in Spain and Fiat assembles the Cinquecento in Poland. G.M. is said to be leaning toward its new plant in Eisenach, in eastern Germany, for the new Corsa. **********The rush to the market by Ford is fairly typical in the small car derby. **********In announcing its decision in March to make an even smaller version of the Fiesta, the chairman of Ford Europe, Albert Caspers, said the company expected small cars' share of the market to grow to about 36 percent here by the end of the decade. The share was 32 percent last year, when a total of nearly 11.1 million passenger cars were sold in Western Europe. **********Indeed, Mr. Caspers said that in four of the last five years the Fiesta was the largest-selling car in Europe. In 1994 Fiesta sales jumped to 485,584 from 455,775 a year earlier. **********At the Geneva Auto Show last year, Ford showed a prototype of a small city car, called the Ka for an Egyptian deity, a four-seater that measured only 10 feet 9 inches in length. Ford now says the model that it will produce will not be identical to the Ka, but will be smaller than the Fiesta, which measures 12 feet 2 inches in length. **********Ms. Francis of Ford said the company expected women to be among the main customers for the new car, because by the end of the decade fully half the car purchases in Europe were expected to be made by women, compared with 26 percent today. Fiat says that 67 percent of the buyers of the Cinquecento are female. **********While some models, like the Mercedes-Benz Swatchmobile, are designed to be two-seaters, the prevailing view is that customers still prefer four-seat cars, though smaller and lighter. **********And despite their size, most models will come with numerous big-car features. Fiat says that roughly one-third the Cinquecentos it sells in Germany, its largest market outside Italy, are equipped with air-conditioning, a feature unheard of not long ago in European cars of any size. **********\"You're targeting anyone and everyone,\" said Richard Gadeselli, a spokesman at the Fiat headquarters in Turin. \"Seventeen-year-olds, retired people, families looking for a second car, wives. It's like Britain's old Rover Mini -- from the royal family to any family.\" **********And despite the fears that too many small cars are on the drawing board, the auto makers are accelerating their plans, pointing to past examples of new models expanding market demand. **********Matt Genrich, a spokesman for Volkswagen, cited the decision by the company in the 1980's to build the subcompact Polo, now its smallest model, which many said would bite into the sales of the next biggest model, the compact Golf. **********That did not happen, he said, adding, \"We make as much money on the Polo as on the Golf.\" **********Some companies are even looking way down the road for the next group of four-wheel mighty mites. **********At the Geneva Auto Show this year, for example, engineers for G.M. talked of a new generation of tiny fuel-efficient cars. **********The machines would be built of aluminum body sheets that would sharply improve handling and fuel efficiency by reducing the weight of the car by as much as one-quarter.

Let's get on with it and be more European: run commercials either between programs or simply several times each evening in large blocks. **********Here is the key to making this palatable to the PBS hierarchy: create a higher standard for the commercials, a standard similar to the one now in place for the \"introductions\" we now see to identify corporate sponsorship on public television. **********For example, the creative teams at advertising agencies could easily take existing footage and fashion a more \"Japanese\" commercial -- a commercial of greater than normal length; one which uses copy, images, and music to create a mood; a piece which enhances an image. A \"noncommercial\" commercial. **********The resulting spots would probably be a joy to watch, inasmuch as many of our better commercials are directed, photographed and edited by the most creative talents working in film. The advertising agency personnel involved would be given a chance to stretch themselves. **********PBS must also begin to act professional on licensing. There is no excuse for the \"Barneys\" of this world to be paid for delivering programming that in turn makes the programmer fabulously wealthy. PBS should at least be an equal partner in any such enterprise. If PBS is not up to handling these situations, it must pay an agent's commission to negotiate these deals.

Called video conferencing, it has been hailed as a way to cut travel budgets and save wear and tear on valuable executives. **********If you saw the technology simulated in such recent films as \"Johnny Mnemonic,\" you might think that TV-quality pictures and conversation-speed audio were the norm. But even in today's best systems, video, though improving, still jerks a bit. **********That is because digitized video is huge, usually hundreds of millions of bytes for a few seconds' worth, compared with just a few hundred thousand for a full-length novel. The technical solution for video conferencing either required an expensive, high-capacity phone line or a tortuous technique to squeeze the video onto a regular phone line, so these products never found a large market. **********But as consumers help drive down the cost of the integrated services digital network, or I.S.D.N. -- a fast-growing digital telephone service that uses existing copper phone lines to provide a much larger conduit for information than traditional analog phone lines -- they are also driving open the door for new services, including video conferencing. **********The Intel Corporation and the Oracle Corporation may be the first companies to answer this particular opportunity's knock. Capitalizing on growing consumer interest in I.S.D.N. and the popularity of on-line services that increasingly must deliver pictures and sound, Oracle and Intel have recently started an initiative to combine two of their existing (and under-used) technologies to deliver video and interactive services over I.S.D.N.'s larger-volume lines. **********With I.S.D.N. as the conduit, Intel's Proshare PC-based video conferencing product and Oracle's Media Server together allow users to record, store and retrieve video messages in almost exactly the same way that people record, store and retrieve E-mail or news and information from corporate networks or on-line services today. **********As demonstrated, the video is still jerky and runs in a tiny window, but it is far beyond anything now available from other on-line services. Eventually, said Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, they would like to sell the system to enough providers to create a new level of \"video enabled\" on-line services. **********In fact, as part of the demonstration, Mr. Ellison had cobbled up a service called Oracle Video Online, which delivered television news on demand and provided video E-mail and shopping services. Mr. Ellison said Oracle and Intel would jointly test the Oracle Video Online concept this summer. They are signing up communications and entertainment companies to participate. **********If they decide to build consumer services based on the Intel-Oracle technology, both companies' products would be propelled into a market where customers may eventually number in the millions. Beyond the business markets that would be happily served by a cheap and useful video conferencing system, the consumer market for an even cheaper and easier-to-use video telephone/on-line service combination could be the product that gives nontechnophiles enough reason to sign up for interactive services. **********No one knows if television news-on-demand or on-line video shopping malls will spark consumer imaginations. But it is hard to imagine that a video telephone system enabled by this technology, priced under $1,000, would not be a huge hit with parents, grandparents and children in households with computers. **********While Oracle and Intel may be first to package a service, they won't have the field to themselves for long. Taking a slightly cockeyed potshot at one of his company's rivals, the Microsoft Corporation, Mr. Ellison claimed that Oracle's video-on-demand system was \"the only working system today.\" **********Oracle is part of three interactive TV trials, but both Microsoft, with cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., and Silicon Graphics, with Time Warner Cable, are delivering video services in their Redmond, Wash. and Orlando, Fla. trials. **********Both Apple Computer and the AT&T Corporation, with their respective QuickTime Conferencing software and Worldworx multimedia network, could conceivably join to transform Apple's underwhelming eWorld on-line service into something like Oracle Video Online. **********And Intel has stated that it will work with other companies as their products are readied for the market. **********More to the point, it would be folly to believe that Microsoft -- or any other on-line provider -- would ignore the commercial possibilities of a video-enhanced, I.S.D.N.-based on-line service that allows people to send each other video E-mail easily. **********Just a few years ago, when on-line services were still virtually unknown, I.S.D.N. was widely scorned because it used copper wire instead of high-speed high-capacity fiber optic cable. Critics who said its initials meant, \"It Still Does Nothing\" are eating their words: I.S.D.N. is the fastest-growing telephone service in decades.

The leftist guerrillas seek publicity, rural development and nationalization of the oil industry. **********A federal jury in the United States last September ordered the Exxon Corporation to pay Alaskans $5 billion in damages. But Colombia has no means to stop the guerrilla attacks or to recover damage costs from the two guerrilla groups responsible -- the National Liberation Army and the Revolution Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. **********\"No one has ever calculated how much the FARC owe,\" said Cecilia Lopez Montano, Colombia's Environment Minister, referring to the nation's largest and oldest guerrilla group. \"It might be counterproductive to calculate the fine. It might encourage them to run up the bill.\" **********A study by the ministry covering 1989 through 1991 found that guerrilla pipeline bombings polluted 375 miles of creeks and rivers and fouled 12,500 acres, ranging from tropical wetlands to Andean watersheds. **********Colombian environmental groups largely avoid talking about the oil spill issue, apparently fearing violent reprisals from the guerrillas. The Government owns the 484-mile pipeline and takes up to 90 percent of oil produced by foreign companies here, with 50 percent representing the Government's share and 40 percent representing tax payments. **********After nearly four decades of guerrilla warfare, most Colombians hardly take notice of the almost weekly pipeline attacks. **********\"The guerrillas just don't care about foreign opinion, or about national opinion,\" said Ms. Lopez Montano. **********Nor have the attacks stirred much response from international environmental groups. \"To campaign, you need a target -- a government, an industry, someone who is responsible,\" Paul Horsman, international campaigner for Greenpeace, said in a telephone interview from the group's headquarters in Britain. **********A brief flurry of national outrage occurred in late January when 4,000 barrels of crude polluted the Magdalena River, Colombia's main river artery.

During the last decade, pipeline attacks have cost Colombia about $1 billion in lost sales. **********With its new environmental program, the Government has tightened its regulation of foreign oil firms. **********Last August, the British Petroleum Exploration Company, the largest foreign oil operator here, paid a $300,000 fine for drilling five wells without permits and for causing minor pollution. British Petroleum maintains that when the wells were drilled in 1991, the permit process was unclear. **********\"We think that oil companies should be fined for negligence,\" said Byron E. Grote, an American who is British Petroleum's executive director for Latin America. \"We don't start any facility without environmental drills.\" **********Since commercial oil production started four months ago at British Petroleum's huge Casanare field, not a barrel of oil has been spilled, company officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/economic-scene-phasing-out-protection-for-textiles-may-take-a-silver-bullet.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Phasing out protection for textiles may take a silver bullet.", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Phasing out protection for textiles may take a silver bullet.", "body_text": " **********DOES the right hand of the Clinton Administration know what the left hand is doing? **********Bill Clinton ran for the White House as a global economic realist, the President who would champion high-paying, high-technology jobs while allowing senescent industries to go gently into that good night. But the bureaucrats who must turn these fine sentiments into day-to-day policy have apparently not gotten the message, digging in against efforts to open markets to everything from Chinese honey to Colombian roses. **********Actually, the idea that bureaucrats are undermining White House trade policy without the President's knowledge is the charitable view. While President Clinton fought for the last round of global trade liberalization, he never sweated the details. And plans announced last week for phasing out protection for clothing and textiles -- what Kimberly Elliott, a researcher at the Institute of International Economics, calls \"the last great bastion of protectionism\" -- suggest the President is, at the very least, a passive accomplice to the regression of his own Administration. **********No part of the recent world trade agreement was greeted with more enthusiasm by free traders than the commitment to untangle a rat's nest of quotas and tariffs that has governed world trade in apparel and textiles for three decades. Ms. Elliott and Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, estimate that unlimited imports would reduce clothing costs in the United States by 18 percent. **********Price breaks would almost certainly be steepest at the low end -- underwear, children's apparel, cotton pants and shirts -- where the struggling middle class does its shopping. \"The benefits should add up to as much as the House Republicans' proposed middle class tax cut,\" said Robin Lenier, a lobbyist for clothing retailers, \"and it wouldn't cost Washington a penny.\" **********What's more, the jobs at risk are not the ones America has been mourning since the 1970's. They typically pay less than $7 an hour. And if there is one clear lesson from a decade of booming employment and slipping wages, America has no problem replacing bad jobs. **********But as the retailers are discovering, it will take a silver bullet to kill the global quota system  known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. The United States has 10 years to get with the program, and the Washington bureaucrats who just firmed up plans to phase out protection are plainly in no hurry. Phase I (1995-97) includes such treasured items as parachutes and seat belts. Phases II and III, extending to 2004, cover just 11 percent of the categories where quotas actually bite. **********Retailers initially expected that some of the pressure on clothing prices would be relieved by a parallel agreement allowing the volume of imports entering under quota to expand. But the numbers hammered out at Geneva are too modest to make a dent: Demand for clothing is still likely to outpace quota-constrained supply. **********That will leave the domestic industry sitting pretty until it falls off a precipice in 2005. Some 150,000 jobs, albeit very low-paying jobs, would be put at risk in a single year rather than phased out over a decade. \"We knew the phase-out schedule would be backloaded, but this is worse than we feared,\" Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, lamented. **********The smart money says it will never come to that. Once the precipice is in view, Congress will likely break the trade accord, extending the quota unilaterally. As a last resort, domestic apparel producers could ask the International Trade Commission to impose \"temporary\" quotas to save them from injury from the expected surge of imports -- a tactic akin to that of a parent killer who demands mercy as an orphan. **********There is no shortage of villains. Rita Hayes, the Commerce Department official who wrote the rules, has close ties to Congressmen from the Southern textile states. So does Jennifer Hillman, the deputy to the United States trade representative in charge of apparel. Her boss, Mickey Kantor, has made no secret of his sympathies, announcing just one day after public hearings that there would be no changes in the proposed phase-out schedule. And, of course, there is Mr. Kantor's boss, Bill Clinton, who appointed them all. **********But in a tepid defense of the President, Ms. Lenier points out that his Administration is merely going along with a game that started long, long ago. \"The program stinks -- and the program's 30 years old,\" she said. While Republican Presidents were ideologically committed to free trade and not beholden to the apparel makers' unions, they, too, avoided tangling with the textile lobby. **********The tragedy here is President Clinton's inability to break free from interest group politics as usual. The New Democrat pledged to reconcile liberal sympathies for the losers in the capitalist free-for-all with the new realities of a globally integrated economy has been left with the dirty work of defending the industrial dinosaurs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/25/business/european-official-fears-sprint-venture-might-muzzle-competition.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "European Official Fears Sprint Venture Might Muzzle Competition", "print_headline": "European Official Fears Sprint Venture Might Muzzle Competition", "body_text": " **********The Sprint Corporation's attempt to form a global alliance with the French and German telephone companies hit another obstacle yesterday, when a top official of the European Union sharply criticized a joint venture at the center of the deal between the European partners. **********His objection raised fresh doubts about the ability of Sprint to consummate its $4.2 billion deal with France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, in which the three companies hope to offer global communications services to multinational corporations. **********The companies have already slipped well behind their original schedule for signing a final agreement, as they continue to wrangle over the precise terms of the deal. Last week, they missed a second self-imposed deadline, though executives still say they are close to a deal. **********But in a blunt statement issued yesterday, the European commissioner for competition, Karel Van Miert, sharply criticized plans by the French and German companies to form a joint venture called Atlas and said it might stifle competition. **********As envisioned, Atlas would bear much of the responsibility for marketing voice and data services in Europe and the rest of the world while Sprint assumed primary responsibility for providing service to corporations based in the United States. **********Under the proposed alliance with Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom plan to acquire 20 percent of Sprint's stock for $4.2 billion. Sprint would then assume responsibility for marketing and providing global communications services to companies in the United States, while the French and Germans would each sell to companies within their borders. Together, the three companies' venture would serve the rest of Europe and much of the world. **********Mr. Van Miert said that the French and German phone companies currently control more than 75 percent of the telephone market within their borders and that this would hinder the development of new competition because France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom would explicitly refrain from entering each other's markets. **********\"The main victims will be small and medium-sized companies, whose choice of service providers will be reduced and who are not in a position to exert any downward pressure on the prices of such services,\" Mr. Van Miert said. \"Competition will suffer a setback precisely at the time that action taken by the commission to liberalize all telecommunications services except basic voice services should begin to bear its fruit.\" **********The European Union is in the process of opening national telephone markets to competition, most of which are now dominated by state-owned or state-supported monopolies, and the current goal is to eliminate most regulatory barriers by 1998. **********Sydney Shaw, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said yesterday that Atlas was crucial to the alliance because it would manage the French and German companies' efforts outside their own borders.

It's the screams. **********The veterinarian around the corner was pinned in his house after it collapsed in the earthquake, but he shouted that he was all right. **********And so Shizuko Hirajima shouted back and told him he would be O.K., and she worked frantically to rescue other neighbors who seemed to be in greater need. **********When the fire erupted, there was not enough time to go back and dig the vet out of his home, so they stood at the edge of the blistering heat and listened as he burned to death. **********\"We could hear him call out,\" she said, shivering. \" 'Help me!' he shouted. 'Help me!' But we couldn't do a thing. We just had to stand there.\" **********The inferno has since been extinguished, and the temblor's survivors are adapting to their new lives as homeless beggars. In Mrs. Hirajima's case, she is dealing with the screams that haunt her by going deaf; she has lost much of her hearing since the quake struck on Tuesday. The veterinarian's shouts no longer echo in her head, but she cannot hear much else, either. **********The reaction of Mrs. Hirajima, a graying woman of 61 years who wrings her hands endlessly, is unusual. But it reflects the drive of most of the millions of people in the earthquake zone to adjust to what has happened and get on with their new lives. **********It is this resilience that is most striking more than four days after western Japan was struck by the great earthquake, which left more than 4,900 people dead and 202 missing and feared dead in the rubble. It also caused tens of billions of dollars in damage, making it one of the most expensive natural disasters in history. **********A daylong hike through the disaster zone leaves one with a taste of amazement at the scale of destruction, pain at the quiet suffering of families that are smaller than they were a week ago, and above all of respect for the determination of newly made paupers to press on with their lives. **********Mrs. Hirajima, for instance, has done more than just become deaf. She and her neighbors extricated themselves from their damaged houses and, still in their pajamas, rushed around pulling other people from the debris. Then they fought fires. And now the Hirajimas and half a dozen other families have taken over a tiny public garden and set up camp. **********They have pitched tents and sleep in them in turns, because there are not enough to go around. They have also dug a latrine, curtained off with cloth fished from the rubble, and built a campfire and organized a rotation for cooking duties. They spend free time at their former homes, searching for anything that can still be of use. **********Mrs. Hirajima still cannot sleep at night, for fear of new earthquakes, and she has to fight back the memories of the veterinarian, and of the beautician who lived down another street. The beautician, a 60-year-old woman, was entombed when the house collapsed on her, but she could still shout out that she was unhurt. **********For hours, Mrs. Hirajima reassured the beautician, telling her it was going to be O.K., as the neighbors tried to dig her out. But it was impossible without equipment to move the slabs of concrete, and the beautician's voice began to fade. They last heard her voice 24 hours after the earthquake, and a couple of days later, when the heavy machinery finally arrived, her body was recovered. **********\"When I look at the rubble of her house, I'm scared,\" Mrs. Hirajima said. \"I figure that her spirit will come out from the debris. Her spirit must be angry at the way she died. Because she cried out, 'Help me!' But we didn't help.\" Reactions Some Laugh Away Their Pains **********Everywhere in the disaster zone, faces are lined with new creases that testify to ways they are bearing the unbearable. In the hard-hit neighborhoods, everyone knows someone who has been killed, and many feel perhaps the most wrenching pain of all: the shock of parents who survive their children. **********One man, Kitai Lin, reportedly held his only son in his arms for 56 hours as they were trapped inside a six-story building that had collapsed. Mr. Lin cradled the boy, 6-year-old Tatsuya, as they lay in the darkness, pinned underneath a refrigerator and a bed, waiting for rescuers to reach them. **********\"My child is in my arms,\" Mr. Lin is said to have shouted just before being rescued. \"We're all right.\" **********But after surviving for two and a half days in the rubble without food or water, the boy died shortly after rescuers pried them free. Mr. Lin is one of many in western Japan for whom a 20-second temblor means more anguish than a lifetime can assuage. **********The paradox is that in a zone of so much sadness, good cheer is also extraordinarily abundant. There sometimes seem to be more happy people in Kobe than sad ones. **********Norio Horinouchi, a lean 66-year-old in eastern Kobe, speaks lightly of how the earthquake knocked down his house, killing six people on the floor below him. \"I had been on the second floor, and then I realized I was on the first floor,\" he recalled. \"When I felt the house shake, I thought that was the last moment of my life.\" **********Asked why he seemed so cheerful, Mr. Horinouchi grinned. **********\"When my sons came to look for me, they were in tears to find that their father was fine,\" he said, glowing with pleasure. \"They were so happy! I knew that I loved my sons, and that they loved me.\" **********Kazuko Ando, a 53-year-old matron whose husband is in the hospital with a back injury, joked about the difficulties of life in a refugee shelter, now that her home has collapsed. Asked how she can joke, she shrugged. **********\"We can laugh and smile,\" she said. \"After all, we know that lots of folks in this area really are suffering with worse problems. Some people down that street lost their youngest child. Over there, a young couple was killed. But my family members, we're all safe.\" **********The eeriest time to be in Kobe is at night, when the back alleys are dark and silent and the only sound is endless sirens in the distance. The alleys are strewn with bricks and beams, and here and there a building leans so far over that it is difficult to squeeze by it. **********On the sides are the hulking shadows of abandoned, damaged houses and the open spaces where homes collapsed into piles of debris -- some of which still contain bodies, or even perhaps a person still alive but now at the limits of endurance. **********At the end of one such alley, just before it ended abruptly where a home lay toppled onto its side, a dozen former residents of the former houses were sitting around a campfire, cooking dinner and laughing heartily. When a visitor showed up, they beamed and offered a chair and began cracking jokes. **********\"We're in pain, of course, but to cheer ourselves up we get together and laugh from the bottom of our hearts,\" explained Kunimasa Nakata, a 43-year-old engineer and the group's chief comic. \"At any moment, we're scared. But at least this way, if there's another earthquake and I'm killed, I won't die alone.\" Looting Reports of Looters Are Mostly Rumor **********Mr. Nakata and other quake victims said the disaster had in some ways brought out the best in people, inspiring a degree of altruism and cooperation not always present in the hurly-burly of mundane jobs. **********Almost everyone interviewed also said that alongside the cooperation, looting had become a serious problem, and many expressed shock and embarrassment that such crimes could happen in Japan. Yet when people were pressed, the reports of looting almost always seemed to be little more than rumors. **********A policeman in central Kobe, for instance, said gravely that looting was a significant problem that had led to increased police patrols. But he acknowledged that he did not actually know of any cases of theft. **********One woman said she had found signs that someone had entered her damaged home when she was away, although she did not actually find anything missing. And one man said that two bicycles had been taken from in front of his house during the first hectic hours after the earthquake, although one explanation is that they may have been seized to rescue someone. **********There was one clear case of looting. On Thursday, several young men heaved a rock through a window of a mini-market and grabbed some food and ran. \"I don't know how much was taken, because everything was still on the floor from the earthquake, and we didn't have time to count the missing merchandise,\" a store clerk said. **********Asked if he was surprised that Japanese should engage in such Los Angeles-style practices as post-earthquake looting, the store clerk was momentarily dumbfounded. **********\"No, you misunderstood,\" he said firmly. \"These looters weren't Japanese. They were foreigners. We saw them. Three young foreign guys.\" Koreans Helping All, Without Bias **********The looters were not Koreans. But in fact the largest foreign population in Kobe by far is that of ethnic Koreans, who have lived in Japan for generations. Such Koreans often face discrimination in Japan, and there have long been tensions between them and their Japanese neighbors. **********After the last great earthquake in Japan, the one that devastated Tokyo and killed more than 140,000 people in 1923, rumors spread that ethnic Koreans were lighting fires and poisoning the few remaining water sources -- even that they had contrived to cause the earthquake itself. Japanese mobs hunted down and beat to death any Koreans they could find. Estimates of those killed range up to 6,000. **********The aftermath of the quake of 1995 suggests that relations have improved, for no tensions have been reported between Japanese and Koreans in Kobe. **********\"People rescued anybody who cried out for help,\" said Kang Chu Ok, a 38-year-old Korean housewife in one of the worst-hit parts of Kobe. \"Nobody paid attention to whether the victim was Korean or Japanese. People helped me just as if I were Japanese.\" **********Mrs. Kang, who spoke in the alley in front of her new home, now tilting precariously and devoid of its front wall, said firefighters had given the same priority to fires in Korean homes as to fires in Japanese homes. Officials with the two Korean associations -- one linked to South Korea, the other to North Korea -- also said they had not heard of any discrimination against their members. Casualties Busy Hospitals, Busy Morgues **********The second-busiest person in Kobe these days may be Yosuke Matsumura, deputy director of the Kobe Western City Hospital, in one of the worst-hit areas. Mr. Matsumura was at home when the earthquake struck, but he immediately hiked the 10 miles to the hospital -- no other transportation was available -- and began treating the wave of patients with burns and other injuries. **********Mr. Matsumura has not been home since, and he has scarcely slept. The hospital's first crisis was that it had no emergency generator, and the lights went out and two patients on respirators died in the confusion. One was a cancer patient, the other had pneumonia. **********A woman was also in advanced labor, with the crown of the baby's head already visible. The doctors decided that the woman could not give birth by herself, but they dared not perform a Caesarean section with no lights or electricity. Despite her state, they put her in an ambulance and took her over rubble-strewn streets to another hospital where the Caesarean was performed successfully. **********As 1,600 patients swarmed the hospital, the atmosphere was virtual chaos. **********\"It was difficult beyond imagination,\" Mr. Matsumura recalled. \"On the first floor, patients were told to stanch their bleeding themselves, and to find a place on their own to lie down, because there was no space. And 65 people were brought in already dead, to be revived by us, but we had to focus on the living.\" **********While none of the hospital's doctors were killed, some had lost their homes or had family members missing, and that did not help their concentration. Two of the 260 nurses are still missing, and many staff members are having problems getting to work because of traffic jams and impassable roads. **********It is getting better, however. The hospital now has electricity, and while it does not have running water, two portable toilets have been installed outside the front door. The stream of patients has slowed as well. **********If Mr. Matsumura is the second-busiest person in Kobe, perhaps the busiest is Akihiko Hagisawa, an undertaker. **********\"For three days after the earthquake I didn't sleep a wink, and then I got five hours' sleep, and then I haven't slept since,\" Mr. Hagisawa said as he drove a body to a temporary resting place in a school auditorium. **********The problem is not just that the area around Kobe has an extra 5,000 bodies to dispose of. The undertakers themselves lost employees in the earthquake, and the local government was so overwhelmed at first that it could not issue the death certificates necessary before bodies can be picked up. **********Then the problem became where to find the extra coffins and how to find enough hearses -- or even station wagons -- to carry them to the crematoriums. In any case, with the gas supply cut off, the crematoriums could no longer dispose of bodies, and so they piled up in spare rooms of the schools that are used everywhere as refugee shelters. **********The new homeless find themselves sleeping in one room of a school, while loved ones are laid out along with dozens of other bodies in another room. The winter air is cool, but even so the bodies are beginning to smell, and relatives are outraged. **********\"When I go to a school to take away a body, people surround me and ask for help in cremating other bodies as well,\" Mr. Hagisawa said. \"We want to cremate them, but there's a long line to cremate.\" **********It will take a month to dispose of all of the bodies left from the earthquake, Mr. Hagisawa estimated. In the meantime, the problem may get worse. **********\"With so many people still missing,\" Mr. Hagisawa said grimly, \"I think the backlog of corpses is only going to get longer.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/business/at-work-the-new-deal-on-drug-testing.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Noble", "pub_date": "1995-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Work; The New Deal on Drug Testing", "print_headline": "At Work; The New Deal on Drug Testing", "body_text": " **********A FAR-REACHING piece of legislation slipped into effect last week, under the very noses of the new majority on Capitol Hill who would eradicate all evidence of regulatory activism. Prudence, perhaps, on the part of the agency involved, the Transportation Department, dictated a slight delay in one of the measure's provisions, but the delay is unlikely to stave off its inevitability. It is safe to say that few of the people affected by the measure are happy. **********Congress passed the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 in the wake of an alcohol-related accident on a New York subway that killed several people. The legislation broadens the coverage and scope of alcohol- and drug-testing programs for \"safety sensitive\" employees in several transportation industries, expanding by at least three million the number of workers who would be covered. The measure would have gone into effect several months ago but for bureaucratic delays. Those delays held up the publication of the rules in the Federal Register until last February, giving employers almost 11 months to prepare for the changes. **********As often happens with Federal edicts, the only person willing to express pleasure at the new fiat was the official in charge. \"A transportation workplace free of drug and alcohol misuse is vital to the safety of the traveling public,\" Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in December. \"Gaining the benefits of alcohol and drug testing starting now is a high safety priority.\" **********The measure requires random testing of almost seven and a half million workers. It affects some 6.6 million holders of commercial driver's licenses, almost double the number currently covered; 340,000 pilots, air traffic controllers, attendants and other airline workers; 80,000 railroad employees, including engineers, signalers and dispatchers; 200,000 operators, controllers and maintenance workers for mass transit vehicles; 120,000 pipeline operators, and 120,000 maritime workers. The Jan. 1 effective date applies to companies with 50 or more safety-sensitive employees. Smaller companies have another year to comply. **********The law prohibits safety-sensitive employees from working within four hours -- eight hours for pilots and other members of flight crews -- of using alcohol, or while showing an alcohol concentration in the blood of more than .04 percent. All use of illegal substances is prohibited. The law requires pre-employment testing; post-accident testing; \"reasonable suspicion\" testing of employees who appear to be impaired, and testing of those who return to work after an evaluation or rehabilitation. Companies can use a variety of medical tests and breath-test devices. **********THE law was a response to two spectacular tragedies. In 1987, 16 people were killed in a collision of Conrail and Amtrak trains in Maryland. Members of the Conrail crew were found to have been smoking marijuana. And in 1991, five people were killed in a high-speed subway derailment in New York. The motorman, Robert E. Ray, had been drinking for several hours before the crash. He was eventually convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to prison. In addition, alcohol use by the captain of the Exxon Valdez was apparently a factor in the accident that spilled millions of gallons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska. **********Naturally then, the imposition of widespread testing has a certain emotional appeal to the public, but both industry and employee groups complain that the new rules are flawed. The transportation industry, for example, questions Government estimates that the regulations will save lives -- or at least enough to balance the price tag and aggravation -- and eventually bring an annual benefit of some $700 million. At a news conference last year to announce the rules, Mr. Pena acknowledged they would probably cost the industry $200 million a year but asserted alcohol is involved in 13,000 crashes each year. **********Employee representatives are more worried about the threat to privacy implicit in any widespread drug-testing program and have challenged at least one version of the rules in court. **********The pre-employment testing requirement is on hold for at least four months, until the Transportation Department decides if new breath-testing equipment is as effective as the standard equipment now in use. Sales of that equipment, one employer group notes, remain flat, indicating the possibility of \"widespread employer noncompliance.\" All of which proves there's more than one way to skin a regulator. LABOR LAW REFORM: AN UPDATE **********THE business community screamed when, his first year in office, President Clinton appointed a commission to study labor law reform. Almost to a person, so the complaint went, the panel members leaned toward labor. In fact, the Dunlop Commission, as it came to be known, after its boss, former Labor Secretary John T. Dunlop, has generally kept to the radical middle, listening patiently to employer demands for more workplace flexibility as well as to criticism from labor about what it calls a blatant corporate disregard for the National Labor Relations Act. **********The commission is said to be ready to deliver a final report that includes a compromise of sorts: support for a measure that would make it easier to form collective bargaining units and for changes in the labor law that would make it easier to form employee committees, e.g., high-performance teams, a practice now made difficult by a provision that outlaws \"sham unions.\" Such a change could easily threaten the heart of the law that protects the right to unionize. Some in organized labor believe they stand to lose quite a bit more than they will gain. Maybe the deck wasn't so stacked after all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/20/business/executive-changes-060795.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********BOSTON COMPANY ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. , Boston, appointed Alexander Webb 3d vice chairman and chief investment officer.

It would open an outlet to the sea for Paraguay and Bolivia and would help the region's new Southern Common Market. The waterway, which could cost as much as $1 billion, would also run through parts of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. **********President Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, whose office here overlooks the brown, slow-moving waters of the Paraguay River, said the waterway would help the country overcome its sense of being landlocked. \"Instead of barges carrying 500 tons, we would able to have barges carrying 2,000 tons,\" he said. **********The Inter-American Development Bank is directing the project and would finance a major part of it with matching funds from the five countries involved if environmental approval is received. **********But environmentalists fear that the river-dredging and channeling project would pull the plug on the world's largest wetlands, the Pantanal in Brazil, an area that is home to 600 bird species. Down river, it would cause flooding, they say. **********\"The five-country region can little afford the destruction seen in the Mississippi and Everglades,\" the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington-based group, warned recently about the Hidrovia. **********\"If you cut through the river meanders and blow up the rocks, the river is going to run faster, and it's going to flood faster,\" warned RaulGauto, executive director of a leading environmental group here, the Moises Bertoni Foundation. **********Scientists say the Pantanal wetlands act like a vast sponge, regulating the flow of rainwater into the Paraguay River. It now takes about six months for water to flow from the Pantanal to the Atlantic Ocean. Hydrologists argue that faster flows could expose down-river areas to flash flooding. **********\"Catastrophic flooding downstream becomes a real possibility,\" warned a recent study by Wetlands for the Americas, a conservation group based in Buenos Aires. **********With fresh memories of billions of dollars in damage caused by the Mississippi floods of 1993, the Development Bank signed contracts in February for $10 million in engineering and environmental-impact studies for the project. Work could start late next year if an agreement can be reached. **********Officials of Paraguay's National Port and Shipping Authority say the environmentalists are alarmists. **********\"For a long time, we have been dredging the river, from 5 feet down to 15 feet, and nothing has happened,\" said Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, director of the agency. He said the new project would benefit 17 million people in the region. **********Some scientists challenge his contentions, though. After the Pantanal suffered its worst drought in 20 years last year, they questioned whether faster river flows from the dredging were already drying out the 50,000-square-mile marsh, which is considered the world's most biologically diverse wetland. **********With a little more straightening, dredging and marking, the Paraguay River would be in shape to allow expanded barge convoys to sail at night. The larger and faster convoys could cut shipping costs in half and open up South America's heartland to new economic ventures, including soy farming for export in eastern Bolivia and iron and manganese mining in western Brazil. **********The supporters of the Hidrovia also contend that the alternatives to the waterway could have a worse impact on the environment. **********\"The pollution caused by a barge convoy is nothing compared with building a highway through the forest and sending 300 trucks over it,\" said Juan Wenninger, Paraguay's Deputy Minister of Transportation. **********In Brazil, the region's economic giant, businesses have been looking for alternatives to a steadily deteriorating highway network. **********Only 2 percent of freight moves on waterways in Brazil, compared with 25 percent in the United States and 28 percent in Germany. But Sao Paulo State recently opened a 1,500-mile, $1.6 billion waterway that links Sao Paulo with Paraguay's second largest city, Ciudad del Este on the Parana-Tiete River system. **********Indeed, businesses are already turning the Paraguay and Parana Rivers into a major economic artery. **********The world's largest sugar refinery opened this year in Tangara, Brazil, and barges loaded with sugar are already floating down river to Argentina. In return, barges have been carrying Argentine wheat to markets up river. Other companies are shipping timber and diesel fuel. **********Last year, Glencore, a Brazilian trading company, shipped 5,000 tons of soy from Caceres to the Atlantic. The company plans to ship 27,000 tons this year. **********\"Trying to stop the Hidrovia is not morally right, because so many people are going to benefit,\" said Mr. Gauto, the Paraguayan environmentalist. \"But we should try to get on the ship, so we can steer the ship from the inside.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/28/business/company-reports-dow-chemical-earnings-post-a-sharp-climb.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Chemical Earnings Post A Sharp Climb", "print_headline": "COMPANY REPORTS; Dow Chemical Earnings Post A Sharp Climb", "body_text": " **********The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that earnings more than doubled in the second quarter, reflecting higher prices for its chemicals and plastics products, particularly in Europe. **********Including a charge for a write-off on the Dow Corning Corporation and a gain from the sale of its pharmaceuticals business, Dow Chemical earned $503 million, or $1.84 a share, compared with $250 million, or 91 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********\"It was a very good quarter, and earnings were higher than what Wall Street expected,\" said Stephen Roberts, an analyst with Roney & Company in Detroit. \"Everything was just a little bit stronger than people thought.\" **********Shares of Dow Chemical rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $74.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., is the nation's second-largest chemical company, after E.

The Japanese company has produced more than 100 million Trinitron color televisions since introducing the technology in 1968. **********But Sony has lagged behind many of its Japanese competitors in the development of flat screens that might one day replace the bulky cathode ray tube. Sony is not even a participant in the fast-growing business of making liquid crystal displays for notebook computers. **********To get back into the race, Sony has turned to others. Its new \"plasmatron\" display is based on technology developed by Tektronix Inc. a Wilsonville, Ore., company, and then refined by Sony. The approach seeks to combine the best features of two existing types of flat screens -- liquid crystal displays and plasma displays. **********Active matrix liquid crystal displays, now used for advanced laptop computers, use a separate transistor to control each picture element. The screen is essentially a giant semiconductor chip made on glass and is difficult to make free of defects. Many engineers believe it will be impossible to economically manufacture active-matrix screens larger than about 15 inches. **********Plasma displays use ionized gases that are excited by an electric voltage and create light for the image. Plasma technology can be used to make screens of 40 inches or even larger. But Sony says the picture is not as clear as with the liquid crystal technology. **********Sony's technology uses a liquid crystal display to create the image. But instead of controlling each picture element with a transistor, Sony controls the pixels with plasma. The ionized gas essentially acts as an on-off switch. **********Sony said the screen could be produced using less precise technology than the advanced semiconductor techn ology needed for active-matrix liquid crystal displays. That should result in lower costs. But the company gave no information regarding costs or prices. **********Sony will have to play catch-up with the existing plasma technology. Fujitsu Ltd. is already selling 21-inch plasma displays and expects to begin making 42-inch displays at about the same time as Sony begins selling its 25-inch screens. **********In a separate development, the Sanyo Electric Company said it would begin selling a television set that would let consumers watch television shows in three dimensions. **********The television set can convert two-dimensional images, from a broadcast, videotape or laser disk, into three dimensions by dividing the pictures into left-side and right-side images. Viewers wear special glasses to see the three-dimensional effect. **********The new television set, 33.5 inches wide by 22 inches high, will be available only in Japan starting next month at a price of 380,000 yen, or about $4,500."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/14/business/market-place-archer-daniels-midland-stock-is-off-but-some-see-a-buy.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1995-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Archer-Daniels-Midland stock is off, but some see a buy.", "print_headline": "Market Place; Archer-Daniels-Midland stock is off, but some see a buy.", "body_text": " **********SHARES of Archer-Daniels-Midland have been pummeled in the last week after disclosures about an unusually broad and aggressive criminal antitrust investigation of the giant grain and soybean processor. And many analysts have been warning of more trouble ahead for the stock. **********\"We suspect the stock could touch $11 or $12 before this is all over,\" said Bonnie Wittenburg in a bulletin issued on Tuesday from Dain Bosworth, the Minneapolis investment firm where she follows the company. **********What the analysts are not talking about much is the stock's long-term outlook, which is about as good as they come in the volatile commodities sector. No other company can match Archer-Daniels-Midland's huge and highly flexible capacity to produce and distribute hundreds of products from soybeans, corn, wheat and other crops. At a time when agriculture's competitive posture is a bright spot on the nation's economic landscape, neither customers, suppliers or the Government stand to benefit from seeing the company seriously crippled. **********\"A.D.M. is is the finest agricultural complex ever assembled and it cannot be duplicated,\" said Leonard G. Teitlebaum, a Merrill Lynch analyst who put a \"near-term hold\" recommendation on the company's stock as the scandal broke but rates it a \"strong buy\" for the long term. **********Archer-Daniels-Midland shares now stand at $16.50, up 50 cents from Wednesday but down from $18.75 on June 27. The decline has been fueled by the emphasis some analysts have put on the uncertainties hanging over the company. Will criminal charges be filed? How onerous could the financial penalties from the Government's case be, not to mention suits from shareholders, customers or competitors? Will senior managers be forced out? Will Congress be more prone to cut Federal price supports that benefit the company? **********Analysts say the company, which has always been hard to analyze because of the reticence of its management and the breadth of its holdings, is even tougher to judge given the uncertainties of the inquiry. **********Still, John McMillan, who follows agribusiness for Prudential Securities, rates the company a buy for speculative investors with horizons as short as a year. While the spotlight has been on risk, he and most others say they doubt that an investigation will derail the company. **********Nothing that has come to light so far suggests such a wide-ranging antitrust problem that the Government will be inclined or be able to demand drastic punishment of the company. The drama of the investigation has included the undercover cooperation of Mark E. Whitacre, president of the company's bio-products group, and a June 27 raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on company headquarters in Decatur, Ill. But customers and competitors say they have seen little to hint of any illegal activities. **********The focus of the investigation has been the lysine and citric acid businesses, which were under Mr. Whitacre's supervision, and the far larger corn sweetener business, which was outside his domain. Archer-Daniels-Midland's major competitors in each of the businesses have received subpoenas requesting information. **********Lysine is an amino acid derived from fermenting corn that is fed primarily to chicken and swine. Until Archer-Daniels-Midland entered the market in 1991 as part of its huge investment -- more than $1 billion to date -- in vitamins and other food and feed supplements, the market had been controlled by two Japanese companies, Kyowa Hakko and Ajinomoto, and a smaller South Korean rival, Sewon. Prices were generally dictated by the price and availability of soybean meal, the main lysine source in most livestock diets. **********Archer-Daniels-Midland quickly climbed into the driver's seat because, unlike its more specialized foreign rivals, it extracts lysine from corn it is already grinding for other products. \"The price crumbled in a hurry,\" said one purchaser, who declined to be named. **********Once Archer-Daniels-Midland secured 50 percent of what has become a 500-million-pound worldwide market, purchasers say, the price rose back toward its historic relationship with soybean meal. It is currently between $1.20 and $1.30 a pound, which would generate about $300 million in revenues. Buyers say it is possible that some kind of collusive agreement helped the prices back up but that they have seen no evidence. **********The company also entered the citric acid business in 1991 when it bought Pfizer Inc.'s operations. Analysts calculate that it splits the domestic market with Cargill Inc. and Haarmann & Reimer, a subsidiary of Bayer of Germany that is based in Springfield, N.J., Both those companies have been subpeonaed. Some citric acid, which is widely used as a food and beverage ingredient, is also imported from China and Europe. Archer-Daniels-Midland's share is probably producing revenues of around $350 million, analysts say. Industry sources say the transfer from Pfizer has had no noticeable impact on the market. **********The corn sweetener industry is equally mystified by the investigation, particularly in light of the Government's courtroom defeat in 1991 after a long-running battle to undo the company's acquisition of the high-fructose corn syrup capacity of Nabisco Brands Inc. Prices for the biggest sweetener product -- high fructose syrup for the beverage industry -- are currently a third lower than their 1991 peak. **********The company has a one-third share of the high fructose market, followed by Cargill and A.E. Staley, a subsidiary of Tate & Lyle of Britain, with just over 20 percent each and CPC International with about 11 percent. Some analysts believe corn sweeteners in general may account for more than half of Archer-Daniels-Midland's earnings although they are just about one-fourth of its sales, which are expected to top $12.3 billion in the year that ended June 30. **********Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the investigation for Wall Street is that it appears to have blossomed out of Mr. Whitacre's group, the part of Archer-Daniels-Midland that company executives had been calling their prime growth vehicle. In fact, the company had said that such bio-products would account for one-third of earnings by 1997. Now it is unclear who will manage the group and whether the company will have to tiptoe instead of moving at its usual full speed ahead. **********Analysts also fret that the board, viewed as a docile extension of Dwayne O. Andreas, the 77-year-old chairman, lacks the influence, will or insight into the company's operations to control any negative developments at a time when transition issues could become pressing. **********On top of all this, the company is coming off a record year when grain prices were low and demand for many products high. Once earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter that ended June 30 are reported on Monday, the next few quarters could prove disappointing by comparison. **********\"The easy thing is just to sell and get out of the way,\" Mr. McMillan, the analyst, said. But not necessarily the smart thing for investors with the long-term view."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/business/company-news-norwest-to-buy-15-billion-in-loan-servicing.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORWEST TO BUY $15 BILLION IN LOAN SERVICING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NORWEST TO BUY $15 BILLION IN LOAN SERVICING", "body_text": " **********The Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the rights to service $15 billion in mortgage loans from Barclays American/Mortgage, a unit of Barclays Bank P.L.C.

Payments of securities would consist of 75 percent Crown common stock and 25 percent newly issued convertible preferred stock. Crown said that 225 francs a share would be a 20 percent premium over Carnaud's Friday share price; Carnaud shares closed yesterday at 189.77 francs, up 3.1 francs, on the Paris Bourse. The merger plan was announced well after the close of trading in both Europe and the United States; Crown's shares gained 25 cents yesterday to close at $41.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The deal should be completed by fall, those familiar with it said. **********Compagnie Generale d'Industrie et de Participations, a French investment company that controls about 32 percent of Carnaud Metalbox's shares, has already signed an agreement with Crown to exchange its shares for equity in the combined company, Crown said. **********Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, who is chairman of C.G.I.P. and also supervisory board chairman of Carnaud, would sit on the board of the combined company, along with at least two other Carnaud representatives, and would be chairman of the combined company's strategic planning committee.

The blast burned her clothes off, seared her flesh and hurled her 30 feet, knocking her unconscious. **********\"When I came to, I looked around,\" she said, gently waving the claw that remains of her right hand. \"The boys had been so cute before, but now their clothes were burned off and they were nearly naked. Their skin was cut up and ripped off. Their faces were peeling off as well.\" **********Though she did not know it, Mrs. Abe was herself so hideously deformed that her own parents would urge her to show mercy to her husband and leave him forever. **********As fire raged nearer, Mrs. Abe joined a parade of survivors trudging down the road in the dusk left by a mushroom cloud that blotted out the sun. Blackened, bleeding, wearing only tatters of clothing, they moaned and held out their arms to lessen the pain -- looking like ghosts. **********Half a century later, those ghosts still haunt Japan and America alike. **********Japan's Prime Minister and other officials conducted a quiet ceremony in Hiroshima this morning, releasing 1,500 doves and honoring the dead so that their souls will be untroubled. But the dead -- probably more than 150,000, many buried in a common grave in what is now a green park -- seem in repose. It is the survivors who are unable to rest in peace. **********Around the world, the dropping of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima remains one of the great moral and historical tangles of modern history. As Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell write in a new study, \"You cannot understand the 20th century without Hiroshima.\" **********The bombing still looms in the background of United States-Japan relations, with many Japanese mystified by what they see as America's unwillingness to show remorse for such cruelty. **********\"I think the atomic bombings were one of the two greatest crimes against humanity in the 20th century, along with the Holocaust,\" the former Mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, told reporters earlier this year. **********Immediately after the bombing, survivors dragged out some American prisoners of war -- who had lived because they were kept in underground cells -- and beat them to death. **********Years later, a popular comic book depicted a young woman dying of radiation sickness, and then becoming a prostitute to get back at American soldiers by infecting them with syphilis. **********Yet today the mood in Hiroshima is not one of anger toward Americans, but simply frustration at what is seen as their callousness and insensitivity. It is similar to the frustration that South Koreans and Chinese feel when Japanese officials refuse to apologize for World War II. **********Some American veterans today still refuse to shake the hands of Japanese, but there seems to be no such venom among Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb. **********\"I've never had a grudge against the United States,\" said Mrs. Abe. \"Japan also did lots of things in the war. The bomb didn't drop out of the blue. It happened in the process of war.\" **********Yashito Matsushige, a newspaper photographer who took the only pictures known to have been taken in Hiroshima on the day of the blast, said that he, too, feels no resentment at America for dropping the bomb. **********\"It's not a question of whether the bomb was good or bad,\" Mr. Matsushige said. \"The war was bad, and these kinds of wretched scenes happened because the war started in the first place.\" **********At Funairi High School, which 50 years ago lost nearly 700 students to the bomb, a group of students said they had no resentments against Americans. The students said no one, not even the descendants of atomic bomb victims, would possibly have any objection to an American boyfriend or girlfriend. **********\"I'd like one,\" volunteered Haruko Miyagawa, a 17-year-old girl. Sanitized History  Glossing Over War's Atrocities **********In part, the graciousness toward Americans may be rooted in something that foreigners often complain about: Japanese schoolbooks. Critics point out that Japanese students barely learn about the atrocities committed by the imperial army, but for balance they hardly learn about the atomic bombing, either. **********The textbooks, which are censored by the Japanese Government, seem intended to avoid unpleasantness of every sort. They give only cursory attention to Japan's invasion of China and attack on Pearl Harbor, sometimes describing them in a way that makes them sound like natural disasters unrelated to human behavior, and they treat the atomic bombing in a similar way. **********In an extreme case, one high school history textbook says only: \"In August 1945, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and then on Nagasaki\" -- without even indicating that it was the United States that dropped the bomb. One survey found that among students in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 10 percent did not know which country had dropped the bombs. **********Some scholars believe that the atomic bombing had the perverse effect of allowing Japanese to regard themselves as victims of the war rather than its cause. The higaisha ishiki, or victim consciousness, is said to be one reason why Japan has such difficulty acknowledging its past aggression. **********Seisuke Okuno, a former Cabinet minister who led the opposition this year to a Parliamentary apology for the war, argues that Japan need not express remorse in part because it suffered brutalities from other countries. Citing the atomic bombs, he said, \"We think that there were war crimes more serious than any committed by Japan.\" **********If there is a \"victim consciousness,\" its shrine is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Schoolchildren throughout Japan pass through it and see pictures of mutilated humans, but they see very little to explain why the bomb was dropped. **********The museum does not demonize America for dropping the bomb, but rather it directs its message at calls for peace and nuclear disarmament. That, too, is one of the most profound legacies of Hiroshima, for it has reinforced a passionate horror of war that remains central to Japanese politics today. **********Japan vows never to develop nuclear weapons and never to send troops abroad to fight. Only 46 percent of the Japanese public favor resisting with force even if Japan were invaded, according to a Government poll. **********Americans have traditionally seen Hiroshima as an end of suffering rather than a beginning. **********Those who were in prisoner of war camps are particularly emphatic about the value of the bomb, because they were scheduled to be killed if the United States invaded. **********\"For all of us who suffered in the camps,\" said Gilbert M. Hair, who was interned by Japanese troops as a child and lost his father and grandfather, the latter bayoneted to death, \"we can tell you that none of us would be here if the bomb had not been used.\" **********When bombing of civilian targets was introduced in the 1930's, partly by Japan in its war against China, the Senate passed a resolution denouncing the \"inhuman bombing of civilian populations.\" The State Department declared that such conduct violated international law, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on all nations to pledge that they would never engage in such \"inhuman barbarism.\" **********Such bombings helped convince many Americans that Japanese were particularly low creatures, without the sophisticated moral instincts of Westerners -- a view that made it easier, a few years later, for America to bomb Japanese cities. Increasingly, American officials and publications began to describe the Japanese people as monkeys or even as rats, cockroaches and other vermin. **********A huge parade in New York City in 1942 included a popular float depicting Japanese as rats trying to flee in every direction. **********The head of a United States Government commission publicly urged in 1945 \"the extermination of the Japanese in toto.\" Plenty of people agreed, for a survey in 1944 found that 13 percent of Americans favored, at the end of the war, \"killing all Japanese.\" **********Images of Germans were never so contemptuous, and Ernie Pyle, the famous war correspondent, wrote that Germans were regarded by G.I.'s as horrible but human, while Japanese were seen almost as \"cockroaches or mice.\" **********To be sure, the Allies still conducted carpet bombing that killed 900,000 Germans, 50 percent more than the number of Japanese who were killed in conventional and nuclear air raids together. **********After the war, as the Japanese became humans again in the American mind, the United States became more troubled by the bombing. In 1945, 85 percent of the public supported President Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb, but the proportion has dropped steadily since then. **********In a recent Gallup poll, only 44 percent of Americans surveyed said they would have dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima. The Unending Debate  Revisionists On Both Sides **********The debate over the ethics of the atomic bomb has evolved in large part because of a group of American revisionist historians. These scholars, like Gar Alperovitz, have pointed out holes in the traditional American defense of the bomb. **********The revisionists have noted that many American officials at the time expected Japan to surrender soon anyway, even without the bomb. The revisionists have also shown that there is little historical basis for assertions that up to a million American troops would have died in an invasion of Japan. **********Japan has its own revisionists, and they argue the opposite: that the United States had little alternative to dropping the bomb. These Japanese revisionists are a tiny minority, but they suggest that taboos are breaking down in Japan. **********\"The bomb was unfortunate, but it was the only means to bring Japan to a surrender,\" argues Sadao Asada, a historian at Doshisha University in Kyoto. **********Professor Asada cites Japanese archival evidence that military officials were likely to fight on, furiously, until the end. **********\"Sacrifice 20 million Japanese lives,\" a senior navy official urged in August 1945, with tears in his eyes, as he proposed a huge suicide attack on the Allies. **********The Prime Minister at the time, Kantaro Suzuki, later described the atomic bomb as \"an extremely favorable opportunity,\" and suggested that conventional bombs would not have been enough. The Japanese navy minister described the atomic bomb as a \"gift from heaven\" and the Emperor's top adviser said that the peace faction had been \"assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war.\" **********The Japanese documents also reveal a little-known factor that may have played a role in ending the war. An American pilot named McDila was shot down on Aug. 8 and lied to his Japanese interrogators, saying that the United States had 100 more atomic bombs, and that the next target would be Tokyo. This was immediately relayed to the war minister and shook up a cabinet meeting in Tokyo the next day. Unknown Toll  Instant Death, Lingering Pain **********Perhaps never in history have so many people died in one instant as at Hiroshima 50 years ago. **********Yet no one knows what that death toll is, partly because the blast obliterated records along with lives. It may be that nearly 100,000 people were killed immediately, and the authorities in Hiroshima calculated that 130,000 to 150,000 had died by the end of 1945. **********Many others have died since then of cancer, and it is often said that the bomb was responsible for 200,000 or more deaths. **********\"We have not found any illness that only atomic bomb victims get,\" said Dr. Nobuhiro Ohta, who runs a medical program in Hiroshima for survivors of the blast. \"We do know of some illnesses that people are more likely to get when they have been exposed to radiation.\" **********Leukemia, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, cataracts and other ailments are all more common in bomb survivors, but the overall increase in mortality for most survivors is not very great. **********One study found, for example, that those with the highest dose of radiation -- an almost lethal dose -- were 4.9 times more likely to die of leukemia than the general population. That was the highest multiple, and most survivors were only a bit more likely than the general population to die of most other cancers. **********\"There's no big difference in mortality for atomic bomb survivors compared to the regular population,\" Dr. Ohta said. \"In terms of longevity, it doesn't seem as if there is much difference.\" **********One of the greatest fears in Hiroshima was that survivors would have deformed children or grandchildren, and this made it very difficult for girls or young women who were in Hiroshima in 1945 to find husbands -- partly because the war had already made young men scarce. But so far there has been no indication that descendants of atomic bomb survivors are affected. Hiroshima's Healing  The Long Road To Reconciliation **********No one understands Hiroshima's past traumas -- and the path of reconciliation -- better than Mrs. Abe, the newlywed who was burned in the blast and joined the column of ghosts. She is still haunted by what she saw as she walked: the man whose eye popped out and dangled by a thread; the corpses in the river; the two little children calling \"Mommy, Mommy\" to what looked almost like a charred log. **********After walking four miles to safety, she was treated at an emergency medical station and then hospitalized for a year. When she recovered, toward the end of 1945, mounds of scar tissue formed on her arms and face. **********The scar tissue pulled her skin, so she could not use her joints, and tugged her mouth downward. The scars were an angry red, thick as a finger, and covered her face. She was hideous. **********\"My in-laws said I should cut all ties with my husband,\" Mrs. Abe remembered, speaking slowly and painfully. \"They said that there might be an effect on future generations, and they said that they felt badly for my husband having to live with such an ugly woman. **********\"Even my parents told me to leave him, since I was so ugly. But my husband was very understanding, so I could continue my marriage.\" **********Mrs. Abe underwent 18 operations over the decades, and by 1975 the scar tissue on her face was successfully replaced with a skin graft from her stomach. Her face looks almost normal now, with just a hint that her mouth was once tugged downward. **********To be sure, there are other effects, such as a tightening of her skin that means she cannot fully close her eyes. When she washes her face, soap gets in her eyes. **********Hiroshima itself has undergone the same process of regeneration. After the bombing, people said no plant would grow in the area for 75 years, but in fact the center of Hiroshima is a verdant park of trees and lawns. Partly because the epicenter was turned into a memorial park, Hiroshima is one of the prettiest big cities in Japan today; it is almost discomfitingly pretty. **********\"At that time, I cried every day, wishing that I had died immediately,\" Mrs. Abe reflected. \"But now I'm rather thankful that I've made it.\" **********\"I'm not asking for compensation from Americans,\" she added. \"I just want them to feel sorry and to try to abolish nuclear weapons. If they do that, the dead could rest in peace and we could feel that our agony achieved something.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/business/international-briefs-credit-lyonnais-sells-brazilian-unit-to-itau.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Credit Lyonnais Sells Brazilian Unit to Itau", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Credit Lyonnais Sells Brazilian Unit to Itau", "body_text": " **********Credit Lyonnais said yesterday that it had sold its Brazilian retail banking subsidiary, B.F.B., to Banco Itau S.A., Brazil's second-largest private bank, for 1.6 billion French francs, or $335 million.

The merger would create Italy's largest bank. **********Investors reacted unenthusiastically to the announcement, which came late Thursday. Today, Banca di Roma shares closed at 1,760 lire ($1.10), down 57 lire, on the Milan Stock Exchange. **********The acquisition, which had been rumored for some time, is the latest move among Italy's fragmented banks to consolidate and expand as changing laws and foreign entries open the banking sector -- long marked by Government involvement and gross inefficiency -- to growing competition. **********Last November, Banca Commerciale Italiana acquired control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto for $1.13 billion. Faced with continuing growth among the powerful banks of northern Italy, Banca di Roma, with its base primarily in the central portion of the country, has been looking for areas of expansion. **********Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, which is based in Rome, is Italy's 13th-largest bank and one of the weakest. The bank has been under surveillance by the Bank of Italy, the central bank, because of operating losses and a thin capital base. Agricoltura reported net losses in the first half of 1994 totaling $18.5 million, with the amount of its nonperforming loans rising nearly 1 percent, to $564 million. **********\"The central bank was glad to see this wedding,\" said Marco Nascimbeni, who follows banking at Carnegie International in Milan. \"It was a way to get rid of problems at Agricoltura.\" **********Banca di Roma said it would pay the equivalent of $326 million to acquire a controlling stake in Bonifiche Siele S.p.A., a bank holding company that owns Agricoltura, from Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise, the 63-year old bank president. It said it would make a public offering for remaining shares that are spread among institutional and individual investors. **********Banca di Roma has $95.4 billion of assets and was formed in 1992 from the merger of two smaller banking companies, Banco di Roma and Banco di Spirito Santo. The banks and their executives were long considered close to Italy's political establishment, which is linked with the old Christian Democratic Party and the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. **********Giorgio Coari, an analyst at the Milan brokerage firm of Caboto S.I.M., said the drop in Banca di Roma's share price reflected Agricoltura's \"three or four hard years,\" as well as its \"inefficiency, personnel costs and low productivity.\" **********But Mr. Nascimbeni said the price that Banca di Roma paid represented a substantial discount, even with a premium. A price based on Agricoltura's market capitalization, plus a 30 percent premium, he said, would have amounted to about $1.25 billion, or roughly double what Banca di Roma agreed to pay."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/a-deal-on-auto-trade-the-next-asian-market-china-beckons-and-car-makers-pant.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1995-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 759, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Beckons and Car Makers Pant", "print_headline": "A DEAL ON AUTO TRADE: THE NEXT ASIAN MARKET; China Beckons and Car Makers Pant", "body_text": " **********China hungers for new cars. American car makers are dying to sell here. **********At China's annual car show, which opened here on Tuesday, thousands of eager buyers pawed at an array of shiny new models and car sellers did their best to tempt them with glossy handouts, flashy videos and seductively dressed women. **********Yet in between these two excited partners lurk an invisible set of bureaucratic and logistical obstacles that have kept potential buyers from coming any closer to an American car than the tantalizing look and touch of a car show. **********This may be the year, as American car makers like to say, when they start breaking into the China market. But so far the foreign suitors are like a pack of unfed dogs and the Chinese authorities are carefully playing them against each other. **********China is dangling a juicy prize before the Americans: a $1 billion agreement to make sedans with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, one of the nation's most profitable state-owned companies with an expert distribution and servicing network. **********Auto executives say the General Motors Corporation is on the verge of beating out the Ford Motor Company for the deal. Perhaps as a consolation prize, Ford has been invited to bid for a mini-van venture in southern China, though that would knock out the Chrysler Corporation, a strong contender until recently. **********In China, however, nothing is certain until it actually happens. **********Shanghai Automotive originally promised a decision by last October. Then they said February, then May. Now, G.M. executives say, they hope for an answer by the end of the year. Executives from two non-American car companies wondered aloud whether the mysterious process would eventually lead to a European car maker instead, or lead nowhere. **********On Tuesday, Ye Ping weaved his way through a crowd of onlookers to step onto the G.M. and Ford displays at the car show. As vice president of Shanghai Automotive, Mr. Ye is one of the men deciding who will win the Shanghai venture, and G.M. and Ford executives jockeyed for a chance to pump his hand. **********Mr. Ye lingered over a small baby- blue four-door European sedan at the G.M. display. At Ford's shop, he posed for a photograph in front of one of the three blond models in slinky black miniskirts who, like the cars they adorned, were imported for the show. **********But he seemed drawn like a magnet to the pulsing music and bright lights at a Ferrari display just beyond, where four Chinese women in dark sunglasses and baseball caps bumped to the beat of Tina Turner, each draping a slender arm atop a Ferrari. Egged on by a colleague, Mr. Ye climbed behind the wheel of a convertible, and a wide smile broke across his face. **********\"Not bad!\" he shouted to his colleague. **********Asked whether Ford or G.M. would win the Shanghai deal, Mr. Ye said, \"It's 50-50.\" Pressed for a reason why G.M. executives were acting so confident about winning the deal, he smiled. \"They know we can't make an announcement yet,\" he said. \"We hope it will be very soon.\" **********Just 1.5 million vehicles were made in China last year, mostly trucks. China's car bureaucracy wants to double that output by 2000 and is actively seeking help from the world's largest auto makers. **********American car executives concede that they are unaccustomed, as they try to enter a market, to being told what kind of vehicle to build and with what partner. **********\"It's not frustrating, it's just different,\" said W. Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford Motor Company International, which sold just 800 cars in China last year with tariffs as high as 200 percent. \"It's not a question of if we will assemble vehicles here, it's a question of when and where.\" **********As for G.M., its record in China has been poor. A venture to make compact pickup trucks in the northeastern city of Shenyang, begun in 1992, may be a classic example of picking the wrong partner and making the wrong product. **********G.M. executives insist it was not a total loss and say they are exploring future possibilities in Shenyang. But the estimated $30 million they spent, before abandoning production in April, seems effectively lost. **********Rudolph A. Schlais Jr., president of G.M.

Some critics of Norplant responded with another side to the story in the following letters. To the Editor: **********You focus excessively on the unremarkable fact that many of the lawyers who have asserted silicone-related claims against Norplant's manufacturer are the same lawyers who were involved in the earlier litigation concerning breast implants.

And will your dealer -- the one you had counted on for service -- survive? Either loss could make life bumpy.

That growth comes after a flat period during which network executives suggested that cable might have finally reached a plateau of about 60 percent of households. **********In the past, older viewers were the most resistant to paying for cable service. CBS's research indicated that many of these people were also loyal viewers of CBS, whose programs aimed at viewers aged 25 to 54. The other networks were all seeking viewers 18 to 49. **********\"My theory is that the older viewers are now signing up for cable,\" said David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for research of CBS. \"They're seeing fewer programs for themselves on the networks.\" **********Indeed, as the networks put together their schedules for the fall season, the concentration on series intended for younger-adult viewers has never been greater.

Cable gains by being more specific in giving different viewers what they want.\" **********The age shift in CBS's programming strategy was money driven. Network television advertisers, though bombarded by CBS with information about the aging of the population and the buying power of older viewers, still spend the bulk of their budgets trying to reach those 18 to 49. Advertisers are expected to spend well in excess of $5 billion for this fall's programs. **********CBS was not reaching many viewers in any age group this past season. And those it was losing didn't seem to be going to its old rivals. **********\"You sure don't see those CBS declines winding up in any other network's bucket,\" said Robert Sieber, vice president for audience development at the Turner Broadcasting System, which owns CNN and TBS, among other cable channels. \"Since the first of the year you can see it all flowing to cable.\" **********To some extent, cable is reaping the benefits of its past financial success. With more to spend, channels like TNT and TBS can offer the National Basketball Association playoffs, which had huge ratings in May. **********Mr. Sieber said cable channels were spending more than ever on original programs, including prime-time series and movies as well as sports, a change from the days when cable was crammed with repeats of old network shows. **********He added that cable had emerged from a period of caution after a new round of Federal rate rules, and had begun adding channels and spending more on marketing. **********Still, some of the growth in cable viewing seems directly related to the shift among older viewers. Mr. Sieber cited a programming move that has greatly enhanced the ratings for TNT -- repeats of an old CBS series, \"In the Heat of the Night,\" every evening at 7. The show was a hit on CBS primarily with viewers above 55. **********Among the other cable networks making ratings gains in prime time are CNBC, the Nashville Network and the Arts and Entertainment Channel, all of which are strong with older viewers. **********Many cable channels that depend on old movies for their programming, including American Movie Classics and TNT, are doing well even as network movies suffer a steep ratings decline. **********\"The TV movie audience is going somewhere,\" Mr. Poltrack said. \"They're finding the movie product they like on these classic movie channels, and A& E and the Lifetime Channel.\" **********Lifetime depends heavily on repeats of made-for-television network movies; its ratings grew 30 percent in the last year. Now it plans to add an original film every month. **********Not every cable channel that is increasing its audience is doing it with an infusion of older viewers. Nickelodeon, which offers children's programs, is also up substantially in the ratings, as is the Sci-Fi Channel, which has a big audience among women 18 to 49. **********But one cable channel seems to be defying the upward trend, having lost more than 15 percent of its audience in the last year. It also happens to be a channel no one will ever accuse of seeking to steal away CBS's older viewers: MTV. Stratifying Audiences **********All four major networks have focused their programming on the 18- to 49-year-old segment at the exclusion of older audiences. NBC used \"Mad About You,\" for example, against shows with older viewers and drew the audiences advertisers covet. **********Many cable networks picked up the network gauntlet by showing specials and series that catered explicity to older audiences. The Discovery Network hit its ratings jackpot inMarch by showing a documentary on aircraft carriers, shown above. CNN and CNBC have also done well among older audiences, especially those interested in the O.J. Simpson trial."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/business/mutual-life-set-to-name-new-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1995-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mutual Life Set to Name New Chief", "print_headline": "Mutual Life Set to Name New Chief", "body_text": " **********The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, whose collapse in 1991 was the largest ever of an American insurer, is expected soon to name as its new chief executive Alan J. Bowers, an accountant who has been a consultant to the company since the middle of last year, according to insurance executives. **********Mr. Bowers, a partner at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand, has not yet signed an agreement with the company, which is based in Newark, and was one of several candidates presented by an executive search firm. But Mr. Bowers, who lacks direct experience in the insurance business, is said to be the front-runner. He is said to have the support of New Jersey's Insurance Commissioner, Andrew J. Karpinski, who is also chairman of the 10-member Mutual Benefit board. **********Mr. Bowers did not return several phone calls to his office, and officials at Mutual Benefit and the New Jersey Insurance Department declined to answer questions about his background. \"The process has not been concluded and we are not going to comment any further,\" Kathy Bird, a spokeswoman for the department, said. **********Apart from working with Mutual Benefit the last 10 months, Mr. Bowers is responsible for a wide variety of corporate business from offices in Parsippany and Princeton, N.J. **********Though Mr. Bowers does not have the actuarial background or sales experience that is common among insurance executives, Mutual Benefit does not need those skills in a chief executive, according to one company adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. Because of the company's brush with disaster in 1991, it no longer sells much new insurance, and its existing insurance business is well managed by Mutual's chief operating officer, Kathleen M. Koerber. **********Instead, the adviser said, Mutual Benefit is more in need of an executive who can manage its diverse portfolio of assets, which range from a building-supply company and maker of children's clothing, to the Fisher Island real estate development in Florida. It was a sharp decline in the value of those assets, particularly in real estate, that caused a panic among customers in 1991; their rush to withdraw funds from the company led the New Jersey Insurance Department to seize Mutual. **********\"Mutual Benefit needs somebody who can make a real estate deal one day, and then talk to wallboard suppliers the next,\" said the adviser to the company. \"A lot of companies are run by C.P.A.'s who have broad business experience, but no detailed hands-on experience in a particular industry,\" he added. **********Because its sales forces has dwindled, Mutual Benefit could be a very attractive target to a bank, some analysts said, if laws are changed to allow such a combination. Mutual knows how to create insurance products -- a skill banks lack -- but is not burdened with an expensive network of sales agents, a staff component that banks do not desire because they already have their own branch networks. **********Robert Belvedere, a member of Mutual Benefit's advisory council and a former agent at the company, opposed the possible appointment, saying the general business skills were less important than insurance experience **********Though Coopers & Lybrand has been an adviser to the company, Mr. Belvedere said that \"in my opinion, Mr. Bowers does not meet the criteria for a new chief executive, which is that they should have insurance experience.\" **********After New Jersey regulators seized Mutual Benefit, the state appointed Victor H. Palmieri, a noted rehabilitator of troubled companies, to run the company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/24/business/currency-markets-canada-s-pale-version-of-peso-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1995-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1363, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada's Pale Version of Peso Crisis", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Canada's Pale Version of Peso Crisis", "body_text": " **********The Bank of Canada has raised short-term interest rates for 11 of the last 12 weeks in an effort to stop the precipitous slide of the Canadian dollar, but has failed so far to reverse its downward spiral to a near record low. **********The central bank acted because a declining Canadian dollar reduces the value of the nation's wealth and compounds the Government's fiscal problems by increasing the cost of servicing Canada's huge national debt. **********For Canadians themselves, the devaluation is cutting both ways, making winter trips to Florida more expensive but also making Canadian goods more attractive abroad. **********The result has been a paler Canadian version of the financial jitters that sent Mexico into economic crisis when it abruptly devalued its peso last month. Both countries depend heavily on foreign capital. **********At just over 70 American cents, the Canadian dollar has shrunk by 5 percent in three months and 20 percent since hitting a high of 89.29 on Nov. 1, 1991. The all-time low was 69.13 cents on Feb. 4, 1986. **********Contributing to the depreciation are Canada's budget deficits and uncertainty about a referendum expected later this year on Quebec's independence. **********A jump of 2.5 percentage points in short-term rates set by the Bank of Canada over the last two months helped brake the Canadian dollar's slide, but has also added $3 billion to the annual cost of servicing the debt. Interest on Canada's debt already gobbles up 35 percent of Government revenues. The higher interest rates could in time also dampen economic growth. **********\"There's clearly the risk of a vicious circle,\" said John McCallum, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. But he added that the Canadian dollar crisis \"strengthens the bargaining hand\" of advocates of major spending cuts in the Government budget to be presented next month. **********The currency imbroglio comes when Canada's economy has sharply improved under Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Economic output in the third quarter of 1994 grew 4.8 percent over the comparable period a year earlier, which is higher than any other member of the Group of Seven industrial nations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that Canada will lead the group in growth both this year and next. **********With trade barriers lowered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canadian exports to the United States have boomed, soaring 65 percent since 1991. Canada has almost zero inflation. And last year, it created 431,000 full-time jobs in the private sector, dropping Canadian unemployment to 9.6 percent. **********But in a world of almost instantaneous money flows, currency markets are prone to what C. E. Ritchie, chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia, calls the \"electronic jury\" of traders around the world. **********The staggering rise of Canadian debt, more than a third of which is held internationally, has left the Canadian dollar vulnerable. **********Over the last five years, Canadian national and provincial governments have run combined deficits of more than $50 billion (Canadian), or $35 billion (United States), annually. Their accumulated debt now exceeds $700 billion (Canadian), an amount roughly equal to the value of all goods and services produced in Canada last year. **********As a percentage of the gross domestic product, only Italy's debt is higher among the leading industrial nations. On a per-capita basis, Canada is at the top of the list. **********The markets have focused on the Government's credibility in reducing the budget deficit. The Government has promised to cut the deficit from the current 5 percent to 3 percent of Canada's gross domestic product, or to $25 billion (Canadian) by the 1996-97 fiscal year. **********If the new Government budget fails to cut spending enough to meet that goal, the Canadian dollar could get even weaker. **********Many market traders say the Government should be taking stronger action. \"Markets want a clear sense that the Government is prepared to make deep cuts in spending,\" said Robert Palombi, senior fixed-income analyst for MMS International, a financial markets advisory service in Toronto. \"They're demanding a less generous welfare state.\" **********Some complained that the Bank of Canada's governor, Gordon Thiessen, waited too long to raise rates after the Federal Reserve Board in the United States tightened money in December. Last Tuesday, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark bank rank nearly another full point, to 8.21 percent. **********\"The market lost confidence in the bank's ability or willingness to support the currency, and this created a feeding frenzy,\" said Jeff Rubin, chief economist at the Toronto investment house of Wood Gundy Inc. **********Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at another Toronto investment firm, Nesbitt Burns Ltd., said the central bank had sought to insulate the Canadian economy from higher rates, but found that it could not do so and still maintain Canada's appeal to international investors. **********Mr. Thiessen talked up the Canadian dollar to the Montreal Board of Trade on Thursday, noting that Canada's economic fundamentals, including minimal inflation and high productivity, were strong. \"So the underlying situation for the currency,\" he said, \"is one that would cause you to look at the possibility of an increase\" in the Canadian dollar's value. **********The Canadian dollar has also been weakened by worries about what will happen to Canada's debt if Quebec votes to leave the rest of the country. A separatist Parti Quebecois government in Quebec is committed to holding a provincial referendum on independence this year. The latest polls indicate that a majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada, but with separatists holding provincial power, they might be able to swing more opinion their way. **********So far, ordinary Canadians have not shown much concern over their dollar's fall. \"I don't get the sense that anyone's particularly worried,\" said James Nason, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia. \"To the credit of the Prime Minister, the political atmosphere is calm and the drop in the dollar has not hurt exports or jobs.\" **********Canadians point out that a large number of American companies are also benefiting from the lower Canadian dollar. Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd., for example, has the mandate from its American parent, the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Mass., to build personal computers for North and South America. Shipments from the Canadian plant in Kanata, Ontario, jumped 70 percent in the second half of 1994. **********The weak Canadian dollar has also helped Canadian store owners along the border. A few years ago, Canadians were spending billions of dollars in American shopping centers, protesting with their feet against the high prices and sales taxes at home. Now the plunging Canadian dollar, helped by lower inflation than in the United States, is luring American shoppers to Canada.                    --------------------       Advances by the Dollar **********(By The Associated Press) **********The dollar ended slightly higher against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday. **********In Asian and early European dealings, the dollar strengthened after investors dumped Japanese stocks, pushing the Nikkei index of 225 issues down 5.6 percent. **********But the dollar retreated in New York as many traders became concerned over reports suggesting Congress could reject or cut the Clinton Administration's proposed $40 billion loan-guarantee package for Mexico. Currency dealers expect the dollar to come under pressure if the peso continues to weaken because Mexico is the third-largest trading partner of the United States. **********In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 99.80 yen from 99.40 yen on Friday. It advanced to 1.5145 marks from 1.5115 marks on Friday. The British pound rose to $1.5940 from $1.5890. **********\"The market has concluded that a failure to pass the Mexican loan package would be a negative for the dollar,\" said Michael Faust, currency strategist at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money-management firm in San Mateo, Calif. **********\"It's not only what it might mean for trade with Mexico, but the impact on international capital flows in general,\" he said. \"Money might tend to stay at home.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/business/business-digest-448795.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********International **********Europeans are uneasy over President Clinton's Mexican rescue plan.

Those talks are to begin in May 1996 and end three years later. **********\"There can be little doubt that Jerusalem is a sensitive issue in the current peace process,\" the two senators wrote, warning against moving too quickly. **********They added, however, that of 184 countries with which the United States has diplomatic relations, \"Israel is the only nation in which our embassy is not located in the functioning capital. This is an inappropriate message to our friends in Israel and, more importantly, a dangerous message to Israel's enemies.\" **********In the weeks before the two senators released the letter, the Administration urged Mr. Moynihan to adopt a measured approach and warned him against acting precipitately. **********The two senators intend to send the letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher after circulating it in the Senate for more signatures. **********Even though the letter goes further than the Administration would like, Administration officials said they hoped the letter would forestall efforts by some Republicans to introduce legislation that would call for moving the embassy in the next year or two. **********\"To try to force the Administration to move the embassy to Jerusalem at this stage would put us out of business as a broker in the negotiations, and it would put the peace process out of business,\" said a senior Administration official. **********Representative Charles E.

You can't have both, says the faction that sees environmental issues as a costly bother and demands that Congress reduce regulations. **********But creative managers are proving that you can, indeed, enjoy both. Companies from Agfa-Gavaert to BMW to the I.B.M. offshoot New Leaf Entertainment are finding ways to cut waste that also add value. **********Other companies can enjoy similar benefits if they learn to ask these broad questions to integrate environmental considerations into their overall corporate strategy: **********CAN YOU MARKET \"USE\" INSTEAD OF \"OWNERSHIP\"?  Customers are generally more concerned about using a product than owning it. Smart companies capitalize on this attitude by making fewer products -- thus reducing the environmental impact -- while still increasing profitability. **********Agfa-Gavaert, for instance, now leases, not sells, copiers. Customers pay only for copies made. Based on improvements suggested by the company's repair staff, copy drums now provide 3 million to 4 million copies instead of just 100,000 before needing replacement. The copiers themselves now last an average of 6 to 10 years, and 2.5 customers, compared with 4 to 5 years for older, single-owner machines. The longer machines last, the lower Agfa's per-copy costs and the higher its profit. **********Leasing of durable goods establishes new revenue streams because the company capitalizes the product and earns money while the customer has it. **********CAN YOU \"CLOSE THE LOOP\"? **********In this area, Germany is in the forefront by requiring some manufacturers to take back a product at the end of its life span. The nation currently has such a requirement for packaging materials, and proposed legislation would expand the rule to automobiles and electronics. **********BMW has already built a pilot disassembly line and has developed a system to recondition old parts as spares or replacements or to recycle the materials internally. The goal is completely recyclable cars by 2000, as much to recover expensive materials as to protect the environment. **********Disassembly has other corporate benefits. Reducing the number of parts and fasteners inherently improves product quality -- every eliminated step removes a potential error -- and makes repairs easier. **********John Kusz, a product designer and environmental theorist, would have manufacturers include a so-called reclamation fee in a product's purchase price, to be refunded when the product is returned. (Norway and Sweden already require this for cars.) The longer the customer holds onto a product, the more interest the manufacturer would earn, encouraging it to design better products. And the customer would have a financial incentive to return the product, allowing the manufacturer to reuse the materials or lease it again. **********Someday, I predict, there will be totally modular closed-loop systems. Computer customers, for example, will buy and keep the basic machines and then receive plug-in modules instead of purchasing new hardware every time there is an improvement. The old modules would be returned, to be reburbished and reused -- in low-cost entry-level systems in developing nations, for instance -- instead of going to landfills. Everyone wins by closing the loop. **********CAN YOU STOP WASTE AT THE START? **********Innovative technology can eliminate entire categories of manufacturing and distribution -- and waste. **********My favorite example in this field is New Leaf Entertainment, an I.B.M.-Blockbuster collaboration. Blockbuster stores in Columbia, S.C., are testing a New Leaf system called Game Factory in which customers, largely young ones, can rent any Sega game even though none are stocked. Instead, the games are stored as files on a server and downloaded to reprogrammable cartridges. **********Again, everyone wins: Sega no longer has to guess how many copies to produce. The games are always available, so no customers walk away disappointed. Store owners end up with less inventory but more rentals. **********Similar print-on-demand systems will revolutionize CD production. Environmentally, they will eliminate the packaging, raw materials and energy consumed in shipping blank cartridges to the recording factory, then repackaging them and shipping them to the wholesaler and finally to the retailer. **********Corporate environmentalism comes down to a simple equation: waste equals inefficiency. \"If it doesn't add value,\" said Henry Ford, who recycled crates into floor boards for his cars, \"it is waste.\" Managers' best contribution to the nation's 25th Earth Day on Saturday will be to do what they should do anyway: cut waste."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/world/as-deng-s-health-flags-so-does-patience-for-dissent.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1995-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 591, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Deng's Health Flags, So Does Patience for Dissent", "print_headline": "As Deng's Health Flags, So Does Patience for Dissent", "body_text": " **********Communist Party leaders in recent weeks have been sending a stream of blunt messages to China's political dissidents telling them to keep a low profile or stay overseas as the country prepares for the political transition that will follow the death of an ailing Deng Xiaoping. **********Western diplomats here say the campaign is intended to chasten anyone who threatens to wrinkle the brittle political fabric of the capital this winter. \"This regime fundamentally lacks legitimacy,\" a Western diplomat said, \"and so the security apparatus is all that stands between the leadership and those who want change, or revolution or just revenge after Deng dies.\" **********On Dec. 27 the Beijing apartment of Liu Zaifu, a prominent literary scholar living in the United States, was broken into and ransacked by five men in plain clothes, neighbors said. Ten thousand books, scrolls, paintings and calligraphy were carted away. **********The men said they were reclaiming the apartment under the authority of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, where Mr. Liu was director of the Institute of Literature in the 1980's. **********The break-in occurred just as Mr. Liu was exploring the possibility of moving back to China, where he was once a powerful voice advocating democracy. **********Now, it seems, he has gotten the message -- do not come home. **********Earlier in December a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989, Wang Dan, filed a complaint in the Beijing Intermediate People's Court seeking relief from the surveillance team that had dogged his every step since last spring. **********Two days later, Mr. Wang said, six or seven plainclothes agents cursed him and threatened to beat him to death. **********Mr. Wang has gone into hiding. **********When a Northwest Airlines flight landed in Beijing on Nov. 24, the renowned Chinese poet Bei Dao was intercepted by security police and subjected to an all-night interrogation in which Mr. Bei was questioned about his association with the group Human Rights in China, which is based in New York.

Just as they did after the Northridge quake here a year ago, Japanese groups and associations have begun appealing for relief funds. They are also promising news from home if they can get it. **********\"Yesterday and today we've sent out letters to all 650 of our members, asking for help,\" said Masako Miwa, coordinator of the Japanese Business Association. \"Some of them have already called and are sending checks, and some are going to bring the checks to us because quicker is better.\" **********Ms. Miwa herself had reason to be worried about the quake. A high-school classmate, Hiroko Furukawa, lives in Kobe with her husband, a doctor, and their two small children, and Ms. Miwa had no idea whether they were all right. Early today, Ms. Miwa found out they were unharmed, but Mrs. Furukawa reported that she had lost contact with her husband \"because he was so busy\" with the injured and that she was in desperate need of milk and diapers for her 16-month-old daughter. **********David Hayter, a 25-year-old volunteer at the Japan America Society of Southern California who went to high school in Kobe, said he considers the city his home. **********\"That's why it's so devastating,\" said Mr. Hayter, who attended the Canadian Academy on Rokko Island, just off Kobe, and is an actor. \"I have a lot of people there and I don't know if they're O.K. or not.\" **********The Japan America Society, he said, has established the Kobe Relief Fund and has already attracted \"a fair number of calls for donations.\" By no means all of them were from Japanese-Americans, he said. **********\"I just had a call from an Armenian gentleman who recalled that when the Armenian quake occurred help came from the L.A. area, and he felt inclined to reciprocate,\" Mr. Hayter said. **********In Little Tokyo, the worrying continued.

After repeatedly trying to get through to Kobe, Mr. Kato tried his cousin in Tokyo, Yuichi Yamaka, who had also been seeking news. **********Eventually, word came that she had gotten up in the middle of the night and was in the kitchen when the quake struck Tuesday before dawn. The roof came down on her bedroom and living-room, but the kitchen -- and Mrs. Yamaka -- were spared. **********\"All of a sudden she could see the stars in the sky,\" Mr. Kato said. \"Now she's at her son's house a block away, but none of them can sleep with the aftershocks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/22/world/conflict-balkans-strategy-allies-warn-bosnian-serbs-substantial-air-strikes-if.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1995-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1082, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advancing Bosnian Serb Troops Would Be First Bombing Targets", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: STRATEGY -- ALLIES WARN BOSNIAN SERBS OF 'SUBSTANTIAL' AIR STRIKES IF U.N. ENCLAVE IS ATTACKED; Advancing Bosnian Serb Troops Would Be First Bombing Targets", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration's military plans call for immediate NATO air strikes if Bosnian Serb forces mass for an attack on the United Nations-designated \"safe area\" of Gorazde. **********Senior Administration officials said today that bombing would be used first against advancing Serbian troops, their communications and their supplies. If this failed, American officials envisage a quickly expanding series of air attacks against military targets in other parts of Bosnia. Destruction of the Bosnian Serb air defenses by NATO bombers would be a prelude to any operation. **********The officials said there was no thought to attacking targets in Belgrade, the capital of federal Yugoslavia and Serbia, and the plan is to avoid targets that would put civilians at risk. **********The officials cautioned that some NATO planes would probably be shot down or would crash and that European soldiers in the United Nations force who are taken hostage might be killed. And, they said, civilians could be hit by stray bombs. **********These are the military assumptions that form the basis for the threats of \"substantial and decisive response\" against the Serbs that emerged from today's meeting of allied military leaders. **********It is the strongest ultimatum laid down in the three years of fighting in Bosnian and Herzegovina. And it is, Administration officials acknowledged, a high-stakes gamble. **********The basic premise is that NATO bombing can inflict more damage on the Bosnian Serbs than they are prepared to withstand. That is by no means certain. **********\"I don't think they can endure it,\" said one senior Administration official who has high hopes for the tougher approach. \"They've only got 80,000 men in their army. They can't afford to take substantial losses. Psychologically, they've gotten a new surge of adrenaline by rolling up Srebrenica and Zepa, but the trend has been demoralizing for them. They're running out of draft-age men, and have been rounding them up in Serbia.\" **********The outcome of the gamble, this official said, hinges entirely on whether the West loses its nerve once the bombing begins and the Serbs take hostages, as they have after past air attacks. **********\"The whole psychology could tip if they take us on and we carry through,\" a senior official said. \"If they challenge us and we don't carry through, that would be a disaster.\" **********Western military experts agree that NATO, with its superior technology and laser-guided bombs, has more than enough firepower to smash the Bosnian Serbs' air defenses and deal a serious blow to their capacity to make war. The Bosnian Serbs' air defense is not as formidable as the French-designed system that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, had in place on the eve of the Persian Gulf war. **********But the Serbs present some challenges. Some of their missiles are on mobile launchers. The SA-6 that shot down the American plane being flown by Capt. Scott O'Grady, for example, was wheeled into an area in which there had previously been no missile threat. And no air attack can eliminate the Bosnian Serbs' shoulder-fired missiles, mostly Russian-built SA-7's. **********The NATO planes have various devices, including the use of chaff, to \"spoof\" or distract the guidance systems of these weapons, but they are not always effective. **********Western military officials acknowledged that any bombing of targets in Bosnia could cause civilian casualties. **********NATO and United Nations officials have already drawn up a list of targets that could be hit in a bombing campaign, and one American official said that one aim was to avoid harming civilians. **********\"The problem is, a lot of Bosnia happens to be populated with people. You'll get collateral damage,\" the official said, using the military term for bombs that hit innocent people. \"This is not the desert. This is not a bunch of military targets stretching across the sand.\" **********American officials expect that the Bosnian Serbs have already scattered their ammunition supplies to caves and other places less vulnerable to air attacks. **********The air strikes, if they are ordered, would involve aircraft from several NATO countries. Among the planes already on the NATO mission over Bosnia are F-16's and F-18's flown by pilots from Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United States. British pilots have been flying Tornado fighter aircraft, and eight German Tornado jets arrived today in Italy to fly support missions for the other NATO pilots. **********Among the other support planes are AWAC radar-tracking planes, tankers for in-air refueling, and electronic aircraft that are designed to suppress radar systems and jam communications. **********Several American military officers expressed reservations that the ultimatum did not state a clearly defined goal for the military operation. If the Serbs attacked Gorazde and NATO countered with an air campaign, when should it stop, they asked. When the Serbs call off their attack? When they return to the bargaining table? **********And what happens if the Serbs pull back from confrontation? How long will the threat of air attacks remain in force? **********American officials declined to spell out the specific events that would trigger the air strikes, but they said generally that a massing of troops around Gorazde in a way that indicated an imminent assault would bring a response. **********Several officials said they would not wait, as they had in the case of Srebrenica, for the Serbs to bring thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks into position. **********One important result of the London meeting, an American official said, was the support among the British, French and Americans for revamping the \"dual key\" system under which United Nations civilian officials had a veto over NATO bombing missions. **********As it has worked until now, NATO picked the targets but United Nations civilian officials had to agree before any bombing raid could be carried out. United Nations officials greatly preferred so-called \"proportional\" strikes, in which a specific tank or artillery piece that had fired an offending round would be silenced by an air strike. These were derided as \"pinprick\" strikes by NATO officials, and they often involved fighter planes crisscrossing a battlefield searching in vain for a particular heavy weapon to shoot at. **********Under the system Washington and its allies now support, the decision to bomb would be left solely to the United Nations officer nearest the action, which would normally be Gen. Rupert Smith, the British officer who commands the United Nations forces in Bosnia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/08/business/5-music-giants-drop-plan-to-start-a-rival-to-mtv.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1995-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 321, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 Music Giants Drop Plan To Start a Rival to MTV", "print_headline": "5 Music Giants Drop Plan To Start a Rival to MTV", "body_text": " **********A tentative plan to start a rival music cable channel to MTV has been dropped by five of the world's biggest music companies. **********The companies -- Time Warner, Sony, Thorn EMI, Bertelsmann and Polygram, which is controlled by Philips Electronics -- had planned the service with a partner, the Ticketmaster Corporation.

His history book described blacks as savage and violent. **********In the 1970's and early 80's, in Mr. Makhale's school in the black township of Soweto, there was no official mention of Nelson Mandela, who is now President of the new South Africa, or of the fight against apartheid. It was an education marked by rigidity, rote learning and at times even physical punishment. **********Now Mr. Makhale, 28, is a language teacher in one of Johannesburg's most progressive public primary schools, an almost entirely black school in an all-white neighborhood. The Orange Grove Primary School is taking part in one of this country's toughest transitions: creating and teaching a more honest version of its history. **********Like every other school in the country, it is starting from scratch, working only with a two-month-old national history curriculum -- still vague and rudimentary -- and so far no new history books. **********Academics here hope that for the first time in this century the realities of South Africa's history will make it into the classrooms. **********The new teaching faces ignorance of the past among both young blacks and whites. Among the more than 70 12- and 13-year-old black students at Orange Grove Primary School, only a few had been told by their parents of passbooks, one of apartheid's most humiliating tools. Under that system, all blacks had to carry a virtual passport, which limited their access to urban areas. **********Access to a good education is still not easy for blacks. Apartheid created separate educational systems for whites and nonwhites. Black schools have little money, overcrowded classrooms, underqualified teachers and poor equipment. The repercussions of the system are still felt. **********\"I think history is basically a subject of interpretation,\" said Mr. Makhale, whose father was arrested under the pass law. \"South African whites are very particular about their history, especially Afrikaners. They wish to preserve it. That stands to be a great challenge for black historians to come off with a reasonable interpretation of events. **********\"In trying to explain what had happened to him, my father felt bitter. He avoided the subject as much as he could. I think there is a genuine feeling of, 'Let us carry on where we are now.' Maybe there is a sense of, 'Let's pretend this didn't happen.' \" **********Just as the Government is trying to forge a respect for law in communities that battled it for decades, the different histories have to be merged to create a coherent view of the past, South African historians say. **********\"If there is ever to be healing, there must be reflecting,\" said Michael Philips, the history teacher at Orange Grove Primary School, who is white. \"I think in our country, people are trying to sweep things under the carpet. People have to face what has happened. One of my fears is that the white people will be painted as being wrong all the time.\" **********The old South African history syllabus was made for the white child, said Cynthia Kros, a lecturer in the history department at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg who is involved in creating a new curriculum for the schools. **********The view of the world portrayed in the old syllabus was Eurocentric and conservative. There were no black heroes, just faceless thieves and tribesmen. Part of the core curriculum was a heroic presentation of the 19th-century Afrikaner push into the South African interior, in which large numbers of blacks were killed or dispossessed. **********Apartheid was described as the nation's crowning achievement. Until the mid-1980's, the syllabus did not allow mention of the African National Congress or of Mr. Mandela. **********There was a marked difference also between the teaching of history in white schools, where teachers were not as strictly monitored, and in schools in black townships, where the teaching system was more rigid.  In these schools, South African history largely stopped in 1948, with the rise of the National Party and apartheid, although chapters were added on African homelands. **********The educational system became a focus for anti-apartheid protest. In 1976 about 20,000 students marched through Soweto to denounce the compulsory use of Afrikaans as the language of teaching in black schools. The protests lasted into the next year, and many students were killed in clashes with the police. **********The new curriculum seeks to bring events like these into the classroom, but for the moment it remains vague, academics say. The Government decided to draw up a new syllabus in 1993 but a tentative one was issued only this January, and teachers say few rural schools have received it. Ms. Kros says she believes that it still focuses too much on rote learning. **********It concentrates on making history less Eurocentric and eliminating racial stereotypes. There is an emphasis on oral history as well. But there is little detailed direction on how to deal with various topics. **********Official textbooks have not yet been published, and Ms. Kros says the burden will rest on publishers to create new books. **********\"The central question is who is going to teach the teacher,\" said Ms. Kros, who is white. \"The problem is massive. It will take a generation to solve. We need tremendous resources.\" **********At Orange Grove Primary School, Kenneth Tnobakgale, 12, said his parents had told him very little about their lives under apartheid.

More than most firms, it has shown a willingness to invest abroad, often in markets that its competitors had deemed far too risky. **********It was Barings that arranged the financing for the United States' purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803. It was a transaction that seemed far too dangerous to some. \"We all tremble about the magnitude\" of the loan, a Barings executive wrote that year. **********In recent years, Barings has staked out a position as a leader in research and trading in emerging markets, providing comprehensive evaluations of Latin American and Asian markets as those markets have zoomed and crashed. And it was a Barings trader in Singapore who was reported to have made the big bet -- on Japan -- that brought on the present crisis. **********As recently as two weeks ago, the firm was hiring investment bankers for its emerging-markets group. It planned to open offices this year in Russia and Turkey. **********Founded in 1762 by Francis Baring, the great-great-great-grandfather of Peter Baring, the current chairman, Barings has remained under family management for virtually its entire history. It is a history that has been close to the British establishment. It was a big financier of Britain's war against France in the Napoleonic age, and it remains a manager of part of Queen Elizabeth's fortune. **********But that history has been shaky at various times, most notably just more than a century ago. **********In 1890, Barings went broke largely as a result of bad loans to Argentina, a country it expected would grow prosperous. The firm was reorganized only with the support of the Bank of England, which had to keep loans outstanding to the firm until 1895, when they finally were repaid. **********That collapse cost the leading members of the family dearly. Edward Charles Baring, the first Lord Revelstoke, was running the firm at the time and plunged heavily into Argentina. Most of his assets, including his art collection, were liquidated. **********At the time, sympathy for the Barings was limited, recalled Philip Ziegler in his book, \"The Sixth Great Power,\" which chronicles the history of the firm. Members of the family had been known for haughtiness. **********\"Fancy the Barings being brought so low,\" Randolph Churchill, the father of the future Prime Minister, wrote in 1890. \"Lord Revelstoke will not be able to ride the high horse as much as he used to.\" **********But, Mr. Ziegler wrote, \"though their judgment had been faulty, their probity was undoubted, and the courage and resolution with which they accepted responsibility for the disaster and set about retrieving it, won the admiration of their sourest critics.\" **********In 1890, The New York Times wrote that Barings was \"the greatest banking house of all the world,\" whose \"signature has stood always and everywhere as an absolute guarantee.\" Today, it clearly would not rank so high, but its crisis still is important. **********If Barings is unable to continue in business, it will be a blow to emerging markets, many already reeling from the Mexican economic crisis. Barings is a leading investment bank in a great number of emerging markets and has played an important role in raising capital for many of those countries. Other firms may not be as eager as they would have been a year ago to rush in to fill the void with emerging markets' having lost some of their luster. **********Those markets, however, were not where Barings' problem arose. It was in Japan, one of the world's most developed and liquid markets. That very liquidity evidently allowed a trader to make huge bets that Japanese stocks would rise this year. And it was those bets that may end the story of one of the most remarkable families in world financial history."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/20/business/the-media-business-times-co-to-invest-in-arts-cable-network.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Times Co. to Invest in Arts Cable Network", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Times Co. to Invest in Arts Cable Network", "body_text": " **********The New York Times Company said yesterday that it would acquire a minority stake in Ovation -- the Arts Network, a new cable television network devoted to the visual and performing arts.

These advocates say news organizations should focus less on conflict and more on educating citizens and providing them with ways to participate in public issues. **********Public journalism has begun to attract widespread attention only in the last year or so, but it already has a cadre of national spokesmen and critics. Advocates say traditional journalism has failed, while critics say the job of journalism is to report on society, not to participate in it. **********That discussion often veers into the academic. But in Madison, where The State Journal has been experimenting with public journalism for more than two years, the debate is no longer theoretical. The discussion that is beginning here over the benefits and dangers of public journalism is likely to be repeated in communities across the country. **********For example, the Mayor of Madison, Paul R. Soglin, said he was troubled by the methods being used by The State Journal in one of its most visible public journalism experiments, a long series called City of Hope, which has explored problems of crime, poverty, racism and unemployment in the region. **********To make the process less confrontational and to increase the possibility of finding solutions, Mr. Denton said he had invited city, state and community leaders to periodic meetings at the paper while his reporters prepared their articles. **********Reporters and editors discussed their findings and potential solutions at the meetings. In a sharp break with tradition, the reporters and editors gave the leaders detailed briefings on what would be published in their articles. One result was that the group called together by the newspaper convened a \"jobs summit\" to develop an economic development strategy for the area. **********Mayor Soglin says the experiment has been awkward. The State Journal, the most powerful editorial voice in the region, has been \"wearing two hats\" by reporting a story it helped to create, he said. And Mr. Soglin says he worries about the \"top down\" nature of a process in which a group selected by editors, rather than by voters, is making policy proposals. **********But mostly, he said, he worries that by mixing the roles of creating news and reporting it, the newspaper may get too much power. **********Some of Mr. Denton's reporters have expressed concerns about whether they are getting too close to public figures. Mr. Denton says the paper's news professionals must never advocate one policy or another because that could hurt the credibility of the paper. **********But he said that gathering influential people and giving them advance information was an innovation that made journalists less adversarial with prominent people in the community. \"Instead of making them feel like targets -- and almost victims -- of our journalism we are trying to make them, ultimately, instruments of solutions,\" he said. **********Dave Zweifel, the editor of The Capital Times, the afternoon newspaper here, says he fears that journalists lose perspective when they orchestrate the news. The Capital Times, with a circulation of 23,000 and old sympathies for Wisconsin's progressive political movement, competes for news with The State Journal, which has always been much more politically conservative. The papers have different owners but share many business operations. **********Mr. Zweifel said he thought the concept of public journalism and the movement that is growing up around it have made some journalists lose sight of the most important traditions of their profession. \"My idea of public journalism,\" he said, \"is finding out what's going on and raising hell about it. But I don't think I should go down to the mayor's office and hold his hand.\" **********Not all of The State Journal's public journalism experiments have raised hackles. The paper has sponsored a series of town meetings, public hearings and \"citizen juries\" in partnership with public television and radio stations in Wisconsin, a local public relations firm and the CBS television affiliate here. **********Since 1992, the events, called We the People/Wisconsin, have included town hall meetings on various issues and public events in which the public, rather than journalists, question politicians. Citizen panels have grappled with policy options on complex questions like what should be done about local property taxes and revamping health care. **********The newspaper and broadcast stations have coordinated coverage. Readers, viewers and listeners have been able to view the events, read about them in The State Journal and request more detail and analysis. **********The series has been praised as a sophisticated effort to help people understand public issues. But while public journalism may occasionally be noble, it is not always scintillating, said Marc Eisen, editor of Isthmus, an alternative weekly in Madison. \"It becomes something you respect and admire,\" Mr. Eisen said, \"but you don't necessarily rush home to watch it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/14/world/burmese-raid-border-camps-in-thailand.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1995-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Burmese Raid Border Camps In Thailand", "print_headline": "Burmese Raid Border Camps In Thailand", "body_text": " **********The long, tense border between Thailand and Myanmar has erupted in fighting in recent days with repeated cross-border attacks on Burmese refugees in Thailand by former Burmese rebels now backed by the junta that runs Myanmar. **********One result has been the death of three Thai policemen and the uprooting of thousands of Burmese refugees in Thai refugee camps, with many of them forcibly marched back across the border to Myanmar. **********While Thailand has issued stern diplomatic protests and deployed reinforcements along the border, the Thai military is not threatening a counterattack against the army of Myanmar, despite allegations that Burmese soldiers have joined in the attacks on Thai soil. **********The Thai military, which has little modern battlefield experience, has historically been unwilling to confront the battle-hardened Burmese forces. And despite the border violations, Thailand has insisted it will continue its policy of \"constructive engagement\" with Myanmar, which aims at exerting influence on the country through increased trade and diplomatic contacts. **********The Burmese junta, which took power in 1988 after crushing a nascent democracy movement, has insisted that it is not involved in the attacks in Thailand. The attacks, the junta says, are being carried out by a breakaway faction of the Karen, a large ethnic group along the Thai-Burmese border. **********The Buddhist faction, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, pledged its support for the Burmese junta last year after breaking away from the larger, Christian-led Karen National Union, which has conducted an insurgency against the Burmese Army for decades. **********Despite the Burmese assertions, relief workers along the border have reported seeing the attackers joined by regular Burmese soldiers, whose arsenal has included mortars and rocket-propelled grenades that have been used to level Karen refugee camps in Thailand. **********\"Thai soil is being invaded almost daily by the Burmese Army, and the Thais feel they are powerless to do anything about it,\" a Western diplomat in Bangkok said. \"In a military skirmish, the Thais know they would be beaten badly -- walloped.\" **********Thailand has long sheltered Burmese ethnic groups, including more than 70,000 Karen, in camps along the border, drawing protests from Myanmar that Thailand has become a military staging point for insurgent groups, including the rebel army of Khun Sa, a member of the Shan group and one of the world's largest opium traffickers. **********While the Burmese junta has reached peace agreements with several ethnic groups in the last few years, it has not made peace with the Karen National Union, one of the largest and best-armed of the insurgent organizations, and the fighting has occasionally spilled across the border into Thailand. **********Mr. Khun Sa's rebel army has also been the target of a Burmese Army offensive in recent weeks, with Burmese soldiers reportedly making use of new shipments of heavy arms from China, which has become the principal weapons supplier to Myanmar. **********Diplomats here say the increase in cross-border attacks this month may be intended by the Burmese military as a warning to the Thais that they must stop offering sanctuary to rebels -- or face even more serious attacks on Thai soil. **********The three Thai policemen were killed on May 3 in a gunfight with 30 to 40 uniformed Burmese attackers who poured across the border to attack a Karen refugee camp in western Thailand. The camp was abandoned after the attackers burned down more than 100 bamboo huts used by the refugees. **********Thailand responded by sending helicopter gunships across the border to attack a Burmese village that had been described as a headquarters for the Burmese rebels.

Take, for instance, the First German-Dutch Army Corps stationed in this one-time Prussian garrison town. **********The corps was formally inaugurated late last month to fanfare about the intertwined destiny of two neighbors whose relationship is distinguished by the reluctance of the Netherlands to be nice to Germany, which occupied it during World War II. **********Nonetheless, both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Wim Kok used the occasion to talk of a shared will to reinforce the European pillar of the NATO alliance, even though the joint army corps is little more than a staff office in the Netherlands and a headquarters here, where a Dutch three-star general, Ruud Reitsma, will technically be able to give orders to German two-star generals. The Dutch division of 15,000 soldiers that makes up half the corps will remain in its barracks in the Netherlands, and the 15,000 German soldiers that make up the other half will remain in Germany. **********Three years on, when the command rotates, a German three-star general will oversee a Dutch subordinate. \"Soon, German tanks will be able to roll over the Dutch heath for the first time since the Second World War,\" came the somber comment from the leftist Dutch newspaper Volkskrant. **********Not only that, but since the Dutch Army has been greatly reduced since the end of the cold war, from 130,000 in 1990 to a projected 70,000 all-volunteer force by 1998, the Dutch division in the joint corps makes up a significant part of the Netherlands' total fighting force. A Dutch officer who spoke in return for anonymity worried that the Dutch Army would become a \"branch office\" of the German Army. **********And, since only national parliaments can decide to send troops outside NATO's boundaries, it is unlikely that German and Dutch troops will ever be sent into action together in the localized conflicts that have supplanted the Warsaw Pact as the foe. **********Even training together is a problem. \"You can't deploy divisions in public areas,\" General Reitsma said. **********The new corps headquarters is in the old German I Army Corps headquarters in this town, one much used to the symbols of war and peace. Here, in 1648, the treaty of Munster became the first of a series of pacts in the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the 30 Years' War and guaranteed Dutch sovereignty. **********But the genesis of the new corps has as much to do with the peacetime politics of European soldiers as the emblems of history and unity. **********In an interview, General Reitsma said the post-cold-war shrinking of the Dutch and German armies had whittled away the number of jobs for three-star generals like himself. (A division merits only a two-star general, a corps needs a three-star general.) So, by creating a joint corps, Dutch and German army planners have brightened the senior officers' job market. **********\"If you can commit a corps-level unit, you are in the discussions of peace and strategy,\" General Reitsma said, implying that, if you could not, you are out of the loop in NATO decision-making. **********Still, national distinctions and memories remain. Some Dutch say the Germans are overly given to Prussian notions of discipline, like saluting superior officers. Some Germans say the Dutch are talkers, not doers. **********The past lingers. \"Why is Waterloo history and the Second World War an experience?\" the general mused. \"How many years does it take?\" **********So do the jokes that draw on what many see as the cultural differences between the Dutch and the Germans. \"How does a German open an oyster?\" a Dutch colonel asked.

Government officials here say Mr. Sakakibara was the point man in discussions with Washington and the primary tactician behind Japan's latest efforts to sell yen and buy dollars. **********An exuberant and iconoclastic man who got his doctorate in economics at the University of Michigan and taught briefly at Harvard, Mr. Sakakibara laughs easily and takes a distinctively un-Japanese enjoyment in provoking heated arguments. **********But his American education and mannerisms belie a strong nationalist view about Japan's economic identity. He passionately criticizes Japanese advocates of \"Americanism\" who insist the country needs to untangle the maze of regulations and clubby business practices that make the market so difficult for foreign companies and even Japanese entrepreneurs to penetrate. **********\"If they believe in the universal value of Americanism,\" Mr. Sakakibara wrote last year in Hatsugensha, a monthly magazine, \"the 'reform' they are attempting is nothing but an act of barbarism against our own national cultural values.\" **********Taking a distinctly personal view, Mr. Sakakibara described his dismay at the crime and declining prosperity he saw in York, Pa., where he was a high-school exchange student in 1958. \"This nice little town, to my surprise, was turning into a slum after 30 some years,\" he wrote. \"The high school even had a metal detector at the entrance.\" **********The lesson for Japan, he implied, was clear. In a 1990 book entitled, \"Beyond Capitalism,\" Mr. Sakakibara strenuously argued that Japan's economic system should never be modeled on that of America. **********In another recent magazine article, he wrote that those who argued that Japan needed to be more open, and perhaps to give up security blankets like the corporate practice of lifetime employment, were guilty of \"hysteria\" and \"masochism.\" **********\"Do consumers and salarymen want destruction of the system?\" he wrote. \"The answer is clearly, 'No.' \" Indeed, he said, there was no reason to believe that opening the Japanese market would reduce the country's trade surplus with the world or weaken the yen. \"This theory is doubly wrong,\" he said. **********For now, Japan and the United States are in broad agreement about the need to devalue the yen. Until recently, American policy had been to either support a strong yen -- which makes American products cheaper in Japan -- or to be indifferent. **********But that changed after the dollar plunged just below 80 yen last spring, and Japan became more desperately mired as growth stagnated, real estate plunged and problem loans at banks grew to more than $400 billion. **********From the American perspective, a Japanese economy that is too crippled to import is potentially more troubling than a strong dollar. **********The upshot was a coordinated effort over the last month to begin pushing the dollar up and the yen down. In Japan, currency experts and Finance Ministry officials say Mr. Sakakibara's biggest contribution may have simply been his ability to charm and persuade Treasury officials that the time had come for action. Indeed, Mr. Sakakibara is said to be a close friend of Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. **********Despite his talkative nature, Mr. Sakakibara has tried to lower his visibility in recent days and has turned down all requests for interviews, including for this article. People close to him say Mr. Sakakibara has become worried about upstaging the Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura. **********But currency experts and bankers say there is little doubt about who is in charge of the yen right now. \"On Japan's side, it's been Sakakibara -- everyone knows he has become the strong person,\" said Mamuro Yamazaki, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in Japan. **********\"He is very sharp, and very good at communicating,\" said Hajime Shinohara, counselor at the Bank of Tokyo and a longtime friend of Mr. Sakakibara. \"What strikes me about him are his abilities and his charm.  He can be very persuasive.\" **********Ultimately, currency values are set by global capital flows rather than attempts by central bankers.  And the yen is getting knocked down by a host of other Government policies: the Bank of Japan slashed its discount rate to five-tenths of a percent last week, one of the lowest rates ever, and the Finance Ministry is planning to disclose another stimulus plan next week that would, if approved by the Parliament, provide more than $100 billion in new spending and tax breaks to stimulate the economy. **********For the moment, however, most eyes are on the currency operation. Mr. Takemura, the Finance Minister, said this week that the yen still had further to fall and many traders believe the dollar could soon reach 105 yen.

In those days, bond traders looked at any prolonged period of dollar weakness against the yen with genuine alarm. **********\"The slightest possibility of a tumble in the dollar would have caused a problem for financial markets\" back then, said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Lehman Brothers. **********But times have changed, and the American stock and bond markets have not only withstood the downward pressure on the dollar, but flourished, to the amazement of some analysts. **********\"I don't understand how two-year Treasury notes can possibly be yielding 6.87 percent with the dollar collapsing,\" said David Buchen, a managing director at Citibank who is in charge of the bank's foreign exchange operations. \"And I don't understand why, if people like marks so much, that 10-year German bonds are yielding about 7.35 percent while 10-year Treasuries are yielding just about the same thing.

The inflationary effect of a lower dollar would be much more profound if countries with strong currencies like Germany, Japan and Switzerland, were America's most important trading partners. They are not. **********Indeed, Canada and Mexico, which last year ranked first and third, respectively, in terms of bilateral trade with the United States, have currencies far weaker than the dollar. Moreover, to maintain market share, foreign companies based in strong-currency countries have either squeezed profit margins drastically or moved operations to the United States. **********All these factors, coupled with signs that the pace of economic expansion in the United States is slowing, make it very unlikely that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates to support the dollar. **********\"In a slowing economy, a falling dollar is a good thing,\" Mr. Sinai said, \"because it helps boost exports and damps import demand.\" **********And William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., money management firm with $60 billion in fixed-income assets under management, said the recent weakness in the dollar was a \"negative for holders of long-term Treasuries, but not a negative for the overall level of interest rates.\" **********Dollar-related jitters may rattle in the credit markets for a short while, said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. Despite near-term caution, Mr. Resler said he remained a fan of dollar-denominated financial assets. **********\"We were moving toward another month of improving prices and falling yields,\" he said. \"But if I am a dollar-based investor, I want to keep my money invested in the U.S. stock and bond markets this year. Earnings look good, and interest rates will continue to come down as the economy continues to slow.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/20/business/japan-sets-big-package-of-spending.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1006, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Sets Big Package Of Spending", "print_headline": "Japan Sets Big Package Of Spending", "body_text": " **********In its biggest attempt yet to jump-start the stalled Japanese economy -- or at least to keep it from rolling backward -- the Government announced today a package of more than $140 billion in new spending and loan programs aimed at stimulating business. **********The new package is considerably bigger than most experts had been expecting in recent days, and it is also bigger than many conservative officials in the Ministry of Finance had originally wanted. But bankers and corporate executives had lobbied heavily for a big jolt to the economy, and the Government officials were apparently unnerved when the stock market dropped on Monday after reports of a more modest package were printed in the local press. **********But analysts said the ultimate impact would still be modest. The new spending, which includes more than $50 billion in new construction projects and other public works measures, should keep Japan's economy from spiraling downward into a decline, but many experts expect anemic growth this year of half of 1 percent or less. **********\"It's a lot of sugar, but not much protein,\" said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. \"A lot of the spending is money that will just turn off at the end of this fiscal year, and they will have to repeat this next year if they want to keep going.\" **********Regardless of the impact of the latest measures, the deeper and more painful debate about Japan's economic identity will continue. At the top of the list of questions is whether the country's big manufacturers, particularly the auto makers, will try to reduce excess capacity by shutting down factories and laying off workers, a move fraught with political hazards. Not far behind is how the banking system will come to terms with its mountain of bad loans, a process that probably means closing insolvent banks and taking hundreds of billions of dollars in write-offs. **********The new Government program is also expected to offer only modest proposals to deregulate the economy, despite a growing chorus of complaint from banks and industrial companies that Government regulations are too intrusive and create a big drag on the economy. **********Top Government officials have said they strongly favor deregulation, but plan to delay most of those initiatives until later this year or early 1996. **********\"Fiscal pump priming will only go so far,\" said Jesper Koll, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd. \"It is the private sector that will have to bring out the animal spirits.\" **********Continued stagnation would be bad news for the United States. Clinton Administration officials have pressed the Government in Tokyo to do more to stimulate the economy in the hope that a rebound in Japanese consumer demand would cause an increase in imports of American goods and help narrow Japan's wide trade surplus. A narrowing of the trade imbalance, in turn, would weaken the yen further, aiding Japanese exports. **********Japan's economy has been stagnant for the last four years, almost as if it collapsed from exhaustion after its superheated expansion during the 1980's. Real estate prices have plunged by more than 50 percent on many properties. The automobile industry has about 30 percent more manufacturing capacity than it needs at the moment. **********The official unemployment rate has crept up to 3.2 percent, despite the adherence to \"lifetime employment\" practices, and those figures do not include women who went back to being housewives or college graduates who decided to stay in school. **********\"Structural problems need solutions,\" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. \"If you don't account for them, then a 10 trillion or 12 trillion yen stimulus package will be only a temporary panacea. Fiscal policy is not a permanent panacea.\" **********As a practical matter, however, most of the debate in recent days has been about the amount of \"mamizu\" or \"pure water\" -- real additions to spending as opposed to reshuffling money -- that will be in the economic stimulus program. **********Investment analysts and bankers consider money spent for construction projects and other public works as \"pure water.\" Expanded loan programs for home buyers and small business, by contrast, are not considered \"pure water\" because most of that money would simply substitute for capital that private banks would lend on their own. **********Top bankers have adamantly argued in recent days that the new plan should have at least 5 trillion yen, roughly $50 billion, in real additions to spending. But the staunchly conservative Ministry of Finance has resisted those numbers and made it clear through press leaks that it was looking for a smaller kick of $30 billion to $40 billion. **********\"This stimulus package is really a patchwork policy, in the sense that we continue to find the Ministry of Finance sharply torn between the budget deficit in Japan and the clear prospect for further economic deterioration,\" Mr. Koll of J. P. Morgan said. **********Japan's budget deficit equals about 4.5 percent of gross domestic product. That exceeds the corresponding figure for the United States budget deficit, which is equivalent to about 2 percent of American output. **********Corporate executives were unwilling to comment on the economic package until it was officially released, but many had been pressing for at least 5 trillion yen, or $50 billion, in \"pure water\" -- which now appears to be likely. **********On Tuesday, the Government reported that Japan's economy grew eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter of this year from the previous quarter, or at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. But analysts expressed doubt that growth could continue at such a rate. **********Mr. Koll predicted that the Japanese economy would grow by about three-tenths of 1 percent in the 1995 fiscal year, which ends in March, and about 1.5 percent in 1996. Ms. Sasaki-Smith of Morgan Stanley, describing herself as a pessimist, predicted that growth would not exceed one-half percent in 1995."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/22/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-jerry-ketchum-receives-3-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jerry & Ketchum Receives 3 Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Jerry & Ketchum Receives 3 Accounts", "body_text": " **********The Jerry & Ketchum unit of Ketchum Communications in New York has been awarded three accounts with combined billings estimated at more than $15 million: the Union Camp Corporation, Ruff Hewn and Speedo Authentic Fitness, affiliated with Warnaco Inc.

Mr. Levitt said that if a survey of investors who received the new documents showed they were helpful, the commission was likely to allow the shorter form to be used alone, without the long form attached. **********At the same time, however, Mr. Levitt said the commission was working with the National Association of Securities Dealers to draw up \"better and fairer sales practices\" among the securities brokers who sell mutual funds to individual investors. That effort extends to the mutual fund industry one of the themes Mr. Levitt has sounded since taking over the agency's chairmanship in July 1993: curbing the practice among some brokers of not adequately explaining an investment's potential risks to customers. **********The mutual fund industry has eagerly awaited approval of the profile prospectus; many industry executives contend that many investors either do not read or cannot understand the complex disclosure documents that fund companies are required to provide. The time frame disclosed by Mr. Levitt today means approval of the new document could come \"sooner than we would have guessed,\" said Jon S. Fossel, chairman of the Investment Company Institute. **********\"Prospectuses, fund advertisements and even some fund names can leave investors with the wrong impression about safety,\" Mr. Levitt said. \"To put all of these documents in plain English is a passion of mine.\" The eight companies whose customers will be the first to receive the profile prospectuses are: Bank of America, Capital Research and Management, Dreyfus, Fidelity, American Express Financial Advisors, T. Rowe Price, Scudder and Vanguard. **********Mr. Levitt said he strengthened his resolve to speed simplification of the disclosure documents while attending a series of \"town meetings\" that the S.E.C. has conducted in recent months with individual investors around the country. More than 1,100 people attended one such session last month in Dallas, the largest of the eight meetings to date; altogether 2,800 people have attended the meetings. **********Mr. Levitt said, \"There is an absolute thirst for knowledge about investments among these individuals, but they are afraid to ask questions because they are too embarrassed or ashamed that they don't know the answers.\" **********Nearly one in 3 households owns fund shares, up from one in 16 in 1980. The ratio has increased sharply as more employers have changed to defined-contribution pension plans, under which the individual employee generally decides how retirement funds are invested. **********The town meetings have also convinced Mr. Levitt that mutual fund risks are not adequately detailed, he said. In March, the agency asked for industry and public comment on a proposal to add to each mutual fund prospectus additional information about the fund's risk. **********How to measure and communicate to investors a particular fund's risk was the major topic of discussion among industry executives at the conference. While many support the goal, few agree on the best way to measure risk. Proposals have ranged from the simple, like a numerical scale from one to five, to more complex statistical measures, like the standard deviation of the fund's annual performance. **********Mr. Levitt, who had previously voiced support for the more rigorous statistical measures, backed away from that view today. But he lent support to the possibility of using one of several less complex risk measures, such as a bar chart of a fund's yearly gains and losses. **********\"We've identified a need for improved risk disclosure,\" Mr. Levitt said. \"Over the last decade, U.S. households have become more significant risk takers, raising the proportion of assets invested in stocks and longer-term bonds from roughly one-third to one-half. Mutual funds have served as the principal vehicle for taking on these additional risks. But we're concerned that the risks are not presented well enough.\" In particular, he noted, \"a majority of those investors have seen nothing but an up market\" in stocks over the last decade. **********For funds that are sold by brokers, that increases the need for fund companies to make sure the salesmen are not misleading investors about the management fees and sales commissions they will pay, Mr. Levitt said. The funds sold by brokers are generally load funds, which charge a sale commission in addition to management fees. No-load funds are sold directly to investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/international-briefs-europeans-seal-communications-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Europeans Seal Communications Pact", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Europeans Seal Communications Pact", "body_text": " **********Veba A.G. and Cable and Wireless P.L.C. sealed an alliance yesterday to operate telecommunications services across Europe. **********Veba, a German utility, and Cable and Wireless, a British telecommunications company, set up two jointly owned companies.

Pace, Goodyear's manager here, heard on his car radio last December that the peso had crashed, dragging the nation's economy with it, he immediately met with his managers to assess the damage. Within days, he figured that domestic demand for their tires would plunge more than 20 percent, or 3,000 a day. His choices: lay off workers or find new export markets -- right away, before his warehouse overflowed. **********Mr. Pace turned his office into a war room. On his walls, members of what he called Team 3,000 pinned outlines and diagrams of strategies to capture new foreign customers, especially in the United States. **********Among the goals: sell 120 more truck tires a day to the United States. And 40 to 48 for mobile homes. Plus another 400 a day to a Chrysler plant in Mexico for new Neons headed north. And why not hawk a few tires in Venezuela? Or Switzerland? **********His team members, aided by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company headquarters in Akron, Ohio, not only found enough buyers to make up for what turned out to be a 3,500-tire drop in domestic sales. They also found spots to sell 1,600 more, setting an output record at the plant, some 15 miles north of Mexico City. A factory that had imported supplies but exported not a single tire in 1992 now ships away half its production, mostly to the United States but also to South America and Europe. \"From one day to another we passed from being an importer company to an exporter company,\" said Marcel Miota, Mr. Pace's production chief. **********Goodyear is just one of many big American companies here that have compensated for the collapse of domestic demand by sending goods abroad, to the United States most of all. As the peso shriveled in value, these companies saw their labor costs, in dollars, fall by more than a third. The resulting flood into the United States of cheaper autos, televisions and other products, including tires, is turning last year's $1.4 billion trade surplus with Mexico into a $15 billion deficit. **********The imbalance has revived the debate over whether the United States should have welcomed Mexico into a new North American free trade zone last year. Several Presidential contenders have already featured opposition to free trade with Mexico in their campaigns. Some economists predict that the deficit, reflecting slower Mexican demand for United States goods but mostly higher Mexican exports, will cost more than 100,000 American jobs this year. **********Calculating the ultimate effects of Goodyear's turnaround and the wider trade deficit with Mexico is far from simple, though. In trade, unlike football, one side's gains are not always the other side's losses. Increased trade can benefit consumers and create jobs in both countries. **********Herminio Blanco, Mexico's Commerce Secretary, noted that although Mexican exports to the United States have risen almost 30 percent this year, United States exports to Mexico are off less than 10 percent. \"As soon as this crisis passes, this is going to be an excellent market,\" he said in an interview. \"Mexico is an excellent source of jobs for the United States.\" **********Mr. Blanco believes, however, that this year's export gains will be permanent, even a base for further advances. What is more, Mr. Blanco is pressing American companies to substitute local supplies for American parts at their Mexican plants. **********Goodyear says that because its United States factories are already running flat out, it is merely adding production in Mexico. But many other companies have shifted jobs to Mexico this year -- mostly under long-range plans that have, if anything, accelerated since the peso's collapse lowered their labor costs. According to Labor Department records, Allied Signal, Mattel, General Electric and Zenith are some of the companies that have laid off American workers and moved production south. (Even so, Mexico's overall job losses from the economic crisis far exceed the worst projections for the United States' loss.) **********Most unions say that Mexico's economic woes and the draining of jobs from the United States bear out their arguments against the trade pact. \"Here's one of those situations where I wish we were wrong,\" said Mark A. Anderson, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. task force on trade. **********For all its new activity, Goodyear's tire plant here, the nation's largest, still seems like a mile-long relic of the industrial past. Outside, 48 years of grime have turned the plant the same color as its products. Inside, the darkness is punctuated by the hissing and clanking of hulking machines and the twinkling lights of small shrines, mounted on columns, to the Virgin of Guadalupe. **********Goodyear commands a leading 30 percent of the Mexican tire market. But the plant's plodding ways under a hidebound union long discouraged renovations and ruled out exports. **********By 1992, however, Mr. Pace saw how a pending North American Free Trade Agreement would eventually remove the 20 percent tariff that had protected Mexican plants from more efficient American competition. Mr. Pace called in the union to explain that Mexico could be swamped by imports. With grudging union cooperation, he cut more than 500 of the plant's 2,500 workers, who in 1992 produced 12,500 tires a day. **********Mr. Pace, a lanky, slouching sloganeer -- \"profit is not a dirty word,\" he lectured his workers, \"it's why we're here\" -- invited suggestions about improving productivity. Despite the cutbacks, output rose to 13,500 tires a day in 1993 and 14,700 in 1994. In gratitude, Mr. Pace renovated the fetid bathrooms, installing tile floors, marble counters and new showers. **********Higher output required higher sales, mostly in the United States. In 1993, the plant began shipping tires north, although only 7 percent of output. Last year, after the trade pact took effect on Jan. 1, removing a 4 percent United States tire tariff, the plant exported about 20 percent of production. **********The peso's December collapse threatened all the trust that Mr. Pace had painfully won. He called union leaders into his office for a message he soon repeated in letters to every worker. \"We cannot promise you anything,\" Mr. Pace told the union chiefs. \"But we will work 24 hours a day to find export business to substitute for domestic demand.\" **********The United States topped his managers' target list, but Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Western Europe, East Asia, even Russia, also came up. In his office, managers translated their discussions into task lists and diagrams at a flip chart on an easel, then pinned the pages to the walls. \"The only thing not in the scenario was a square tire,\" said Mr. Miota, the production chief. **********The managers then worked the phones, calling former bosses, colleagues and employees in Goodyear's global organization, reminding them of favors owed. With plants in 30 countries and a crisis always breaking out somewhere, Goodyear has become expert at moving tires to stronger markets, as long as they can be profitably sold. **********Mr. Pace, at 43 one of the company's top foreign trouble-shooters, worked on his Goodyear friends from previous assignments in South America. He persuaded them to stock and sell some tire types from Mexico that they did not make themselves and some that they did. **********The plant desperately needed molds from headquarters in Akron to make seven new tire models for the United States and more for South America. The reduced labor costs were a clincher. Since December, the peso has lost nearly half its value against the dollar -- tumbling to about 16 cents, from about 29 -- but union wages at this plant and many others have risen just 8 percent. \"That devaluation helped us to be competitive,\" said Pablo M. Ross, Goodyear's logistics director here. **********Goodyear will not disclose overall production costs. But Mr. Pace says supply costs are similar in the United States and Mexico. And for every dollar Goodyear spends in the United States on labor, it can get the same output for 62 cents in Mexico -- down from 90 cents before the devaluation. **********Tire plants in the United States pay $17 an hour in wages alone. Mr. Miota says workers here average $10.50 an hour in wages and benefits, or more than $15 before the peso's plunge. While they are generally paid well enough to buy cars, own houses and earn the envy of friends and relatives, none of several workers interviewed said they were compensated nearly as well as Mr. Miota said. Nicolas Martinez Martinez, a senior power technician and one of the plant's best-paid workers, earns about 4,000 pesos a month, or roughly $3 an hour. Mr. Pace says that benefits more than double wages. **********The workers bemoan the loss of purchasing power from inflation, which this year has run at an annual rate of about 50 percent. Mr. Martinez, used to vacations in Acapulco and other resorts, is staying home this year, citing the higher costs of everything from shoes to gasoline. **********Still, employees are glad they work for a company that can export to preserve their jobs. \"It's a very strong international company,\" said Juan Jimenez Salinas, glancing down from his forklift. He earns about $80 a week. **********In Mr. Pace's office, export deals for new tires soon found their way from the sheets pinned on the walls to a central tally on the easel. **********The Chrysler Corporation, which started using the plant's tires last year, agreed to take another 400 as its own exports rose. Next to the \"Mobile Home 40-48 tires a day\" entry, Mr. Pace marked \"Done. Jan. 13, 1995.\" He also found new markets north of the border for Unisteel radial truck tires, high-performance Eagle car tires and private label tires. By midyear, exports to the United States more than doubled, to at least 5,200 a day. **********The plant got far more help from other markets than managers anticipated. They were soon able to sell 2,600 tires a day to Latin America. Though sales there have slowed, beginning this month they have been selling 900 tires a day to Europe and about 100 a day to Japan. **********All told, the plant is turning out 16,300 tires a day, 11 percent more than the year before. Mr. Pace plans to maintain or increase exports even when the local market picks up, as it is just starting to do. **********By increasing productivity two-thirds in the last three years, he added, the factory has become a candidate for a major expansion. **********In the long run, the plant will stop trying to make every type of tire the Mexican market needs and instead concentrate efficiently, like American plants, on a few models. Just watch what happens to his exports then, Mr. Pace said. \"We've got this magnificent opportunity now, and we cannot let go of it,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/17/world/discord-is-rising-over-pact-on-spread-of-nuclear-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1995-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2023, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Discord Is Rising Over Pact On Spread of Nuclear Arms", "print_headline": "Discord Is Rising Over Pact On Spread of Nuclear Arms", "body_text": " **********For a quarter of a century, a relatively simple treaty of fewer than 50 paragraphs has served as the touchstone of all international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons and to prevent peaceful nuclear projects from being used in destructive ways. **********Now the 1968 accord, the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is up for renewal, 25 years after it took effect, in 1970. **********The accord has done its job reasonably well. But as representatives from 174 nations gather here to begin a four-week conference on Monday to review and renew the treaty, there are sharp differences about its future. **********The United States and the other four nations that acknowledge having nuclear weapons -- Britain, China, France and Russia -- want to extend the treaty, known as the NPT, indefinitely and unconditionally. **********All signers to the treaty, except the five nuclear powers, have been required to renounce all nuclear weapons programs. The five nations argue that if the treaty is not renewed indefinitely, it will lack a sense of permanence and may tempt some countries to develop nuclear arms or to resume nuclear programs that can be diverted toward offensive purposes. **********\"The NPT is the centerpiece of all our post-cold-war arms-control efforts,\" John D. Holum, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said at a State Department briefing on Thursday. **********Mr. Holum said the conference will be the only opportunity to make the treaty permanent by a simple majority vote because there is the possibility that the signers may decide on limited periods of extension instead. The Clinton Administration believes that it has enough support to get the treaty extended on a straight open vote, and hopes to obtain a large majority so the accord will have greater force. **********But a number of leading non-nuclear nations are proposing limited extensions and other methods for approval. They base such proposals on arguments that the nuclear powers have failed to live up to pledges under the treaty, and that extending the pact indefinitely will allow those promises to go unfulfilled forever. **********Fundamentally, they say, the nuclear powers are not moving fast enough toward disarmament, as defined under Article VI; are not willing to give binding guarantees of assistance in case of nuclear attack, a provision that is supplemental to the treaty, and are not sharing peaceful nuclear technologies adequately, as required by Article V. Among those lined up against the United States are Venezuela, Mexico, Nigeria and Indonesia. **********More specific outlines of the outcome here will emerge during the first three weeks of negotiations, when the treaty will be reviewed and as delegates try to reconcile the fundamental issues put forth by the leading non-nuclear countries and other nations.

Although that has not happened, the world of 1995 is very different from that envisioned by the treaty's drafters, who labored in an environment polarized by superpowers. With the world no longer rigidly divided but increasingly fragmented, there are many new countries and new opinions to contend with. **********\"For the first time since 1815, no great powers are threatening each other,\" said Charles William Maynes, a former diplomat and editor of the journal Foreign Policy. \"This is the opportunity to get down to reducing weapons to a minimum deterrent. In fact some people think we could go even farther: there are those who believe we can set out the possibility of a non-nuclear weapons world.\" **********Because countries without nuclear weapons want to exploit this possibility, the debate on extending the treaty is expected to be intense. **********\"We are prepared for a very difficult and volatile situation in New York,\" Thomas Graham, the chief United States negotiator, recently told Basic Reports, an international security newsletter. **********George Bunn, the deputy chief American negotiator when the treaty was written, agrees that it would be foolish to predict the outcome of this conference. But Mr. Bunn, who is now with the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford University, said in an interview that he was encouraged by the unanimous adoption of a Security Council resolution on Tuesday giving non-nuclear nations qualified guarantees of assistance in case of attack by a nuclear power. **********Leading nations from the developing world -- including Indonesia and Nigeria, which are now members of the Security Council -- had strong reservations about what they saw as the weakness of the commitment. **********\"But they voted for it,\" Mr. Bunn said. \"That is a good omen.\" **********Some leaders of the developing world say the Administration's campaign for a straight vote will deepen discontent and may tempt governments to violate or even withdraw from the treaty. **********\"If indeed they want to push for a majority vote -- and they already claim they have an overwhelming majority -- then that will be the end of the NPT itself,\" Nugroho Wisnumurti, Indonesia's chief delegate to the United Nations, said in an interview. He prefers an agreement by consensus or a secret ballot to avoid a divisive public showdown. **********Some Western analysts agree that the most powerful countries should not try simply to reaffirm the status quo, but should seek solidarity to stop the ambitions of rogue states. **********\"History is full of periods when empires collapse and there are brief periods of stability before new competitions arise,\" said Daniel Plesch, director of the British-American Security Information Council, an independent research organization. **********\"By a combination of luck and good management, we got through the cold war without blowing ourselves up,\" he continued. \"We're now at a moment when we can get nuclear weapons under control and on the way out -- or we can fumble it, and watch the sort of events that occurred in Yugoslavia happen on a grand scale between nation-states over a longer time frame. **********\"I don't think most people realize what an historic moment this is.\" **********American officials say it is unrealistic to expect a nuclear-free world anytime soon. They also argue that the nuclear arms race has already been stopped in effect through agreements between Moscow and Washington, though the number of weapons permitted is still higher than it was when the treaty went into effect. **********Mr. Graham, the American negotiator, recently called demands for quicker disarmament \"propaganda\" rooted in cold-war thinking. **********Among those who take an opposite view is Daniel Ellsberg, the former Defense Department official who leaked the Pentagon Papers and who is now director of Manhattan Project II, a disarmament program at Physicians for Social Responsibility in Washington. **********He said in an interview that cold-war thinking was taking place in important parts of the American policy establishment, where the ghost of the Warsaw Pact, the defunct Soviet-led military alliance, still hovers. **********This is reflected, Mr. Ellsberg said, in the language of the assurance recently made by the United States, Britain, France and Russia, which tempered a pledge not to use nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear-weapons nation with exceptions for nations that may be allied a nuclear-weapons country. **********\"NATO policy was and still is based on a plan to initiate nuclear weapons use in case of attack from the Warsaw Pact,\" he said. **********China made the only unconditional \"no first use\" pledge. **********The United States has done so only in supporting the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco, which barred nuclear weapons from Latin America and the Caribbean. Mr. Bunn described this as \"a discrepancy hard to explain.\" Another regional accord, the Rarotonga Treaty, made the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone in 1985. **********Although the conference here will focus on continuing efforts to halt the spread of weapons, other issues, not all directly covered by the pact, are likely to be debated. Nuclear powers will be urged to move faster in drafting a separate treaty barring nuclear tests, and on a pact to stop production of fuel for nuclear weapons. **********Critics of the pact will also point to the continuing failure to persuade India, Israel and Pakistan, which have nuclear technology and almost certainly nuclear weapons, to join the treaty. North Korea, Iran and possibly Iraq, which signed the treaty, are suspected of violating it. **********After conflicting signals from Cairo, Egypt's chief delegate to the United Nations, Nabil A. Elaraby, repeated on Thursday that his Government could not agree to an indefinite extension if the treaty lacked \"universality.\" This was an allusion to Israel. **********For their part, the Israelis say they cannot agree to any non-nuclear pact as long as the nuclear intentions of countries like Iraq and Iran remain suspicious and while the region lacks an acceptable reality of general peace. **********There will also be calls to strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, the United Nations agency that is charged with monitoring compliance but must operate on a small budget while its tasks expand. Those tasks now cover Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, three former Soviet republics that have renounced nuclear weapons and are dismantling them and returning them to Russia. A CLOSER LOOK Points of Contention as Debate Opens on Nuclear Treaty **********As a conference opens at the United Nations today on renewing the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, some non-nuclear nations are proposing limited extensions and other methods for its approval, arguing that the nuclear powers have failed to live up to pledges under the treaty. **********They assert that the nuclear powers are not sharing peaceful nuclear technologies adequately, as required by Article V of the treaty; are not moving fast enough toward disarmament, as defined under Article VI, and are not willing to give binding guarantees of assistance in case of nuclear attack, a provision that is supplemental to the treaty. Here is the text of Articles V and VI: ARTICLE V Each Party to the treaty undertakes to take appropriate measures to insure that in accordance with this treaty, under appropriate international observation and through appropriate international procedures, potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions will be made available to non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty on a non-discriminatory basis and that the charge to such parties for the explosive devices used will be as low as possible and exclude any charge for research and development. Non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty shall be able to obtain such benefits, pursuant to a special international agreement or agreements, through an appropriate international body with adequate representation of non-nuclear-weapon states. Negotiations on this subject shall commence as soon as possible after the treaty enters into force. Non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty so desiring may also obtain such benefits purusant to bilateral agreements.  Article VI Each of the parties to the treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/18/business/company-news-purchase-by-pacific-telecom-gets-fcc-approval.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PURCHASE BY PACIFIC TELECOM GETS F.C.C.

The company's stock nearly doubled on its first day of public trading in February. But on Friday, General Magic closed at $15.325, well off its $32 peak earlier this year. **********As those who spend time with visionaries know, it is a lot harder to deliver a product than a promise. Plagued by an exodus of executive and technical talent, a lukewarm market reception and tough new competition for its technology, General Magic may have to pull more than a rabbit out of its famous top-hat logo to keep its act together. **********The recent reorganization separated the company into two business units organized under its main software products: the Magic Cap communications system and the Telescript programming language. What has gone unnoted is that the reorganization is actually a shift to General Magic's original 1993 strategy. **********Magic Cap's cartoony interface and built-in networking features were invented to make electronic communication easy -- particularly through small hand-held devices -- in the same way that graphical user interfaces like the Apple Macintosh system were designed to simplify the work of personal computing. Today, Magic Cap, which is found in both the Sony Magic Link and Motorola Envoy hand-held communicators, supports rich messaging -- E-mail on steroids that can contain text, sound and animated graphics. **********Magic Cap also simplifies the entire communication process. To do so, it incorporates what is actually General Magic's core technology -- the Telescript programming language. Telescript enables the creation of autonomous, intelligent software \"agents,\" which are small computer programs that can be customized by individual users and are designed to sally forth onto a computer or telephone network. **********Out on the network, the agents connect with the Telescript \"engines\" -- special-purpose software that helps the agents perform their tasks. Today, the agents mostly filter and forward E-mail. Tomorrow's agents may perform complex tasks, like negotiating for meeting and travel schedules and on-line shopping, with little or no human intervention. **********When General Magic first described its strategy two years ago, the vision was clear: Telescript engines would be incorporated into all kinds of digital devices, from network server computers to office telephone systems. At the time, Mr. Porat said that Magic Cap was merely his company's own \"proof of concept\" for the power of Telescript. **********As a potential industry standard, Telescript could move into what could have been General Magic's target from the get-go -- the lucrative market for business computer networks and their suppliers. **********But because it was a start-up with scarce resources -- despite having some big \"Founding Partner\" equity investors like Apple Computer, AT&T, Matsushita, Philips Electronics and Sony -- the company soon began focusing on Magic Cap. Seemingly abandoned was the plan to develop Telescript independently of Magic Cap. The few customers who bought Magic Cap devices found an operating system that was incompatible with their desktop PC's, and yet another E-mail address -- provided by AT&T, which developed a proprietary Telescript-based network called Personalink. **********Slow sales of the devices, which began shipping almost a year ago, have not made for good relations with AT&T. The communications giant leaned on General Magic to deliver a Magic Cap application for PC users in an attempt to expand the number of potential Personalink subscribers. **********As a result, in a classic case of cart before the horse, General Magic is expected to ship a PC version compatible with Microsoft's Windows 3.1 next month -- at roughly the same time it will finally release its first software development kit to enable other equipment makers to develop Telescript applications. **********But the decision to release Magic Cap for Windows has apparently alienated equity partners like Sony and Motorola, which see such a product as direct competition for sales of their hand-held devices. **********Mr. Porat has often said that alliance management was his company's \"third technology,\" and likened it to \"dancing with the bears\" -- one wrong move by the tiny prima ballerina, and it's curtains. Although Mr. Porat said that a meeting of General Magic's 15 founding partners last week \"exceeded expectations,\" word on the street is that some partners are frazzled by delays in upgrading Magic Cap and releasing Telescript development tools. **********Meanwhile, the overwhelming interest in all things Internet threatens to eclipse Telescript even before it reaches orbit. Most notably, Sun Microsystems claims that its Java programming language does a better job of everything that Telescript can do, including the provision of agents. Sun is already literally giving away Java via the World Wide Web, providing legions of software developers with free access to a tool that could make Telescript obsolete. And Microsoft is said to be working on similar technologies. **********Such competitive threats make it impossible for General Magic to set de facto industry technical standards with Magic Cap and Telescript, as it hoped. And as soon as outside software developers start testing the limits of the company's technology, sleight of hand will cease to be an option: ready or not, General Magic will move off the stage and into the real world."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/12/business/international-briefs-bba-group-to-sell-units.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BBA Group to Sell Units", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; BBA Group to Sell Units", "body_text": " **********The BBA Group P.L.C., a British automotive- , aviation- and electrical-components maker, said yesterday that it would sell its automotive-products brake and clutch division to Cinven, for $:181.2 million, or $290 million.

In December, General Shihabi and the previous Israeli chief of staff made inflexible presentations, then did not even talk about the other side's positions. **********The latest talks, which took place in Fort McNair, focused on security arrangements. **********Israeli officials said there was agreement in principle in four important areas: establishing a demilitarized zone, adding a zone with a limited troop presence beyond that, setting up an early warning system and fostering confidence-building measures between the two armies. **********But there was no agreement on details, the Israelis added. **********Diplomats involved in the talks said Israel wants to maintain ground stations in the Golan Heights to monitor Syrian troop movements; Syria opposes such an idea, favoring aerial surveillance instead. Israeli officials said that if monitoring stations were allowed on the Golan Heights, they would allow Syria to maintain such stations in northern Israel to monitor's Israel's military. **********The two sides also discussed using third-country observers. \"What we are trying to reach is a point where a future war will be impossible,\" a senior Israeli official said. **********To build mutual confidence, the the negotiators discussed visits by military delegations, setting up a special communications network and using joint patrols on Golan. Israel has called for such measures as soon as possible to ease public distrust of Syria, but Syrian officials here said they opposed such measures until there is a peace accord. **********One Israeli official said the Syrians took a \"hard line\" and added: \"It's not an easy thing for both peoples to compromise about a future that's very different from the past. There's a lot of mistrust.\" **********The two military leaders met briefly with President Clinton. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, \"A good deal of work remains to be done\" but the talks \"represented a very important step in the right direction.\" **********American officials said they expected lower-level diplomats and military officials to resume talks in Washington in late July. **********In Israel on Wednesday, the head of the Likud opposition party, Benjamin Netanyahu, released parts of what he said were Government instructions for General Shahak, which he said called for full withdrawal from Golan -- something the Rabin Government has never publicly offered.

Like them, Mrs. Contemplacion was forced by the wrenching poverty of the Philippines to leave her family behind and seek menial work in a foreign land. **********But in death, the 42-year-old Filipino maid has achieved a type of martyrdom. Mrs. Contemplacion's execution last week in Singapore horrified millions of Filipinos and stirred up a sense of outraged nationalism not evident in this country in years. **********It was surely a sign of the passion felt here that President Fidel V. Ramos said on Saturday that Mrs. Contemplacion, who was convicted of killing a 4-year-old child, was a \"beloved\" national heroine whose death would \"not be in vain.\" **********Today, in another sign of the impact of Mrs. Contemplacion's death, the Government of Singapore announced that it would postpone indefinitely a state visit to the Philippines by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. **********The Prime Minister's visit, originally scheduled for next month, would be postponed \"to a more propitious time,\" the Philippine Foreign Secretary, Roberto Romulo, said today at a news conference here. \"This postponement was reached by mutual agreement between the Philippine and Singapore Governments.\" **********The Foreign Secretary did not offer any explanation for the postponement, but other Philippine officials said the reason for the delay should be obvious. \"If the Singaporeans came to town now, there would be riots in the streets of Manila,\" a senior Philippines diplomat said. No new date was announced for the Prime Minister's visit. **********Mrs. Contemplacion was hanged Friday for the killings in 1991 of another Filipino maid, Delia Maga, and a 4-year-old Singaporean boy who was in Mrs. Maga's care. Singaporean prosecutors said that Mrs. Contemplacion had freely confessed to responsibility for the deaths. **********She was accused of strangling Mrs. Maga and the boy after an argument in which Mrs. Maga announced that she would not carry back to the Philippines a heavy package from Mrs. Contemplacion to her family. Mrs. Contemplacion's unemployed husband and four children remained behind in the Philippines while she worked in Singapore. Until their final reunion last month, Mrs. Contemplacion had not seen her children since 1991. **********If the story had ended there, with Mrs. Contemplacion's guilt all but certain, her execution might well have produced no uproar in the Philippines. The public here has largely resigned itself to news of the harsh punishments and humiliations meted out to Filipinos who are accused of violating foreign laws. **********More than two million Filipinos work overseas -- most of them as maids and janitors and in other menial jobs, contributing almost $8 billion a year to the Philippine economy. Hundreds of them return home each year in coffins. **********Manila's newspapers often feature reports about migrant Filipino laborers who are killed, tortured or raped abroad, and about others who are sentenced to long prison terms or to death because they have no money to hire competent lawyers to defend them in foreign courts. Three Filipinos were beheaded in Saudi Arabia in January after they were accused of hostage-taking and murder, charges that human rights lawyers in the Philippines say were not adequately proved. **********Mrs. Contemplacion's case became a national obsession, though, after two witnesses came forward in the last month with detailed testimony suggesting that she had been framed. **********The first witness, Emilia Frenilla, had also worked as a maid in Singapore. Her employer was the uncle of the dead boy, and Mrs. Frenilla said she overheard her employer and the child's father talking about pinning the two deaths on Mrs. Contemplacion. **********Mrs. Frenilla, who has since returned to the Philippines, said that the boy accidentally drowned after suffering an epileptic fit in a bathtub, and that the boy's father then killed Mrs. Maga, blaming her for the child's death. **********The second witness is Virginia Parumog, a Filipino woman who had pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Singapore and who had been held in prison there with Mrs. Contemplacion. Miss Parumog alleged that Mrs. Contemplacion had been tortured into confessing to murder. **********In detailed statements rebutting the testimony of the two women, the Singapore Government said that it had investigated Mrs. Frenilla's allegations and found them untrue. It said that the boy did not suffer from epilepsy and that Mrs. Frenilla could not have understood a conversation between the boy's father and uncle because she did not understand the Chinese dialect they spoke. **********The Government described Miss Parumog's allegations as \"wild and baseless.\" It said that Philippine diplomats had made nine prison visits to Mrs. Contemplacion since her arrest in 1991 and that there had never been \"any representations regarding complaints of ill treatment or claims to Contemplacion's innocence.\" **********The Singaporean rebuttals did nothing to calm Mrs. Contemplacion's grief-stricken friends and supporters, who turned out by the thousands last weekend to catch a glimpse of her coffin as it was transported by hearse from Manila's international airport to her home in the central province of Laguna for burial. **********President Ramos had made two last-minute appeals to the Singapore Government for a stay of execution for Mrs. Contemplacion, asking that the new evidence be thoroughly reviewed before the hanging took place. **********But the Singaporeans went forward on schedule with the execution. That seemed to make clear that even the President of a neighboring, friendly Asian Government would receive no special privileges from Singapore, which prides itself on a severe legal system that bans chewing gum and mandates the death penalty for possession of even tiny amounts of narcotics. **********\"I found it surprising that the Singaporeans wouldn't at least delay this by a week or two out of respect for a neighboring head of state,\" a Western diplomat said. \"It doesn't say much for Asian unity. I certainly think it could be taken by Ramos as a serious insult.\" **********The furor here over Mrs. Contemplacion's execution could be a political blow to President Ramos, who is hoping that voters will give his party a resounding vote of confidence in congressional elections this May. **********While polls show that Mr. Ramos is extremely popular with voters, his Department of Foreign Affairs has been blamed for mishandling Mrs. Contemplacion's case and for failing to take seriously the problems of migrant workers abroad. **********The criticism was addressed today by Mr. Romulo, who said that his department was recalling several Philippine ambassadors, including the Ambassador to Singapore, to Manila to discuss new ways of assisting Filipino workers accused of crimes abroad. **********He said his department \"undertook all measures possible\" to defend Mrs. Contemplacion. After Mrs. Contemplacion made a confession, he said, she was allowed to visit several times with officials from the Philippine Embassy in Singapore and was given \"the occasion to change her testimony -- and she did not.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/business/chiron-corp-chirnnm.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIRON CORP.

In effect, Nabisco will be competing with its own phenomenally successful low-fat Snackwell's line in addition to the reduced-fat versions of its Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and other brands. **********Oscar Mayer, meanwhile, will take aim on the ham sandwich, the nation's No. 2 lunch and dinner entree (behind pizza), according to National Eating Trends, an industry consultant. Americans bought $835 million worth of ham cold cuts in 1994. **********Yesterday's developments add a new level of competitiveness to America's corporate food fight. Oscar Mayer not only competes with Conagra's low-fat Healthy Choice deli meats, but its parent, Kraft Foods, is owned by the Philip Morris Companies. Philip Morris, in turn, is the chief worldwide tobacco competitor of RJR Nabisco Holdings, which owns Nabisco. **********Conagra, the nation's second-largest food processor after Kraft, will license its Healthy Choice name to Nabisco for an undisclosed fee to combine \"the power of the Healthy Choice brand with Nabisco's expertise in snack-food product development,\" said Philip B. Fletcher, chairman and chief executive of Conagra. **********The first Healthy Choice product, frozen dinners, was introduced in a distinctive green box in 1988, and the line has grown to more than 300 offerings with annual sales of $1.3 billion, according to Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. **********\"The strategy is to keep going until the entire grocery store is a sea of green,\" said Lynn Phares, a spokeswoman for Conagra, which is based in Omaha. **********\"Nabisco doesn't mind competing with itself as long as their total volume increases,\" Ms. Ghez said. \"Its Snackwell's brand was partially cannibalistic of its full-fat cookie line, but the ultimate result was very beneficial.\" **********She said that Conagra did not enter the cookie market on its own because, as a major provider of flour to the baking industry, it did not want the industry to view it as a competitor. **********The Healthy Choice cookies and snacks will conform to Conagra's stricture that they offer less than 30 percent of calories from total fat; less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and have lower cholesterol and sodium levels than full-fat products. **********The new Healthy Choice line will not be announced until next spring, Mr. Verdon said, \"to keep our competitors guessing.\" Ms. Ghez speculated that they might be lower-calorie versions of Nabisco's low-fat offerings, some of which are hardly low in calories. **********Mr. Verdon said that although Snackwell's had provided most of the growth in the no-fat cookie and snack categories from 1993 to 1995, \"we think Healthy Choice will be the reason the category grows in 1996 and 1997.\" **********Mr. Verdon said that Nabisco generated 32 percent of its sales volume last year in low-fat and no-fat products. Its Snackwell's line, introduced in 1993, had sales of $500,000 last year, according to Ms. Ghez. **********Oscar Mayer's no-fat sliced ham products will be introduced in six Southwestern states next month and will be distributed nationally by the middle of next year. The five-ounce packages, labeled Oscar Mayer Free Deli-Thin Ham, will sell for $1.99 to $2.29. A three-slice serving will have 40 calories and be available in three flavors: smoked cooked ham, baked cooked ham and honey ham. **********\"Every food company is looking for a niche, and Oscar Mayer is aggressively pushing no-fat,\" said Marvin B. Roffman, a securities analyst with Roffman Miller Associates. \"There is no question that the American public has really been reading those nutritional labels.\" **********The Oscar Mayer fat-free line of meats was introduced last January with its no-fat hot dogs. \"Now America's favorite sandwich is going fat-free,\" said Robert A. Eckert, president of the Oscar Mayer Foods division, which is based in Madison, Wis. **********Mr. Eckert would not describe the defatting process in detail, saying that it was proprietary. He said the company selected the leanest available cuts of ham, trimmed off the fat and removed more fat in the manufacturing process. The result is combined with \"40 percent added ingredients,\" according to the the package label, which says the final fat-free meat is a \"ham and water product\" that is \"chopped and formed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/business/managers-profile.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Middleton", "pub_date": "1995-01-15", "snippet": "Bryan Sudweeks\n Fund: Montgomery Emerging Markets Fund; $859.6 million in assets.

Ultrashort usually means less than a year, but it can mean several years. Some invest abroad; others stick to the United States. Some pay dividends; others don't. **********While nearly all the share prices of the 15 ultrashort funds fell last year, their high incomes propped up their total returns. The ultrashorts gained 3.1 percent, on average, according to Lipper Analytical Services, compared with losses in short-term government and high-quality corporate bond funds. **********Ultrashorts were a way for the fund industry to appeal to bank customers, by offering an investment whose price did not vary much but whose yield was higher than that on certificates of deposit. **********As yields fell in 1992 and 1993, the funds became more popular. The number of funds nearly doubled from 1990 through 1994. **********And after a year like 1994, when prices tumbled, \"you'd expect strong growth from mutual fund investors\" who are looking for less downside risk in their bond funds, said Jeffrey R. Kelley, editorial manager of Morningstar Mutual Funds. **********Like money market funds, the share prices of ultrashorts are mostly stable. Of course, you forfeit any gains from share price movements. As a group, the funds returned 30.1 percent for the five years ended 1994, compared with 36.0 percent for short-term bond funds, Lipper said. This makes most ultrashorts better choices for those more concerned with income than with long-term gains. **********Yet the funds can respond quickly to rising interest rates because they own short-term paper. The group typically owns a mix of Treasury, government agency securities, corporates and investment-grade commercial paper with an average weighted maturity of 90 days to a year. **********That's why the ultrashorts held up so well last year. Their 3.1 percent gain compares with losses of 1.65 percent in short-term government funds and 0.4 percent in short-term high-quality corporate funds. **********Yields were pretty good, too. The ultrashorts yielded 3.95 percent, on average, last year. That compares with 3.59 percent for money market funds and 5.21 percent for short-term government funds, Lipper said. **********But share prices of ultrashorts are not fixed at $1 like money market funds. They vary with the value of their holdings like any other type of bond fund. **********In fact, while the hefty yields were enough to create positive total returns, the share prices of most ultrashorts fell last year. **********Strong Advantage, by far the largest fund in the group, began 1994 with a share price of $10.19 and closed the year at $9.98. Hotchkiss & Wiley Short-Term Investment Grade lost 1.85 percent of its principal, and Neuberger & Berman Ultra Short Bond Fund lost 1.66 percent. **********Only two funds managed to increase their share prices in 1994. Eaton Vance Government Short-Term Treasury gained 3.49 percent using an accounting technique that lets the fund accumulate earnings instead of paying dividends to shareholders. And Permanent Portfolio Treasury's price rose 2.3 percent using a similar tactic. **********In fact, Neuberger's price has dropped almost steadily since its 1986 inception. **********As a result, \"it's important for people not to confuse ultrashorts with money market funds,\" Mr. Kelley said. **********The risk-reward equation that applies to any bond fund also applies to ultrashorts. **********The Hotchkiss fund, last year's best performer among all taxable bond funds, with a total return of 4.4 percent, earned its top billing partly by holding short-term corporate issues as well as derivative securities designed to profit from rising interest rates. **********Strong owns lower-credit paper -- 18 percent is in junk issues -- so its good performance came mostly from higher income. It yielded 5.52 percent in 1994. **********By contrast, Neuberger & Berman Ultra Short Bond mandates a minimum credit quality of A but averages AAA, said its manager, Theresa Havell. And Permanent Portfolio owns mostly short-term Treasury notes, virtually eliminating credit risk. **********Does it pay to skim the higher yields off an ultrashort that owns junk? **********Bond prices typically move because of shifts in interest rates. But in a real \"flight to quality\" that causes a credit crunch like there was in 1990 \"there won't be a market even for the shortest junk,\" Mr. Kelley said. **********What about overseas investments? Pacifica Asset Preservation buys foreign issues; Neuberger & Berman won't. **********And some funds have longer average weighted maturities then one year. Strong can go as high as six years; Neuberger, two. The moral: don't judge ultrashort funds by their yields because their risk levels range all over the lot. Check a fund's total return.  And read its prospectus to find out where it can invest and its shareholder report to see where it does invest, Mr. Kelley said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/world/off-chile-s-southern-tip-shellfish-harbor-new-peril.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1995-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 644, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Off Chile's Southern Tip, Shellfish Harbor New Peril", "print_headline": "Off Chile's Southern Tip, Shellfish Harbor New Peril", "body_text": " **********Ever since its discovery by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in 1520, the 350-mile strait around South America that bears his name has been a prime fishing ground for shellfish. **********But the emergence of deadly toxins in the Strait of Magellan's water in the past three years has brought an abrupt end to the unrestricted harvesting of shellfish here.

The plants carry a poison that attacks the nervous system of fish and accumulates in filter-feeding animals like clams and oysters. In heavy concentrations, the plants give sea water a reddish color, but the water may be contaminated even if no discoloration is visible. **********Red tides have been recorded for centuries, but scientists say they are now increasing rapidly, especially around harbors where human populations are growing. In recent years, red tides have closed shellfish beds to fishing in both the Gulf of Mexico and off Connecticut. **********The spread of the red tide to the world's southernmost waters is part of a worldwide epidemic of toxic phytoplankton blooms. Scientists believe the spread may be linked to natural changes in the chemistry of the environment, climactic change or pollution. **********Leonardo Guzman, a regional director of Chile's Institute of Fish Promotion, said that his Government agency, which supports the fishing industry, is working with two universities to monitor the waters and shellfish throughout the strait and to restrict fishing in areas with dangerous concentrations of the toxin. **********\"All shellfish products that are caught are tested to make sure they do not pose a risk to the public,\" Mr. Guzman said. \"You are free to eat any shellfish product you buy in the supermarket or order in a restaurant here because it has been tested.\" **********Mr. Guzman said it was too early to tell exactly what impact the red tide will have on the country's fishing industry. While the restrictions have caused a decline in the shellfish catch, the take of some other kinds of fish that are not affected has actually increased. **********Dr. Karen Steidinger, a senior research scientist with the Florida Environmental Agency who is an expert on red tide, said that there are about 55 species of dinoflagellates, the organisms that cause red tides. The species most common in southern Chile causes death in about 20 percent of cases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/world/yeltsin-displays-his-health-on-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1995-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YELTSIN DISPLAYS HIS HEALTH ON TV", "print_headline": "YELTSIN DISPLAYS HIS HEALTH ON TV", "body_text": " **********Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris N. Yeltsin appeared on television from his hospital room here tonight to prove that while he was sick, he was not as sick as the Kremlin had led people to believe by its insistence that he was fine. **********Mr. Yeltsin was flushed into public view by serious questions about the authenticity of the only photograph released of the President after he was hospitalized on July 11. The picture, distributed by the Itar-Tass news agency last Friday, showed Mr. Yeltsin in an Ellesse tennis shirt seated at a desk next to a table with four telephones. It appeared identical to footage of the Russian President, wearing an Ellesse tennis shirt at a desk next to four telephones, that was filmed when he was on vacation in southern Russia last April. Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary said it was taken at Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on Friday. **********The whole episode was eerily reminiscent of the days when Communist bureaucrats often airbrushed out their enemies, staged fake events or recycled old snapshots of themselves as new. **********The television image tonight of Mr. Yeltsin was shown without advance announcement on the Russian state television in an attempt to dispel mounting rumors about his health -- and also to counteract talk of the Kremlin's recent relapse into Soviet-style public relations. **********In his appearance at the hospital, Mr. Yeltsin used the phrase \"heart attack\" to describe his illness, although the term in Russia is applied to even mild but sudden heart ailments. Previously, his aides had said he suffered from ischemia, a shortage of oxygenated blood to the heart. **********By saying that he was already working four hours a day and smilingly promising that he would soon be playing tennis again, Mr. Yeltsin moved swiftly to conduct damage control. But the Russian Government's sensitivity to criticism seems to be growing acute as parliamentary elections approach and doubts about Mr. Yeltsin's health increase. **********Lately, the Kremlin has made increasingly heavy-handed attempts to rein in Russian news organizations. The Russian Prosecutor General opened a criminal case last week against a satirical puppet show, Kukly, a program that is broadcast on NTV, Russia's only nationwide independent station. The charge was that \"the highest officials in the Government were portrayed in an insulting manner.\" **********As the election campaign approaches, charges of Government pressure and censorship have multiplied. \"I think there is a direct link between this and the coming elections,\" Igor Malashenko, the president of NTV, said today. \"This is an attempt to intimidate us.\" **********If the controversy over the photograph of Mr. Yeltsin stirred up fears that the Kremlin is seeking to conceal the seriousness of Mr. Yeltsin's health problems, the controversy over the puppets has stirred up concern that the Government is not even trying to mask its attempts to influence the media. **********At a news conference today, Mr. Malashenko sat rather cheekily at a table next to bobbing and gesturing life-size puppets of Mr. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and others, borrowed from the program. \"It would be horrible if it weren't so funny,\" he said of the Government's attempt to prosecute the puppet show. He added that he did not believe the case would ever go to trial. **********But he also noted quite angrily that on a separate charge, the prosecutor's office had written NTV a letter demanding that the news program hand over the tape of a recent interview with Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel who led the hostage-taking raid on Budyonnovsk last month. The Russian Government has a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Basayev, who has been hiding somewhere in Chechnya. **********Mr. Malashenko said both cases were related to the station's aggressive and award-winning reporting on the war in Chechnya. **********\"This is revenge against our coverage of the Chechen military campaign, which did not go down well with some Government officials,\" Mr. Malashenko said. **********There are other reasons for a Government clampdown. NTV is owned by Vladimir Gusinsky, a real estate, banking and media tycoon who had publicly quarreled with some of Mr. Yeltsin's top aides. After the President's security service raided Mr. Gusinsky's offices last December, he fled to England and has made only rare appearances in Moscow. NTV is the main competitor to Russian state television, which was recently reorganized as Russian public television. The Government retained a controlling 51 percent interest. **********The Government's attack on the puppet show has become a cause celebre in Moscow. Modeled on the British program, Spitting Image, and a similar French satirical puppet show, Kukly is a weekly program that uses puppets to poke fun at such prominent political figures as Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin. But unlike France and Britain, Russia does not have a long tradition of indulging political satire. **********The skit that prompted the criminal charges was broadcast on July 8. Using the setting of a well-known Gogol story, \"At The Bottom,\" it portrayed Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin and other Government officials as loutish, drunken flophouse bums to make a stinging point about the newly set minimum wage of $10 a month. **********Mr. Malashenko said the Prosecutor General did not initiate the investigation on his own, saying he acted \"as an instrument at the hands of some influential forces.\" He did not name names, but instead cited Lenin's question, \"Who benefits from this?\" **********The Prosecutor General, Aleksei Ilyushenko, declined to comment. But the daily newspaper Izvestia reported in its Wednesday's issue that Mr. Ilyushenko's press secretary said that neither Mr. Yeltsin nor Mr. Chernomyrdin had asked the prosecutor's office to do something about the show. **********\"The case was instituted at our initiative,\" said the press secretary, Aleksandr Zvyagintsev. The case, currently under investigation, was brought under a law that forbids people from publicly insulting the dignity of the state. **********There have been other signs that the Government is responding fiercely to perceived slights in the press. Last week, Nikolai Dorenko, the host of \"Versii,\" a daily political talk program on the state-controlled television station, ORT, told his viewers that Mr. Chernomyrdin, who would succeed Mr. Yeltsin in the event of his death, also suffered a heart attack two years ago, and received an artificial valve. Asked about the comment while attending an art opening, Mr. Chernomyrdin denied that he had undergone major heart surgery and angrily denounced the program's host. **********Then Radio Liberty, the United States Government-run station that is beamed at Russia, got involved. Its Moscow bureau reported that the day after the program was broadcast, Mr. Chernomyrdin called the ORT directors and complained so bitterly about the program and its host that the station decided to cancel it. Radio Liberty correspondents then reported that after their broadcast the station reversed itself and decided not to cancel the show. **********Aleksei Pushkov, the director of public information for ORT, and a former editor at Moscow News, said: \"If Mr. Chernomyrdin told us to cancel the show, we would have canceled it, regardless of what Radio Liberty said about us. Radio Liberty can influence our decisions, but they cannot reverse them.\" **********Mr. Pushkov did not deny that there has been increasing Government pressure on his station and others as the campaign heats up. **********\"Definitely, with the election campaign in the offing, television has been subject to more attention from the authorities,\" he said. \"The real question is whether the authorities plan to use a velvet glove or an iron fist.\" **********Though he said he found the Kukly program offensive, Mr. Pushkov said the Government's reaction to it was equally deplorable. \"The Kukly case,\" he said, \"this was an iron fist.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-joe-boxer-sign-in-times-square.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Joe Boxer Sign In Times Square", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Joe Boxer Sign In Times Square", "body_text": " **********The Joe Boxer Corporation is joining other underwear marketers that advertise in Times Square by signing a two-year lease for an interactive billboard. **********\"What's an underwear company without a Times Square presence?\" asked Nicholas Graham, chief executive of Joe Boxer in San Francisco, referring to rivals like Calvin Klein Inc. and Jockey International.

Rugby and cricket were the pursuits that equipped Queen Victoria's youthful elite to withstand the rigors of empire. And life, the poet Sir Henry Newbolt informed his readers in the 1890's, was rather like a sporting event -- not played **********for the sake of a ribboned coat, **********Or the selfish hope of a season's fame, **********But his Captain's hand on his shoulder smote -- **********\"Play up! play up! and play the game!\" **********These days, forget it. **********\"Rugby is at the crossroads -- completely,\" said Peter Bills, editor in chief of Rugby World, Britain's biggest-selling rugby magazine. **********\"I see dangerous territory ahead,\" said Dudley Wood, the former head of the Rugby Football Union, the sport's governing body in England. Mr. Wood retired in July after a long campaign to hold back the dark forces of what this soul-searching is all about -- money. **********For years, English rugby has been the last holdout of the amateur ethic. Tennis, golf, track and field, soccer, cricket -- all have fallen prey to the lure of lucre. But now a game is in play for the very soul of English rugby: the big-name players are restless, questing for a slice of the sponsorship money, and as the old ways come under threat, the game has come to be seen by some as a belated parable for everything that happened in the Thatcherite Britain of the 1980's. **********\"The whole ethos of rugby has been about sport, about a kind of courtesy, decency and manners,\" Mr. Bills said. \"And if the game becomes professional, all that operates is the chasing of bucks.\" **********To an outsider, there might seem little courtesy, decency and manners in this most contact-prone of contact sports. Mention rugby and most people think of large, muddy players gouging and scraping for the ball, so brawny that they eschew as wimpish the protective garb of their distant cousins in American football. **********But there's much more to it than that, as people know in these northern parts of England where the rugby field has provided the setting for a long-running skirmish in the war of the classes. **********Generically, rugby was born in 1823 when William Webb Ellis, a young student at Rugby School, simply picked up the ball during a soccer game and ran with it. **********First there was the game called Rugby Union, with 15 players to a team. Then, in 1895, came a faster-paced game, Rugby League, with roughly the same rules, but 13 players. The difference, though, went far beyond the numbers. **********Rugby Union was played by the middle class at schools and in clubs, and reached its annual zenith in the south of England, when Oxford played Cambridge at Twickenham groundin London and people frolicked outside with strawberries and champagne in picnic hampers. **********Rugby League, by contrast, was a game watched by the working class, usually men in flat tweed caps from the industrial northern counties of Lancashire, around here, and Yorkshire, across the hills -- more likely to find post-game sustenance in pints of beer and potato pies. **********Most important of all, though, Rugby Union was an amateur sport; in Rugby League the players earned money. **********Such was the disdain of Rugby Union types for Rugby League types that, for decades, any Union player who crossed the lines to play League earned an immediate lifetime ban from Rugby Union. **********Now, though, England's national team is negotiating a $2.4 million deal to sell promotional logo space on its team jerseys -- and up to a third of the money will go to the players. What's more, the people who run the game -- the Union game, that is -- seem to sense that the once unthinkable is now the inevitable. **********\"There's no way now we can avoid the full-time employment of guys to play rugby,\" said Tony Hallett, who took over from Mr. Wood as head of the Rugby Football Union. **********Galvanizing the debate was the announcement in June by Rupert Murdoch that he had made a $500 million deal with South Africa, New Zealand and Australia for exclusive broadcasting rights to games in those countries over the next 10 years. **********Even years back, it is said, Welsh Rugby Union players expected to find \"boot money\" in the locker room after a supposedly amateur game. And the amounts under discussion -- annual players' salaries up to about $120,000 -- seem small by the standards of other sports. **********But the money evoked by Mr. Murdoch seems suddenly to have awoken Rugby Union players to the sense that there's gold out there for them, too. **********\"The Murdoch package will flush out the arguments about payment for players once and for all,\" Mr. Hallett said. **********And, some feel, when the debate is done, and Rugby Union players are paid to play instead of playing the game alongside full-time jobs outside the sport, the old division between amateur and professional, Union and League, will be replaced by a new one. **********\"That's the bottom line,\" Mr. Bills said, lamenting the passing of a little bit more of an older England. \"It'll divide the game between those who play the game for fun, and those who play for money.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/11/business/economic-calendar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calendar", "print_headline": "Economic Calendar", "body_text": " **********Listed below are the scheduled release dates for major economic indicators this week.

Mr. Emerson says Landry's will earn $1.20 a share this year and $1.80 in 1996. **********The fund's concentration so alarmed Granite Capital International, the money management firm that had provided the fund with its name, and 12 percent of its assets, that the firm has said it will withdraw its money on June 30. Mr. Emerson says that worries about concentration have caused him to sell about a third of his position, and he says that while some investors leave his fund, others come. \"Anybody who thinks my split-up with Granite will cause a liquidation of positions is wrong,\" he said. The fund will be renamed Stonehill Partners. **********Mr. Emerson would rather talk about the possibility of a short squeeze, noting that the short position is very large relative to the public float. **********In the long run, Landry's share price will be determined by how well the company does.

The I.R.S. has three years after the due date of a return to audit it, though the limit can extend to six years if income has been substantially understated. In the case of fraud or failure to file, there is no time limit. This means taxpayers should keep their returns and all the paperwork that substantiates income and deductions for a minimum of three years, and preferably six. Tax professionals generally advise clients to keep their returns, though not the supporting documents, permanently because often they are the only comprehensive personal financial records. **********If you have carryforwards, like passive losses that cannot be taken until you have passive income, keep the return and records as long as necessary to claim them; then keep them on file for three more years. Also, six years of records is generally advised for complex arrangements, like trusts, S corporations and partnerships. **********Personal residences.Because taxpayers are generally not liable for a capital gain if they sell one home and buy another within two years, records on every house, condominium or co-op owned should be kept in a permanent file. **********Include your original purchase documents and mortgage records, as well as receipts for all capital improvements -- that is, anything permanent that adds to the house's value, like air conditioning or a new bathroom or kitchen. The costs of these improvements are added to the purchase price to determine the cost basis for tax purposes, and thus hold down any capital gains that might eventually be owed. **********Routine maintenance like painting or plumbing repairs, however, does not add to the cost basis. **********People who have failed to keep records should re-create a history, advised Carol R. Caruthers, national director of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse. Look at old checks, she said, and ask contractors for duplicate bills. **********I.R.A.'s and pension plans.  It is important to keep permanent detailed records on I.R.A.'s, especially separating deductible and nondeductible I.R.A.'s, since eventual withdrawal of funds from a deductible I.R.A. will be taxable, whereas you have already paid the taxes on a nondeductible contribution. Indeed, keep careful records on all tax-deferred retirement accounts. If you borrow from such an account, keep records to show that the money was repaid on time. **********Divorce.  Keep the original court papers on alimony and child support, to prove which is which, at least six years because it is an area the I.R.S. often examines. Child support is neither deductible to the payer nor includible as income to the recipient. Alimony is deductible by the person who pays it and is taxable income to the recipient. **********Stocks and bonds.  Keep brokers' transaction slips on purchases as long as you own a security. When you sell it, match the purchase slip with the sale slip, so that you can report capital gains and losses on your return, and keep the records at least three years. **********Mutual funds.  Record-keeping can be more complicated than with stocks and bonds. Taxpayers need to keep the fund managers' quarterly reports showing dividend reinvestments, fund trades and redemptions, and ideally keep their own summary sheet, either handwritten notes or a computer spreadsheet. **********Since taxes are paid each year on dividends and capital gain distributions even if reinvested, a record of those payments is needed so they can be taken into account when the shares are eventually sold; that way you do not overpay capital gains taxes. Keep the records at least three years after the due date of the return. **********Casualty or theft losses.  Videotape your home and its contents, Ms. Caruthers advised. In case of a theft, a police report and appraisal will be needed; the videotape will help document the loss for both insurance and tax purposes. **********Casualty losses are deductible only to the extent that the lesser of cost or market value, after any insurance recovery, exceeds 10 percent of adjusted gross income plus $100. They are considered an audit flag. Still, if taxpayers have the records to substantiate the loss, they should prevail in an audit. **********Interest.  Interest on home mortgages and home-equity loans is generally deductible, as is interest on business loans and investment interest. However, taking out a margin loan at your broker to buy a car, say, is considered consumer interest, which is not deductible. Keep records of any deductible interest with your return at least three years, and preferably six. Once a consumer loan has been paid -- credit card interest or an auto loan, for example, those records can be discarded. **********Medical records.  Most taxpayers are unable to deduct medical expenses, because they are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. If you qualify for a deduction keep the records three to six years; if not, toss them. **********Home offices.  People who deduct home offices -- which must be their principal place of business and used regularly and exclusively for business -- need detailed records. In addition to claiming a depreciation deduction for the part of the house used for business, a proportionate share of utilities, repairs, and insurance is deductible, so those records must be kept. **********One thing to consider in deciding whether to claim a home office deduction is that the cost basis of the house goes down for the part that is depreciated. When you sell the house, you cannot roll over the gain on that part. Home office deductions are an audit flag, so these records should be kept at least six years, and the depreciation part placed in the permanent residence file. **********Gift and estate tax matters.  These records should be kept permanently, Mr. Neumark said. Also, keep a detailed list of assets for your executor that discloses where you keep supporting records. A will is generally not detailed, and a list will be a great help in marshaling the estate's assets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/business/second-breakup-t-reorganization-t-reversing-strategy-announces-plan-split-into-3.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T, REVERSING STRATEGY, ANNOUNCES A PLAN TO SPLIT INTO 3 SEPARATE COMPANIES", "print_headline": "THE SECOND BREAKUP OF AT&T: THE REORGANIZATION; AT&T, REVERSING STRATEGY, ANNOUNCES A PLAN TO SPLIT INTO 3 SEPARATE COMPANIES", "body_text": " **********More than a decade after breaking up the Bell System to settle a Federal antitrust suit, the AT&T Corporation announced yesterday that it would dismantle itself yet again -- this time voluntarily. **********The move, a tacit acknowledgment that its vast information technology empire had become unfocused and too unwieldy to manage, is the largest dismantling of a corporation in American history, based on the stock-market value of the company, which exceeds $101 billion. **********AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, engineered the plan under a veil of remarkable secrecy that made yesterday's announcement a complete surprise. He said AT&T was responding to changes in technology and government regulation that have turned the communications world topsy-turvy. **********\"The vertical integration model was good for its time,\" Mr. Allen said in a telephone interview yesterday, referring to AT&T's sprawling activities, which include cellular and long-distance telephone service, computers, communications-equipment manufacturing and consumer credit cards. \"But shifts in the market and public policy suggested it was time for us to change.\" **********AT&T said it would divide its business into three companies: communications services, communications equipment and computers. AT&T will provide its core telephone service through the communications services company, which will hold on to the powerful AT&T brand name. **********The equipment company, still to be named, will take over AT&T's giant business in the making and selling of network switching equipment, corporate phone systems and consumer telephones and answering machines. **********AT&T's troubled computer business -- the former NCR Corporation, which lately has been known as AT&T Global Information Solutions -- forms the nucleus of the third company. AT&T has lost several hundred million dollars on its foray into computers, and said yesterday that it would lay off 8,500 workers of the 64,000 in that division. **********Over all, AT&T has 304,500 employees, and the corporation yesterday was vague on how many of those will have jobs under the new structure. \"It would be safe to say that the combined new businesses will have fewer employees than the current AT&T,\" Mr. Allen said in a televised address to the company's workers. **********Unlike the Bell System breakup, this restructuring may not affect consumers that dramatically -- and any impact on the general public is unlikely to be felt in the near term. In 1982, AT&T agreed to divest itself of its local telephone system by creating seven separate local telephone companies. When that divestiture was completed in January 1984, for the first time consumers began buying their local and long-distance phone service from different companies -- local service from Nynex, for example and long-distance from AT&T or competitors like MCI. **********In this restructuring, AT&T is spinning off its noncore businesses. **********\"I'm not sure it's going to mean that much to consumers, unless you happen to be a consumer who owns AT&T stock,\" said Bradley Stillman, the director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America. **********And yet, industry analysts noted that the expected competition in local and long-distance phone service, a possible result of telecommunications legislation pending in Congress and a major reason for AT&T's breakup, will have a sweeping impact on the nation's communications customers. **********\"This is clearly the most significant announcement in the telephone industry since the 1984 divestiture,\" said Kenneth M. Leon, a telecommunications analyst at Lehman Brothers. **********In one stunning stroke, AT&T has transformed itself from the nation's fifth-largest industrial company, with about $75 billion in sales last year, into three smaller, but still enormous, entities -- with projected sales of $49 billion. Its telephone business would rank as the 12th-largest company in America, behind the Chrysler Corporation. The communications-equipment and computer companies would have sales of $20 billion and $8 billion. **********Under the restructuring, which AT&T hopes to complete by 1997, stockholders would receive an undisclosed number of shares in each of the three new companies. AT&T's shares are the most widely held securities in the United States. **********AT&T said the restructuring must be approved by the Internal Revenue Service since it is designed to be tax-free. But regulatory experts said they expected the plan to encounter little resistance in Washington, because it would dismantle -- rather than create -- a conglomerate. **********The antitrust division of the Justice Department said it would see if the plan conforms to the court-supervised antitrust consent decree that governed the 1984 breakup, and to a separate decree that enabled AT&T to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications last year. **********But Anne K. Bingaman, an Assistant Attorney General and the head of the antitrust division, said, \"In general, corporate spinoffs of this kind do not raise significant antitrust concerns.\" **********AT&T said that it would still have to abide by the terms of the consent decree under which it dismantled the Bell System. Those rules prohibit it from reacquiring a Bell company. Federal and state regulations, however, are beginning to allow AT&T to enter the local telephone market on its own, or with a non-Bell partner. In fact, AT&T is expected to consider alliances with cable television companies, with Time Warner seen as a likely candidate. **********In addition to the spinoffs and layoffs, AT&T said yesterday that it planned to sell off a major division, the AT&T Capital Corporation. **********The company said it might also issue new stock in the equipment company, which would be equivalent to 15 percent of the current value of the unit, in the first half of 1996. **********Wall Street analysts generally applauded the plan, which they said would sharpen AT&T's focus. The company's shares jumped $6.175, to $63.75, on heavy volume in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********But it is not clear that the restructuring accomplishes one of the company's key goals: unlocking hidden value in its assets. **********Daniel Reingold, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he estimated that together the three companies would be worth $61 a share -- less than the current market value of AT&T's stock as a combined entity. **********Executives familiar with AT&T said the company has mulled over a restructuring ever since the original breakup in 1982. In part, this is because the company has always encountered conflicting agendas between its long-distance business and its equipment-manufacturing arm. **********AT&T's progeny -- the seven so-called Baby Bells -- are prime customers for its digital switches and other telephone networking technology. But as AT&T's telephone division has begun to compete in some of the Bells' local markets, Nynex, Bell Atlantic, Pacific Telesis and other Bells have been more reluctant to buy equipment from AT&T. Instead, they have turned increasingly to AT&T's equipment competitors, like Northern Telecom. **********That reluctance has grown as state governments from New York to Texas have voted to allow AT&T and other long-distance carriers into local phone markets. In addition, Congress passed legislation that would open phone markets to free-wheeling competition in which long-distance companies like AT&T, MCI, and Sprint will invade local phone markets while local companies like Nynex, Bell Atlantic, and Pacific Telesis expand into long distance. **********By turning the equipment business into a stand-alone company, AT&T hopes the Baby Bells will be more likely to buy its gear. **********And as the company attempts to break into foreign telephone market, it is running into resistance from government-owned telecommunications companies like Germany's Deutsche Telekom, which buy AT&T's equipment but compete in the global long-distance market. **********Several analysts said that AT&T wanted to concentrate on shoring up its strongest businesses -- communications services -- as it prepares for the rough-and-tumble world of deregulated telecommunications. **********Executives at the Baby Bells said yesterday that the restructuring would make AT&T a more formidable competitor in local telephone service, since the new AT&T could train all its guns on that business. **********\"This clearly underlines their intent to compete in our local markets,\" said Sid Boren, the senior vice president of corporate planning at the BellSouth Corporation in Atlanta. **********As if to underscore its commitment to that business, AT&T said Mr. Allen would become the chairman and chief executive of the new AT&T telephone company. Lars Nyberg, the chief executive of AT&T's Global Information Services division, will head the new computer division. **********Although Mr. Allen, a 38-year veteran of AT&T, said he had no \"mixed emotions\" about splitting up the company, executives familiar with AT&T said he would have preferred to keep it in one piece. **********According to analysts, Mr. Allen lobbied aggressively but unsuccessfully this summer against legislation that would open long-distance markets to competition from the Baby Bells. Although Congress has not passed the legislation, it is expected, and analysts said that Mr. Allen may have felt he had to break up the company now. **********Mr. Allen said yesterday that he began seriously contemplating a breakup in March. After broaching the issue with AT&T's board, he retained an investment bank, Morgan Stanley & Company, and a law firm, Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, to explore ways to break up AT&T. **********Mr. Allen and a small circle of senior executives tinkered with the plan and made a second, two-hour presentation to the board in July. They made a third presentation at the board's annual meeting at the Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., earlier this month. **********The board gave final approval to the plan at an hourlong meeting yesterday morning at AT&T's headquarters, a mammoth, old brick building in lower Manhattan that used to serve as the nerve center for AT&T's Long Line services. **********Like his predecessor, Charles L. Brown, the AT&T chairman who engineered the 1982 breakup, Mr. Allen zealously kept the plan under wraps. For the first several months, he said he confided in only two AT&T executives: John D. Zeglis, the general counsel, and Richard W. Miller, the chief financial officer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/business/the-media-business-random-house-editor-shift.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Random House Editor Shift", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Random House Editor Shift", "body_text": " **********Ann Godoff, a vice president and associate editorial director, has been named editorial director of the Random House Adult Trade Group by its president and publisher, Harold Evans. **********Mr. Evans said yesterday that Ms. Godoff would work with the editorial staff to coordinate lists among the group's publishers, which include Random House, Times Books, Villard and Modern Library. **********Ms. Godoff will also continue to acquire and edit her own books.

Lynch and Peter V. Ueberroth, people familiar with what shareholders expect of a public company. **********How, then, could such a distinguished board fail to recognize and address serious problems that developed at the giant construction and engineering company during the six-year tenure of William J. Agee, the chairman and chief executive? **********Part of the answer may lie in the fact that half a dozen influential outside directors had close ties to Mr. Agee through a tiny private charity set up by his wife, Mary Cunningham Agee, to provide young women with alternatives to abortion.  Many corporate governance experts said the unusual ties raised this question: Once so many of the directors and their wives had joined with the Agees in what they all clearly felt was a profoundly important moral crusade, how likely was it that they would challenge Mr. Agee in the board room over his handling of the company's affairs? **********The lessons of the Morrison Knudsen case reach far beyond this company. With shareholders increasingly looking to independent directors to police managers, the Agee situation shows how unseen personal bonds of all kinds can derail the effectiveness of any corporate board. **********And while most experts on corporate governance found the Agee case extreme, there may be many such examples in Corporate America. No one knows how many, since companies are not required to disclose such relationships to their shareholders. **********Morrison Knudsen's dream board presided for years over a company that once saw its chief executive's pay and perquisites come under a Federal tax investigation, that has seen its chief financial officers leave with alarming frequency and that has frequently left its leading customers fuming over poor workmanship and missed deadlines. **********Last month, with the company facing immense losses and with the board galvanized by two feisty newcomers, the directors finally demanded Mr. Agee's resignation. But Morrison Knudsen's crisis continues. Yesterday, its acting chairman, William P. Clark, resigned as the company announced a staggering 1994 loss of $310 million, almost twice the original estimate of $174 million. **********The charity run by Mrs. Agee, the Nurturing Network, was founded by her in 1986. Mrs. Agee is the charity's unpaid executive director, and she and Mr. Agee are members of its board -- as are Gerard R. Roche, one of the nation's top executive recruiters and a Morrison Knudsen director; the wife of Mr. Lynch and the wives of two other outside directors, Christopher B. Hemmeter and John Arrillaga. Until last year, the charity board also included the wives of two other outside directors, Mr. Ueberroth and Lindsay E. Fox. Mr. Lynch, Mr. Arrillaga and Mr. Ueberroth have been among the charity's largest donors. **********And the company's independent accountants, Deloitte & Touche, made at least one large cash donation and did the charity's annual audits free. On some occasions, the charity's board met at the same time and place as the corporate board, sharing in intimate dinners where the charity's work was frequently spotlighted. **********Personal friendships and family socializing are routine among outside directors and chief executives, of course, and no one expects a chief executive to preside over a board of hostile strangers. But the tangled web of relationships at Morrison Knudsen -- pieced together by comparing public charity records with the company's board memberships -- stretches far beyond such commonplace board room camaraderie and beyond the normal pattern and structure of corporate philanthropy, say many experts who were told of the arrangement. **********\"I have never seen a situation like this,\" said Jay Lorsch, a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in corporate board issues. **********Harvey J. Goldschmid, a Columbia University law professor, said of the board's failure to act sooner: \"When you ask what went wrong, I expect the answer has more to do with the interpersonal relationships than with anything else. No one wants to write a law saying 'no joint charitable service.' But boards will want to keep in mind that where there is too much overlap, it may create an unhealthy atmosphere.\" **********Charles R. McCarthy Jr., a corporate lawyer in Washington, said the arrangement described to him was \"so deeply steeped in familiarity and overlapping ties\" that it served as a warning to all directors. **********\"The policeman loses something of his objectivity when he allows himself and his family to become this intertwined with the management team, albeit for a worthwhile charity,\" he said. \"Directors must keep their distance. They are there to represent the interests of the shareholders, and anything they do that beclouds their objectivity renders them less effective.\" **********Mark Armstrong, a spokesman for Morrison Knudsen, emphasized that the Nurturing Network was not affiliated with the company, but he would not comment on the corporate board's ties to the charity in the past. **********The only corporate director with ties to the Nurturing Network who responded to interview requests was Lindsay Fox, whose wife served on Mrs. Agee's board until last year. Mr. Fox said that he considered his and his wife's board service as \"two totally separate issues; there was no conflict at all.\" **********Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Lynch said yesterday that he did not consider his support for the charity to be a conflict. Mr. Roche declined to comment. Mr. Ueberroth, Mr. Arrillaga and Mr. Hemmeter did not respond to messages left at their offices last week and yesterday. **********Efforts to reach the Agees through their lawyer in Washington were unsuccessful. But Ann Granger, a spokeswoman for the Nurturing Network, said she saw no conflict of interest in the relationships between the organization's board and the Morrison Knudsen board. **********Securities lawyers agree, however, that if the half-dozen outside directors who were supporting the Nurturing Network had been similarly involved in a business run by Mr. Agee's wife -- if, for example, Mrs. Agee ran a small flower shop instead of a small charity -- Morrison Knudsen's shareholders would have been informed of these links. As it is, public companies need not disclose the interlocking charitable interests that tie outside directors to a company's management. After looking at the Morrison Knudsen case, some corporate governance experts say they think such disclosure would be a healthy idea. **********\"One of the first questions you ask about directors is whether they are serving two masters, whether their loyalty is to the shareholders or to management,\" Roger J. Magnuson, a securities lawyer in Minneapolis, said. \"That is material to investors, although it may not be 'material' for the purposes of applying the securities laws. As an ethical matter, I think it is best to disclose those relationships.\" **********Mr. Lorsh, too, said he was \"quite surprised that there could be this kind of complicated arrangement going on that nobody knows about.\" If shareholders had known, he said, \"they might have asked the outside directors: 'What is this doing to your ability to be an objective judge of what is going on at the company?' \" **********The ties between the private charity board run by Mrs. Agee and the public corporation's board run by Mr. Agee were unusually fluid and complex. In 1992, for example, Mr. and Mrs. Fox joined the two boards in tandem; two years later, Mr. and Mrs. Ueberroth both resigned from their respective boards. **********Stan Crow, a lawyer in Boise, was a member of Mrs. Agee's board in October 1992, when he became vice president of corporate communications at Morrison Knudsen, a position he held until March 1993. And Stephen G. Hanks, who became secretary to the board in 1990 and who was Mr. Agee's top aide during 1994, served until late last year on Mrs. Agee's board and on the board of the Semper Charitable Foundation, a tiny private foundation also set up by the Agees in 1983. **********In addition, until her resignation in January of this year, Mrs. Agee was the director of the small but long-established Morrison Knudsen Foundation. That foundation made grants to the Nurturing Network, and the corporation itself regularly donated goods and services to the charity. **********These arrangements were a departure from the common forms of corporate philanthropy, said John Edie, general counsel of the Council of Foundations in Washington. It would not be unusual, he said, for a company like AT&T to form a foundation and put AT&T executives on its board. \"But it would be unusual to have the wife of AT&T's chief executive as the director of that foundation,\" he said. And it would be even more unusual to find a chief executive's wife and a company's outside directors all engaged in a separate non-affiliated charity, he said. **********These highly unusual philanthropic connections were forged on top of more common ties of friendship and shared interests. For Mr. Roche, those ties stretch back at least to 1980, when Mary Cunningham was a young executive working for Bill Agee, who was chief executive of the Bendix Corporation. According to Mrs. Agee's memoirs, Mr. Roche helped her find a new job after she left Bendix late that year amid widespread public speculation about her relationship with Mr. Agee. The Agees maintain that there was no romantic link between them until after she left the company; they married in June 1982. **********And the Lynches, who share with the Agees a deep personal and financial commitment to a number of religious charities, accompanied Mrs. Agee on a trip to Lourdes, the French shrine, last April. **********The intensity of the ties that bound the Agees to some of the outside directors was poignantly revealed at a lavish weekend-long birthday party for Mrs. Agee in September 1991. A videotape of the evening showed Mr. Arrillaga, a member of the Morrison Knudsen audit committee, reading a tender letter to Mrs. Agee from his wife, Fran, who served on the Nurturing Network board but who was unable to attend the celebration. **********\"John and I feel so blessed to have you and Bill as such a loving and special part of our lives,\" Mrs. Arrillaga wrote. **********That heartfelt tribute does not surprise Mr. Lorsch, the Harvard professor. \"Mary and Bill have been charismatic characters from way, way back,\" he said, noting that they had frequently \"surrounded themselves with people who share their beliefs.\" **********That pattern was altered last year when Mr. Agee recruited two new directors -- Mr. Clark, a former Reagan Administration official, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former Carter Administration official -- to bolster the company's international business. Neither Mr. Clark nor Mr. Brzezinski, nor their wives, were invited to support Mrs. Agee's charitable group. Mr. Brzezinski said he was not even aware that the wives of many fellow directors were on Mrs. Agee's board until a reporter asked him about it. **********It was these two men who prodded the board toward its final confrontation with Mr. Agee. After Mr. Agee's departure, Mr. Clark became the board's acting chairman. **********The company's stock fell yesterday to $6.50, down $1.625, on the day's bad news and off sharply from a 52-week high of $29.875 last April. **********Aggrieved investors have filed many lawsuits attributing Morrison Knudsen's crisis to the failure of its board. The long roster of defendants in one leading case did not, however, include Mr. Clark and Mr. Brzezinski. They \"became alarmed at the spate of warning signs which were ignored by the board,\" that lawsuit stated, and \"were not about to abdicate their responsibility to the company and its shareholders.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/business/a-hospital-copes-with-the-new-order.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "1995-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3485, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Hospital Copes With the New Order", "print_headline": "A Hospital Copes With the New Order", "body_text": " **********G. AUBREY SERFLING doesn't sound like the chief executive of a hospital that hemorrhaged $500,000 a week through most of 1994; a hospital that since 1991 has laid off 1,500 of 4,300 employees, including 23 of 34 senior managers; a hospital that over the last two years saw its patient revenues plummet by $36 million, more than 10 percent, even as it kept the same one-fifth share of the city's admissions. **********Mr. Serfling, the 50-year-old leader of the California Pacific Medical Center, one of the state's largest and most prestigious private hospitals, can hardly contain his exuberance as he runs through the dire facts, and the drastic changes they have triggered. **********\"Hey, it's an opportunity to build a whole new world,\" Mr. Serfling says, his green eyes flashing. He says the hospital will claw its way into the black in 1995, for the first time since 1990. And he proudly describes California Pacific as a national model for major hospitals that must conform to the new age of market competition. **********Whether this place is more a model or, as the local press has often described it, a \"troubled\" institution that dove too recklessly into the financial shoals of managed care may be a matter of perspective. In a sense, both descriptions are true. **********But there is little doubt that the tumult at California Pacific -- a nonprofit institution long dominated by medical specialists and known for Cadillac care -- will be replicated across the country as prepaid care through health maintenance organizations becomes dominant. Hospitals in New York and elsewhere are contemplating similar changes, if they have not started them already. **********Beyond the drastic trimming of expenses, this hospital in an upscale part of San Francisco is engaged in a more basic and in some ways humbling transformation: from cathedral of no-holds-barred medicine, to partner with its doctors in a stringently run enterprise, stressing primary care outside hospital walls. **********For decades, hospitals -- typified by acute-care beds closely tended by doctors and skilled nurses, machine-filled surgical bays and dazzling diagnostic tools -- have been the arch-symbols of medical progress, virtually synonymous with good care. Until recently, one often heard physicians say \"if you're sick enough to need a doctor, you should be in a hospital,\" noted Charles E. Rosenberg, a medical historian at the University of Pennsylvania. **********No more. Today, executives of H.M.O.'s and even many doctors who provide managed care refer to hospitals almost scornfully as \"cost centers\" -- financial drains where patients are sent only as a last resort and which they must leave as quickly as they can. **********Last year, Congress rejected President Clinton's proposals for reining in health spending, which, at more than 14 percent of the gross domestic product, is far higher than in most other industrial nations. But the private employers who pay many medical bills are fighting back on their own, hiring H.M.O.'s to be financial attack dogs and force costs down. **********Nowhere is the resulting competition fiercer than in California where, today, the assumptions that once guided hospital management have been turned upside down. At California Pacific now, only 4 percent of patients have traditional fee-for-service insurance, paying generous fees with little question. Under the spreading system of payment called capitation, in which doctors and hospitals receive preset sums to provide all care to groups of people, hospitals must not only slash costs but also redirect their goals. **********The former path to solvency -- keeping beds filled and attracting more patients who need high-priced surgeries -- amounts to financial suicide. Instead, the goal must be to keep patients healthy and, when that fails, to treat them efficiently, avoiding the $1,000-a-day acute-care bed whenever feasible. **********Top-notch, technological care is still essential to save the sickest patients, and hospitals will remain places of life-and-death dramas. But where in the past an expensive procedure like cardiac surgery also brought in large profits, each operation now is a drain on revenues. The Quality Question The Bottom Line On Patient Care **********The new method of payment, with its incentives to doctors to hold down costs, has also triggered debate about whether patients will be better off, as H.M.O.'s assert, or shortchanged, as some doctors fear. For his part, the chairman of medicine at California Pacific, Dr. Martin Brotman, feels that patients will be protected by medical guidelines, peer review and other measures. \"It's different -- a little less of the art of medicine and more of the science of medicine,\" he said. **********California Pacific and an affiliated, for-profit group of 700 physicians have so far signed H.M.O. contracts that give them full responsibility, for a preset price, for care of 107,000 people, a number that nearly doubled in two years. These now account for 30 percent of the hospital's patients, and are projected to account for 80 percent of business as soon as 1998; their looming presence sets the tone for all decisions. Nearly all the rest are in looser managed-care arrangements involving discounted fees, or government programs. **********Licensed for 1,067 beds, the hospital now maintains about 550, of which 460 are classic acute-care beds, the rest in a skilled-nursing wing where patients are monitored less. In a dramatic sign of changing medical practice, the average number of acute-care beds occupied each day here dropped to 280 in 1994, from 392 in 1991. This reflected both a reduced tendency to hospitalize people and shorter stays. **********\"I no longer think of myself as the C.E.O. of a hospital,\" said Mr. Serfling, who rose through the ranks at California Pacific over the last 20 years and seems to have transformed himself along with the fiscal environment. \"Our business is providing a full range of benefits to health-care purchasers. I'm C.E.O. of an integrated health company.\" **********In point of fact, Mr. Serfling is becoming C.E.O. of just one component of a health business. By all accounts, power is shifting toward the doctors, especially the primary-care doctors. They provide most care and are the ones who attract the customers -- the employers that buy insurance and the H.M.O.'s that are their middlemen. **********In this case, a for-profit organization jointly owned by the doctor group and the hospital, called a medical services organization, is rapidly taking over many crucial tasks, both from the hospital and from the contracting H.M.O.'s. These include negotiation of the H.M.O. contracts, computerized monitoring of individual doctors' decisions in their scattered offices, approval of patient tests and surgery and the standardizing of care within the hospital. **********The services organization's board of directors has six doctors and four hospital administrators. In two years the group has built a staff of about 180, filling three floors of a nearby building. Many people, including Mr. Serfling and Dr. Michael Abel, president of the doctor group, expect that eventually one chief executive will preside over a combined physician and hospital entity. **********The doctor group itself includes about 250 primary care doctors and 440 specialists, said Dr. Abel, a surgeon when he is not wearing his new hat as an executive. That mix includes too many specialists, everyone agrees. The solution so far has been to let economic pressures do the winnowing; specialist incomes have declined by 10 percent to 40 percent, Dr. Abel said. \"I see people retiring early, or moving out of state,\" he said. Entrepreneurial Spirit Big Decisions, Quickly Made **********Among the doctors and within the hospital, people with an entrepreneurial bent are taking over. The combined enterprise has a corporate feel that is vastly different from the lumbering, almost medieval character of classic hospitals with their specialty-department fiefs. **********Mr. Serfling said he identifies with his counterparts in nearby Silicon Valley, where rapid, high-stakes decisions amid frantic innovation are the norm. By way of example, he said on a recent afternoon, he was considering a take-it-or-leave-it offer from a leading insurer, for exclusive coverage of 40,000 people. **********The offer: flat monthly fees per person in the mid-$30's range to the hospital and the $50 range to the doctors' group -- he would not divulge exact numbers -- for which they would together provide all care, from toddler checkups to heart transplants. The population to be covered includes workers and their families; rates for elderly people would be far higher. **********Quite recently, such an offer would have been considered absurdly low; only a year or two back, H.M.O. payments for the hospital portion were $40 to $45 a person, Mr. Serfling said. In practice the proposed fee would amount to a 45 percent discount from the hospital's normal charges, he said. But he is also aware that H.M.O.'s have driven even stiffer bargains with other hospitals in California. **********\"We have this proposed revenue stream per patient,\" he said. \"Management has to figure out how to deliver all care, run a hospital and still deliver a high-quality product.\" **********\"A lot of people think that's impossible,\" he said. \"They're wrong, but we have to start with a clean piece of paper. That's what's so exciting.\" **********The physicians would be accepting a sum to divide among themselves. They would also agree to keep the total number of hospital days used by those 40,000 patients below a target. If that is surpassed, then the extra expense would come out of the doctors' collective share. On the other side, if expenses are held below projections, the doctors and hospital would divide up the surplus. **********Hospitals all over the country are groping their way as managed care increasingly takes hold. Some have closed or been bought by for-profit chains that aim to remold them into nodes of competitive networks. Larger hospitals are trying various strategies for building their own bottom-to-top health systems. **********New York Hospital in Manhattan, for example, is buying up smaller hospitals that it hopes can feed the sickest patients to its advanced facility. The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania hopes to secure H.M.O. contracts by buying groups of primary-care doctors in the Philadelphia region.  Controlling Costs Getting Patients Is the Easy Part **********But as California Pacific discovered, getting patients is the easy part. Then the institution and its allied doctors have to take good care of those people at the prevailing price, bearing the risk of overruns. **********\"What a big network does is to assure volume over time,\" said Raymond J. Baxter, a consultant with Lewin VHI in Fairfax, Va. \"But unless you also control your costs, I don't think you'll get all the way to the finish line.\" **********While many hospitals are being dragged into managed care, California Pacific rushed into it, amassing as many H.M.O. contracts as it could in hopes of gaining a competitive advantage. But as the number of patients on fixed fees climbed, costs drifted down too slowly and the hospital took a bath. **********Not so long ago, a hospital could make up for losses in managed care, and for low payments from Medicare and Medicaid, by charging its other insured patients more. But here, at least, the days of cost-shifting are over. **********Complicating things, California Pacific has just completed a major merger, begun in 1991. Today's hospital results from the joining of the former Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, an eminent tertiary care and teaching hospital in posh Pacific Heights, and Children's Hospital, more primary-care oriented and located nearby in the middle-class, increasingly Chinese area of Richmond. **********The merger will yield long-term economies but entailed short-term conflict and costs as two cultures were forced to meld. Already, there has been extensive retooling of buildings and staff. The former Children's Hospital continues to deliver babies, close to 5,000 a year, but much of it has been converted into a giant out-patient surgery center, with 10 operating rooms that now account for 60 percent of all the hospital's surgery. **********The hospital announced that it was closing down the Children's emergency room, but in the face of community protests, it kept open something more akin to a walk-in clinic. The former Presbyterian facility has become the site of most acute care and in-patient surgery. Sinking Morale Paring the Staff, Top to Bottom **********Last year, with losses mounting, the board took the extreme step of hiring the Hunter Group of St. Petersburg, Fla., consultants that specialize in scorched-earth hospital makeovers. Under their guidance, the board fired most of the top managers. Hunter has placed three of its own people temporarily in senior vice president jobs, running day-to-day operations. **********As staff slots were cut from top to bottom, morale sank; one patient who had surgery at the hospital last year said she had felt as though she were lying in a union meeting. **********Meanwhile, the hospital is doing everything it can to curb the use of costly services. Department by department, procedures are being standardized in \"clinical pathways\" -- detailing exactly when various tests should come before and after a given surgery and specifying which drugs and brands of devices to use. **********Thus, when cardiac bypass patients are given the right pretesting, they can come in on the morning of surgery rather than staying a night or two as in the past. With the right post-surgery sequence, most can go home in 5 days, compared with 10 or 12 a few years back. **********As patients are sent home more quickly, home visits by nurses are up. And inside the hospital, ever finer distinctions in patient condition are being made, all to reduce the need for costly monitoring. **********A stroke patient might come in through the emergency room, then after a short stay in an acute-care bed move to a rehabilitation ward and then to a skilled nursing bed before returning home, each level staffed less intensively. The hospital's 90 skilled nursing beds have been close to 100 percent full, and are slated to increase as more acute-care beds are closed. **********The intensive care unit, for the critically ill, has also been subdivided. The traditional unit has a registered nurse for every one or two patients. But some patients, such as those being weaned from a respirator, are moved to a \"transitional care unit,\" with one nurse for every three patients. **********With the hospital now involved in so many levels of care, the traditional focus of acute care \"is just a blip on the screen,\" said Lisa Miller, director of quality management. **********In a practice used by some H.M.O.'s that own hospitals, the medical staff is experimenting with special in-patient doctors, who take over from the primary doctor when a patient is admitted. The efficiency of having the attending physician on hand through the day, a specialist in the care of the seriously ill, is clear. On the other hand, this goes against the hallowed notion of continuity of care by a single physician in sickness and in health, and leaves some of the doctors uneasy. Taking Some Hits A Cutting Edge Gets a Bit Duller **********Though the board says it wants to preserve a cutting-edge hospital, many doctors privately wonder about the role here of the most advanced and expensive treatments. Unsure of its future, with some members expressing feelings of betrayal, the liver transplant team recently moved to Stanford University Hospital, and some other specialists have left. **********California Pacific is hardly becoming second-class; its spacious new birthing rooms have Jacuzzi's, though women sent home the day after delivery may have little opportunity to enjoy them. It remains a top center for heart and other organ transplants. **********But a powerful sign of changing times is a large hole in the ground at the corner of Sacramento and Maple, near the former Children's Hospital. This was to be the site for a $50 million cancer center, the kind of showcase that hospitals used to build to attract paying customers. The project was canceled in 1993. **********Quality cancer care will continue, but some state-of-the-art treatments including bone-marrow transplants -- now standard for some kinds of cancer, experimental for others -- are no longer offered at California Pacific, which will have to subcontract with other hospitals when patients need them. **********The cancer center's demise reflects more than financial woes. For it has dawned on executives here that when you are being paid a flat fee, the last thing you need is to attract more cancer patients. **********\"This is a very difficult transition for the medical staff,\" said Dr. Neal Birnbaum, the chief of staff. \"Patients who are sick seek us out,\" he said, referring to the hospital's reputation for specialized treatments, something that attracted many doctors too. \"Now we pay a penalty for that.\" **********The future of research and doctor training, things that helped give this hospital its cachet, is also uncertain. \"The focus is on how we can maintain research and education as some aspect,\" Mr. Serfling said, \"with a smaller, less grandiose vision.\" **********The question at the back of everyone's mind is whether the quality of care is endangered by the penny pinching and the incentives to hold down referrals, tests and surgery. **********As hospitals cut staff, nurses in particular have been outspoken in warning about a possible threat, not only from their reduced numbers but also from the downgrading of skill levels in some jobs. **********While California Pacific has not yet cut back on highly trained nurses as much as some local hospitals have, the reductions \"have definitely lowered the standard of care,\" said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses Association. \"Staffing decisions are made by the financiers rather than the medical professionals.\" **********Dr. Brotman, the medicine chairman, said he believed that care has not been compromised, though many nursing jobs are restructured. **********Most doctors here seem to feel they have little choice but to join in the H.M.O. contracts, but some express apprehension about possible medical impacts. **********Dr. J. Donald Hill, chief of cardiac surgery, said he had been pleasantly surprised by the economies his department had achieved. Overall, he said, the cost of bypass surgery had been reduced to close to $20,000, less than half of what it was a few years back (though still above the $15,000 fee that H.M.O.'s in Southern California pay when they subcontract for the procedure). **********But he said he was uncomfortable with a system in which doctors bear financial risk for care. \"You make more money by not giving care and this is frightening to surgeons,\" he said. He only hopes, he added, that other quality controls would prevent scrimping. **********Dr. Brotman said that past practices had been wonderful for doctors and patients but were not economically realistic. \"You could just provide whatever you felt was best for your patient, and someone would pay the bill,\" he said. He feels that more conservative care can often be better as well as cheaper. **********One casualty of managed care may be the hospital's commitment to community services, including a seniors' day center and mental health services. \"Unfortunately, current medical reimbursement structure eliminates any operating margin that could be diverted to community programs,\" said a planning document approved by the hospital board last September, and such programs will continue \"in a more limited scope.\" **********This hospital has never treated large numbers of uninsured people but here, as elsewhere, the newly harsh fiscal climate makes charity care all the less attractive. As Mr. Serfling himself emphasized, the spread of managed care may leave the uninsured even worse off unless the government acts to protect them. **********Whether, despite all their efforts, this hospital and its doctors will be powerful enough to stay independent is another unanswered question. Will they be bought by a hospital chain like Columbia/HCA, or a giant insurance company like Aetna? The hospital is linked to three others but is largely autonomous for now. **********Dr. Abel, head of the doctor group, said the group's first hope is to ally with other physician-led medical systems in, perhaps, purchasing and H.M.O. contracting. But no one knows how much growth and capital it will take to survive -- to remain competitive in the ever more demanding battle for patients. **********\"I don't want to work for an insurance company,\" Dr. Abel said. \"But if the hospital cannot be a source of capital, where are we going to find it? It would be bad business not to explore what's out there.\" **********None of these issues is enough to dampen the spirits of Mr. Serfling, whose survival in his position through the last three years of turmoil has astounded many hospital experts in the city. **********\"In the beginning we were depressed, but now a lot of people here are pretty excited about the changes,\" he said. As hospitals elsewhere enter the same treacherous waters, he said, \"most groups will go through a period of major organizational depression.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/12/business/international-briefs-european-inquiry-today-on-french-bank-bailout.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "European Inquiry Today On French Bank Bailout", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; European Inquiry Today On French Bank Bailout", "body_text": " **********The European Commission will start an investigation today into the French Government plan to bail out Credit Lyonnais. **********France wants to remove 135 billion francs -- $27.6 billion -- of high-risk debt from the bank's books, placing it in a separate unit.

John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters today that Iran had placed Hawk antiaircraft missiles on an island in the Strait of Hormuz, heightening fears that Teheran could cut off oil shipping in the waterway that handles 20 percent of the world's oil production. \"The other day they started putting missiles on their launchers, which they had not done before,\" General Shalikashvili said. **********But the General shared only part of what is worrying the Pentagon. Other officials said Iran has also increased its troops on the islands to nearly 4,000 from 700 last October, brought in tanks, SA-6 surface-to-air missiles and 155-millimeter artillery. Coupled with Chinese-made Seersucker antiship missiles on the Iranian mainland and two other Iranian islands, the new equipment \"gives them surface-to-surface missile and artillery coverage of waterways,\" said one senior Pentagon official. Seersuckers are upgraded Silkworm missiles. **********Iran has made no threats against shipping or its neighbors, but American officials say Teheran is trying to exert greater influence in the region. They said Iran's buildup on the islands also coincided with the United States sending 15,000 troops to the gulf last October to prevent Iraq from invading Kuwait. **********President Clinton sought to play down the increased Iranian military presence, telling reporters today, \"There is no undue cause for concern at this moment.\" **********The senior Pentagon official agreed that \"there's no indication of hostile intent.\" **********\"The real concern,\" the official said, \"is the possibility for an inadvertent incident where ships pass too close and some trigger-happy guy lets loose a round.\" **********Still, the Iranian military buildup comes as Washington has expressed growing concern over Teheran's campaign to acquire not only conventional military equipment, like three Russian-made diesel submarines, but also long-range missiles and nuclear reactors. \"I am very worried when a Government like Iran would get a capability of weapons of mass destruction,\" General Shalikashvili said. \"We'd face a very, very serious challenge.\" **********The islands being fortified are Abu Musa and the Tumb Islands, which the United Arab Emirates also claims. The two countries shared Abu Musa until three years ago when Iran seized control, allowing only a small fishing village to remain. **********American intelligence analysts first noticed the military buildup last October when Washington was rushing troops to Kuwait to check the forces of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But when that crisis subsided, the Iranian troops and equipment stayed. **********About half the troops, largely Iranian marines and air defense troops, are located on Abu Musa along with three American-made Hawk launchers, half a dozen 155-millimeter guns and some Korean War-vintage tanks, an American official said. The Iranians began loading missiles into the launchers about two weeks ago, the official said. **********On the Greater Tumb, Iran has positioned troops and two Soviet-made SA-6 batteries. On the Lesser Tumb, the Iranians have installed 122-millimeter artillery, the official said. **********As the buildup continues, the Iranian Navy is also drawing increased American attention.

The bombing intensified a feeling among Karachi's population of more than 10 million that the long history of ethnic, religious and criminal violence here, responsible for thousands of deaths in recent years, has taken a sharp turn for the worse. **********For all the horror of the bombing, it was just the latest in a series of attacks that have turned Karachi into one of the most dangerous places in the world. **********The attack on the mosque, in a working-class district of east Karachi, was the third in less than two weeks on a gathering of the city's Shiite Muslim minority, who lost 20 people killed in two attacks on Shiite mosques on Feb. 25. This time, the fury of survivors and relatives of the dead was intensified by the fact that several of those killed were small children, boys and girls as young as 5 years old, who gather every Friday outside the mosque to beg for alms. **********One survivor of the blast, Mubarak Haidar, said he saw one of the gunmen leveling his AK-47 rifle and firing at a small girl as she fled the turmoil, striking her in the back. **********The police appeared to have no leads on the identity of the attackers.

The new arrivals, mostly Urdu-speaking people, overwhelmed a population of 400,000 that had been dominated by native-born residents of Sind Province, of which Karachi is capital. **********The split grew wider as the well-educated migrants, known as mohajirs, grew restive at what they saw as discrimination by the native Sind residents, who used their power to reserve government jobs, admissions to college and other privileges for themselves. Many of Pakistan's rulers, including Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a wealthy Sind landowner who was overthrown as prime minister by a military coup in 1977 and hanged for an alleged political murder in 1979, were accused of siding with the Sindis. **********According to friends, Mr. Bhutto so regretted his handling of Karachi that he said before his execution, \"If I had only handled Karachi right, I would never have been in this situation.\" **********The situation facing Ms. Bhutto is more dire. Mohajir-Sindi rivalries have been overtaken by a brutal street war between the main mohajir political group, the Mohajir National Movement, and a breakaway faction known as M.Q.M.-Haqiqi. Their rivalries are compounded by a vicious struggle between drug barons who have profited by the chaos to turn Karachi into a city with an estimated 1.2 million heroin users. **********On Thursday, a typical day, 10 people were gunned down. Newspapers said nine of the killings were M.Q.M.-Haqiqi retaliation for the slaying on Wednesday of a notorious M.Q.M.-Haqiqi leader, Mullah Rehmat, known as the Beast of the Night. Following Karachi routine, the killings were carried out by masked men, some riding in stolen cars, others on motorcycles or motorized rickshaws. **********The violence has soared on the tide of weapons that flowed into Karachi from the war in Afghanistan in the 1980's, when many of the American-financed Muslim resistance groups turned from fighting Soviet forces to selling weapons. The phenomenon has given rise to the term Kalashnikov culture, which Pakistanis use to describe the lawlessness. **********\"We are seeing all the after-effects of the Afghan war,\" said Husain Lawai, a leading Karachi banker, whose journey to work reflects the special hazards that face residents of leafy suburbs like Clifton, where the well-to-do live in high-walled homes protected by armed guards. He uses a different-colored car each day, leaves his home at different times and follows different routes. **********In less affluent areas, the terrors are greater. \"I get very panicky whenever I see a speeding car or a rickshaw,\" said Afaq Ahmad, a 54-year-old editor at The Daily News, who approached two Westerners walking the streets of Nazimabad, one of the most violent areas, and urged them to take sanctuary in his home. Unknown to the Westerners, three people had just been killed a short walk away, causing shopkeepers to roll corrugated shutters over their windows. Within moments, what had been a busy shopping district became as still as a morgue. **********As the violence has increased, the 30,000-man Karachi police force has virtually abandoned law enforcement, settling for establishing heavily manned traffic checkpoints that give only rudimentary scrutiny. Few in Karachi were surprised when they read that a police detachment commander in the area where the two Americans were slain, Ghulam Ghaus, was arrested for negligence on Thursday after a policeman on traffic light duty reported that Mr. Ghaus, arriving moments after the attack, refused to chase the yellow taxi in which the killers fled, apparently because he feared being killed himself. **********Many in Karachi despair not only for Karachi but for Pakistan, believing that the bloodletting strikes at the heart of the principle of Muslim brotherhood on which Pakistan was founded. At the Aga Khan Hospital, the surgeon who signed the Americans' death certificates, Dr. Fazle Rahim, said the violence was a defiance of everything the country was meant to represent. **********\"In the Holy Koran, there are words to the effect that God cannot help those who are determined to self-destruct,\" the 45-year-old doctor said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/04/business/business-digest-198895.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 601, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Found: A Computer Virus Transported by E-Mail  An agile type of computer virus, one that can sneak past security devices by hitching rides on electronic mail and Internet files, is causing deep concern among computer security officials around the world. **********Only one virus of the new type has been spotted, and so far there are no official reports of damage to corporate or private computer data.

Government ministers, opposition leaders and President Ezer Weizman all accused the clergymen of threatening the cohesion of the army and undermining Israeli democracy. **********The religious ruling was issued by leaders of the Union of Rabbis for the Land of Israel. It is a group with hundreds of members here and abroad who support Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and oppose the Government's agreements with the P.L.O. They include rabbis from Jewish settlements and the former Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Avraham Shapira, who recently declared that soldiers should defy orders to evacuate Jewish settlers from the occupied territories. **********But the ruling drew criticism from some Orthodox circles, with the Chief Ashkenazic Rabbi, Yisrael Meir Lau, warning against possible civil war. **********\"It is inconceivable to disobey orders,\" he said today on national television. \"The Israel Defense Forces are the army of the entire people. If, God forbid, the Government sends down such a directive, the soldier has no alternative but to follow the order.\" **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said, \"There has never been anything like this in Israel.\" **********\"It is inconceivable that we will turn the State of Israel into a banana republic,\" Mr. Rabin said. He added: \"It's unbelievable that in Israel, as a democracy, a very small number of rabbis will take upon themselves the right to act against the law. To call on a soldier to refuse legitimate orders means anarchy. We will not accept it. We will not allow it.\" **********Mr. Rabin, who last week labeled some American rabbis \"ayatollahs\" for issuing a similar edict, said the Government would see if legal action should be taken in response to today's ruling. Shulamit Aloni, a minister from the leftist Meretz Party, accused the rabbis of calling for \"organized rebellion,\" and demanded that army units that are filled entirely with Orthodox yeshiva students be dismantled. **********Reading the ruling, Rabbi Haim Drukman said: \"We ruled that the Torah forbids evacuating army camps and transferring them to gentiles, because it nullifies a commandment and endangers lives and the existence of the state. A permanent army camp is for all intents and purposes a Jewish settlement. Uprooting it and leaving it to gentiles is tantamount to uprooting a settlement from the Land of Israel. So it is clearly and simply forbidden for any Jew to assist in the evacuation of a settlement, a camp or facility.\" **********\"The army has never put its soldiers in a situation in which they were forced to act against their religious, moral or national conscience,\" Rabbi Drukman continued. \"We call on the Government and the army leadership not to force soldiers to choose between their values and army orders.\" **********Israel and the P.L.O. have set a target date of July 25 for signing a new agreement that is expected to involve a gradual army withdrawal from six West Bank towns and other populated areas as a prelude to Palestinian elections. **********Although no Jewish settlements will be moved for now, the settlers have vowed to scuttle the agreement, saying the withdrawal endangers their lives. Some call for a campaign of civil disobedience. **********As part of this struggle, about 40 settlers were arrested today when they blocked a highway after the police had stopped them from bringing mobile homes to expand the Jewish settlement of Efrat, near Bethlehem. They later began building a house in the area. **********Senior military officers are concerned that the disobedience will spread to the army, where thousands of Orthodox yeshiva students serve in combat roles, many in units likely to be moved out of West Bank bases. In recent weeks some of these soldiers have asked rabbis for advice. **********On Tuesday, an army reservist who refused to serve in the Bethlehem area, as a protest against the withdrawal plan, was sentenced to 14 days in jail. Other soldiers have voiced concerns about the possibility that they would have to confront and forcibly remove settlers. **********Conscientious objection is rare in Israel, but not unknown. **********After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, about 300 soldiers were jailed for refusing to serve there, generally people on the political left. The difference now is that the objectors are on the right. **********Rabbi Yehuda Amital, who heads a large yeshiva in the West Bank and a movement of observant Jews who favor territorial compromise, disputed the rabbis' ruling. **********\"There is no basis in Jewish law that requires religious soldiers to refuse orders in this case,\" he said. \"I agree in principle that religious and moral imperatives are above military orders, but in this case there is no conflict. A call to disobey orders is very serious. This is a political act that can destroy the army.\" **********Leaders of the opposition Likud Party also rejected the ruling. \"We believe that orders have to be followed,\" said the party leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. \"The army is based on this principle, and it must be maintained.\" But Mr. Netanyahu added that Mr. Rabin should realize that his policies are \"dividing the nation.\" **********Dan Meridor, a Likud Parliament member and a former Justice Minister, said that although the Government's policies are dangerous, \"there is only one danger that is graver, civil war, and everything has to be done to prevent it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/19/business/international-briefs-thomson-csf-reports-first-profit-in-2-years.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thomson-CSF Reports First Profit in 2 Years", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Thomson-CSF Reports First Profit in 2 Years", "body_text": " **********The French military and aerospace giant Thomson-CSF yesterday reported a profit of 364 million francs ($73.3 million) in the first half of 1995.

But the debate in Washington, and among taxpayers across the country, shows the complexities of making such changes. Peter Passell's look at the proposals (\"The Tax Code Heads Into the Operating Room,\" Sept. 3) drew many reader reactions, including various responses to its discussion of plans for a so-called flat tax. To the Editor: **********It's too bad that your article failed to address some common misconceptions about our tax system, misconceptions that are vigorously encouraged by those who benefit from them: *********** A simpler system will lower your taxes. Most of the complexity of the tax system has to do with deductions, not with additional taxes. Furthermore, taxes are already pretty simple for low-income people, who can file Form 1040-EZ. Anyone subject to the alternative minimum tax certainly can afford an accountant to cope with its complexities. *********** Tax deductions and government spending have little to do with each other. Every business person knows that a dollar of foregone revenue has the same effect on the balance sheet as a dollar of expenses. Tax deductions are tax expenditures. Since they disproportionately benefit the wealthy, the wealthy have a strong interest in disguising that fact. And tax expenditures are inefficient: it would cost less, for instance, to subsidize municipal borrowing than to continue the deductibility of municipal bond interest, or to provide matching grants for charitable contributions than to continue the charity deduction. *********** The I.R.S. is the big bad guy. Lower-income taxpayers rarely are troubled by audits. The I.R.S. quite sensibly focuses its efforts on high-income taxpayers because that's where the greatest returns are to be found. Money spent on compliance enforcement is returned many times over, particularly when it's concentrated on returns with large unadjusted gross incomes or in cases where large-scale fraud is likely. *********** Flat rates and elimination of deductions necessarily go together. This is the illusion fostered by flat-tax advocates like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and one that your article failed to dispel. We could certainly eliminate deductions, as Senator Gramm proposes, but still retain a progressive rate structure. The way the flat-tax proposal is presented ignores that possibility. PAUL W.

For employees, the abrupt decision is a sign that Mr. Willes could be the most austere boss that the Los Angeles company has ever had. **********\"This is how corporations work,\" said Porter Bibb, an investment banker at Ladenberg, Thalmann & Company, who specializes in media deals. \"The old guy can't make the tough decisions. So the new guy comes in without any baggage and says, 'Let's do it.' \" **********When Mr. Willes took charge of Times Mirror in June, he not only had no baggage; he had no profile in the industry. Mr. Willes, who turned 54 yesterday, came from General Mills Inc., the giant consumer-products company, where he had been the vice chairman and head of its international operations. **********Unlike his predecessor, Robert F. Erburu, Mr. Willes had no connection to the Chandlers, the Los Angeles family that controls Times Mirror, or even to newspaper publishing. Mr. Willes spent most of his career in Minneapolis: he held a series of jobs at General Mills, and before that, he was governor of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. **********Nor has Mr. Willes offered any clues to Times Mirror employees who have been scrambling to get a fix on their new boss. He has so far refused to discuss his strategy for Times Mirror -- he declined to comment for this article. And he has made few forays into the company's ranks. **********Editors at New York Newsday said that Mr. Willes first met Donald Forst, the editor of New York Newsday, the day before he closed the paper. By the time most Newsday employees had heard of the decision, Mr. Willes was already flying back to Los Angeles. **********Even without hearing Mr. Willes's speech, some people who know him said his decision to move swiftly at Times Mirror was entirely in character. Eric Philo, a newspaper analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he spoke with Mr. Willes several months ago when Mr. Willes was considering accepting the chief executive position at another company. **********Mr. Philo said that Mr. Willes focused on one of the company's weaknesses, and indicated that if he took the job, he would make quick changes without waiting for other executives to make recommendations. **********\"As an analyst, you're used to hearing chief executives talking very cautiously about the prospects of companies,\" Mr. Philo said. \"But he had clearly formed his own opinions.\" **********Mr. Willes's financial bent is also nothing new. He rose through the ranks at General Mills as a financial executive. Though Mr. Willes eventually oversaw some of the company's food products, executives there said he was more of a numbers person than a marketer. **********Indeed, one executive who worked with Mr. Willes at General Mills and insisted on not being identified, said Mr. Willes did not create any products in his 15 years there. Instead, Mr. Willes played a part in the revamping of General Mills: the company spun off its restaurant division, in addition to its retail holdings, Ann Taylor and Eddie Bauer. **********Other executives said that Mr. Willes had demonstrated an ability to learn new businesses. At General Mills, for example, executives who worked with Mr. Willes said he became well-versed in marketing. **********\"He asked good questions and displayed very sound business judgment,\" said Howard P. Liszt, the chief executive of Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis advertising agency that handles several General Mills brands like Nature Valley Granola and Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn. **********But industry experts said the Times Mirror's board was not seeking an executive who could learn the folkways of the newspaper business when it hired Mr. Willes. The board wanted someone to streamline the company's operations and bolster its sagging stock price. **********\"A more expansive way of looking at New York Newsday is that this is the first of several steps to be taken by Mr. Willes,\" Mr. Philo said. **********Indeed, while analysts said that shutting down the paper would save Times Mirror $10 million a year, they also said the company still had bloated costs elsewhere. As a result, Times Mirror currently has the lowest return on equity of any publicly held newspaper company. **********In addition to Newsday, Times Mirror publishes The Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun, and several other newspapers; Field & Stream, Popular Science, and nine other magazines. The company also owns several specialty book publishers, and a joint venture in cable-television programming with Cox Communications. **********Analysts and bankers said they expected Mr. Willes to cut costs at several of these properties -- perhaps even sell off or shut down some. Mr. Bibb, for example, predicted that Mr. Willes might try to sell the magazines. \"They are tired, mature titles,\" Mr. Bibb said. **********Also under scrutiny are three new cable television channels that Times Mirror is starting with partners. Mr. Philo said that the channels -- the Golf Channel, Outdoor Life Channel, and Speedvision -- were part of a new media investment strategy that would reduce Times Mirror's 1995 pretax earnings by $50 million. **********Most of the speculation, though, continues to center on the company's newspapers. In addition to New York Newsday, Times Mirror is closing down The Baltimore Evening Sun -- a move that was announced shortly before Mr. Willes took the reins. **********This week, The Los Angeles Times is expected to announce a cut of 150 editorial positions, largely through attrition and buyouts, according to employees of the paper. And industry executives said that another Times Mirror paper, The Hartford Courant, is preparing a list of possible reductions in anticipation of a request from Mr. Willes. **********Dennis Schain, a spokesman for The Courant, said on Saturday that no layoffs were planned. But, he added: \"We've been very selective about filling any open positions. There's a burden of proof in filling any position.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/business/equity-offerings-expected-for-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 414, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Offerings Expected for This Week", "print_headline": "Equity Offerings Expected for This Week", "body_text": " **********The following equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week: **********Adco Technologies Inc., Michigan Center, Mich., an initial public offering of two million shares.

Trump, the developer, has signed a letter of intent to purchase the leasehold on 40 Wall Street, a 70-story, 1.1-million-square-foot office building between Broad and William Streets in lower Manhattan. **********Abe Wallach, an executive vice president at the Trump Organization, said that Trump executives hoped to sign a contract later this week but completion of the deal would depend on whether the State Legislature approved a package of tax breaks and other incentives for downtown Manhattan. **********No purchase price was disclosed, though real estate executives familiar with the deal said it was less than the $8 million paid by the owner, Kinson Properties, in 1993. **********Mr. Trump said the price was, \"reflective of the nonapproved status\" of the incentives package. \"Wall Street is one of the great streets in the world in terms of name recognition value,\" he said, adding that he expected the incentives would pass, and that he would \"become involved in that process.\" **********Mr. Wallach said it would take $100 million to convert the property to either a prime office building or a mixed-use commercial property with 160 rental apartments on the upper floors. He said the funds would likely come from \"large institutions, private individuals, and our Asian friends.\" A spokesman for Kinson Properties said the company had no comment. **********\"An integral part of the project is obtaining the package of benefits now before the State Legislature, particularly the real estate tax incentives and the zoning changes already approved by the city,\" Mr. Wallach said, referring to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed incentive package for lower Manhattan. The plan stalled in the State Legislature at the end of June. **********The structure was originally called the Bank of the Manhattan Company Building. \"When it was built in 1931 it was the tallest building in the world,\" Mr. Trump noted. He compared the challenge of converting the building to that of his current work on the former Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, which is being converted to luxury apartments. **********The State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who effectively killed the incentives package in the session of the Legislature that ended on June 30 when he declined to introduce the package for a vote, said members of his staff would meet with proponents of the plan today. \"I hope by the time we get through discussing it and hearing from some of the other people involved we'll be in a position to go forward,\" Mr. Bruno said. The incentives package had been passed by the Assembly. **********Mr. Bruno said that no special session was planned to address the downtown package, but that \"something like this would find its way to the agenda sometime in the fall.\" **********Despite the uncertainty over the legislation, two deals have gone forward in the financial district in the last few weeks. Fitch Investors Service, an 82-year-old bond rating agency, has renewed and expanded its lease at One State Street Plaza, near Battery Park, where it has been since 1990. Fitch is adding 25,000 square feet, bringing its occupancy in the building to 97,000 square feet. The lease is for 15 years, said Byron D. Klapper, Fitch's publisher. Robert Goodman of Julien J. Studley was the broker. **********Mr. Klapper said Fitch had decided not to wait for the legislation because of rapid growth. \"It's important for us as a rating agency to be in the financial district,\" he said, adding that the company had increased its staff by 30 people this year to a total of 260. **********And Town Sports International, the operator of the New York Sports Clubs, has signed a 16-year lease for 26,000 feet at 30 Wall Street at the corner of Broad Street. The space was occupied until 1994 by a Chase bank branch. Prudential Unit At Rockefeller Center **********Rockefeller Center Management has signed its first lease since the owners of the property filed for bankruptcy protection in May. Prudential Preferred Financial Services, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company of America that serves wealthy clients, is leasing 17,000 feet for 15 years at 630 Fifth Avenue at 51st Street. **********Because the lease was larger than 10,000 feet and longer than five years, and thus in the category of a major lease as specified by the bankruptcy judge, approval of the deal was needed from Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., the real estate investment trust that holds the mortgage on the complex, said Alan Stein of Rockefeller Center Management. **********Richard Berzine, an independent broker who represented Prudential, said Prudential asked that funds for tenant improvements be put into escrow to assure their availability."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/20/business/house-bill-sets-off-fight-in-long-distance-calling.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 549, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "House Bill Sets Off Fight In Long-Distance Calling", "print_headline": "House Bill Sets Off Fight In Long-Distance Calling", "body_text": " **********The long-distance telephone industry began waging war today against a House bill to rewrite the nation's communications laws after the bill was changed late last week to make it much easier for the seven regional Bell companies to enter their $70 billion market. **********A coalition led by AT&T, MCI and Sprint began buying radio and television time around the country for advertisements that will probably start running early next week. Top executives at dozens of long-distance companies have blanketed House leaders with letters opposing the bill, while AT&T began pushing its thousands of employees, shareholders and retirees to put pressure on members of Congress. **********House leaders hope to bring the bill up for a vote on the floor next week, though the new opposition may make that more difficult to accomplish. **********On Wall Street, meanwhile, Merrill Lynch upgraded its ratings for the seven regional Bell companies and GTE as a result of the legislative changes, while downgrading the AT&T's stock. Stocks of all seven Bell companies rose today, despite the market's overall decline, with the Bell Atlantic Corporation climbing $2, to $56.875 and BellSouth climbing $1.50 to $54. **********Industry lobbyists, fearing a major defeat, pleaded to meet with Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and other top leaders for a new chance to make their case. But those requests went unanswered and the changes were made in large part by Mr. Gingrich's own demand that the bill be made \"less regulatory.\" **********\"We feel as though we've been boxed in, and we don't have any choice but to oppose the bill,\" said Marlin Fitzwater, a spokesman for the Competitive Long Distance Coalition, which represents the long-distance industry. **********The telecommunications bill is broadly intended to knock down regulatory barriers that currently prevent the local telephone, long-distance and cable television companies from entering each other's markets. But the Bell companies, which are prohibited from entering the long-distance market under current law, have been locked in a sumo-style wrestling match with long-distance carriers over the precise conditions for winning freedom. **********The bill that passed the House Commerce Committee contained a provision, considered essential by AT&T, that would not allow the Bell into long-distance service unless it faced a \"facilities based\" competitor in the local telephone market offering services that were comparable in features, scope and price. A \"facilities based\" competitor is one that would have its own network, rather than one that would lease lines and switches from the established phone company. **********But Speaker Gingrich and Representative Richard Armey, the House Republican whip, decided the restriction had to be relaxed. Last week, the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Representative Thomas J. Bliley of Virginia, summoned executives from each industry and informed them that the provision had been dropped. **********Daniel P. Reingold, Merrill Lynch's telecommunications analyst, said the Bells would now be likely to enter the long-distance market as soon as two years -- less than half the time it would have taken under the earlier House bill. Predicting that the Bells could capture more than 20 percent of the long-distance market by the year 2000, Mr. Reingold predicted their earnings would climb an average of 9 to 10 percent a year over the next five years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/05/business/piper-jaffray-offer-to-settle-lawsuit-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Piper Jaffray Offer to Settle Lawsuit Gains", "print_headline": "Piper Jaffray Offer to Settle Lawsuit Gains", "body_text": " **********An offer by the Piper Jaffray Companies to settle a class-action lawsuit over steep losses in a bond mutual fund has been accepted by most of the fund's investors. **********Shareholders representing just 5.39 percent of the $140 million lost in Piper's Institutional Government Income Fund declined to approve the settlement by the deadline on Monday.

If there's no money to hire a multinational staff, but you don't want to miss opportunities to cultivate foreign customers or suppliers, consider desktop translation software. (And if trusting your personal computer to translate sensitive documents brings to mind uneasy memories of Monty Python's Hungarian phrase book, rest assured: these programs produce translations that, if hardly fluent, are at least inoffensive.) **********Language translation was one of the first tasks tried on computers during World War II. But even in the 1950's and 60's, the complexity and size of the programs brought early mainframes to their knees. **********Now that we can have the power of a mainframe on our desktops, however, a personal computer user can buy translation programs for as little as $59 that run on the Windows, Macintosh, DOS or OS/2 software systems. The translations can serve as first drafts, to be edited by a professional translator if idiomatic phrasing is required. Or they can serve satisfactorily as rough memos, when just the gist will do. **********Two companies used to account for about 85 percent of the personal computer translation market between them, but the smaller one, privately held Microtac Software, was acquired last month by the larger, publicly held Globalink Inc. of Fairfax, Va. With the merger, Globalink now offers three product lines: the Language Assistant series, for consumers, with a street price of $59; Power Translator, for business users, at $129; and Power Translator Professional, for large corporate or government desktop networks, at $600. The more powerful programs offer greater understanding of idioms and larger dictionaries for technical terminology. **********Each program is specific to one foreign language, and each is bi-directional. For example, French Assistant can translate English documents into French, or French documents into English. The Assistant series also offers Spanish, German and Italian. The Power Translator programs offer French, Spanish, German, Russian and Chinese. Original documents can be created within the program, or transferred from most of the major word-processing programs, with all the word-processing formats intact. **********Michael E. Tacelosky, Microtac's founder and now the president of Globalink, said the company's products were not aimed at replacing professional translators or the much more linguistically correct mainframe and minicomputer-based translation programs used by governments and multinational corporations. He noted however, that even those mainframe programs, which cost $20,000 or more, produce translations that typically must still be edited by human translators. **********He sees Globalink's products as prime for businesses that might not normally get involved in translation. \"We make it easy for people to understand documents in a foreign language and to communicate in areas in which they otherwise could not,\" Mr. Tacelosky said. The company's higher-priced products, he added, are also intended to help even professional translators by supplying consistent terminology and eliminating much retyping of documents. **********Globalink's programs are easy to use, and require little or no reading of manuals. Type in new text or drop in an existing document, click on the \"translate\" command, and the program does the rest. The translation can operate automatically, and will work in the background while you work on other computing tasks. Or it can be interactive, stopping at questionable words and offering options. **********Interactive mode is best for catching words that can be nouns or adjectives, for example, depending on context. It also avoids the overly literal translations of the automatic mode, such as Ordinateur de la pomme Inc., for Apple Computer Inc. **********A professional translator, Catherine Marachi, viewing a copy of a simple letter I translated with French Assistant for the Macintosh, was astonished at the program's ability to do as much as it did. But she was also relieved that it is not about to put her out of work. **********It deftly rendered the simple declarative sentence \"We saw your photograph in the Intervac catalog\" into \"Nous avon vous votre photographie dans l'Intervac catalogue,\" for example. But the software choked on \"We are interested in exchanging homes for 3-4 weeks in July, 1995.\" The translation -- \"Nous interessons a echanger maisons depuis 3-4 semaines dans juillet, 1995\" -- sent Catherine out of the room muttering \"Mon dieu.\" **********(Mr. Tacelosky, who cheerfully acknowledges Globalink's limitations, advises sending both the English and the translation of a letter, so that recipients can refer to the original, in cases of bewilderment.) **********To a great extent, this software also epitomizes the computer cliche: garbage in, garbage out. Before attempting to translate, it may be a good idea to run a document through a program like Wordperfect's Grammatik grammar checker, and use of a spell checker is essential. **********\"If the material being translated is properly written, I find the program meets its advertised goals,\" said Edward Kane, a Tacoma, Wash.-based author who is using Power Translator in the preparation of a book on castles in Germany. Both for translating articles from German, or for translating his English letters for German colleagues, he said, \"it translates 95 percent of the material accurately.\" **********For business, government or legal purposes that remaining 5 percent can be very important, so Globalink recommends using a professional translator for the final transcripts. Professional translators can cost $50 to $100 an hour, but the software speeds up their task considerably. Globalink also offers industry-specific dictionaries, which can be customized. **********Many business users find that the programs alone are accurate enough for their daily needs. While in the midst of acquiring a German company, B.D.M. International, a computer systems-integrator based in McLean, Va., used Power Translator to read local newspaper accounts of the deal. Compared with using a professional translator, \"it cut the cost by 75 percent,\" said Phillip Karber, B.D.M.'s corporate vice president. \"And it cut the time to do a rough translation -- one good enough for an executive to understand and make decisions based on -- by 90 percent.\" **********The power of translation software is increased when it is combined with other technologies. In the German deal, B.D.M. had to have secretaries type in the overseas news accounts before translating them. Now, as B.D.M. is in the midst of a transaction with a French company, the Americans are using scanners and optical character recognition software to enter memos and newspaper stories from France directly into their computers. **********Mr. Tacelosky said he believed the real growth area for translation software is electronic mail and the Internet global computing web. Text downloaded in foreign languages from the Internet or commercial on-line services can be dropped into these programs for translation. Globalink's next priority is to establish what's known in the software trade as an application programming interface -- or A.P.I. -- which would provide other software companies a means for incorporating Globalink's capabilities into their own programs. **********\"People really want to communicate; what they want the computer to do is to help them,\" Mr. Tacelosky said. \"The more knowledge you have of a language, the easier these products are to work with,\" he said. \"But the less knowledge you have, the more indispensable they are. The worldwide network community is not going to be all in English.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/11/business/finance-briefs-365895.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt  Federal Farm Credit Banks is selling $45 million of notes due in 2000 through Merrill Lynch & Co.

But next year \"Women in Love,\" \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"This Side of Paradise\" are among the books that will have been in print for 75 years, the magic age at which copyrights end in this country and the books enter the public domain. **********This means, for example, that beginning next year anyone can publish F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"This Side of Paradise,\" first offered by Scribner in 1920. And they can charge whatever they want and not pay a nickel in licensing fees or royalties. **********For readers, this move into the public domain is great news. With more companies scrambling to publish the newly available titles, there will presumably be competitive pricing and a wider variety of editions of classics like Eliot's \"Waste Land\" or Shaw's \"Saint Joan.\" Readers may be able to find editions of these books that cost as little as $1 for a just-the-text-please paperback to $24 for a nicely bound hard cover. **********But for publishers, public domain is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is obvious for the growing number of publishers eager to get a crack at Hemingway or Fitzgerald for the first time. **********\"I'm rubbing my hands together now because we can finally publish 'The Age of Innocence' \" said Michael Millman of Penguin Classics, a unit of Pearson P.L.C., referring to the 1920 Edith Wharton novel, which enters the public domain at the beginning of next year. **********There may still be fees to be paid for translations or notes that a publisher wants to include in new editions, but the publisher does not have to pay royalties to the author or the author's estate (typically 10 percent or so of the cover price). **********By and large, classics sell extremely well. According to a recent study by Bantam, more than 23 million copies of books referred to as classics are sold each year, with more than half of those going to high schools and college bookstores. Works like \"Huckleberry Finn\" and \"Hamlet\" are cash cows, selling tens of thousands of copies annually. **********Others enjoy a resurgence in popularity, often prompted by movie adaptations. Publishers, for instance, are scheduling new releases of Jane Austen's \"Sense and Sensibility\" to make the most of the coming film starring Emma Thompson. **********Luann Walther, executive editor of Everyman's Library at Alfred A. Knopf, part of Advance Publications, said that since the company published \"Little Women\" last October in time for the December release of the Winona Ryder film, more than 50,000 copies of the $15.95 hard-cover book had been sold. \"That's tremendous for a classic,\" she said. **********The downside is that publishers lose their exclusive hold of highly coveted titles. In many cases, those books form the spine of a publisher's back list. Houghton Mifflin sold 1.5 million copies of Willa Cather's \"My Antonia\" in 75 years, but when the book moved into the public domain the publisher saw its sales drop by more than half. **********\"Obviously you'd like to publish a successful book exclusively forever,\" said Joseph Kanon, head of the trade and reference division of Houghton Mifflin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/business/flatiron-news-in-debut-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Flatiron News In Debut Issue", "print_headline": "Flatiron News In Debut Issue", "body_text": " **********A new magazine devoted to the arts, business, restaurants, food, fashion and shopping in New York City has appeared on newsstands. **********The magazine, Flatiron News, takes its title from the 1902 landmark building at Broadway and Fifth Avenue at 23d Street.

One of the company's primary goals is to unshackle its equipment division, which has been hampered by its ties to the long-distance division. Mr. McGinn said today that the telephone executives he spoke to were unanimously in favor of AT&T's drastic move. **********\"The head of one European phone company told me, 'This has changed everything for us and how we look at you,' \" Mr. McGinn said. He declined to identify the executive because he said he did not want to risk upsetting him. **********Prior to the announcement of the breakup, AT&T's Networks System Group was losing customers because regional Bell operating companies in the United States and state-owned monopolies in Europe were reluctant to buy equipment from the same company that was beginning to compete with them in their home markets. **********Now, analysts and potential customers said, AT&T has a fighting chance to win lucrative contracts from both the Baby Bells and European telecommunications giants to supply them with everything from cellular telephones to digital networking equipment. **********AT&T introduced a new product today that would enable companies to offer local telephone service without laying miles of copper wire. Combining digital technology with a traditional fixed-wireless network, the company said it had developed an economical way for telephone operators to offer phone service in less-developed markets. **********Industry executives said the new product would appeal to telephone companies in Asia and the Middle East, and could help increase AT&T's overseas sales, which are currently 25 percent of the division's total revenue of more than $20 billion. **********In Europe, industry executives said, the state-owned telephone monopolies would still be more likely to buy the majority of their gear from home-grown equipment companies like Alcatel Alsthom of France and Siemens of Germany. **********But at least one European telephone company said it would cast a kinder eye on AT&T. John J. Goossens, the chief executive of Belgacom, the state telephone company of Belgium, said he had warned AT&T in February that his company would not buy equipment from AT&T because it was trying to compete for customers in Belgium's long-distance market. \"That's no longer a problem,\" he said. **********The good news for AT&T is bad news for beleaguered European equipment companies. Alcatel and Siemens have both built lavish booths at the Telecom '95 trade show and are putting up a brave front for its 130,000 visitors. But they are under pressure from their biggest customers -- France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom -- which are themselves facing new competition and want to pay sharply lower prices for equipment. **********\"We can no longer play the Good Samaritan to local suppliers in the name of the Government,\" said Mr. Goossens, who was the chief executive of Alcatel's Belgian operations prior to joining Belgacom in February. **********Alcatel announced last week that it had lost $240 million in the first half of 1995. The company also said it would take a charge of $2 billion to $2.4 billion to pay for a major restructuring of its operations. Alcatel is expected to disclose further details of its planned overhaul at a news conference here on Thursday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/11/business/the-media-business-prodigy-seen-opening-doors-in-cyberspace.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1995-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 331, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prodigy Seen Opening Doors in Cyberspace", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Prodigy Seen Opening Doors in Cyberspace", "body_text": " **********Prodigy Services Inc. is expected to announce today a new feature that will allow hundreds of thousands of its users to create their own personal \"home pages\" on the Internet's World Wide Web. **********Analysts said the advance would extend Prodigy's Internet advantage over its larger rivals, Compuserve and America Online, which are just beginning to allow their customers to view other people's home pages on the World Wide Web. **********The Web, as it is known, is emerging as the most popular segment of the global Internet, especially for computer-based commerce and electronic publishing.

War crimes tribunals have been created by the United Nations for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda -- the first such international processes since the trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo at the end of World War II -- and there is growing pressure to set up a permanent international criminal court. **********But in Cambodia, the coalition Government that emerged from democratic elections in 1993 includes several former Khmer Rouge officials, among them Hun Sen, one of two Prime Ministers in a power-sharing arrangement. The other Prime Minister is Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whose father, King Sihanouk, allied himself with the Khmer Rouge twice in a quarter-century. **********Although both Prime Ministers expressed support for the program in speeches in August, many influential Cambodians are known to be opposed to war crimes trials, preferring to let the past be buried. **********Scholars involved with the genocide project and some outsiders say it aims to give Cambodians the information and training they need to pursue cases against Khmer Rouge leaders in any way they choose, not to conduct trials for them. **********\"The burden will be on the Cambodians to dig out the facts and decide what to do with them,\" said Frederick Z. Brown, a former State Department official who was in charge of Indochinese affairs when the Khmer Rouge came to power. **********Mr. Brown, now a senior fellow at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said in an interview that he had at first been skeptical about the program, which is under State Department control but is also supported by the Australian Foreign Ministry. He said it first seemed to look like \"a make-work project, idealistic but without practical application.\" **********\"I have changed my mind,\" he said. \"The project is very thoughtfully structured. It gives the United States the role of providing a framework and a mechanism to explore this issue.\" **********Conservatives in Congress have criticized the choice of an Australian scholar, Ben Kiernan, to head the program. Mr. Kiernan, a leading authority on the Khmer Rouge era who teaches history at Yale, is remembered by many as a defender of the Cambodian Communists, even when accounts of their atrocities began emerging in the late 1970's. **********A public campaign against Mr. Kiernan is being led by another Australian historian in the United States, Stephen J. Morris. **********In July more than two dozen leading scholars and specialists on Cambodia wrote open letters in support of Mr. Kiernan, who they say acknowledged his error as early as 1978 and has been working to expose atrocities ever since. **********\"There is no one -- in the U.S. Government or the anti-war movement that opposed the bombing of Cambodia -- who does not share some responsibility for the tragedy of Cambodia,\" John McAuliff, director of the independent U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, said in a recent interview in New York. **********For two decades there have also been disagreements in many quarters about the legal definition of genocide and whether it applies to the Cambodian tragedy. **********\"The main issue of debate in Cambodia is whether genocide was committed with respect to the Khmer nation in whole or in part,\" said Jason Abrams, a legal consultant to the State Department on the project. While a case can be made that the Khmer Rouge singled out Buddhist monks and minorities like the ethnic Chinese, the ethnic Vietnamese and the Muslim Chams, it is harder to make a case for genocide against the nation, said Mr. Abrams, who is now deputy executive director of the Open Society Institute in New York. **********\"Nobody was thinking of autogenocide when the genocide convention was written,\" he said. \"It is frustrating for Cambodian participants to hear that not everything that happened was genocide. It is distressing for them to learn that legal-technical definitions may not make them all victims of genocide. **********\"But very serious crimes against humanity were committed by the Khmer Rouge against the whole Cambodian population.

There are a lot of Salinas loyalists still there, and I suppose they are starting to feel a little cold.\" **********For the moment, Mexicans seem inclined to back Mr. Zedillo. In a national poll published this morning by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, 54 percent of those surveyed said they trusted the President, a clear increase from similar recent polls. More than 80 percent said they did not trust his predecessor. **********In a sight that would have been unthinkable two weeks ago, when tens of thousands of people marched through Mexico City to protest the Government's handling of the economy and its military sweep into rebel areas in Chiapas state, drivers near the presidential offices have honked their horns today in loud approval. **********But there are still many doubters. **********\"I don't think they have convincing proof,\" an engineer, Bruno Gavito, 36, said as he sat this afternoon on a bench at the Monument to the Revolution. \"This happened so that Zedillo can place a lot of the blame for the economy on Salinas.\" **********In meetings with the Cabinet and state governors, some of whom remain loyal to Mr. Salinas, Mr. Zedillo has called for a closing of the ranks, officials said. But it is unclear whether the politically inexperienced President has reassured other, more dangerous political groups. **********Officials familiar with the investigations of the killings of Ruiz Massieu and Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential candidate who was assassinated at a campaign rally in Tijuana in March 1994, said that they had information that might implicate other political figures, including some reputed to have ties to drug traffickers and corrupt law enforcement officials. **********\"They're trembling, because nobody really knows what it means when the rules are broken,\" one official said. \"But there shouldn't be any real threat so long as you proceed by the book and only on the cases that you've established as a priority.

However, there were rumors yesterday that Seagram might be considering selling its $10 billion stake in Du Pont back to the company, or selling its nearly $2 billion stake in Time Warner, to raise funds to buy MCA. **********Matsushita paid $6.6 billion for MCA in 1990. In the interim the dollar has weakened substantially so Matsushita would have to sell MCA for a far higher price to recover its investment, when converted to yen. **********A Matsushita official met with John C. Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc., to discuss a possible sale in early 1994. However, until Thursday, when Matsushita acknowledged in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that it \"was still deciding upon our goals for MCA and have not reached any conclusions,\" the company had publicly denied it was trying to sell MCA. **********Although Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, is still rumored to be a bidder, Mr. Malone said last night in a telephone interview from Tokyo, \"I can definitely say that they have not been holding any discussions with us.\" **********He confirmed that the two companies had talked a year ago, adding, \"We were not that hot to write them a big check, and they weren't that hot to cash it.\" He added that even then, Matsushita was interested in selling. **********Bertelsmann A.G is another rumored buyer, as is the ITT Corporation, which has shown continued interest in building an entertainment operation. However, an ITT spokesman said yesterday that the company had \"its plate full\" and denied that it had expressed any interest in MCA. **********Mr. Malone said he had not met with MCA executives while in Japan. He said he was convinced that the company would be sold but pointed out that a sale was extremely difficult, largely because of the dollar's deterioration. **********\"The price might be a pretty big obstacle,\" he said. Matsushita would have to sell MCA for $10.5 billion to recoup its investment, considering the rise of the yen. \"If it is sold for less, Matsushita would have to take an embarrassing write-off,\" Mr. Malone said. **********Commenting on rumors that Seagram might sell some assets to buy MCA, Mr. Malone said: \"Strategically, it is logical they would want MCA. They want to be in the entertainment business, and they are stymied at getting more control at Time Warner.\" Seagram owns 14.9 percent of Time Warner, but would confront a \"poison pill\" provision if it bought more. **********Du Pont could be an alternative source of cash for Seagram, which bought its 164 million Du Pont shares, or a nearly 25 percent stake, for $20 a share; the stock closed yesterday at $60.50. Thus the stake, which cost $3.28 billion, is now worth about $10 billion. Still, an outright sale could result in an enormous capital gains tax, but Seagram might be able to structure a stock swap or other tax-free deals. **********The relationship between Seagram and Du Pont has not been particularly smooth. The Bronfman family, which is active in Jewish causes, opposed a failed deal by Du Pont's Conoco subsidiary to drill for oil in Iranian offshore fields. **********But the company currently has a loss on its Time Warner stake, for which it paid $38.20 a share. Another option for Seagram might be to sell its Tropicana division, which one person familiar with the company, estimated might be worth about $1 billion. **********Matsushita will undoubtedly ask a high price for MCA, which did not do particularly well in its latest fiscal year, which ended yesterday. Matsushita does not release MCA's earnings, but several people close to the company said that although sales were up to about $4.6 billion from $4.1 billion a year earlier, operating profits were flat at about $400 million. **********Geffen Records, a division of MCA, had a banner year, but other parts of the company did not turn in such strong performances. Despite the continued income from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Schindler's List,\" the film division's performance was not so strong as it had been the year before. One person with knowledge of the company said it had already written off some of the $125 million cost of \"Waterworld.\" **********Another problem is the increasing tension between MCA's chairman, Lew Wasserman, and president, Sidney J. Sheinberg, and the company's Japanese parent. Executives in Japan have been reluctant to let MCA make any major acquisitions, and that has stymied the company. Yesterday it appeared that whatever sales negotiations were going on were being handled without consulting American management. **********Polygram's chairman, Alain Levy, was traveling yesterday and unavailable for comment. The stock of the 20 percent share of Polygram that was spun off to the public in 1990 has done well, rising from $18 when it was issued to $54.875 a share yesterday. **********Still, whether Philips is willing to acquire the whole company is unclear. One media executive suggested yesterday that the two companies might form a joint venture and merge MCA and Polygram. Thus, Matsushita could turn over management problems to Polygram, which already works with MCA through Gramercy Films. However, Philips and Matsushita are not collegial in other ventures. For example, they are rivals in the digital videodisk business. **********The News Corporation, the parent company of 20th Century Fox, might also seek a joint venture for the film businesses, one person close to MCA said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/13/business/the-media-business-nbc-group-is-set-to-bid-for-the-assets-of-multimedia.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1995-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NBC Group Is Set to Bid For the Assets of Multimedia", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; NBC Group Is Set to Bid For the Assets of Multimedia", "body_text": " **********NBC has formed a partnership with two other communications companies, Tele-Communications Inc. and Media General Inc., to bid for the assets of Multimedia Inc., which include cable television systems, newspapers, television stations, and syndicated talk shows. **********An executive familiar with the plan who declined to be identified said yesterday that the three companies had decided to make the joint bid because each had a separate interest in the assets.

If its inspectors find something suspicious, they can only raise the alarm, leaving it to the Security Council to take action against the violator. **********\"We happen to live in a world of sovereign states,\" said Dr. Blix. \"We cannot parachute in or shoot our way in, absolutely not.\" **********The agency, authorized at the time only to monitor declared nuclear facilities, was caught off guard when Iraq's secret nuclear weapons program was disclosed after its defeat in the Persian Gulf War in 1991. After the war, agency inspectors descended on Iraq to find and demolish buildings and machinery. In 1992, the agency determined that North Korea was not providing a full accounting of its stocks of plutonium, a possible bomb ingredient, triggering intense diplomatic efforts and a recent agreement under which North Korea has foresworn nuclear weapons.  Iran, which is buying Russian nuclear equipment over United States objections, has become the latest candidate for closer scrutiny. So far, Dr. Blix said in the interview, \"we are not encountering any lack of cooperation from the Iranians\" in getting access to their installations. **********While the agency's watchdog responsibilities have increased, its regular budget has been frozen for the last decade, excepting for inflation, by a blanket policy of zero real growth in United Nations spending. **********Its technical cooperation programs, which provide the carrot for nonnuclear countries to join, are financed in large part by the United States, which now pays nearly 40 percent of the agency's total expenses, compared with a normal assessment of 25 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/10/business/clark-accepts-increased-bid-from-ingersoll.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Antilla", "pub_date": "1995-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clark Accepts Increased Bid From Ingersoll", "print_headline": "Clark Accepts Increased Bid From Ingersoll", "body_text": " **********Less than two weeks after snubbing a hostile bid for $1.34 billion by the Ingersoll-Rand Company, the Clark Equipment Company yielded yesterday and accepted an improved offer of $1.46 billion. **********The merger, approved by the boards of both companies, would create an industrial giant with combined sales of nearly $5.5 billion and more than 40,000 employees. **********\"It strikes me as pretty quick, but at the end of the day, I guess Clark recognized that it was a goner,\" said George Kellner, a partner at Kellner, DiLeo, a New York arbitrage firm that had purchased shares of Clark. \"And Ingersoll is probably as good a buyer as any.\" **********The cash merger, at a price of $86 a share for Clark stockholders, represents a slight premium to Friday's closing price of $84.125 for Clark. The initial Ingersoll bid of $75 to $77 a share was made in mid-March, and was rejected by Clark's board. **********Clark, based in South Bend, Ind., manufactures construction machinery, forklifts and truck transmissions, among other products. Ingersoll, of Woodcliff Lake, N.J., makes air compressors, vacuum pumps, mining equipment and other industrial machines. **********Ingersoll took its bid directly to Clark's shareholders, going public with its offer after the close of trading on March 28, when Clark had closed at $53.125. By the close of trading the following day, Clark shares had soared to $81.25 as investors placed bets that Clark, one way or another, would be forced into a sale at an even higher price. **********A $77-a-share tender offer was begun by Ingersoll on April 3. Clark management, in the meantime, communicated with a number of potential suitors, none of whom was apparently able to match the price at which Clark was trading after the news of the Ingersoll offer. **********After initially rejecting the offer, Leo J. McKernan, Clark's chief executive, agreed to meet with James E. Perrella, his counterpart at Ingersoll, on Friday evening at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. By 12:30 P.M. yesterday, the Clark board was meeting at the St. Regis to vote on the proposed merger. Two and a half hours later, the Ingersoll board met in the offices of its law firm, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. **********\"It might trade at a slight discount to the deal price Monday,\" said James Pierce, an analyst at PNC Financial, which owns shares of Clark. After a merger is announced, the stock of the target company often trades slightly below the deal price as takeover speculators bail out, not wishing to tie up their money waiting for the deal to be consummated, he said. **********Mr. Kellner added, however, that the outside possibility of another bidder might push the stock up from Friday's close, meaning that Clark could trade in a range of $84.125 to $86. \"There is always the chance that someone comes from left field,\" he said. **********Mr. Pierce said, \"The odds are not very great for a competing offer.\" Still, a number of analysts have mentioned Deere & Company as a possible suitor for Clark. Deere's management has said that it is interested in making acquisitions, and the company has $245 million of cash and marketable securities on hand. **********Ingersoll could have bid as high as $95 a share without having diluted its earnings, said Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst at Smith Barney. \"However -- and there is a big however here -- there is a concern that if you pay a fairly full price, you might be doing that at the peak of the economic cycle,\" he said. **********Mr. Levkovich said that given the uncertainties of the economy, $86 a share \"seems reasonable -- they're not paying top dollar at the top of the cycle.\" **********Economists are divided as to whether heavy industry will enjoy a soft landing from the economic recovery, a benign downturn or a recession. The last possibility would mean that Ingersoll had purchased Clark at the worst possible point in the economic cycle. **********Clark's chief executive, Leo J. McKernan, in a statement yesterday, said the merger \"delivers fair value to our shareholders and also provides our employees with excellent opportunities within the framework of a fine company like Ingersoll-Rand.\" **********A person close to the deal said that it was \"unresolved whether McKernan would continue in an active role or not, but that it was Ingersoll's intention to hold on to \"the operating management\" of Clark. Later this week, Clark is expected to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will, among other things, outline the severance agreements of top executives who will not be remaining at Clark. **********Asked whether jobs would be lost in the merger, this person replied, \"Their businesses are great; their management seems great, but their headquarters may be superfluous.\" **********Joanne Tremulis, a spokeswoman for Clark at the Chicago office of the public relations firm of Burson Marsteller, said Clark's management team was on the way back from New York to South Bend and could not be reached for comment. **********But any bidder emerging at this point would have to take on an additional nuisance cost. Under the terms of the deal, Ingersoll would be paid a $35 million breakup fee by Clark in the event that the merger did not take place, said Robert Friedman, the Simpson Thacher law partner in charge of the transaction from Ingersoll's side. With 17 million shares outstanding, that would cost a new bidder $2 a share from Clark's coffers to complete the deal. And, of course, another bidder would have to better the price that Ingersoll is willing to pay. **********The shares of Ingersoll-Rand closed Friday at $33.125, down 25 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/10/business/company-news-alumax-in-deal-to-buy-cressona-aluminum.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALUMAX IN DEAL TO BUY CRESSONA ALUMINUM", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ALUMAX IN DEAL TO BUY CRESSONA ALUMINUM", "body_text": " **********Alumax Inc., a large aluminum producer, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Cressona Aluminum Company, a maker of extruded aluminum products, for $430 million in cash.

Kramer, the publisher of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, would like to answer his critics. He says he is shaking up journalistic traditions to save big-city newspapers from extinction. **********And Mr. Kramer has plenty of critics to answer. The paper, where he was once editor, has a long tradition of solid journalism. But with Mr. Kramer as publisher since 1992, it has also become perhaps the most ridiculed newspaper in the country, described by critics inside the paper and out as a headquarters of political correctness and New Age journalism jargon. **********The Star Tribune has dived into just about every experiment being tried by any newspaper, anywhere. The paper is dividing its reporters into teams; trying \"employee empowerment\" techniques to get journalists involved in decision making; using focus groups to measure what readers want; experimenting with \"interactivity,\" and redesigning the paper to be more reader-friendly. **********\"I'm not sure there's a current journalism fad that our managers have not embraced,\" said Robert Franklin, a longtime reporter and a former city and state editor. **********The Star Tribune, which is owned by the Cowles Media Company, is financially healthy and has a steady circulation. Nonetheless, the paper is in the process of reorganizing just about everything in sight, from its corporate and newsroom structures to the look of its pages. **********Mr. Kramer has said he is searching for new solutions to the problems that are threatening dailies across the country. In the process he has, in effect, opened a debate inside The Star Tribune over how America's midsize newspapers are to cope with such challenges as declining readership and shrinking advertising. **********\"My No. 1 goal is to keep the institution of metropolitan journalism healthy and financially viable so it can continue to be done,\" he said. **********Mr. Kramer's moves to improve service to what he calls the paper's \"reader-customers\" have brought skewerings from national writers, local critics and many of the paper's own staff members. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post have poked fun at the changes, especially the cultish new titles given to nearly everyone in authority. (Yes, the managing editor is now the news leader and there really is a newsroom director of player personnel and a leader of strategic integration.) **********Mr. Kramer has also broken down the traditional wall in journalism between newspapers' business and news staffs, giving his top editor bottom-line responsibility for the paper's revenue from readers, including circulation. \"The people responsible for news should also be responsible for success with readers,\" he said. **********In a savage critique, an alternative paper here, The Twin Cities Reader, recently parodied The Star Tribune's message. \"We're so terrified of losing subscribers, we're willing to try anything,\" said one invented memo The Reader asserted could have been written by Tim J. McGuire, the Star Tribune's editor, who now has the added title of general manager of the reader-customer unit. **********Among the management's other changes has been a ban on the use of what it says are offensive American Indian nicknames like Redskins in sports articles; working to increase cooperation between the news and business staffs; inventing new publications like one aimed at real estate brokers, and giving reporters new assignments to meet what are said to be the interests of readers. **********At a time of closings, layoffs and consolidations in the newspaper industry, Mr. Kramer and his supporters at the paper say print journalists need to keep doing the best of their traditional work, like investigative reporting. But they say journalists also need to be flexible enough to try new ways of doing their jobs. **********Being the butt of jokes and the object of derision, they say, may be the price of confronting the threats to the entire newspaper industry. \"There's trouble out here in River City,\" Mr. McGuire said, \"and we as an industry are trying to forge a future. We here are trying to take hold of that future, rather than having it take hold of us.\" **********Many journalists, Mr. McGuire said, naively insist that they do not want to worry about whether readers want their journalism. \"The only way we're going to be independent and strong is if we understand we've got to make some money,\" Mr. McGuire said. \"That's how this works. That ideological purity is not going to work any more.\" **********But some critics at the paper say the frenzy for change and the focus on internal organizational issues have made The Star Tribune wander too far from simply gathering the news and printing it. \"Just as politicians are being led by polls, we're being led by focus groups and market research,\" said Mike Meyers, an economics writer at the paper. **********Joe Rigert, an investigative reporter and a former city editor, said repeated meetings about collaboration and the team approach had distracted reporters. \"I don't get it,\" he said. \"I don't understand how this is going to serve readers. You serve readers when you've got reporters out in the field talking to people.\" **********Mr. Rigert and some other critics say one of the main functions of journalism is to inform readers, even if that sometimes means annoying or offending them. **********But there are some at the paper who say the grumbling is just obstructionism. Susie Eaton Hopper, the features coordinating editor, said she often encountered resistance when she tried to get reporters, photographers, graphic artists and editors to collaborate. **********She said the changes were healthy because they forced journalists to focus together on how to better serve readers. **********The Star Tribune has had operating profit margins of more than 18 percent for the last three years, several percentage points higher than averages at some similar newspapers. **********It is also relatively stable in circulation, despite some sharp price increases at newsstands and for home delivery. For the six-month period that ended in March, average daily circulation was 404,757, down about 7,700 from the corresponding period a year earlier, while Sunday circulation was about the same, at 695,548. **********Mr. Kramer said he was sick of \"crepe hangers\" who proclaim the death of the newspaper business. And he said newspaper publishing could still be a growth business if it gave up journalistic inhibitions while remaining protective of its integrity. **********He said, for example, that through all the changes at The Star Tribune he had insisted that business executives be forbidden to discuss news judgments with editors or how advertisers react to news coverage affecting their interests. **********But, Mr. Kramer said, journalists are too quick to assume there is something impure about trying to give readers what they want. **********\"Don't assume that appealing to your readers means pandering,\" Mr. Kramer said. \"A lot of them want good journalism.\" **********Journalists, he said, are often too quick to insist that the problems of newspapers are not their responsibility. **********\"Some people will say, 'It's the readers,' \" he said. \"I just don't buy that. I say it's our problem. I believe in the public service of what we do, but if we can't get readers to care, what do we accomplish?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/28/business/business-digest-487895.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 621, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********S.E.C.

If this city of crumbling mud-brick edifices and narrow, winding alleyways has come to be synonymous with remoteness, its location -- on the edge of the Sahara at the northern bend of West Africa's greatest river, the Niger -- has always made it a strategic meeting place of two worlds.

Accuses Investor Of Fleecing His Brokers", "body_text": " **********In an unusual case of an investor accused of fleecing his stockbrokers, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued an Atlanta man yesterday whose trading is said to have led to $13.5 million in losses for Wall Street. **********The investor, Michael J. Morse, 52, placed orders to sell shares of stock at nine big brokerage firms, hoping that when it came time to deliver the shares to the firms, they could be acquired at lower prices, according to the complaint by the S.E.C.'s Northeast Regional Office in Manhattan. But when the market moved against him and the stocks went up, he left the brokers with losses that should have been his own, the complaint said. **********Mr. Morse gave the brokerage firms the impression that he already owned the stocks, the complaint said, and told them that he was far wealthier than he really was. But the firms apparently did not ask for proof of either claim. **********\"This is one of the largest losses we've seen in a free-riding case,\" said Richard H. Walker, regional director of the S.E.C.'s Manhattan office. He was referring to a practice in which an investor profits illegally by taking a \"free ride\" in his account, trading without ever buying, borrowing or owning any securities. **********The free riding suspected in the Morse case was a form of short selling -- betting that a stock would decline. But for a short sale to be legal under securities regulations, an investor must either borrow the shares before selling them or already own them. The borrowing of shares can only be done in what is known as a margin account, which Mr. Morse did not have. So, in order to short stocks in his cash accounts at the nine brokerage firms, Mr. Morse should have already owned the shares. But he did not own them, according to the S.E.C. complaint. **********Reached at his home in Atlanta, Mr. Morse said he was not aware that he had been sued by the S.E.C. \"Good God almighty,\" he said, adding that he would call back after getting in touch with his lawyer. He did not call back. **********In late September, when the losses first came to the attention of the brokerage firms, Mr. Morse said in an interview with The New York Times that \"some very nice people at very good firms were negatively impacted, and in the end, I'm responsible.\" **********The S.E.C. has brought other cases against free riders over the years, Mr. Walker said, including cases in which no losses were suffered by brokerage firms. \"In a lot of these cases, the losses aren't that great, but the amount of trading is unbelievable,\" he said. **********The Morse case stands out not only for its having yielded large losses, but also for the blue-ribbon list of national firms that were losers for having done business with Mr. Morse: Goldman, Sachs, Oppenheimer, Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney, First Boston, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers. **********Several people familiar with Mr. Morse's trading said brokerage firms were known to look the other way at free riding when the trades were profitable and yielding fat commissions. Mr. Morse's trading, which began in 1992, did not result in losses until summer 1994, these people pointed out. **********Up until then, the firms had willingly done business with Mr. Morse, a former stockbroker who had been dismissed by Kidder, Peabody in 1989, and who had lost three arbitration proceedings brought by customers who said he had put them in unsuitable investments and \"churned\" their accounts -- quickly buying and selling securities simply to create commissions. In April 1993, the New York Stock Exchange censured Mr. Morse and banned him from the industry for three months. **********Although Mr. Morse was apparently hoping that he could quickly replace the shares at lower prices -- buying them in an account at another firm -- the market instead turned up for a number of the stocks he was selling short last summer, the complaint said. **********Ultimately, after Mr. Morse failed to deliver the shares he had sold short, the firms realized that they must \"cover\" the short positions and buy the stocks at higher prices. Their losses were the difference between the price at which Mr. Morse sold the shares short and the price -- months later -- at which they bought the shares in order to replace them. **********In the end, the brokers doing business with Mr. Morse suffered millions of dollars in losses in stocks sold short last July and August, including Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, 3Com, Intel, Home Depot and Amgen. **********According to the complaint, Mr. Morse opened the accounts in 1992, selling short at one firm and buying an equal number of shares at another firm. **********\"In this way,\" the complaint said, \"Morse used the proceeds from the sell order at one brokerage firm and the stock from the buy order at a second brokerage firm to settle the trades without owning the stock sold and without possessing the funds necessary to buy the stock purchased at the time he placed the trades.\" **********At Merrill Lynch, which sued Mr. Morse on Sept. 19, a spokesman said that a judgment of $1.5 million had been entered against the investor in October in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York. But Merrill has so far been unable to collect, he said. A spokeswoman for Prudential Securities said that, similarly, \"so far the firm has not been paid\" despite a judgment against Mr. Morse. **********Other firms stopped short of suing. At Oppenheimer, a spokesman said that it did not appear to be worth pursuing Mr. Morse in court. \"We, along with a group of other firms, investigated Mr. Morse's financial condition,\" he said, \"and since the results of that investigation were the disclosure that he appeared to have no assets, there seemed to be no point in taking legal action.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/27/business/international-business-us-venture-bets-on-colombian-coal.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Mercer", "pub_date": "1995-07-27", "snippet": "Colombia seems an unlikely candidate to become a world-class coal exporter.

Taxes are high, there are no clear ground rules for investors and the threat of left-wing rebel sabotage is ever present. Yet an American mining company is taking a big part in a drive to turn Colombia into the world's No. 3 coal exporter, after Australia and South Africa. **********Colombia, after all, has proven coal reserves of 6.59 billion tons, the largest in Latin America. And lured by the high quality and accessibility of that coal as well as its proximity to a port area, the Drummond Company of Birmingham, Ala., picked Colombia as its first foreign venture in 1989 after considering several European countries, Canada and Indonesia. Production in the mine in northeastern Colombia began in April. **********Drummond will spend almost $1 billion on its 30-year project. The investment includes a port owned by Drummond in Santa Marta on the Caribbean Sea. The mine is in La Loma 110 miles south of the port. With estimated reserves of 485 million tons of high-grade coal, low in sulfur and ash, Drummond hopes to export at least 10 million tons a year within five years. **********The company expects to sell most of its coal in Europe. \"We are encouraged by the current availability of buyers,\" said Jim Strickland, a Drummond spokesman. \"The market conditions are rather promising.\" **********Not that Drummond will be alone. A mine operated by the Colombian state company Carbocol in association with Intercor, an affiliate of the Exxon Corporation, now produces more than 13 million tons of coal a year. If market conditions allow, Drummond plans to increase production levels to match that mine, called El Cerrejon. **********El Cerrejon, in the northern department of La Guajira, is the largest mining project in Latin America, with estimated reserves of three billion tons. Since they began work in 1978, Intercor and Carbocol have each invested $1.5 billion in the project. **********But Carbocol soon went into debt and had increasing difficulty putting in the money it had promised, and the Government has decided to sell the company, in what is expected to be Colombia's largest privatization. **********It was the difficulty of operating state-owned mining companies that set the stage for the entry of Drummond, which is acting as the sole investor and owner of its project. **********\"We learned a lesson with Carbocol,\" said Abraham Romero, manager of Ecocarbon, the state company that oversees the country's coal resources. \"This is an area in which the state should let private investors use their experience and resources.\" **********Drummond's contract is expected to act as a precedent-setter for mining ventures by foreign investors. \"We feel that the contract we have will provide a fair return for the company and the Government,\" Mr. Strickland said. The company's venture entails no risks for the Government and, beyond paying taxes, Drummond does not have to share its profits. It is required, though, to invest in the economically depressed region surrounding the mine. **********Ecocarbon is now planning to seek foreign bids on other coal reserves in the central and southern parts of the country. Total coal exports for this year are projected at 20.5 million tons and 32.4 million tons by 2000, by which time this country hopes to account for 10 percent of world exports. **********United States and Asian companies have expressed interest in some of these new ventures, in spite of the drawbacks. Drummond and Intercor are required to pay 15 percent of the market value of coal in royalty taxes, compared with 5 percent in Australia and nothing in South Africa. And both companies have spent millions of dollars in private security to guard against possible attack by left-wing guerrilla groups. In addition, the army has set up protection units near both mines. **********Colombia also faces competition from Venezuela, which is freeing investment in mining, and Chile, which has attracted more than half of its foreign capital in mining ventures. **********So far, coal mining here has been relatively immune to the nationalistic concerns that continue to affect foreign investment rules for oil. Because of constitutional provisions, mining is subject to less restrictive contracts than is the oil business, where, despite recent changes, foreign companies still pay extremely high taxes and must enter contracts in which state and private companies share profits and investment. **********Still, analysts in Colombia have warned that the Government lacks a well-defined policy for attracting investment in mining. **********\"The Government has been neither clear nor expedient in establishing regulations for investors,\" said Armando Zamora, promotion director of Coinvertir, a private company that monitors foreign investments in Colombia. \"It needs to work more on precision. Only then will foreign investment be truly attractive in coal.\" **********Yet the lure of high reserves continues to overshadow security and tax concerns in the oil sector as well. The Colombian Government is estimating its oil reserves at four billion barrels, about twice the reserves estimated in an area being exploited by the British Petroleum Company in the eastern central oilfields of Cusiana and Cupiagua. So far this year, Ecopetrol, the state oil company, has signed eight contracts with foreign countries, compared with 12 in all of 1994."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/13/business/key-rates-908895.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-thompson-is-added-to-heinz-s-roster.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thompson Is Added To Heinz's Roster", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Thompson Is Added To Heinz's Roster", "body_text": " **********The H.

The gains in the peso are seen as a positive response to several moves taken by the Mexican central bank to control the currency's recent volatility. **********The Mexican stock exchange, which has drifted aimlessly recently, surged today, with its main index rising 106.86 points, or more than 6.5 percent, as investors showed growing confidence in the new plan. **********While analysts in New York and Mexico were cautious not to attribute too much to a one-day rally, they were clearly encouraged. \"We're looking at the bottom of the market now,\" said Chip Brown, an economist with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. \"I don't see it getting much worse than it was a couple of weeks ago.\" **********Stabilization, however, is so far coming at a high cost for Mexico. Although the official data will lag by several weeks, there are daily indications that soaring interest rates, a shrinkage of credit, higher prices for gasoline and other products produced by the Government and federal budget cuts are causing even more pain than what President Ernesto Zedillo had told Mexico to expect when he announced the recovery plan on March 9. **********Indeed, there are increasing signs that the economy was even weaker than the Government had described when outlining the austerity measures. **********Official unemployment figures now show that around 400,000 Mexicans lost their jobs in January, much more than the 250,000 jobs that the Government said just two weeks ago were lost for both January and February. **********Recent figures show that domestic car sales fell more than 70 percent in February, while retail sales over all dropped 2.7 percent in January.

One of those banks, J. P. Morgan & Company, is now seeking to raise $1 billion in financing to help bolster Mexico's banking system, **********On Wednesday, the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its credit rating on the Government's long-term peso debt to BBB+ from A and darkened the outlook on Mexico's foreign currency debt to negative from stable. **********But there were some slighlty encouraging signs this week. And in an economy as battered as Mexico's, any bit of positive news can be cause for celebration. **********For the first time, the Bank of Mexico paid off holders of maturing Government bonds called tesobonos in dollars instead of pesos. Some $29 billion in such bonds at the beginning of the year spooked investors, and as the bonds matured every week, holders rushed to convert their pesos into dollars. This flooded the market with pesos and created a huge demand for dollars that sent the peso exchange rate into wild gyrations. **********The Mexican Government released trade figures showing Mexico had exported $452 million worth of goods more than it imported in February, providing a measure of hope that Mexico will be able to slash its huge current account deficit, which contributed to the crisis that erupted last December. **********Also this week, the Bank of Mexico started to issue what will be regular reports to help investors anticipate the peso exchange rate.

In Switzerland, the Colt sells relatively well. Not so in Europe's largest auto markets -- Germany, France and Italy, which have effectively limited the sales of Japanese imports. **********While Japanese car sales in the United States accounted for about 23 percent of the market last year, in Europe they were half that amount. **********The Europeans have limited the sales of Japanese imports by allocating market share and growth rates. They have also forced the Japanese to accept other trade barriers as a price of entry into the world's second-largest auto market. **********Indeed, the tough European trade stance has squeezed the same kind of concessions out of Japan that Tokyo is reluctant to grant the United States. Thus the Europeans have demanded -- and gotten -- larger quotas of European-made parts in Japanese cars built in Europe, and have forced Tokyo to accept what are in effect market quotas for its cars in Europe. **********For years, many European auto markets were kept off limits to Japan thanks to an array of bilateral government agreements, some of them going back decades. Italy, for example, signed a mutual restraint agreement with Japan after World War II that enabled Japan to protect its market from a murderous flood of cheap tiny Fiats. In recent years, the accord served Italy to keep the Japanese at bay. **********In 1992, as Europe moved toward a more open market, European trade officials agreed to gradually allow the Japanese a greater portion of the market. But when sales slumped the next year, and European car makers feared a permanent loss of market share, Japan was forced to back off and accept slower growth. In exchange, Europe agreed that it would lift all restrictions by the year 2000. **********\"It's totally managed trade,\" said Jeffrey Bobeck of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington. **********Under the arrangement, officials from European trade offices and Tokyo's Ministry for International Trade and Industry meet twice yearly to review car sales forecasts, after which the ministry assigns quotas to the Japanese manufacturers based roughly on their existing European market shares. **********The aim is \"not to upset the market, but to assure smooth growth,\" said James Rosenstein, the spokesman for the Association of European Automobile Makers in Brussels. \"The spirit is a fair sharing of both growth and contraction,\" he said. **********In Italy, for example, where Fiat has had to struggle to stay in the race, the Japanese share has been held to about 5 percent; in France, where auto makers Renault and Peugeot have effectively lobbied the Government for protection, it is less than 4 percent. **********Dealers like Mr. Wirnsberger in relatively open markets like Switzerland are lucky. With no competition from a Swiss auto industry and few import restraints, Japanese cars have seized 24 percent of the Swiss market. In Ireland, their share is 37 percent, in Finland 29 percent, and in Denmark 26 percent. Even in relatively liberal Britain the Japanese share hovers at 12 percent, half the North American figure. **********Japanese auto makers started making cars in the United States largely to get around voluntary import quotas that Japan agreed to in the early 1980's. Similarly, the Europeans have forced Japan to agree to build more cars here. **********But unlike the United States, Europe got Japan to agree that any cars made in Europe would have at least 60 percent of their content supplied by European parts makers. **********For that, the Japanese have taken the costly step of recruiting and training European suppliers. By this year, Nissan and Toyota, which also build cars in Britain, say local content will surpass 80 percent. In the United States, American-made parts account for less than half the content of Japanese cars made in America. **********The Japanese have also been hamstrung by a European system of car dealerships that was almost as highly regulated as the Japanese system that has foiled American car makers. In Europe, it is virtually impossible for the Japanese to sell through existing dealers. Only last week, the Europeans announced a partial deregulation that would make things easier for non-European auto makers. **********Nevertheless, the Japanese are far from dropping out of the race."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/14/business/l-it-s-the-category-not-the-fund-832195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "It's the Category, Not the Fund", "print_headline": "It's the Category, Not the Fund", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********\"Stop Me Before I Invest Again,\" (April 30) makes the point that the urge to diversify among mutual funds can get out of hand.

(George?) Its editor and publisher have no publishing experience. Its parent company puts out fashion, automobile and decorating magazines but knows nothing about political magazines, which is what George will be, or sort of be. **********If all this sounds like a less than surefire formula for success, hold on. **********George is the magazine that John F. Kennedy Jr. has been working on for more than a year with his partner, Michael Berman. On Thursday, they signed a contract with Hachette Filipacchi , which plans to publish George in September in what the company is calling a \"major launch.\" **********Mr. Kennedy, 34, and Mr. Berman, 37, say George will be a new kind of political publication: a glossy life-style magazine about politics. Politics has become a part of pop culture, the partners maintain, and George will seek to popularize politics for their generation in much the same way that MTV and television programs like \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" do. **********\"We want to make politics sort of entertaining,\" Mr. Kennedy said. \"If it is entertaining, people are going to be interested in it, and if they are interested in it, they might think more about it and maybe involve themselves in some way down the line.\" **********\"We are defining politics very broadly and want to focus on entertainment and politics, media and politics, business and politics,\" he said. \"Ultimately this magazine has to be useful and give people information about public issues. In the same way that some magazines have made financial markets accessible to people who don't want that much sophisticated information, we would like to make information about public issues accessible in a way that makes people feel included.\" **********Spirits were running high a few hours after signing the contract with Hachette. Having just finished lugging boxes from a small office in downtown Manhattan to their new office in the Hachette building in midtown, the two young entrepreneurs had changed from jeans into more formal clothes, borrowing ties and jackets as needed, to look the part of publishing executives for an interview and a photograph. **********Their new partner, David J. Pecker, president and chief executive of Hachette, said his company had been looking to start another magazine. With the interest generated by November's elections, a new kind of political magazine had great appeal to Mr. Pecker. **********After hearing reports of Mr. Kennedy's idea, Mr. Pecker and the editorial director of Hachette, Jean-Louis Ginibre, met him and Mr. Berman for lunch last spring. **********By October, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Berman had become convinced that in light of their inexperience, there were more benefits to hooking up with a large publishing company than trying to go it alone. **********Once Hachette entered the picture, plans for the magazine became much more ambitious. The magazine is now aiming for a circulation above 400,000. **********\"We are going to use the entire leverage of our company and give it the best art direction and graphic execution the company has,\" Mr. Pecker said. \"A glossy magazine with shorter stories, great graphics and a very sexy new visual.\" **********\"Those are David's words, not mine,\" Mr. Kennedy interjected with a grin. The first issue of the magazine is expected to reach newsstands in September, followed by a second issue in December. Hachette expects to publish six issues in 1996. **********A survey sent to 200,000 people last fall, which included readers of news weeklies, financial and women's magazines and other publications, indicated an unexpectedly high rate of interest, Hachette executives said. The 100,000 pieces of mail that included Mr. Kennedy's name elicited a response that was 20 percent higher than those pieces without it. **********The target audience for George will be 25 to 44, 60 percent male and will have a median household income of $40,000. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Berman were the sole investors until now. Mr. Pecker would say only that Hachette's investment for the start-up would be more than $5 million and less than $20 million. **********The idea for the magazine came to Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Berman, who are old friends, when both were between career moves. Mr. Kennedy, whose title will be editor in chief, had finished a four-year stint as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Berman, who will be executive publisher and has a background in advertising, public relations and marketing, had sold his business. **********Mr. Kennedy's interest grew out of his own experience. He even referred to publishing as the \"other\" family business. \"My mother obviously was in the publishing business,\" he said. **********\"I obviously grew up with politics,\" Mr. Kennedy said, \"and have always been interested in ways in which people can get involved with it and be stimulated by it.\" **********The suggestion that this might be a platform for his entry to politics brought a smile. \"There are just a lot more direct ways to go into politics than to start a magazine,\" he said. \"If I wanted to go into politics, believe me, there are better, cheaper, easier ways to do it.\" **********As for the magazine's title, yes, it refers to George Washington. Depending on what future tests indicate, the cover may have a subtitle that includes the word politics so that newsstand browsers will not be left clueless. **********\"People don't wrinkle up their noses at the name George the way they used to six months ago,\" Mr. Kennedy said. \"The idea was a sort of different take on politics, a playful and ultimately maybe more accessible take on the subject matter.

Its cover showed a strikingly cool model in a black beaded dress with a single cover line: \"Enter the Era of Elegance.\" **********It was a dramatic entrance by Ms. Tilberis, the former editor in chief of British Vogue, into the high-stakes world of American fashion, a land of smoke and mirrors where image is often worth its weight in reality. Her mission was to turn around the moribund 125-year-old Harper's Bazaar, once the doyenne of American fashion magazines, which was in its eighth year of a downward spiral in advertising pages. **********In re-creating her magazine, Ms. Tilberis was up against far more than staying on the cutting edge of fashion. She was up against the most insidious syndrome in the business: the escalating gossip, rarely traceable but usually spread to scare off advertisers, that a floundering magazine is in even deeper financial trouble than most people think. **********Like Hearst, many magazine companies are privately held and it is virtually impossible for outsiders to assess the financial health of any publication. Publishers posture and make claims, but the vacuum of real information is filled by gossip, raised eyebrows and scornful laughter at claims of success. Off the record, of course. **********On the face of it, almost three years after the arrival of Ms. Tilberis, Bazaar's vital signs are still weak. After an impressive 58 percent surge in advertising the year after she took over, ad pages fell 9 percent in 1994. This year, they are up 4 percent through May. **********Ad pages tell only part of the story, since figures published in the trade do not take account of discounting, a widespread practice in which ad pages are sometimes sold at prices that are up to 40 percent less than the published rates. It is clear, however, that among women's fashion magazines Vogue is still the leader, with Elle barely holding on to second place. **********The smallest magazine in the field, Mirabella, has withdrawn from play until September. It was sold by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in April to Hachette Filipachi, where it joins Elle. Amy Gross, Elle's editorial director, will also be Mirabella's editor in chief. **********Another sign of a magazine's health is circulation. Bazaar's circulation of 752,711 was up 2 percent last year, after dropping 4 percent in 1993. Next month the magazine will raise the circulation it guarantees its advertisers to 750,000 from 700,000. Newsstand sales, however, have been declining for three years. **********But D. Claeys Bahrenburg, president of Hearst Magazines, a unit of the Hearst Corporation, minimizes the importance of newsstand sales. He said creating provocative covers for the newsstand would destroy the elegant image Bazaar has worked hard to create. The only reason for Bazaar, a subscription-driven magazine, to be on the newsstand is to lure potential subscribers, he said. **********\"When we brought this magazine to market, trying to create a clear identity, we did not see it as a newsstand vehicle,\" he said \"It is an up-market product.\" **********Reaction in the industry to the new Bazaar is mixed. Some see it as calm and coolly elegant; others describe it as boring, even lifeless. **********\"It had a lot of hype that first year and maybe it was inevitable that it couldn't live up to its promise,\" said Claude Fromm, executive vice president and media director of TBWA, an advertising agency. \"Vogue has captured the spotlight, Elle is coming along and I wouldn't be surprised to see Mirabella do well under Amy. Harper's Bazaar doesn't seem to be creating that much of a buzz.\" **********On the other hand, advertisers like Rose Marie Bravo, president of Saks Fifth Avenue, and Leonard A. Lauder, president and chief executive of Estee Lauder, give Bazaar high marks. \"We think they are sensational,\" Ms. Bravo said. \"We find it very elegant, very sophisticated, very subtle.\" **********Mr. Lauder, whose company has advertised in Bazaar for 30 years, praised the magazine's \"clear precise point of view.\" **********\"There is no mushiness about where they are and what they stand for,\" he added. \"Our decisions about where to advertise are rarely based on numbers and rarely based on buzz, because we rarely pay attention to anyone's buzz except our own.\" **********But buzz is the buzzword in the land of smoke and mirrors, and competitors making sales calls have been quick to point out what they see as Bazaar's vulnerable position. **********Mr. Bahrenburg would not comment on the magazine's earnings but said: \"We are very pleased with how it is developing. It is an authority in the fashion world and it is now in the process of becoming more and more of a commercial as well as a critical success.\" **********Despite the fashion industry's penchant for trashing all in sight, Ms. Tilberis seems to be genuinely admired by virtually everyone. Her dignity and openness in dealing with a serious bout of ovarian cancer last year won her widespread respect. **********And she knows exactly what she wants her magazine to be: \"I think we made the niche we wanted to make and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I really wanted to create.

With its Sound Blaster equipment, many people say, Creative Labs helped invent the wave. **********Beyond its sound cards, which are circuit boards that can be inserted inside a PC, the company has also become leading seller of multimedia upgrade kits, or all-in-one packages that turn a plain vanilla PC into one that can provide sound and video using a sound card, speakers and a CD-ROM drive. **********But Creative Labs, like many other multimedia companies, is finding itself squeezed by the industry it helped create. As more and more computers are sold with sound cards and multimedia built in, and the older computers without sound equipment are taken out of service, Creative Labs is hoping to sustain its strong growth by increasing sales to computer makers and broadening into new areas. **********At first glance, the pressure on Creative Labs, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., is hard to find. Earlier this month, Creative Technology Ltd., its Singapore-based parent company, announced that sales for the second quarter had more than doubled, to more than $400 million, from the corresponding period last year -- turning 1994 into the company's first billion-dollar calendar year. CompUSA, the nation's largest computer retailer, called Christmas 1994 its best season yet for sales of multimedia upgrade kits. **********\"The future looks very promising for us,\" Sim Wong Hoo, chairman and co-founder of Creative Technology, said while discussing the earnings in a recent conference call. **********Company executives say they expect the market for multimedia upgrades to peak in 1996. But industry analysts say that time has already arrived. Of the PC's purchased in the last six months of 1994, two-thirds had a CD-ROM drive, according to the Odyssey Corporation, a market research company in San Francisco. **********\"The problem the numbers reflected in the U.S. is that the market has matured,\" said Jeff Matthews, a general partner with Ram Partners LP, a money management company in Greenwich, Conn., that invests in high technology. \"Most consumers can go out and buy a great PC with all this stuff built into it.\" **********Indeed, most of the growth in the most recent quarter came in Europe. Growth in the United States was down, to 23 percent growth in the quarter ended in December from 60 percent growth in the previous quarter. Overall profits declined to $22 million in the last quarter of 1994 from nearly $40 million in the corresponding period of 1993, as the company was forced to adjust its product mix toward lower profit items. **********Even if Creative Technology, which employs 4,100 people worldwide, disagrees with analysts on when the retail market will dry up, it already has in place a three-pronged strategy to survive: the company hopes to repeat its success in the sound business in video products for computers; it hopes to continue building up its business of selling its equipment to computer makers, and it hopes to expand dramatically into telephone computing services. **********The latter will be available first: this spring the company plans to introduce a Phone Blaster package that combines voice mail, facsimile transmission and electronic mail. Mr. Sim said products like this one will eventually be a major part of his business. **********Toward this end, Creative Labs last year acquired Digicom Inc., a small data communications company that sold high-performance modems and other products using digital signal processing technology. DSP technology is used for audio compression and text-to-speech translation, and new DSP chips can be programmed to perform communications functions as well. **********Creative Labs hopes to offer three-dimensional video add-ons later this year that could turn personal computers into game machines with video performance that rivals machines from Nintendo and Sega of America. The first products in this new video line will be out before the end of 1995, Mr. Sim said. The line will compete with products from S3 Inc., a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that makes a computer chip that provides three-dimensional graphics. **********\"This represents a big leap,\" he said. \"It will actually spin off a new kind of software that will be very, very interesting. And its future is wide open.\" **********Many analysts say they think that the strong relationships Creative Labs has with software developers will help it win crucial support in the video market. But recreating the huge success of Sound Blaster is by no means assured. **********\"When it comes to producing it in volume and at a low cost, they've got the manufacturing infrastructure, and they've also already got the relationships and the distribution channel,\" said Rob Stone, an analyst at Cowan & Company, an investment banking company in Boston. \"The question is how strong is their technology?\" **********Creative Labs has also begun to build up aggressively its sales to PC manufacturers, like Compaq Computer and Gateway 2000, which include Creative Labs equipment in their multimedia machines. Currently 17 percent of the company's sales are through computer manufacturers, and the company hopes to build that to 20 percent, Mr. Sim said. **********Last year, the biggest competitor Creative Labs faces in the upgrade business became the first major casualty of multimedia's success: Media Vision Technology Inc. of Fremont, Calif., once one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing companies, stunned Wall Street when it announced that after nine consecutive profitable quarters it would post a huge loss for the first quarter of 1994. **********At first, Media Vision executives blamed price cuts by Creative Labs for their problems. But analysts quickly learned that Media Vision had badly overstated demand and amassed huge inventories. A subsequent investigation led to the resignation of the executive staff, and the company filed for protection under Chapter 11. **********That leaves Creative Labs unchallenged at the top of the heap. Far smaller competitors include Reveal, which is owned by the computer maker Packard Bell Electronics, and Diamond, a privately held company. **********Creative Labs, which popularized its technique for incorporating sound in personal computers in the mid-1980's, today controls roughly 60 percent of the market. Hundreds of software companies toil to assure customers that their products are \"Sound Blaster compatible.\" **********Last year, Creative Labs announced a series of packages that bundled together its multimedia hardware with CD-ROM software for specific audiences. The Sound Blaster Multimedia Office, for example, includes the Microsoft Office set of business software; a home-education bundle includes several dozen software programs for young children, and an entertainment bundle includes a collection of games. These were advertised and marketed aggressively and commanded yards of shelf space in retailers' software aisles. **********Until 1996, Creative Labs will focus on its delivering new products to its core markets; it recently delivered a new generation of Sound Blaster technology -- what it calls the AWE32, which processes data in bundles of 32 bits rather than 16. That capacity allows digital playback and synthesis of professional-quality music and sound effects. **********Company executives and some industry watchers anticipate a healthy market for such upgrades among the owners of multimedia PC's, who, they hope, will pay to add the latest and greatest sound to their machines. **********\"The business is absolutely growing,\" agreed Larry Mondry, executive vice president of merchandising for CompUSA, where nearly all PC's sold to home users are multimedia machines. \"So far, the business has been in additions. Now you're going to true upgrades, like from double-speed to quad-speed CD-ROM drives.\" **********Creative Technology, one of Singapore's largest computer equipment companies, was founded in 1981 by Mr. Sim -- who is one of Singapore's most visible high-technology success stories. In 1992, Creative Technology became the first Singapore company to be listed on Nasdaq. **********Back in 1986, the company introduced the first Chinese PC, the Cubic CT, which included multimedia capabilities far ahead of its time. Despite the machine's features, sales were not strong, because Creative Technology was underfinanced and too focused on developing computersrather than selling them, said Chay Kwong Soon, the company president. **********The experience marked a turning point. \"We learned from our mistakes,\" Mr. Chay said. \"We learned we had to market.\" **********And market it did, with a vengeance. In 1988, Creative Technology announced the Game Blaster, a full stereo sound board for the PC that was immediately a hit among the growing hordes of game players. The company opened an American office in South San Francisco, and in 1989 brought out Sound Blaster product, with a fuller set of features. It quickly became a hardware standard with which the software producers had to comply. **********Analysts give the company, and Sim's management, a lot of credit for helping create an entire market from scratch."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/08/world/mexican-claim-of-graft.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexican Claim of Graft", "print_headline": "Mexican Claim of Graft", "body_text": " **********In documents filed in a Texas court case, the fugitive former chairman of Mexico's largest airline has asserted that he paid $8 million in illegal campaign donations to his country's governing party during the presidential elections last year. **********Article, page A8."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/25/business/making-the-pc-come-alive.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1995-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1787, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Making the PC Come Alive", "print_headline": "Making the PC Come Alive", "body_text": " **********At 3Com Park, a Giant batter hits a line drive through the hole and sprints toward first base. Simultaneously, an animation of the scene -- with video-game realism -- can be displayed on computer screens anywhere on the Internet. **********\"When he hits the ball, his batting average is updated in real time,\" said Patrick Naughton, chief technology officer of the Starwave Corporation, an on-line provider of sports and other entertainment programming. **********The demonstration, which can create similar on-line play-by-play of any Major League Baseball game, was created by software developers at Starwave in Bellvue, Wash., using a new computer language known as Java -- an emerging technology that many industry experts expect to be the next big thing in computing. **********Just as popular World Wide Web \"browser\" software like Netscape has transformed the Web from a scientist's research tool into a consumer medium over the last two years, many computer industry researchers and executives predict that the Java programming language will transport the Web to the next level. **********Currently, the Web, for all its multimedia marvels, which include text, images and even sound and video clips, is a fairly static medium. A computer user connected to the Internet can visit Web sites, but doing so is similar to watching the world through a storefront window. **********Java essentially removes the glass from the window. It can serve simultaneously as a universal translator -- enabling programs to move fluidly between incompatible operating systems -- and as a go-fer. With the help of a browser like Netscape, it can run across the Web and the rest of the Internet to fetch programs from the powerful computers that run Web sites and bring the programs and the information they generate (like the second-by-second account from the baseball game) back to a user's home computer. **********Developed over the last four years by an elite team of software designers at Sun Microsystems led by James Gosling, and introduced to the market earlier this year, Java has burst into the already rapidly expanding commercial world of the Internet and the World Wide Web. **********Other software developers are beginning to adopt Java, using it to create a new class of programs that leapfrog the walls that now keep many computers from interacting easily with each other. These programs could operate on any computer -- whether a Windows, Macintosh or Unix machine -- that a Java program encounters on the Internet. **********Sun is a maker of computers and software using the industry-standard Unix software operating system, and the leading provider of so-called Internet server computers that act as the gateway through which most people's desktop computers actually send and receive data over the Net. Figuring that what is good for the Internet is good for Sun, the company now hopes to turn Java into an industry standard by making it freely available to individuals and universities, while licensing it to companies that incorporate it into software products. **********As a standard, Java could potentially transform the static universe of the Internet's World Wide Web into a computing ecology in which programs jump from one computer to another and do useful tasks -- whether delivering the morning newspaper electronically without the user having to go look for it, performing automatic diagnosis and repair of computers from an on-line service center, or providing an interactive arena for elaborate multiplayer games. **********\"My computer has literally come alive,\" said Larry Smarr, the director of the National Center for Supercomputing in Urbana-Champaigne, Ill., the Government-financed research center that originally developed Mosaic, the original World Wide Web browser on which Netscape is based. \"This is the hottest thing on the Net.\" **********The enthusiasm is not limited to researchers. Advertising agencies are starting to look at Java as a way to to cobble together little animated ads that people can easily download from the Web; a Coke ad, for example, might appear on the screen as a bottle cap, which when clicked with a computer mouse might turn into the cola-guzzling polar bear. **********Lotus is said to be negotiating licensing rights with Sun to incorporate Java into an Internet version of its popular Lotus Notes program. Notes enables groups of people to work simulataneously on a single file over a computer network of Notes users. With Java embedded in Notes, that capability would extend to any computer on the Internet, and allow Notes users to run any Java program they receive. **********And Netscape Communications Inc., whose browser software is the most popular way to navigate the World Wide Web, has already licensed rights to Java in hopes of continuing Netscape's role as an industry standard-setter. Having Netscape aboard could give other software developers confidence to develop Java-based programs, knowing that millions of Netscape users will be able to run them. **********Netscape, which was forced to acknowledge a potentially serious security flaw in its own software last week, might also benefit from Java's built-in security features, which are supposed to alert users of any intruders, viruses, Trojan horses or other network goblins that might crawl into their machines from the Internet. **********\"This is an elegant piece of work,\" said John Seeley Brown, a director of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, one of Silicon Valley's best-known computer laboratories. Mr. Brown's organization had nothing to do with Java's development -- which makes his compliment all the more persuasive. \"Java could change the paradigm of everything -- from newspapers to interactivity in the home,\" he said. **********In the world of computer science, new programming languages are almost as common as graduate student dissertations. Only rarely, usually no more than once a decade, does a new language catch the attention of a sufficiently broad group of programmers to emerge as a potential standard. **********The last programming language to do so was Microsoft's Visual Basic, which was introduced in 1991. It was based on the decades-old Basic language and has evolved into a set of tools for software programmers -- a so-called object-oriented approach that lets the creator use ready-made programming modules instead of writing lines and lines of code. **********Some well-known computer scientists even argue that Java, or a language very much like it, will eventually transform the computer industry by turning networks into a new technology platform -- supplanting both the personal computer and PC operating system software as the foundation for a new market and new businesses that will grow as quickly as the PC software industry once did. **********\"The software industry is going to reinvent itself,\" said Geoffrey Fox, a professor of computer science and physics at Syracuse University and a pioneer in the field of parallel computing (in which tasks are broken up into small pieces for solving by dozens or even hundreds of computer processors working in parallel). Not only will Web browsers like Netscape be updated for Java, Professor Fox predicts, but each major category of software application, like word processors and spread sheets, will be rewritten in Java to take advantage of the Web. **********\"Previously it was impossible to compete with Microsoft products like Word and Excel,\" he said, \"but now I see the World Wide Web leveling the playing field in the software industry.\" **********Java is based on the idea of \"distributed computing,\" in which a network of computers jointly process information and solve problems that otherwise would be the burden of a single machine. The distributed computing concept is not new. As early as the mid-1970's scientists at places like Xerox PARC experimented with programs, called worms, that would automatically travel over a computer network between machines to do useful tasks. **********But harnessing the technology has proven difficult. For one thing, accepting unknown or unproven programs over a computer network is fraught with risk. One of the most infamous worms was created by Robert Tappan Morris , a Cornell University computer science student who unleashed a worm in 1988 as an experiment that wound up damaging more than 6,000 government, corporate and university computers on the Internet. **********\"We're playing with fire,\" said Mr. Brown at Xerox PARC. \"This is not something for mere mortals.\" **********Yet its Promethean possibilities are precisely why Java has been attracting such eager converts. Java appears to be the best attempt yet to strike a workable balance between security and functionality. **********Java is known as an \"interpreted\" language, which means that each program that runs on the computer is examined and then executed, instruction by instruction, by the Java interpreter -- a small software program known as an engine. The engine acts as a bouncer at the barroom door that will admit no visitor with the appearance of a trouble maker. **********If the foreign program is admitted, the engine continually watches it to insure that it behaves itself and does not include any viruses, time bombs or secret back doors that could cause trouble later, even after the guest has been ushered out. **********By handling security at this most basic level, Java is designed to permit small application programs called applets to flit back and forth between computers on a network, bearing skills as diverse as computer animation, real-time updates to newswires or stock-market tables, or multimedia advertisements. **********It is also applets that would allow for collaborative computing among any computers on the World Wide Web, similar to the collaborative work that Lotus Notes currently enables users to perform on machines and corporate networks equipped with Notes. **********Even though Java is designed to guard against the most common threats to network security, however, some computer researchers contend there is still no absolute solution -- and that Java cannot protect computer users from themselves if they decide to forgo the safeguards built in to the language. **********Besides viruses and worms that may prowl a network with malicious intent, another class of programs called Trojan horses can hide themselves in supposedly trusted applications. Java is supposed to be able to detect such attacks. But if a user chose to ignore a security alert once the Trojan horse had been detected, and allowed the foreign program to run, Java could not protect the user's system from damage. **********Some security experts predict that naive users will be lulled or **********conned into lowering their defenses -- and suffering the consequences. **********\"There is no silver bullet,\" said Allan Schiffman, president of Terisa Systems, a Menlo Park, Calif., an Internet computer security firm.  \"You can't expect to ever have a blanket solution to computer security.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/world/world-news-briefs-148-arrested-as-youths-disrupt-mexican-protest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; 148 Arrested as Youths Disrupt Mexican Protest", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; 148 Arrested as Youths Disrupt Mexican Protest", "body_text": " **********Police officials said today that 148 people were arrested and two passers-by were hurt when gangs of youths disrupted an opposition march in the central square on Monday night. **********Several hundred youths forced their way into the march, commandeered several public buses and burned four of them in Mexico City's vast central plaza.

There is still a decent supply of cars to choose from, but not in all models. And though some dealers say they are much less inclined to negotiate on price, others insist it is just the right time to stop by for a deal. **********Just when buyers might expect to feel the bite of the 100 percent tariffs also varies from showroom to showroom. The tariffs are set to kick in Wednesday and apply retroactively to all targeted cars that arrived in this country after May 19. But the manufacturers have promised to absorb tariffs on any car that gets here by Wednesday. That will protect all those who buy before the deadline, but only some who buy after it, since inventories range widely, from one to three months, depending on the dealer and the model. **********In any event, consumers have also been reacting in different ways to the tariff threat. Some who were wavering about purchasing the pricey cars decided to take the plunge. **********Dr. Walter Gilbert of Jacksonville, Fla., for example, wasted no time when the tariff deadline was announced May 16. Two days later, he dashed over to a Nissan Infiniti dealer, Atlantic Infiniti, where he plopped down a check for $41,000 and traded in his 1988 BMW M5 for a gray Q45 that matches his wife's. **********Others are holding off, concerned that dealers might shut their doors. Pamela Hayden of Lake City, Fla., decided not to buy a $30,000 Infiniti I30 -- at least not for now -- citing concerns about getting service and parts in the future. **********More people apparently decided to make purchases than to head for the sidelines in May, judging by sales figures for that month. But the situation now is not clear, since June figures will not be released until the month is over. **********Lexus sales in the United States surged in May, to 8,378 cars, compared with 7,403 in May 1994. But Mike Michels, a spokesman for Toyota's Lexus division, said that not all of the gain could necessarily be attributed to the tariff threat. Other variables, including advertising and marketing programs in May, may also be responsible, he said. **********At Mitsubishi, sales of the company's only targeted model, the Diamante, more than doubled in May, to 639, from April's total of 291. The company credited tariff jitters for at least some of that gain. **********At some dealers in the New York metropolitan area, business is still brisk. Jim Benson, finance manager for Kings Infiniti in Brooklyn, said sales had increased strongly in the last two weeks. **********Richard Karsian, general manager of the Lexus dealership in Englewood, N.J., said that customers whose leases would soon be up were coming in early to arrange renewals \"as a precautionary measure.\" His dealership sold 118 cars in May, compared with 70 in May 1994, and he has already sold 80 this month. **********Some dealers are capitalizing on the situation to get higher profits. Bruce Stevens, a sales manager for Atlantic Infiniti in Jacksonville, said that \"on some models we're not as willing to negotiate as we had been in the past,\" specifically on the J30, Q45 and I30, because availability of these cars is down. For example, he said only 12 J30's were on hand, instead of the typical 35. **********Others say customers now have the edge because sales at their showrooms have been tapering off. **********Stewart Lasser, owner of the Infiniti dealership in Denville, N.J., said that while May was bustling, sales had been down this month, \"so people are getting really good deals.\" He said he was taking lower gross profits, in some instances accepting $1,500 in profit on a J30, compared with $2,000 last month. **********As for inventory, many dealers appear to have ample supplies on hand. Nissan, for example, cut production on its affected vehicles this month, but dealers still have a 60-day supply, said a Nissan spokeswoman, Debra Sanchez Fair. And Honda's Acura stopped shipping its targeted Legend models from Japan for a week in May, but then resumed. As of June 1, Acura said that it had a 90-day supply of all vehicles, including those affected by the tariff. **********Despite all the hoopla, some people who are buying Japanese luxury cars these days are doing so for all the usual reasons. **********Take Brian Wilcox of Marietta, Ga. Earlier this week, he traded in his Nissan 300-Z sports car for a four-door Lexus, the ES 300, which goes for $35,400. The purchase had nothing to do with international trade tensions.

You often hear of top executives getting them -- windfalls that would pay off the mortgages in entire neighborhoods, with enough left for a few centuries' worth of groceries. But at Chemical Bank, some goodies trickled down to humbler workers last week, too; when the stock topped $50 for three days running, a share plan announced a year ago kicked in. The numbers had considerably fewer decimal places than those in executive pay packages -- a profit of $1,481 (before taxes) -- but it did spark interest. \"It was amazing how suddenly the whole organization began paying attention to the stock price,\" said Chemical's chairman, Walter Shipley, who at yearend owned 551,950 shares and has options to buy 530,000 more.  TOBACCO  Yes, It's a Drug. Now What? **********The F.D.A. has this tricky problem. It has decided that nicotine is an addictive drug, and one that's clearly dangerous; plug those facts into a legal computer and you'd have to ban cigarettes. It can't do that, of course -- smokers would probably burn Washington to the ground (or bury it in ashes). So last week the agency sent some more modest ideas to the White House (given the explosiveness of this issue, it passed the buck). These included banning vending-machine sales, clamping down on sales to minors, and barring \"Joe Camel\"-type ads (which seem to have nearly vanished anyway). Even such modest measures face a rough ride, though. Tobacco is \"a legal commodity\" and should be treated as such, said one tobacco-state lawmaker, while another was \"distressed\" and \"annoyed.\" . . . Also last week, a glimpse into tobacco history: In 1950, an epidemiologist named Morton Levin wrote one of the first papers to show that smoking causes lung cancer, and campaigned against smoking throughout his career. Dr. Levin just died at 91.  SPENDING IT  Down and Out at Genentech **********It's hard to get by on nearly $1 million a year. So to make ends meet -- and considerable ends they must be -- G. Kirk Raab kept borrowing from Genentech, where he happened to be chief executive. Finally, Mr. Raab sought a $2 million personal-loan guarantee from Roche Holdings of Switzerland, even as he was negotiating the sale of his company to Roche -- a deal, by the way, that shareholders say shortchanged them. This was too much for the board, which sent Mr. Raab packing last week. That ended a stormy tenure at this fast-growing company, one marked by strong criticism of its sales practices. A top Genentech sales executive, in fact, is about to go on trial on charges of paying kickbacks to a pediatrician to prescribe Genentech's growth hormone.  INVESTIGATIONS  Blowing a Golden Whistle **********It is not, generally, a great idea to bite the hand that feeds you -- especially if that hand belongs to a powerful company like Archer-Daniels-Midland. That company has fed Mark Whitacre very nicely, in fact: as head of the BioProducts division, he is a rising company star. But it's unclear whether that star will keep rising. For last week it turned out that Mr. Whitacre, working with the F.B.I., secretly taped executives' conversations as part of an inquiry into possible price-fixing. Though whistleblowers have popped up in all sorts of places to denounce corporate naughtiness, it's highly unusual for such a high executive to play that role.  TRADE  No Favors From China **********Yes, we can talk tough with China all we want -- on human rights, on Taiwan's status. But highmindedness, no matter how virtuous, might also have its costs, for China's sheer bulk gives it indisputable power. Last week, after saying that no decision was due for months, China snubbed Ford and Chrysler to give Mercedes a $1 billion contract to build mini-vans and engines in China, even though Mercedes has never actually built a true passenger mini-van -- you know, with all the cup-holders. Chinese officials denied that rising tensions with Washington had anything to do with the decision, but Detroit has to be wondering. DIPLOMACY  The Next Step in Vietnam **********The building of a diplomatic bridge to Vietnam raised emotional issues -- some people saying the move was overdue, others insisting it wouldn't be time till all the missing were accounted for. But put those issues aside for a moment: a big step in healing the wounds will come when goods can flow freely between the nations. And despite last week's opening, that can't happen quite yet. Still needed are a trade agreement and preferred trading status, and even then American companies must struggle to catch up with Asia and Europe to do business in a country with 73 million people, more than France or Britain.  AUTOS  Japan Meets One Trade Goal **********Remember that hoopla-laden trade agreement with Japan last month, the one that made the world safe for Lexus owners? No numbers. No specific targets. Just words. But most people have probably forgotten that when George Bush went to Tokyo three years ago, Japan's auto industry set a target of buying $19 billion worth of American parts in the year that ended this past March, twice the previous level. And guess what: Japan did so, and more. Figures out last week showed $19.86 billion in purchases. There's a footnote, though: that figure is total purchases, not imports. Most parts were for Japanese plants here. Japan had set a goal of $4 billion in imported parts, but fell short with just $3.23 billion.  CONSOLIDATION  One Bank, Indivisible **********Something strange is going on. One advantage of a national Government -- politics, if possible, aside -- would seem to be the economies of scale it offers in running things. But everyone's been slamming the centralized bureaucracy as a failure. Banking, though, is heading full-blast in the opposite direction. Repeatedly citing \"economies of scale,\" the nation's banks are tripping over themselves in a rush to merge into behemoths. A few weeks ago, First Union said it would buy First Fidelity of Newark. Then last week PNC agreed to buy Midlantic, and First Chicago and NBD agreed to merge into a Midwest powerhouse. The value of the deals: $5.4 billion, $3 billion and $5.3 billion. But there was no truth to rumors that Citibank was buying the Federal Reserve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/02/business/international-business-us-not-embracing-call-for-a-shift-on-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1995-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Not Embracing Call for a Shift on Japan", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. Not Embracing Call for a Shift on Japan", "body_text": " **********Commerce Secretary Ronald H.

In it, he took a much less aggressive tone than other American officials in discussing efforts to open the Japanese market. **********\"We have a good opportunity now to initiate a more positive phase in the trade and economic relations between the U.S. and Japan, one in which the tone becomes more cooperative and more oriented towards the common goal of building a world economy in which our two countries are not pictured as antagonists but as close partners,\" Mr. Garten said, according to a text of the speech released by his office. **********He went on: \"Such an environment will not evolve from soothing words, but from some very hard work on both sides of the Pacific. Achieving it will be a difficult challenge for both Washington and Tokyo. I believe it can be done, however.\" **********The speech gave the appearance of undermining Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.

Reasoning that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is undervalued and may be a takeover target, stock traders have recently bid up the price of shares in the Wall Street investment bank. **********Lehman's stock has climbed almost 20 percent from mid-August to $23.50 a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, Lehman's shares have risen almost 60 percent from less than $15 a share at the start of January. Lehman shares have also outpaced those of most other investment banks, which as a group have risen about 43 percent this year, on the back of the steady rise in the stock market. **********\"People are looking at Lehman because it's so cheap -- it's under book,\" said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Lehman's book value is about $25 a share, he added. **********Lehman looks cheap compared with many of its peers, said Michael A. Flanagan, an analyst with the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. Merrill Lynch & Company is trading at twice its book value, he said, while Morgan Stanley & Company has a market price of 170 percent of its book value and Paine Webber Inc. is at 130 percent. **********\"The whole group has gone up, and there are the takeover stories, too,\" said James P. Hanbury, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim, discussing the recent rise in the stocks of Lehman and its investment-banking rivals. Asked who might buy Lehman, Mr. Hanbury replied: \"Who knows? Some large institution with lots of money -- European, Canadian, whatever.\" **********The favorites are the big European banks, such as the Union Bank of Switzerland and Deutsche Bank. But both these institutions have insisted recently that they prefer building their own franchises on Wall Street to acquiring businesses like Lehman Brothers. Still, bulls say these foreigners are not making much progress and eventually will have to buy anyway. **********\"These takeover rumors have been circulating all year, and even back to when the company was spun off by American Express,\" Mr. Moszkowski said, referring to the May 1994 sale of Lehman. **********There does not seem to be any sudden earnings surge to account for Lehman's soaring stock price. Next week, the company will announce results for its third quarter, which ended Aug. 31. \"The earnings aren't going be much higher,\" Mr. Moszkowski said. He forecasts per-share earnings for the quarter of 40 cents to 45 cents. That would mean about $49 million of earnings applicable to the common stock, after the payment of about $11 million of dividends on preferred shares, he said. **********One recent boon for Lehman will not show up in next week's earnings. That is a $50 million gain from the sale of its 8 percent stake in an Italian cellular-telephone company. That profit will appear in Lehman's fourth-quarter earnings, which are due in December. **********Analysts say that Lehman is trying to rebuild its earnings and tightly control costs to improve its standing with credit rating agencies. Lehman was hurt earlier this year by a downgrade of its ratings, which makes it that much harder for the company to compete. **********\"They have a ratings issue and a revenue issue,\" Mr. Hanbury said. \"Lehman is a big fixed-income business,\" he noted. \"If you're rated under A,\" as Lehman currently is, \"and the competition is single A and double A,\" he noted, it is very hard to win business. **********\"It's kind of a cart and horse issue,\" Mr. Hanbury added. \"How do you get the earnings without the rating? How do you get the rating without the earnings?\" **********The rating agencies seem conciliatory toward Lehman. \"They have a cost-cutting program that is making progress,\" Haig J. Nargesian, a senior analyst for financial institutions at Moody's Investors Service, said. Still, explaining why Lehman's credit ratings are lower than those of some peers, he cited its low profit margins. \"Long-term, it'll be important for them to build revenues,\" he said, to improve the company's standing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/business-digest-972195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Senate Votes to Drop Communication Rules **********The Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill that would sweep away decades of regulation for telephones, cable television and broadcasting, replacing such oversight with open competition. **********The bill could reshape the telecommunications and media industries.

Several officials suggested that Cuba had hinted that it might extradite Mr. Vesco as a way to develop good will with the United States at a time when it is eager to have the 32-year-old economic embargo against the Cuban Government eased. **********But some officials said they always doubted Cuba would turn over Mr. Vesco, a financier who fled the United States in the early 1970's during an embezzlement investigation, since he is reputed to have information linking many Cuban officials to criminal activity. **********Joseph Sullivan, the head of the American Interests Section in Havana, which serves as a liaison office between the Cuban and American Governments in the absence of diplomatic relations, met with Cuban officials late today in what American officials described as a last-ditch effort to persuade Cuba to extradite Mr. Vesco. **********CNN reported today that the Cuban President, Fidel Castro, had said in a private dinner on Sunday with the network's executives and journalists that it would be \"immoral\" to extradite Mr. Vesco and make him a \"pawn of U.S.-Cuba relations.\" Mr. Castro was quoted as saying that Cuba would conduct its own investigation of Mr. Vesco. **********American diplomats say Mr. Vesco must have done something to run afoul of Mr. Castro or his brother, Raul, the head of the Cuban military, because for years Mr. Vesco had been free to conduct his business dealings with their unofficial blessing. **********Rafael Dausa, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Mr. Vesco has been charged with being \"a provocateur or agent for foreign special services,\" although he refused to specify which country's special services Mr. Vesco was believed to be serving. **********In recent interviews, American diplomats, intelligence experts and law enforcement officials said that during his years in Cuba, Mr. Vesco has been heavily involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and smuggling American goods into Cuba. **********Administration officials said Cuba declined to turn over Mr. Vesco even though they had complied with Cuba's request to provide information about the numerous indictments Mr. Vesco faces in the United States. They include a 1976 indictment handed down by a Federal grand jury in New York for siphoning off more than $200 million from a Geneva-based mutual fund and a 1973 federal indictment in Washington for making an illegal $200,000 contribution to the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon. **********In addition, a Federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla., indicted Mr. Vesco in 1989 for conspiring with Carlos Lehder Rivas, a Colombian drug cartel leader, to smuggle narcotics. Ten days ago, prosecutors in Tallahassee, Fla., unsealed a 1984 indictment that charges Mr. Vesco with cocaine trafficking. **********One senior State Department official said that after Mr. Vesco was arrested, an official in the Cuban Foreign Ministry told the American liaison office in Havana: \"We have him. Are you interested in him?\" The Clinton Administration read this as an offer to hand over Mr. Vesco if the United States were to reciprocate in some unspecified way. The State Department has said repeatedly, however, that the Administration would not make any reciprocal gestures in exchange for Mr. Vesco's extradicton. **********A senior Administration official said that even though Cuba had strongly suggested two weeks ago that it might extradite Mr. Vesco, it emphasized today that it was not making -- and had never made -- any formal offer to do so. **********Within the Administration, officials speculated that there were two reasons why Havana had decided not to extradite Mr. Vesco: he knew too much that could incriminate senior Cuban officials, and the Clinton Administration did not offer enough to make it worthwhile for Mr. Castro to hand over America's most wanted financial criminal. **********American law enforcement officials acknowledge some ambivalence about the prospect of having Mr. Vesco returned.

But mechanical problems delayed his plane from New Zealand and he barely made it in time for the airport handshake today. **********So he missed the sight of Mrs. Clinton and her 15-year-old daughter, Chelsea, ensconced in a padded howdah atop Shamsher Bahadur, a 9-foot, 8 1/2-inch elephant whose name means Brave Tiger, in a sunset search for a tiger in the grass on Saturday.

Some suggested they were reluctant to invite comparisons with Jacqueline Kennedy, the last American First Lady to make a solo trip to this region. She rode an elephant in Jaipur, India, 33 years ago last month. **********One ride of an hour and a half was enough for Mrs. Clinton, though Chelsea went out again this morning. Neither spied the big quarry, the endangered royal Bengal tiger, but they did see rhinos, spotted deer and a peacock perched in a tree. **********The forest was also thick with wild hogs, whose cousin, the Arkansas Razorbacks, impelled Mrs. Clinton's attempt at contact with the outside world from the remote lodge: she brought a short-wave radio, hoping to catch word of the game between the University of Arkansas and North Carolina, but couldn't find any broadcasts in English.

By October 1991, however, the securities in the partnership had been ravaged by losses in rapid-fire trading, and Ms. Manion-Fleming was left with just $24,000. No problem, said the investment adviser, International Market Strategies; give us five years, and we'll win back your principal. She did; they aren't. In January, she and other partnership investors filed a joint complaint to get their money back from the brokerage firm that did the trades. **********THE BROKER: Consolidated Financial Investments Inc. of St. Louis, which executed many of the trades described in the complaint before the National Association of Securities Dealers. Alan Stiffelman, a Consolidated officer, said his firm is an innocent that just followed the instructions of a money manager not affiliated with Consolidated. **********THE STATUS: The N.A.S.D. has yet to assign a hearing date. The plaintiffs' lawyer is considering suing the investment adviser, who is not an N.A.S.D. member, separately. **********THE LESSON: Don't believe financial advisers who promise you can never lose more than a certain percentage of your money. Such a claim is only meaningful when there's a bond to back them up. And if their trading causes huge losses, don't believe any promise that they'll make it all up to you in further trading. Get that claim in writing, then ship it off to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to your state securities regulators so they can determine if the promise amounted to fraud. **********TO hear Alan Stiffelman tell the story, it's a case of devious investors looking to rip off a brokerage firm after the market turned against them. All his firm did, he said, was execute trades ordered by International Marketing Strategies, manager of the investment partnership the investors had joined. **********\"This is the slimiest thing I've ever seen,\" said Mr. Stiffelman, branch manager of Consolidated Financial Investments Inc. \"These people are completely in outer space,\" he said of a group of eight customers who filed a claim against him and his firm. **********Mr. Stiffelman is ranting over the arbitration complaint, filed in January, against him and Consolidated and against Cutter & Company, another brokerage firm in St. Louis.  Gary Ross, a former employee of both Consolidated and Cutter and a principal in St. Louis-based I.M.S., was also named. Mr. Stiffelman says the customers knew exactly what was going on -- he sent detailed statements to them as well as to I.M.S. -- and that they didn't complain at the start, when the accounts were making money. **********Only when the accounts began losing money, he said, did the investors squawk. He said he did not know the particulars of their I.M.S. agreement but acknowledged there had been heavy trading in the accounts. **********Sharon Manion-Fleming, one of the plaintiffs, was a 23-year-old widow pursuing her bachelor of arts degree at Maryville University in Chesterfield, Mo., when she became an I.M.S. customer in 1990. **********The $169,000 she invested with I.M.S. came from an insurance settlement after her husband's death in a car accident in 1988. I.M.S., which used Consolidated as a broker for her trades, said she would get income about equal to that of the John Hancock bond fund she had been in, Ms. Manion-Fleming recalled. The stocks, Treasury bills and options in her account would be traded within the structure of an investment partnership managed by I.M.S. **********\"They said it was virtually risk-free,\" she said of the strategy outlined by I.M.S. \"I couldn't afford to lose more than 10 percent of my money, and they guaranteed in writing that no more than 10 percent of the principal could ever be lost.\" **********Gary Hamby, who, along with Mr. Ross, was a principal of I.M.S. at the time, has no telephone listing at the home address given in his regulatory record. Mr. Ross did not return telephone calls to his home. The St. Louis telephone number on file with the S.E.C. for I.M.S. is no longer in service. Even the accountants who compiled I.M.S.'s financial statements are bewildered: \"I can't find them now,\" said Jay Logsdon of Maher, Sabino & Associates in St. Louis. \"They left me holding the bag\" on some bills, too, he said. **********In January 1992, just two months after the complaint says Mr. Hamby told the plaintiffs their accounts were virtually drained, Mr. Ross was hired as a broker at Consolidated, where he remained until February 1993, according to regulatory records. Before Consolidated, Mr. Ross had been a broker at Cutter & Company of Chesterfield, Mo., for about a year and a half. Cutter also did trades for customers of I.M.S., according to the complaint. **********Ms. Manion-Fleming said that after I.M.S. had lost all but $24,000 of her money, its officers \"put together an agreement in which they promised to rebuild our accounts over a five-year period.\" Believing she would be made whole and receive monthly payments of $1,400 for 5 years, she signed a document giving I.M.S. five years to recoup her principal, in part by investing in zero-coupon bonds. \"At the time, not knowing any better, it seemed like it would work,\" she said. **********No such luck. After months went by with no payments, Ms. Manion-Fleming and the other investors hired Investors Arbitration Services, in Woodland Hills, Calif., to file their arbitration complaint. I.A.S., which advertises its investor-friendly assistance in securities arbitration in local and national media, filed the claim with the N.A.S.D. but then \"was stalling on our case and not putting much effort into it,\" she said, adding that telephone calls to the company would often go unreturned. **********In February, the investors transferred the case to a St. Louis lawyer. Word from Carol Dubow, president of I.A.S.: \"It surprises me\" that any I.A.S. customer would complain of not having calls returned. **********Ms. Manion-Fleming said their lawyer is now trying to retrieve at least part of the group's $25,000 retainer to I.A.S. -- her portion: $4,000.  But she isn't holding her breath for that, or any other restitution, after learning too many investment lessons the hard way. **********Are you involved in a dispute between a broker and an investor?

Though road building is a national frenzy, China has fewer paved roads than Depression-era America. A national highway network remains a distant dream. It is faster to move cargo along the river system or ancient canals than to use the roads. **********The burden on the highways is most apparent here, along the central highway of Hunan Province, which has become an extraordinary corridor of commerce that is opening southern China's internal market to Guangzhou, Hong Kong and the world. **********Traffic on this stretch of the highway has been backed up more than 10 miles in both directions for weeks as the Hunan Province highway authority tries to put a new surface on a treacherous stretch of potholes, dips, cuts and trenches. **********Mr. Zhou is one of three drivers who rotate shifts behind the wheel of the creaking lumber carrier. It will take them more than two days to cover the 240 miles from Jianghua in southern Hunan to the lumber mill in Changsha, the provincial capital. **********That works out to less than five miles per hour. And they have to make the trip five to six times a month. **********The long, tedious hours are punctuated by horrific collisions or furious fistfights. **********Li Xinhua, 19, is one of the traffic policemen who is supposed to bring discipline to the chaos, where tempers can flare over the loss of time and money out there on the steaming pavement. **********\"The worst is when some of the drivers get so mad they come down out of their trucks and try to beat us,\" Officer Li said. **********He talked as he commandeered the car of foreign travelers only too willing to use his authority to jump to the front of the line. It was Mr. Li's job to tell a policeman five miles ahead to stop the single lane of traffic that was moving south so the opposite lane could have a chance to start moving north again. **********This method of alternating lanes was supposed to happen every 20 minutes, but the police have no walkie-talkies, so everything depends on word of mouth passed up the line, or on couriers like Officer Li. **********Complicating matters this afternoon is that a truck carrying crushed rock has plowed into a cargo truck, igniting one vehicle's gasoline tank and creating a fire that has blocked both lanes, the one standing still and the one that was supposed to be moving. **********One of the drivers did not survive the inferno and lay on the pavement, a charred corpse. Several hundred drivers had abandoned their vehicles and their torpor to observe the grisly diversion as firefighters and policemen scurried about their work. **********The thousands of truck drivers sitting in line have created a captive market for entrepreneurial Chinese villagers who live along the highway. They have opened soda and ice cream stands, fast food shops, even brothels, to profit from the gridlock. **********Young Chinese women in frilly dresses and bows in their hair decorate the doorways of every roadside restaurant, beckoning unshaven drivers to climb down and sample their home cooking. **********But it can be risky to leave a truck unattended. **********\"The thieves come at night,\" Officer Li said. \"We have caught them stealing pigs from the pig carriers and watermelons from the melon trucks.

They included oil companies like Exxon, conglomerates like General Electric, beverage companies like Coca-Cola, long-distance phone companies like AT&T, and health-maintenance organizations like U S Healthcare. **********Stock traders said, however, that the increase in stock prices might have been exaggerated by the \"triple witching\" phenomenon that begins today with the quarterly expiration of three kinds of stock options. **********In the past, to exercise their options traders have furiously bought and sold stocks on expiration day, but they now appear to spread their activity over two or even three days. **********\"In the last couple of quarters, every time we get into this thing, we rally before it,\" said Todd Clark, managing director of equity trading at Mabon Securities. A telltale sign that triple witching played a big part in the rally was that bond prices began falling around 1:30 P.M. and stocks continued to rally later in the day, he said. **********Another sign was that on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly two stocks advanced for each one that declined, with 1,420 winning stocks and 801 losers.

A report at 10 A.M. by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, indicating little or no growth in manufacturing in its region, served to confirm the idea. **********Stock and bond traders therefore concluded that it was safe to buy stocks and bonds because there would be little chance that the Fed would raise interest rates while the economy was slowing. **********Bond prices rose sharply until the afternoon, when prices suddenly dropped, wiping out the gains of the morning. Barry Kirschner, bond trader at Chase Securities, said \"a very large seller of bonds\" entered the market at about 1 P.M. and helped to drive prices down. **********As many traders had expected, the Bundesbank, the German counterpart to the Federal Reserve, did not cut interest rates.

Although many priests and nuns died protecting the Tutsi, others, including members of the top hierarchy, collaborated in the massacres, according to reports by human rights groups. **********The Rev. William Knipe, a Maryknoll priest who has spent several decades in Kenya, said: \"The church failed so miserably in Rwanda in 1994. Many Rwandans have in a sense written off the church. It no longer has any credibility.\" **********At the end of the three-hour Mass, the Pope addressed Rwandan and Burundian refugees in French and said that he \"was close to them and shared their immense pain.\" **********\"What is happening in your countries is a terrible tragedy that must end,\" he said. \"During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. **********\"This is the only way to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and Burundi,\" the Pope said. **********The visit to Kenya was the Pope's third and last stop in Africa and it attracted the largest crowd. He began his trip in Cameroon and arrived in Kenya yesterday from South Africa. Kenyans came from all over the country, camping out in Uhuru Park, skipping school or taking the day off from work. **********Surging crowds had to be held back by policemen armed with billy clubs or on horseback. People fainted and children cried, but all was drowned out by the cheering crowd and the rhythms of an African choir. In between the Mass and the Pope's speech, children sang and danced by the altar. **********This is Pope John Paul's third trip to Kenya -- the others were in 1980 and 1985 -- and it comes at a critical time for East Africa's Catholics. Roman Catholicism came to Kenya in the 1890's, about the time Britain established a protectorate, but the church's biggest growth has occurred since independence in 1963. About 5.6 million of Kenya's 26 million people are Catholic and the country now has 19 bishops. **********The church is also one the most effective grass roots organizations in East Africa, especially in Kenya, where it retains an authority often feared by political leaders. In Kenya's rural areas, the best hospitals and schools are run by missionaries. **********The church has also delevoped a reputation as a protector of human rights, criticizing corruption and the lack of political freedoms. **********In turn, the Kenyan Government has accused certain members of the church hierarchy of supporting the opposition. The Pope met briefly with President Daniel arap Moi on Monday and Government officials attended the Mass today. **********In Rwanda and Burundi, Africa's most Catholic countries, each with a population 80 percent Catholic, ethnic killings are continuing, and priests say the biggest challenge facing the church is trying to explain to its followers how Catholics can kill Catholics by the hundreds of thousands. In Rwanda, many Catholics have either left the church completely or are converting to evangelical sects. In Kenya, missionaries estimate that about 10 to 20 percent of the country's Catholics are being led away by small Protestant denominations that are more Africanized. **********At another level, there is a fear that the ethnic killings of Rwanda could happen here as well. In Kenya, where there are at least 10 ethnic groups, tens of thousands of people have been displaced in recent years and up to a thousand have been killed in politically motivated ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley. **********\"Many of us are worried that something like Rwanda could happen here in Kenya,\" said Father Knipe, the Maryknoll priest. **********\"If we use violence to promote political ends, we're liable to catapult ourselves into massacre situations which are widespread and uncontrollable,\" the priest said. \"In Rwanda, the tribe and ethnic group took pre-eminence. What I am afraid is that the church was not adequately enculturated and Africanized.

Please let the women and children in front of you.\" **********The general said, \"In this first round we will evacuate women, children and elderly and all those who want to leave this combat area, without forcing them.\" **********He told the television, \"Srebrenica is free now,\" but added, \"There are still small groups trying to put up resistance.\" **********The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, was even more confident.  Although he promised that the captured civilians and peacekeepers were \"completely safe and secure,\" he said there was no chance that the safe area would be reconstituted, something the Security Council demanded today. \"Srebrenica is our country,\" he said from Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters near Sarajevo. **********The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, visibly distraught, demanded restoration of the safe area today as well as the resignation of Yasushi Akashi, the senior United Nations envoy in the former Yugoslavia. **********A United Nations official in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, who asked not to be identified by name, said the Bosnian Serbs \"can do pretty much what they want there now.\" **********\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand what is happening,\" the official said. \"The Serbs won a military victory and now they want to ethnically cleanse the territory they captured. The sad fact is that there isn't much we or anyone else can do about it.\" The Croats in Bosnia and the Muslims are working together in a federation. **********In addition to their military victory, the Bosnian Serbs' collection of Dutch hostages being held in Bratunac, north of Potocari, grew to 48 today; there were fears the 400 other Dutch peacekeepers at Potocari might face the same fate. Bratunac was also the destination of the male refugees who were rounded up today. **********The Bosnian Serbs now control all of Srebrenica and could easily use the peacekeepers, largely disarmed, as shields against NATO air strikes, as they did with approximately 400 other peacekeepers in late May. After that last round of NATO air strikes, some United Nations troops were held prisoner while others were surrounded and their movements restricted. **********Zepa, another designated safe area near Srebrenica, is widely believed to be the next target of the Bosnian Serbs, and fighting was reported there Tuesday night. But only sketchy information was available today; President Izetbegovic and United Nations officials could only say they had heard Bosnian Serb troops were gathering outside Zepa. **********Reports from areas of fighting have been difficult to obtain because of restrictions keeping outside journalists from the battle zones. **********As news reached Zagreb of the buses leaving Potocari, a European ambassador there said, \"This takes the U.N. one step further down the road toward concluding that it can't do the job in Bosnia safely or in the right way.\" **********The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, demanded today that the Serbs withdraw but ruled out further attacks by NATO warplanes or peacekeeping forces. **********\"We believe that in spite of the aggression, negotiation for the time being is the only way to find a solution,\" he said during a visit to Athens. \"I will do whatever ought to be done to maintain the presence of U.N. troops in former Yugoslavia, in spite of the pressure that we receive to encourage the pullout of the troops.\" **********The European Union's mediator in the former Yugoslavia, Carl Bildt, said the United Nations mission had reached a \"turning point\" but he played down the possibility of an imminent withdrawal. **********Mr. Bildt said, \"A withdrawal of the U.N. means only paving the way for a longer, a wider and a more brutal war, and I can't see really that being in the interests of anybody.\"  The United Nations sent six trucks out of Belgrade to Potocari today, loaded with 22 tons of food, water and medicine for the refugees who had not yet been moved out of the area. The Red Cross and other private groups said they were waiting for clearance from the Bosnian Serbs to enter the enclave. **********\"There is also a great need for mattresses and blankets for wounded patients,\" said Mr. Redmond, of the High Commission for Refugees. **********Red Cross representatives said they planned to take food, medical supplies, blankets and hygiene articles to refugees transported by bus and truck out of the enclave. **********The Serbs asked the United Nations to supply fuel for the evacuation of the refugees, but turned down a United Nations offer of helicopters to evacuate about 70 people who were sick and wounded, Colonel Coward said. **********Mr. Akashi, the United Nations envoy, said United Nations troops would not help to \"ethnically cleanse\" Srebrenica of its 40,000 mostly-Mulsim refugees. **********United Nations and relief officials said that splitting up the refugees would make it more difficult to track their movements, but they were able to win one concession. **********\"We have been able to negotiate to have at least one Dutch U.N. soldier on every truck to try to monitor for any human rights abuses,\" said Alexander Ivanko, a United Nations spokesman."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/28/business/people-s-choice-takeover.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People's Choice Takeover", "print_headline": "People's Choice Takeover", "body_text": " **********The People's Choice TV Corporation said today that it had agreed to acquire Preferred Entertainment Inc. in a stock swap worth about $64 million.

Mr. Botero denied the allegations, but resigned days later. **********This afternoon, the 39-year-old son of the painter Fernando Botero Sr. issued a statement in which he said, \"I confront this process with integrity and peace of mind.\" **********In a statement this evening, the President's office praised Mr. Botero's record as Defense Minister and said that \"the Government trusts that after the explanations and answers that former Minister Botero will give in the next few days\" the crisis will be resolved. **********According to an official in the Prosecutor General's office, Mr. Botero will be held for a maximum of 10 working days while prosecutors conduct their preliminary investigation into his actions in the campaign.  After that, he can either be freed or held longer if prosecutors determine there is sufficient evidence to make a case against him. **********Indications that Mr. Samper's campaign may have received money from drug traffickers first surfaced in June of 1994. In the tapes of telephone conversations, two Cali cartel leaders, Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who have since been jailed, offered to donate $3.75 million to the campaign. **********The disclosures made United States officials suspicious of Mr. Samper and relations between the two countries deteriorated. Washington exerted increasing pressure on the Colombian President to prosecute the leaders of the Cali cartel. **********Although the Colombian police have managed to put six of the cartel's seven leaders behind bars, the arrests have been overshadowed by the furor over the election campaign. **********Senior Government officials have continued to deny that any drug-related money went to the campaign, attributing the allegations to a conspiracy by drug traffickers and political enemies of Mr. Samper. They have also said that the President did not controlled the financing of his campaign. Mr. Samper himself has said that if there was any influx of drug money into the campaign it happened behind his back. **********The resignation of Mr. Botero, coupled with Mr. Medina's testimony, has led Colombians to call increasingly for the President's resignation. **********In recent days, in what is seen as an attempt to gather support for the presidency, Mr. Samper has held meetings with businessmen, union leaders and the military to call for a nationwide coalition against violence. **********But in what many took to be a sign that the Government was seriously weakened, the President acceded to calls by the military and business groups to reverse policies he had championed.

Cramer, president of Cramer & Company, a private money management firm based in New York, and an \"editor at large\" for Smart Money, praised three small companies in which his firm held substantial positions. Shortly after publication, the stocks, which are usually thinly traded, soared in value on unusually heavy trading. **********Steven Swartz, editor of Smart Money, a personal finance magazine jointly owned by Dow Jones & Company and the Hearst Corporation, said that non-staff contributors would no longer be able to write about companies that have outstanding stock worth less than $500 million and are therefore more prone to manipulation. In addition, contributors would not be allowed to write about a company in which they held more than 1 percent of the stock. **********But Mr. Swartz said that the new policy would not prevent contributors from accumulating stock before their articles were published -- or, more specifically, within the three- to four-week period between the time articles are accepted for publication and are first seen by readers. **********Though Mr. Cramer said he has not sold any of his shares since the article appeared, he did not disclose the size of his holdings in his column. He also continued to buy large numbers of shares in the companies after he had submitted the column to his editors, but before it reached readers. **********His actions raise both ethical and legal issues about the proper handling of unpublished investment advice that have plagued financial journalism for years. In some celebrated cases, financial journalists have been jailed for trading on information contained in articles before they were published. **********\"What he did is a legal form of front running,\" said Fred W. Frailey, the deputy editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, a Smart Money competitor, referring to the practice in which stock brokers buy shares ahead of their clients. \"He bought right in front of publication in grotesque quantities,\" Mr. Frailey added. **********Mr. Swartz said that he and Mr. Cramer simply underestimated the impact that the article would have. \"We'd never seen anything like this before when one of these stock doubled in price,\" he said, referring to the surge following Mr. Cramer's column. \"It surprised us.\" **********Mr. Cramer's purchases clearly violated the conflict of interest rules laid down by Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, which strictly prohibit employees of the company's publications from profiting, or even appearing to profit, from an upcoming article. **********But Mr. Swartz maintains that the policy does not apply to Mr. Cramer, who is not a Dow Jones employee and who was asked to do the column precisely because he is an active money manager, not a journalist. **********\"The reason we have Jim Cramer is because he buys stocks for a living and he is good at it,\" Mr. Swartz said. \"From the very first issue, we knew that he would be buying stocks. That is what we want him to do. But now that this has occurred, we know that we need to set some additional parameters.\" **********Mr. Swartz stressed that Mr. Cramer disclosed in his column that his firm owned shares in the companies that he was writing about and he even warned readers not to rush out and buy them. **********Mr. Swartz added that in early issues of Smart Money, which was begun with two test issues in 1992 and now has a circulation of about 550,000, the magazine routinely disclosed to readers that Mr. Cramer might hold open positions in stocks that he was writing about. It would now return to publishing that disclaimer, he said. **********Clearly surprised by the investor reaction to his column and mortified by the subsequent criticism, Mr. Cramer said in an interview that he had bought the shares as long-term investments and will not sell them anytime soon. **********Nevertheless, as manager of Cramer & Company, Mr. Cramer receives a management fee on the firm's assets and a bonus based on its performance. Even if he does not sell the shares, he stands to gain as long as their prices remain higher. **********Mr. Cramer said that he has not done anything wrong. **********\"If all I did was write a column about stocks I don't like and don't own, it wouldn't make any sense,\" he said. **********\"I said that we were a large holder,\" he added. \"I said that I bought them. I said that you shouldn't buy them if their prices run up.\" **********Mr. Cramer brings a unique perspective to his column because in addition to being a successful money manager, he also has extensive experience in journalism. He was president of the Harvard Crimson daily newspaper while an undergraduate and later worked for several newspapers and The American Lawyer magazine. He attended Harvard Law School and worked at the investment bank of Goldman, Sachs & Company before starting Cramer & Company. **********He is a regular contributor to The New Republic magazine, and last year, he and James Stewart, Smart Money's other editor at large, were nominated for a National Magazine Award for an article they wrote for Smart Money about planning for retirement. **********In his column this month, Mr. Cramer wrote about so-called orphans: stocks that may be promising but don't get covered by research analysts on Wall Street. **********\"At Cramer & Co., we love orphans,\" Mr. Cramer wrote. \"That's because if we are right, we can buy all the stock we want and wait quietly for the good news to seep out . . . .\" **********The column went on to describe four of Mr. Cramer's favorite picks, including Rexon, a maker of backup storage systems for computer networks. Between Jan. 17 and 20, the days the magazine reached subscribers, Rexon shares jumped 31 percent to $6.875 from $5.25. Volume surged from 61,300 shares on Jan. 17 to 263,600 the following day and stayed at that level for the next two days. **********According to its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cramer & Company owns 9.12 percent of Rexon's stock. In the last half of December after Mr. Cramer had filed his story, his firm acquired 165,000 shares at an average cost of about $5 per share. **********Cramer & Company also owns 9.06 percent of Canonie Environmental Services and 5.66 percent of UFP Technologies, two other stocks included in the column. Mr. Cramer says that he continued to acquire more of UFP Technologies at the end of the year in line with his general investment strategy. **********\"I bought these stocks in a consistent pattern far more aggressively before I wrote my column,\" he said. \"I'm still buying them now at their current prices. That is how much I believe in them.\" **********It is unlikely that Mr. Cramer's actions could be considered insider trading, according to Ira Lee Sorkin, former head of the New York office of the S.E.C. who is now a white-collar criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan. The question rests on wheter Mr. Cramer had a duty to disclose his holdings in the stocks that he recommended. As a writer for a general-interest publication, an argument can be made that he did not have such a legal obligation, Mr. Sorkin said. **********But the conflict still raises questions about the best way publications can make use of the market savvy of investment professionals while remaining true to readers. That is something that is heartily endorsed by Norman Pearlstine, who helped bring Mr. Cramer to Smart Money when Mr. Pearlstine was executive editor of The Wall Street Journal. He is now editor-in-chief of Time Inc. **********\"It sounds like they are doing the right thing,\"Mr. Pearlstine said of the policy change. But he still had a reservation about allowing contributors to trade before publication. **********\"It appears to me that the worst window is if you are buying and selling between the time you've written the article and the time the readers get their hands on it,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/world/in-india-us-diplomacy-is-sounding-a-lot-like-economics.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1995-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In India, U.S. Diplomacy Is Sounding a Lot Like Economics", "print_headline": "In India, U.S. Diplomacy Is Sounding a Lot Like Economics", "body_text": " **********Just hours before Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his entourage landed amid the chaos and crushing poverty of this historic trading center, the power grid for much of the area failed, plunging the homes that have electric power into darkness. **********Such failures are fairly common here. But for Mr. Rubin, the fourth American Cabinet member to visit India since the start of the year, the timing was exquisite. Each official came to persuade India's leaders that it was not in their interest to allow a slowing in the broad movement to open their economy. **********Each of the Americans has gone on to add that one early test would be to assure the completion of an American-built power plant near Bombay, one of the country's first privately constructed plants, which would help to relieve an overburdened, aging power system. But the contract, completed less than two months ago, has already run into trouble from politicians who charge that by letting American companies into a once-sealed market, India is submitting to a new form of imperialism. **********In his first trip abroad, a round-the-world tour that took him from Indonesia to Dublin, Mr. Rubin constantly found himself walking a fine line between persuading countries like India to embrace deeper reforms beloved of international investors, and not appearing to be a visiting trade negotiator demanding instant change. **********This is the kind of tough balancing act that marks the new era of American foreign policy. Now, the looming issues between the United States and India are not New Delhi's role in the nonaligned movement or its nuclear-weapons program, but the liberalization of its shallow and corrupt financial markets, its reluctance to allow private competition in the insurance business and its slowness in sweeping away choking regulations that date to the British Raj. **********To travel with Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company and a man with an uncanny ability to cut through economic obfuscation, is to witness how much the age of economic diplomacy thrusts the United States into the heart of other nations' domestic economic policies. **********In four days here, he dug into the guts of the country's changing economic structure at an extraordinary level of detail. **********Meeting with American executives in New Delhi, he debated whether the United States should push India to create a Securities and Exchange Commission. He urged Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, who has slowed the economic reform movement after a series of political setbacks, to finally allow foreign insurance companies to enter the Indian market, which has been controlled by Government-run firms. He grappled with the question of what to do about ancient taxes levied against every truckful of products that passes a state border -- both slowing the process of moving goods and increasing their cost. **********\"This is a long-term effort,\" Mr. Rubin said midway through his trip. \"We have to help build a successful society in order to build markets for American goods 10 or 15 years down the line. But we also have to be extremely respectful of what they have done, and make it clear we're certainly not meddling.\" **********Mr. Rubin repeatedly edited his speeches to remove wording that seemed to lecture India about the need for change, and when answering questions often offered what he called \"a perspective on what the markets will require.\" **********If that was the message, then it often did not translate. News accounts in Indian newspapers of Mr. Rubin's visit frequently sounded the theme of American pressure, and suggested that the demands of \"the market\" were really the demands of the United States. **********Just as Mr. Rubin arrived here, the opposition parties blocked approval of legislation in Parliament that would strengthen patent and copyright protection as required under a new world trade agreement; it was a provision Washington had pressed for vigorously. But the reality is that it would help put out of business companies here that copy American software or make knockoffs of Kellogg's corn flakes. Opponents of Mr. Rao have seized on it as evidence that he is bowing to the United States. **********When Mr. Rubin announced midway through his trip that he would have postponed his visit if he had known that Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, would be there at the same time on a state visit, the Treasury Secretary was described in the Indian press as \"displaying a petulance beyond his brief.\" **********\"Does the U.S. consider India as a banana republic?\" an Indian paper, The Hindustan Times, asked. It suggested that even though the United States is by far India's largest trading partner and source of investment, New Delhi should keep its distance, rather than follow \"America's shifting allergies and preferences, which make yesterday's friends today's foes, and vice-versa.\" **********The incident underscored the mixed emotions that the new, economically driven foreign policy has evoked. On the one hand, Indian officials say they welcome the sudden high-level attention from Washington, including two visits by Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary, focusing on the country's tremendous needs for electric power, and one by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who traveled with a small army of chief executives and used the moment to seal about $6 billion in deals. But now the pressure has come to seem a bit overwhelming. **********\"If the impression develops, and it has, that America is delving deeply into the details of India's economic policy, it will have a backlash,\" said S. L. Rao, director general of the National Council for Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. \"There has not been enough effort to show that these kinds of linkages solve the problem of health or education or poverty, and that makes them easy political targets.\" **********Mr. Rubin made that effort repeatedly, even spending a day at a World Bank site in a remote mountain area where deeply impoverished villagers are being taught how to work the land so that it retains more monsoon rainfall, increasing the harvest. But in a country only beginning to learn about international capital markets, it is far harder to make the case that reforming the workings of the Bombay stock exchange will soon help the poor. **********Even when the benefit seems obvious -- such as the power plant in Maharshita State near Bombay under construction by the Enron Corporation, Bechtel and General Electric -- political problems abound. Mr. Rao's Congress Party lost the state election last month, and in a battle that seems to have more to do with politics than electric power, the new state government has vowed to review the awarding of the contract to the American companies. **********India is hardly the only country, of course, where the United States has thrust itself into the innermost plumbing of the domestic economy. It has done so for years in Japan, seeking to sweep away hidden trade barriers. In recent months it has mandated broad, highly specific rules for Mexico -- down to what its trade balances should look like and what its interest-rate policy should be -- as the price that country must pay for a $20 billion bailout. **********But both those cases involve large trading partners, in which the United States holds a tremendous economic stake. India, in comparison, is tiny, attracting a scant $1.6 billion of American investment in 1992 and 1993, the last years for which there are reliable figures. Over the same period, American companies invested seven times more in China, and six times more in Thailand, a country of only 20 million, compared with 900 million in India. **********Mr. Rubin and other American officials say they are being motivated by the experience in China, where the United States waited too long, let too many competitors enter the market first, and then engaged too late in long battles with the Chinese to end market practices that discriminated against foreign companies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/business/company-news-roadway-services-to-spin-off-trucking-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROADWAY SERVICES TO SPIN OFF TRUCKING UNIT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ROADWAY SERVICES TO SPIN OFF TRUCKING UNIT", "body_text": " **********Roadway Services Inc. of Akron, Ohio, said yesterday that it would spin off its Roadway Express trucking unit into a separate publicly traded company.

Baum, a retailing analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********J. C. Penney said yesterday that same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, hopped 14.4 percent higher, and the May Department Stores Company reported a 9.2 percent jump in same-store sales at its department stores. **********Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and Burdines, posted a 7.4 percent increase in same-store sales, and the Gap Inc., whose same-store sales have hovered in the low single digits for months on end, reported a 7 percent rise in same-store sales last month. Those companies and others slashed prices last month in an effort to clean up bloated inventories left over from weak holiday sales. **********Retail industry analysts consider same-store, or comparable-store, sales figures the best measure of a retailer's performance because they factor out sales from new stores that are not necessarily comparable. **********Two large retailing companies had disappointing sales in January. The Limited Inc. said its same-store sales fell 5 percent from January 1994 in spite of its efforts to clear out fall and winter merchandise, and the Woolworth Corporation reported a 3 percent decline in same-store sales. **********Goldman's Composite Comparable-Store Sales Index, a weighted average of the same-store sales of 49 retail chains, climbed 4.7 percent last month compared with 3.5 percent in January 1994 and in the same range as gains retailers have posted every month since September. A similar index compiled by Salomon Brothers using sales data from 22 retailers showed a 6.1 percent increase. **********Retail companies have usually used January to clear out the mistakes they made in merchandising for the holiday sales season, which is the peak sales season of their fiscal year. Only 5 percent of their annual sales come in January, and the month usually represents 15 to 20 percent of their fourth-quarter volume. Most retailers' fourth quarters run from November through January. **********\"January is what January is: a clearance month that really doesn't tell you much,\" said Robert F. Buchanan, a retailing analyst at NatWest Securities. \"February is going to give us a better indication of what trends look like.\" **********Mr. Buchanan and other analysts said that several retailers had reported strong sales of early spring merchandise that they began to put out toward the middle of the month. **********Mervyn's, the Dayton Hudson Corporation's long-troubled discount department store chain, had an 11.6 percent increase in same-store sales last month, in part because of good sales of spring merchandise. Talbots Inc., a women's specialty store chain that had a 5.5 percent increase in same-store sales, reported similar gains. **********But analysts cautioned against reading much optimism into those reports. The muddy picture of the overall economy, with some indicators portending solid consumer spending ahead and others pointing to a slowdown, has made many hesitate to forecast the year yet. **********Many analysts expect 1995 to be a tough year for retail companies, as higher interest rates eat into discretionary income. Real wage growth is slowing, housing sales have been slowing and installment credit is reaching a level that many economists consider unsustainable. **********\"Year-over-year growth in consumer spending is going to slow in 1995,\" Mr. Baum said. \"That said, the retail stocks may be finished with their period of underperformance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/24/business/is-organized-crime-back-at-the-table.html": {"writer_name": "Barry Meier", "pub_date": "1995-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Is Organized Crime Back at the Table?", "print_headline": "Is Organized Crime Back at the Table?", "body_text": " **********Just a few steps from the Cafe du Monde, a popular tourist spot here, is Frank's, a casual, Italian-style restaurant that not long ago caught the eye of a different class of sightseer -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********The restaurant's habitues included some intriguing characters with nicknames like Noogie, Mr. A and Muffaletta Frank. And their table talk was not limited to food. Based largely on F.B.I. surveillance, Federal prosecutors won indictments last year of 17 suspected members or associates of the Marcello crime family here and the Genovese and Gambino families in New York. **********Among other things, the 17 are accused of controlling a distributor of video poker machines and draining millions from the machines' manufacturer, Bally Gaming International Inc. All of those indicted have denied wrongdoing and say they have no ties to organized crime. **********For their part, prosecutors say the scheme is a case study of how the mob is trying to take its place again at the nation's gambling tables. As sketched out in documents from regulatory hearings and bankruptcy filings and in search warrants, wiretapped conversations and the indictments themselves, it is a story of sour deals, greedy hustlers and terrified corporate executives that also raises questions about Bally Gaming's actions in the case. **********The gambling industry has long been trying to shed its image as a mob-controlled domain for one in which publicly traded companies like Bally Gaming operate under regulatory scrutiny. Experts agree that the vast majority of gambling companies are now free of criminal influence. **********But as more states race to open casinos, cracks may also be opening in the licensing and hiring process. Federal and state investigations in places as far apart as California and Minnesota suggest that organized criminals and other questionable operators may already have a foothold. **********\"You have a proliferation of gaming, which makes it ripe for a takeover by organized crime,\" said Wilmore W. Whitmore, president of the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation, a state regulatory board. **********Bally Gaming is still reeling from its experience in Louisiana. The company, based in Las Vegas, Nev., makes a variety of gambling equipment. Originally a unit of the Bally Entertainment Corporation, a casino operator, it was spun off in 1992. **********Bally Gaming's troubles here grew out of a brief marriage of convenience that began in 1991, when it came looking for a local distributor to break into a lucrative new market. Prosecutors say that those lurking behind the company it found, Worldwide Gaming, were simply looking for a mark. **********By the time the marriage unraveled in 1993, Bally Gaming says it was out about $18 million and Worldwide was in bankruptcy. **********Because Worldwide was a start-up, Bally Gaming bankrolled its entire business and also lent it money to finance truck stop owners and others who wanted to lease or buy the company's machines. But Worldwide repaid little to Bally Gaming. A key reason was that payments collected from the machine operators by a company related to Worldwide were skimmed by the same mob figures who were behind the distributor, prosecutors have charged. **********Views differ sharply, however, over whether Bally Gaming was an innocent victim or a victim of its own making. Some critics have questioned whether the company, in its haste to cash in on a gambling gold rush, overlooked or brushed aside warning signals. **********Daniel Horgan, a lawyer for Bally Gaming, said that company executives did everything they could at the time to uncover problems at Worldwide and root them out. \"Everything looks different with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight,\" he said. **********But Mr. Whitmore, the state regulator, has his doubts, suggesting that organized crime figures may have found the perfect victim in Bally Gaming. \"These guys probably couldn't believe it,\" he said. \"They didn't even have to reach into their own pockets.\" **********In January, a few weeks after an article appeared in The Times-Picayune of New Orleans questioning Bally Gaming's actions, Mr. Whitmore denied the company a permit to sell equipment to the giant Harrah's casino being built here, saying that Bally Gaming had allowed itself to be \"infiltrated\" by organized crime. He was overruled, however, by the full board. The board agreed with prosecutors, who described Bally Gaming as blameless, and it issued a temporary permit. **********A fuller picture of the company's role is certain to emerge this fall, when those indicted go to trial. **********The episode's roots stretch back to the passage in September 1991 of legislation that soon put video-poker machines in every bar and truck stop from New Orleans to Baton Rouge and beyond. Gambling-equipment manufacturers viewed the state as a bonanza, but the catch was that they would be required to operate through a local distributor. **********The legislation also apparently posed a challenge to suspected members of the Marcello crime family, which had been active in gambling.  To get into the new video-poker market, Anthony (Mr. A) Carollo, the family's reputed acting head, and his aide, Frank (Muffaletta Frank) Gagliano, needed to take control of a distributor run by seemingly legitimate front men to avoid the scrutiny of regulators, according to last year's indictments, which named both men. **********That company was Worldwide Gaming, whose president was Steven R. Bolson, a lawyer who had worked for several Atlantic City casinos, and whose vice president was Christopher J. Tanfield, a concert promoter. With the help of Mr. Bolson's contacts, Worldwide became a distributor for Bally Gaming in late 1991. By mid-1992, it graduated to exclusive distributor after bringing in an order for 2,000 machines. **********But even before that pact was completed, a warning sign had appeared. In early 1992, The Village Voice published an article that linked Mr. Tanfield with Eugene (Noogie) Gilpin, a reputed associate of the Genovese crime family who was also named in last year's indictments. Mr. Tanfield abruptly resigned from Worldwide Gaming, but stayed on as a consultant. Executives of Bally Entertainment, then in the process of spinning off Bally Gaming, say they looked into the newspaper's allegation but found no support for it. **********They may not have looked hard enough. Federal investigators, who stumbled onto Worldwide as a result of a run-of-the-mill bookmaking inquiry, later maintained that Mr. Tanfield was an associate of both the Genovese and Gambino families. In a recent interview, Mr. Tanfield, who was also indicted and who denies the charges, said that no one from Bally Entertainment or Bally Gaming asked him about the article until November 1992. **********By then, Bally Gaming executives were wondering how they got involved with him and others at Worldwide and how they could get out. \"It's all fraudulent,\" John Garner, Bally Gaming's controller, told Jamie Perdiago, an outside lawyer for the company, in a wiretapped conversation cited in court documents. **********Meanwhile, those later indicted in the case were keeping busy. Mr. Gilpin and others flew in from New York for discussions with Mr. Carollo. And Mr. Tanfield, for one, wildly boasted of future success, court papers indicate. **********\"I got as much clout as you need, anything you need,\" he proclaimed in a wiretapped conversation with a Government informant. \"I got the Governor, I got the Senate, I got the Congressmen, I got the legislatures and I got the streets.\" **********Events at Worldwide, however, were of increasing concern to Bally Gaming. When its representatives visited the distributor, they found that money was being lent to those leasing equipment without proper liens being placed on the machines, Mr. Perdiago, the lawyer for Bally Gaming, recently testified at regulatory hearings. **********\"Chris Tanfield had a saying that was really accurate,\" said Mr. Perdiago, who had been retained by Bally Gaming to monitor Worldwide.\"It was like they were driving down the highway with a grocery bag of hundred-dollar bills and the windows were down.\" **********Suspicious-looking individuals also hung around Worldwide's office in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie and Bally Gaming executives did not relish run-ins with them. Jerry Flynn, a former executive who was sent to investigate problems at Worldwide, was terrified of Felix A. Riggio 3d, who ran the company close to Worldwide that collected money from the bars and truck stops. **********\"He would even run out of the room, run out of Worldwide, you know, out the back door when Riggio came in the front door,\" Mr. Perdiago testified. Mr. Riggio was also among those indicted. **********By the end of 1992, Bally Gaming executives recognized that Worldwide represented a potential catastrophe. In a wiretapped conversation, Mr. Garner, the controller, told Mr. Perdiago, \"This pig is getting sloppier and sloppier,\" court papers indicate. He also related how he had told another man to go \"perfume this pig\" before the auditors arrived, according to the court papers. **********Mr. Horgan, the Bally Gaming lawyer, said that Mr. Garner was just using a \"colorful choice of words\" and was not covering anything up. Arthur Lemann 3d, a lawyer who represents Mr. Carollo, said that he intended to show at trial that Bally Gaming controlled the activities of its distributor, a contention that Mr. Horgan rejected. **********Following an inquiry by a private investigator, Bally Gaming demanded in November 1992 that Worldwide end its association with Mr. Tanfield and several others. It clearly hoped to salvage its investment and keep Worldwide afloat. **********That would prove to be wishful thinking. By then, Mr. Bolson, Worldwide's president, knew that the company was controlled by organized crime, according to a plea agreement he entered last year. **********Finally, in May 1993, Bally Gaming dropped Worldwide, and the distributor immediately filed for bankruptcy-law protection. A year later, a Federal grand jury handed up its indictments. **********Separately, in plea agreements, Mr. Bolson acknowledged that he helped conceal those controlling Worldwide, and Alan Maiss, a former president of Bally Gaming, pleaded guilty in January to charges of failing to tell regulators that Mr. Tanfield did not have a gambling license. Mr. Bolson and Mr. Maiss are cooperating with the Government. **********Bally Gaming must still pass muster for a final permit here. And it may even lose its name. Bally Entertainment, which licenses the name to its spinoff, said it was thinking about taking it back because of the Louisiana debacle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-old-name-is-new-for-north-castle.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Old Name Is New For North Castle", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Old Name Is New For North Castle", "body_text": " **********Rotando Partners in Stamford, Conn., is returning to its roots by reverting to its original name, North Castle Partners, after a string of name changes in the last four years. **********The agency, with billings estimated at $130 million from clients like Ocean Spray and Days Inns, changed names from North Castle to Rotando Lerch & Iafeliece in August 1991, then to Rotando Partners in October 1993.

Almost all of them bear the name of an ethnic Tutsi party whose agenda is ethnic cleansing of Hutu. **********As political violence has spread through this tiny nation just south of Rwanda for the last 18 months, life for the more than 1,000 students at this school has increasingly become a tense standoff. **********Two weeks ago, after an argument in one of the dormitories, Tutsi barricaded a staircase, threw a grenade into an area where Hutu students slept, and attacked them with knives and clubs. One Hutu student was killed and more than a dozen were injured as they jumped out of a third floor window. **********The school has tried to defuse tensions. But no one has been arrested for the attack, and many of the Hutu have refused to sleep at the school and some have stopped going to classes. **********The secondary school in Bujumbura, the capital, is a microcosm of Burundi, a country caught in an cycle of violence. Like Rwanda, Burundi is about 80 percent Hutu and 14 percent Tutsi, with about 5 percent belonging to smaller groups. Like Rwanda, Burundi has had years of growing ethnic violence. **********But in Burundi, with the Government headed by Hutu and the army led by Tutsi, a fragile balance of power has been maintained. **********None of the students interviewed in Bujumbura were willing to give their last names. Members of each group blamed the other for instigating violence. And within an hour of meeting with two foreign journalists, the principal, Hassan Bahendwa, received an anonymous letter accusing him of siding with the Hutu and threatening to kill him. **********\"Fear is everywhere here,\" said Mr. Bahendwa. \"It is the politicians that create this hatred. We can have weapons searches in the school. We can try to explain to the students that it is not worth killing your friend. But it is first and foremost a psychological question. We have to first make people feel safe. And no one here does.\" **********Mr. Bahendwa said that he worries about being killed. \"But what can I do?\" he said \"I will not be the first to be killed in Burundi.\" **********Hutu gained control of the Government two years ago for the first time since independence in 1962, and a military coup attempt in October 1993 triggered killing on both sides. More than 100,000 people have been killed in ethnic violence since then. The Government has been paralyzed by violence on both sides, who have armed militias and youth gangs. **********\"There are no good guys or bad guys -- just gray hats,\" said a Western diplomat in Bujumbura. \"Some are just more stained with blood than others.\" **********The roots of this ethnic hatred are deep. The Hutu majority have always resented the disproportionate numbers of Tutsi in the Civil Service and the university. Most Hutu remain poor farmers. **********In 1972, the Tutsi turned on the Hutu, killing tens of thousands of people, including almost all the educated Hutu. For years afterward, many Hutu were so fearful that they did not send their children to school, and they left their homes unimproved and walked instead of riding bicycles to avoid provoking jealousy.  After Hutu won the 1993 elections, many felt they finally had the power a majority deserved. But the violence has made both ethnic groups feel vulnerable. **********\"It is a balance of fear,\" said Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi who became President in a military coup in 1987 but lost the 1993 election. \"There is violence; there is intimidation; there is uncertainty for the future. It will be a long process to bring back trust and confidence.\" **********The current President, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, says the military must integrate Hutu into its ranks and that youths must ignore the militants' call to arms. **********\"There is a deep chasm between the worries of the population and what politicians say,\" said Mr. Ntibantunganya. \"It is very dangerous.\" **********Meanwhile, Tutsi have left their farms and moved into the towns. Most of Bujumbura is Tutsi-controlled, except for Hutu ghettos that Tutsi do not dare enter. The city has a dusk-to-dawn curfew. **********The main markets are patrolled by Tutsi youth gangs. Hutu farmers quickly leave the city as soon as the markets close. **********At the Bujumbura secondary school, the violence began just after the 1993 coup attempt. Oscar Raymond, a 25-year-old Hutu student who refused to give his last name, said Tutsi students attacked Hutu, burning their books and clothes. For a year, the Hutu students stayed away, returning only last fall. **********\"If it continues like this our country will become ashes,\" Oscar Raymond said. \"We have become animals here in Burundi.

Analysts said the delay could hurt competitors nearly as much as it did Nintendo, because consumers may put off buying any machine until the Ultra 64 becomes available. 34."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/12/business/l-a-vow-of-poverty-for-doctors-917295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Vow of Poverty for Doctors?", "print_headline": "A Vow of Poverty for Doctors?", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Regarding \"A Hospital Copes With a New Order\" (Jan. 29), a major point is consistently overlooked in the discussion about health care costs is the salaries and fees we pay to the professionals.

Mr. Meyer is a longtime ally of Michael Ovitz, the chairman of Creative Artists, who himself was nearly lured to MCA several weeks ago. And Doug Morris, who ran Warner Music's record labels until he was dismissed by Time Warner management last month, will go to MCA to start his own record label, according to people familiar with those talks. **********Mr. Meyer, who is 50, will become president of MCA, replacing Sidney J. Sheinberg, 60, who has been given a deal to produce movies for MCA's Universal Studios. **********As part of the changes, Lew R. Wasserman, the 82-year-old longtime chairman of MCA, will soon step down and serve as chairman emeritus, an honorary post, industry executives said. It was unclear whether Mr. Meyer would run MCA outright, or serve under a replacement for Mr. Wasserman. **********The hiring of Mr. Meyer was viewed across Hollywood as something of a coup. Still, insiders do not believe that he has the influence or vision of Mr. Ovitz. By all accounts Mr. Ovitz not only supported Mr. Meyer's decision to leave the agency but encouraged it. By tonight, there was renewed speculation that with Mr. Meyer at MCA, Mr. Ovitz could himself renegotiate with Mr. Bronfman for the top job there. **********Mr. Bronfman is hiring Mr. Morris soon after his departure from Time Warner. Mr. Morris, who is 56, will start a record label at MCA; he and MCA will each own half of it.  [ A contract dispute between Time Warner and Mr. Morris following his dismissal provides a rare glimpse of the highly lucrative deals a music executive can earn. Page D7. ] **********MCA Records, headed by Al Teller, has among its properties Geffen Records, the label that David Geffen sold to MCA in 1989. Dreamworks, in which Mr. Geffen is a participant, has said it plans to start a new record label, headed by Mr. Geffen, in association with MCA. **********At Warner, Mr. Morris was a strong proponent of the type of music known as gangsta rap, a passion that landed Time Warner in hot water politically. But under Mr. Morris, Warner had nearly a 22 percent share of the entire domestic music market, leading the industry.   The talks between Mr. Meyer and Mr. Bronfman, who is the chairman of the Seagram Company, MCA's new owner, began in the last week or so over an informal dinner, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Mr. Bronfman indicated an interest in Mr. Meyer, but said he doubted that Mr. Meyer would go to MCA because he was so close to Mr. Ovitz. Mr. Meyer then expressed interest in hearing more about the job. The talks picked up from there. **********Mr. Meyer is a popular figure in Hollywood, a former Marine with a low-key and friendly style, in contrast to the more formidable Mr. Ovitz. His appeal for Mr. Bronfman was based on his relationships with top stars, directors and writers. **********A founder of Creative Artists in 1975 with Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Meyer has represented movie stars like Michael Douglas, Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Tom Cruise, Barbra Streisand, Jessica Lange and Whoopi Goldberg. He has also run the day-to-day operations of Creative Artists and is Mr. Ovitz's closest associate. **********Last month, talks between Mr. Bronfman and Mr. Ovitz broke down, partly over financial issues but also because of his ambivalence about leaving his job as Hollywood's most powerful talent agent. **********Mr. Meyer's departure from Creative Artists is expected to ripple across the normally stable talent agency. Who will replace Mr. Meyer, and who will represent his high-profile clients who earn millions of dollars for each picture, is unclear. **********The MCA job will test Mr. Meyer's ability to take on projects and maintain a steady flow of profitable film and television shows. And the fate of Thomas Pollock, who ran the movie side of MCA, as well as that of other top executives at that company, is also unclear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/business/company-news-137295.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1995-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 457, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;", "body_text": " **********An Italian eyewear maker, Luxottica Group S.p.A., yesterday made an unsolicited offer of $24 a share, or $1.12 billion, for the U.S. Shoe Group, the parent of Lenscrafters, the nation's largest retail optical chain. **********Shares of U.S. Shoe surged $5.375 yesterday, to $24.125, a new 52-week high, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Because the shares closed slightly above the price of the offer, industry analysts and shareholders said Luxottica would probably have to sweeten its bid for U.S. Shoe, possibly to as high as $28 a share.

Scott F. O'Grady, had been on the move stealthily in hilly woodlands for six nights before his guarded radio signals allowed rescuers to verify his survival and home in. **********\"This is Basher-52,\" the 29-year-old combat pilot announced from hiding, using his code name in a rescue plea monitored by NATO officials. \"I'm alive and I need help.\" **********Four helicopters and two jet fighters ultimately arrived in response. Captain O'Grady was jubilantly yanked into a helicopter in a drill-perfect two-minute operation after a score of marines leapt down onto Bosnia's soil to secure the ground for his rescue. **********\"I'm good but I'm ready to get the hell out of here,\" the captain told his rescuers, according to Adm. Leighton Smith, commander of NATO forces in southern Europe. Admiral Smith was beaming as he described how the United States converted the embarrassment of the Bosnian Serbs' downing of Captain O'Grady's F-16C jet last week into a rare moment of exultation in the lethal, grinding conflict. **********\"He is an American hero,\" President Clinton declared in celebrating a bit of positive news from the protracted Bosnian debate, in which critics have increasingly accused the Administration of policy drift and failure. **********Officials said the rescue operation succeeded with no American casualties but left some bullet-pocking on the rotors of one of the helicopters that shepherded Captain O'Grady to safety aboard the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge in the Adriatic. **********The story of the rescue, reconstructed here from narratives offered in official military briefings and interviews on both sides of the Atlantic, put the Kearsarge at the heart of the operation. **********The ship had moved closer to shore as 40 aircraft hovered in separate parts of the mission, apparently prepared to offer defensive fire in case of heavy resistance from the Bosnian Serbs. **********The rescue opportunity arose Tuesday when the first signals were picked up as non-voice radio beacon signals that were part of the Captain's survival kit. **********His identity was confirmed on his backup voice radio in a contact early today by one of his fellow flyers from the Americans' base in Aviano, Italy. They had been deliberately sent up in the search because they could recognize his voice and be less subject to tricks by hostile forces. **********From that moment of certain identity, at 2:08 in the Bosnian morning, it took American military officials less than five hours to plan and carry out the risky daylight rescue that culminated when Captain O'Grady sent up a smoke flare from hiding and darted from the woods with a pistol in hand and deliverance in mind. **********His rescue, at 6:44 A.M in Bosnia (it was 12:44 A.M. in Washington), was instantly relayed to an anxious President Clinton by Anthony Lake, his national security adviser, who White House officials said tersely reported, \"Got 'im!\" **********Beyond the deliverance of the pilot, the operation was fraught with policy and strategic risks. **********At one point an American officer, fearful that the rescue craft would be fired on, requested permission to fire a missile at a Serbian radar installation tracking the mission from Serb-held territory in Croatia, according to American officials. **********Permission was denied, and the rescue proceeded safely to its joyful conclusion on the Kearsarge. Captain O'Grady was found to be slightly dehydrated and undernourished, with only a slight burn on his neck. But he was in good shape for a pilot who friends described as an avid insect-eater in his military survival courses. **********\"It won't be very soon that I'll forget the look on his face as he approached the helicopter this morning,\" said Col. Martin Berndt, who hauled the pilot onto his CH-53 Sea Stallion assault helicopter after Captain O'Grady had directed his rescuers to an open field near his hiding place, some 60 miles inland from the Adriatic. **********The captain's fate had been unknown since his jet-fighter was cut in two by a Serbian missile over Bosnia last Friday. No parachute was seen as the cockpit section went down through a cloud bank. The broken craft was tumbling, Pentagon officials said today, as Captain O'Grady reached down, tugged the ejection lanyard and exploded out to parachute down into Serb-held territory. **********There was no detailed description immediately of how he survived in the sparsely populated pinelands, but Pentagon officials said he stayed in hiding by day, moved about evasively at night and husbanded the batteries of his survival-kit radio. **********Back home, the family of the Brooklyn native maintained a vigil with telephone calls to his base commanders in Italy. They said they did not lose confidence in the efforts by the Air Force to find Scott, although some began pleading in recent days that military officials send in troops to conduct a search on the ground. **********\"I just couldn't understand why we just couldn't send in commando teams,\" said Captain O'Grady's brother, Paul, a 25-year-old dental student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. \"I mean, I could understand because it's such a heavily armed area with enemy fire down there. But it's your brother. You want them to go in and get him.\" **********The pilot's mother, Mary Lou Scardapane, said family members were braced for a tragic ending when they called military officers to check unconfirmed reports that he might have been captured. **********\"They said, 'Your boy is out there somewhere,' \" she related. **********In Italy, his wingmates in the 555th and 510th squadrons were reported no less anxious as they took part in repeated flyover searches of Bosnia for some scrap or signal of his fate. **********It was Captain T. O. Hanford, a pilot from the \"Five and Dime\" -- the 510th -- who first verified that the guarded messages suddenly heard from somewhere below were in the voice of his colleague, Captain O'Grady. **********Captain Hanford, protecting against some sort of Serbian trap, warily engaged the speaker in what military officials described as \"old friend stories\" to authenticate the missing pilot. **********Celebrating the survival, Admiral Smith, the NATO officer, sounded amazed as he told how Captain O'Grady suffered only a minor neck burn in ejecting from the stricken aircraft. **********\"That gentleman survived one tremendous ride out of that airplane,\" the admiral said at a London briefing. \"That cockpit was tumbling. So he was very lucky to have gotten out of that thing.\" **********The admiral said that while official announcements were minimized about the fate of the pilot, \"We were constantly searching for him, and I think he knew that.\" **********Captain O'Grady's survival kit was equipped with a sophisticated beacon that Pentagon officials said could transmit his precise position with a radio signal compressed into a short burst. **********Pentagon officials said he was cautious in using either the beacon or his voice radio, a comparatively primitive model that can easily be intercepted by hostile listeners. During the Persian Gulf war, Iraqi forces pinpointed the location of downed airmen by tracing their radio transmissions. **********At his rescue, Captain O'Grady guided the helicopters within 50 yards of his wooded, hilltop hiding place. Marine Corps Gen. Terry Murray, speaking at a Pentagon briefing, offered a cogent summary of the scene. \"No fire going in; recovered the pilot,\" he said. **********\"The Marines exited the plane and secured the ground,\" he continued, referring to the plain fact of American military forces actually venturing, however briefly, onto Bosnian soil -- a possibility feared by many involved in the policy debate in Washington over what to do in and about Bosnia. **********\"Captain O'Grady ran out of the woods, helmet on, flight jacket, pistol in hand, and he was quite pleased to climb on the 53,\" General Murray concluded. **********As news of the rescue was flashed around the world, some representatives of the Bosnian Serbs contended that the rescue mission had not been a surprise. They claimed that Bosnian Serb forces tracking the mission on radar had let it go forward for \"humanitarian\" purposes rather intercepting it and creating a far larger confrontation with the United States. **********The White House gave no such credit to the Serbs. The President's spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, noted that the Bosnian Serbs had previously claimed to have captured the pilot and that this proved \"consistent with the outrageous behavior we see from the Serbs throughout the Bosnian conflict.\" **********Mr. McCurry jubilantly summarized the overnight operation with a flourish, reporting that the President and Mr. Lake lit up victory cigars in the early morning dark on the Truman balcony. But the earlier hours of anxiety were clear in the minute by minute details of the operation offered by Pentagon and NATO officials. **********At 2:15 A.M., an AC-130 gunship code-named Ghost 45 confirmed over Bosnia that the unexpected transmission seven minutes earlier had indeed come from Captain O'Grady. Aboard a circling Awacs intelligence gathering plane, officers reported back to their command that the pilot's condition was good, but added, \"He really needs to get out tonight and radio getting weak.\" **********The message of the captain's survival and wily evasiveness in Bosnia was relayed to Admiral Smith in London, according to one official, in the starkest sort of bulletin: \"Basher-52 just checked in.\" **********The Admiral, a NATO colleague said, bolted to attention as \"every nerve in his body stood up.\" Executive options were measured. An order to go in with a full \"TRAP\" -- Tactical Recovery of Aircraft or Personnel -- was soon issued. About four dozen Marines sleeping aboard the Kearsarge were roused from their racks and prepared for the dawn raid. **********At 6:07 A.M., as morning light spread across the Bosnian battle zone, EA6B and EF-111 \"jammers\" -- planes specially designed for electronic warfare -- began intense interference of all radar and communications in the area to foil Bosnian Serb tracking. Six minutes later, one of the planes reported ground contact with Captain O'Grady. **********Across the border, in a Serb-held area of Croatia, a radar system began monitoring air activity over Bosnia. The radar site in Knin, code-named Giraffe, was turned on at 6:21 A.M., according to a NATO chronology which made it ominously plain that, if the Serbs had been initially surprised by the raid, they were in the dark no longer. **********Two helicopters filled with the marines landed 20 minutes later near the captain's lookout, as yellow signal smoke led the way down. The ramp of one copter was jammed shut by a tree stump, leaving half the marines sent on the mission stranded inside, as a score of marines leapt from the other to take up cover positions on the ground. **********Above them hovered two AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters, gunships bristling at the ready. A step above this force, two AV-8 Harrier jump jets patrolled nearby skies tightly, ready with even heavier firepower. **********At 6:44 the fugitive pilot emerged from the treeline and was picked up, pulled through the cockpit opening of the nearest copter, the one with the jammed door, and delivered firmly into the hands of Colonel Berndt. **********The pilot was whisked aloft and covered with a blanket and soon was devouring emergency rations. In the trip back, rescuers took note of a ground-to-air missile that missed the convoy and some machine-gun fire that grazed a helicopter rotor without effect. **********It was on this leg that the radar monitoring of \"possible\" tracking by Bosnian Serb missile installations became troubling, according to NATO officers. At 6:58, an officer aboard one of the EA-6B jammers recommended that NATO forces destroy the radar base at Knin. **********The request was rebuffed by senior officers, according to a NATO official. The tactic was deemed unnecessary as well as a potentially dangerous escalation of the confrontation with the Bosnian Serbs at a time when they were still holding United Nations troops hostage. **********At 7:07, one of the helicopters reported the launch of a shoulder-fired missile. It missed. **********Through most of this, the O'Grady family waited unknowing in America. **********\"The hardest thing is, the truth is out there, but you don't know what it is and you have no control whatsoever,\" the pilot's sister, Stacy, 26, said about the six days the family spent waiting for some word. \"It's really frustrating. You can't do anything. But at the same time, you're his family and the ones that love Scott the most.\" **********At 12:48 this morning, the telephone rang at the home of Dr. William O'Grady, the pilot's father, a radiologist in Alexandria, Va. \"I figured it was my brother or just a relative,\" Dr. O'Grady said. Instead it was a military officer with news. **********\"He said that they had radio contact with him and that he was alive,\" said Dr. O'Grady, 56, who hurried to awaken Stacy and Paul to tell them. \"We started jumping up and down and yelling.\" **********At that point, the O'Gradys believed Scott was still on the ground in Bosnia. But Dr. O'Grady did not feel anxious. \"They were going in, and I knew they were going to get him,\" he said. **********A short time later, they are not sure of the time, they got a call with confirmation that Scott O'Grady was back safe in friendly hands. Shortly before 1 A.M., President Clinton was on the line. He found the family \"full of joy and pride and gratitude,\" Mr. Clinton said later at the White House where he celebrated the pilot's return. **********\"Our country has the finest armed forces in the world and we are very, very proud of them and ecstatically happy today,\" the President declared, enjoying a respite on common patriotic ground despite the debate over Bosnia. **********Exclaiming over Captain O'Grady, President Clinton obviously was making further plans for Washington congratulations and attention over \"an astonishing story.\" **********Dr. O'Grady said he simply wanted to kiss his son when he comes all the way home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/06/business/key-rates-347295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/07/business/company-news-executive-appointments-announced-by-the-times.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 405, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Appointments Announced by The Times", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Executive Appointments Announced by The Times", "body_text": " **********The New York Times announced a series of appointments yesterday in a management realignment affecting the newspaper's advertising, circulation, operations and human resources departments. **********The appointments were announced by Russell T.

Companies have taken steps to protect confidentiality, by creating separate files for medical records, developing privacy rules and hiring outside vendors to run their primary-care clinics. Nonetheless, breaches occur. **********Stephanie Evans, director of health care advocacy at the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said she handled a number of cases in the last year in which employees found out from a company doctor that they were H.I.V. positive and experienced workplace problems as a result. **********In one case, at a pharmaceutical company, people in the medical department apparently overheard conversations about a manager's condition and told his co-workers. In another, involving a manager at a large cosmetics company, the information somehow got back to a supervisor, who pressured the manager to leave on disability, Ms. Evans said. **********For all these reasons, many health and privacy experts say, employees have to think hard about when to take advantage of the affordable care that companies offer. **********Company medical departments, like any other medical service, also face varying perceptions about quality. When Gary Towler, an auto worker at a Ford Motor Company plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., needed a doctor's certification last year to go on disability for a work-related wrist injury, his saw his own doctor instead of the company's. **********\"The medical service is not highly thought of\" at his plant, he said. \"It's there, but it's a last resort really.\" **********Mr. Towler also said the company doctor's hours were not convenient for him because he works the night shift and there is no doctor at the plant from midnight until 6 A.M. **********Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said company doctors were intended for a limited purpose: to treat only conditions that occur on the job. All other types of injuries and illnesses should be handled by an employee's own doctor, he said. Jennifer Flake, a spokeswoman for Ford, said, \"We're proud of the quality of service provided by our physicians companywide.\" **********Many satisfied employees also defend their companies' medical departments. Linda Cowart, a personnel assistant at the Union Camp Corporation in Savannah, Ga., credits a company doctor with saving her life. For more than a year, Ms. Cowart had been to various private physicians complaining of vertigo. One doctor said that it was inner ear trouble, another that she had fluid in her sinuses. Late last year, a Union Camp doctor sent Ms. Cowart for a brain scan that showed she had a benign tumor. She had it removed three days later and has since made a complete recovery. **********WHATEVER employees think of the quality of their companies' care, another important issue is confidentiality. Alan F. Westin, publisher of Privacy and American Business, a quarterly newsletter, said employees should be aware of the economic relationship between the doctor and the company. \"Anybody who uses a company physician in the assumption that person can be as absolutely respectful of confidentiality as an outside person is foolish,\" he said. **********A crazy quilt of Federal, state and court-made rules governs confidentiality, said Craig M. Cornish, a privacy lawyer in Colorado Springs. Medical ethics rules say doctors may tell management only whether a person is fit to work, and may not disclose diagnoses or other details. Some states have adopted the physician-patient privilege, so that doctors usually cannot divulge anything learned in an examination without first getting a waiver from the patient -- as they might, for example, for pre-employment physicals and workers' compensation exams. At the opposite extreme are state court decisions finding that when the company requires an exam by its own doctor, there is no physician-patient privilege. **********Companies can calm employee nerves by clarifying policies and procedures, said Mr. Westin, who advises businesses about privacy issues. That way, he said, employees won't \"view the doctor as a company espionage agent.\" He added that current technology enabled businesses to use bulletproof security systems that keep medical records separate from personnel files. **********But even with such safeguards, medical records in the aggregate \"may come back to haunt you,\" said Mark A. Rothstein, professor of law and director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston. Benefits departments that administer or oversee company medical plans sometimes have access to data that show -- without disclosing names -- how many employees and dependents have submitted claims related to AIDS, for example, and what the treatment costs. **********Although the law is unclear about what companies can do with that information, they seem to have some latitude to cut coverage \"even if it's not good policy or good ethics,\" Mr. Rothstein said. **********Special pressures may come to bear on company doctors that can affect the care of employees in other ways. **********With low-back injury, for example, a private doctor might recommend that the employee avoid much bending or lifting at work, said Stephen Levin, medical director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Yet a company doctor who makes the same recommendation risks interfering with productivity, Dr. Levin said, speaking hypothetically. **********Dr. Levin also speaks from experience. Early in his own career, when he ran the employee health service for another hospital, the personnel office asked whether he could come up with a medical reason to find that an employee with high blood pressure could no longer do her job. He refused, and left the position for other reasons a year later. **********Nor do cases like this seem to involve only a few companies. Economic tension with management is a pervasive problem for company doctors, said Ms. Draper, the sociology professor. **********For her book, Ms. Draper interviewed more than 60 company doctors. Many of them told her anonymously about pressure to violate privacy protocols as well as to keep quiet about risks to the health of workers. **********More than a dozen recent lawsuits against E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and its doctors raise that issue. The suits, filed in New Jersey state court by 68 current and former employees, include accusations that Du Pont doctors discovered toxic levels of lead in the bodies of some employees and did not tell them about it. Du Pont denied the accusations but settled the cases in March of this year. Silvio J. DeCarli, a company lawyer, said details of the settlement were confidential. **********Doctors at many companies deny that they face such conflicts. A physician's loyalty belongs to patients, said Robert Kessler, medical director at Quad Graphics, a printing company in Pewaukee, Wis., that runs a full-service medical department for employees and their families. **********Since the company opened its clinic five years ago, it has not found any link between printing compounds and employee health problems, Dr. Kessler said, but if it did, the doctors \"have the full support from our C.E.O.\" to put the patient first. **********Nobody knows just how many companies have full-service medical departments, but more than two dozen opened clinics in the last several years as they became fed up with other health care options, said Jim Norton, a consultant in Toronto with the Wyatt Company, a benefits firm. **********At least one big company has gone in the opposite direction. Southern California Edison, a 50-year leader in company-operated health care, has lately seen no reason to compete with the burgeoning health care business in its region, said Margaret Jordan, vice president for health care and employee services. For the last two years, the utility has been dismantling its clinic, Ms. Jordan said. **********But numerous others -- among them Deere & Company, Gillette and Adolph Coors -- see the clinics as tools for reducing the cost of health care benefits, even though the savings are sometimes hard to measure. Employee participation is usually voluntary, but many companies make it substantially less expensive for workers to get health care at their own clinics than elsewhere. **********At Union Camp, the forest products company based in Wayne, N.J., each clinic visit costs the employee $15, including lab work and injections. Employees who instead see their own doctors must pay 20 percent of all costs out of their own pockets. **********Economics was the initial reason why Dianne Lawhorne, a technician in industrial relations at the company, started taking her daughter, Dru, 2, to the clinic in Savannah. By seeing the family practitioner there, Ms. Lawhorne figures that she saves about $25 a visit, compared with what she paid a private pediatrician. Now, she says she also goes for the good care. The clinic is operated by Medicenter Inc. of Lawton, Okla., which provides the five doctors. **********AN emphasis on preventive care also attracts employees to their companies' medical departments. Kathleen M. Davis, 46, a trademark specialist and corporate ethics coordinator for Hercules Inc., a specialty chemicals company in Wilmington, Del., receives a free annual physical from its medical unit and consults it for minor ailments. Several years ago, she said, it played a larger role. **********\"I had a pounding in my head, in my ear area, and I went to the medical department,\" she said. \"They talked with me, checked me out, and recommended that I see a specialist who diagnosed the symptoms as the beginning of Meniere's disease.\" She said she is no longer under care for the disease, which is an inner ear disorder. \"As far as I'm concerned, I'm fine now,\" she said. **********Gillette, which started its medical department 35 years ago, remains firmly committed to providing employee care, said William Greer, who has been the medical director since the department's inception. He estimates that Gillette saves $75,000 a year just by doing electrocardiograms itself. **********Harder to quantify are the savings associated with prevention, one of the chief advantages companies cite for playing an active role in primary care. At Gillette, that includes periodic screening for high blood pressure and diabetes. A wellness program at Coors offers free pap smears and skin cancer checks. **********But these are just the type of services that trouble the privacy experts, especially given the somewhat uncertain state of the law. **********The Americans With Disabilities Act, in effect for three years, may offer some protections against an employer that uses medical information improperly to affect a worker's job status, said Mr. Cornish, the privacy lawyer in Colorado Springs. But the precise contours of the law, which covers all aspects of the work relationship, remain largely untested. **********What's more, bringing a lawsuit is difficult and expensive and \"compounds the injury,\" said Mr. Maltby of the A.C.L.U. \"Everyone from the judge to the court clerk knows about your medical history.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/fcc-is-said-to-seek-an-end-to-preferences-on-sex-and-race.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.C.C.

The F.C.C. program involves hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars worth of new licenses to the nation's airwaves. **********But the agency's general counsel, William Kennard, is now recommending in an internal memo that the agency abandon that plan and simply offer advantages to small businesses of all types. **********The recommendation is likely to be approved by the full commission later this week. Agency officials said they had been planning to announce a decision on Friday. **********If the recommendation is accepted, it would represent the first big casualty of the Supreme Court's new interpretation of affirmative action programs. **********The Supreme Court ruled on June 12 that Federal programs that classify people by race are presumably unconstitutional. In doing so, the Court overturned its most recent decision on Federal affirmative action, a 1990 decision called Metro Broadcasting v. F.C.C. that had upheld a Federal affirmative action program designed to increase the number of broadcast licenses awarded to members of minorities. **********While the chairman of commission, Reed E. Hundt, has been a strong advocate of the program, the problem is that the agency is trying to award licenses as quickly as possible. Officials are concerned about being blocked by a court and delaying the entire process for months, if not years. **********The F.C.C. recently completed one big round of auctions, selling off 99 licenses for more than $8 billion, to some of the largest companies.  Agency officials said that delaying the next round of auctions for small businesses would simply give the giant corporations a bigger head start and very likely lock up the market before the small companies ever got started. **********If, on the other hand, the agency delayed issuing all new licenses in the interest of fairness, it would postpone the arrival of new services and cement the dominance of today's cellular telephone carriers. **********The debate over the new licenses marks the second big debate this year involving affirmative action and the F.C.C., and it comes amid a push from the Republican-dominated Congress to scale back the whole range of set-aside programs aimed at helping minority groups. **********Earlier this year, Congress voted to abolish a longstanding F.C.C. program that conferred tax benefits on companies that sell broadcasting or cable television systems to minority-owned companies, largely in response to reports that Viacom Inc., a giant media conglomerate, was about to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes by selling its cable systems to a small black-owned company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/britain-fines-wall-st-firm-in-client-deals.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britain Fines Wall St. Firm In Client Deals", "print_headline": "Britain Fines Wall St. Firm In Client Deals", "body_text": " **********Morgan Stanley & Company said yesterday that it had paid a fine of $:240,000, or $384,000, to British regulators because of a failure to conduct and supervise foreign-exchange business that led to $28 million in losses for its clients. **********Though small by American standards, the fine is the largest ever imposed by the Securities and Futures Authority, the regulator of London's investment markets, which monitors roughly 1,350 firms in Europe's biggest financial center. In addition, Morgan Stanley made a substantial, but undisclosed, payment to help cover the agency's costs. **********The fine could damage Morgan Stanley's reputation in the increasingly competitive London and European financial markets. While European financial firms often acknowledge that Wall Street houses possess superior financial expertise and greater capital strength, they sometimes contend that the biggest American firms are more ruthless in the way they manage their business, placing their own interests before those of clients. Morgan Stanley's settlement is likely to lend weight to such criticisms. **********A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman in London said yesterday, \"We discovered the problem, we investigated it, we reported it to the S.F.A. in 1992.\" The firm offered to cover the clients' losses, at a cost of $30 million, that year, she said. **********The losses resulted mainly from disastrous speculation in the Italian lira, which was devalued in 1992. Morgan Stanley was a participant in at least some of the loss-making foreign-exchange transactions, effectively reaping profits from the transactions as its clients lost money. **********In addition, the clients' losses were incurred at least in part through investments in derivatives that were created by Morgan Stanley for its clients. Derivatives are investments that are linked to, or derived from, the performance of an underlying asset like stocks or a currency. **********Clients, who included Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the chairman of Adidas A.G., the sporting goods manufacturer, suffered losses totaling $28 million. **********Four of the five clients have already accepted the settlements offered by Morgan Stanley. One client, Peter Ackerman, a Berlin-based lawyer, had declined to settle with the firm pending the outcome of the British agency's investigations, Morgan Stanley said. **********Both Morgan Stanley and the agency said they were reluctant to comment in detail on the case because of pending actions against Burkhard Brauch, a 32-year-old former vice president for Morgan Stanley in London. **********Morgan Stanley is suing Mr. Brauch in British courts, seeking millions of pounds in damages and contending that he mishandled the clients' accounts. Mr. Brauch is countersuing Morgan Stanley for unfair dismissal and seeks substantial financial damages. **********The Securities and Futures Authority also has pending disciplinary action against Mr. Brauch, who could not be reached for comment yesterday. Mr. Brauch, who is German, joined Morgan Stanley in April 1987 and was dismissed in September 1992, the firm said. He now lives in Madrid, according to The Financial Times, which first reported the client losses and the S.F.A. settlement yesterday. **********That report caused the agency to issue a statement outlining the settlement. \"We weren't trying to be secretive or keep this out of the public domain,\" an S.F.A. spokesman, David Jones, said yesterday, \"but because there is this parallel action against Mr. Brauch, we were waiting until there was an outcome on that case.\" **********The fine has already been criticized in the British press as one easily shrugged off by so powerful an investment bank as Morgan Stanley. But Mr. Jones rejected that characterization. \"We don't think a fine of $:240,000 plus substantial costs represents a limp slap on the wrist,\" he said. **********The London regulatory rules came into force in 1991, and the S.F.A. has been more active in imposing sanctions against firms that break its rules. It has recently imposed a fine of $:200,000, or $320,000, against Greig Middleton, a British investment firm, because it did not adequately inform investors of the details of an investment plan. In 1993, the agency fined Goldman, Sachs & Company $:160,000, about $256,000, for breaching capital requirements in buying shares in companies owned by Robert Maxwell. **********The agency said in its statement that Morgan Stanley had admitted that it breached London financial market rules in the way it \"organized, conducted and supervised foreign-exchange business for five private clients in 1992.\" The firm also admitted that it \"failed to insure that dealing on four of those accounts remained suitable for clients,\" according to the agency, and did not notify clients fully about their foreign-exchange transactions, failing to \"disclose the underlying transactions or the open positions.\" **********In addition, the agency said, Morgan Stanley's records, which were available to the firm's management, did not show market values for the clients' holdings, and the firm also \"didn't adequately monitor the amount of margin which had to be paid in by four of the clients.\" Investors are commonly required to put up in cash or negotiable securities a proportion, or margin, of the investments they are making. **********The agency acknowledged that Morgan Stanley had promptly reported the matter to regulators, had cooperated fully with investigators, \"promptly took over the clients' loss-making positions,\" and offered to restore their original capital position as though the trades had not taken place, at a cost of $30 million. **********The agency also said that its investigation had \"found no evidence of related wrongdoing,\" and that Morgan Stanley had conducted an internal review of its monitoring procedures, taking steps to improve them. **********Still, the firm was found by the agency to have broken two statutory principles required by the rules of London's Securities and Investments Board, a financial markets watchdog: that a firm should act with due skill, care and diligence, and that it should give its clients timely and comprehensive information of its dealings in their behalf."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/08/world/chirac-leading-the-right-wins-presidency-of-france.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1065, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIRAC, LEADING THE RIGHT, WINS PRESIDENCY OF FRANCE", "print_headline": "CHIRAC, LEADING THE RIGHT, WINS PRESIDENCY OF FRANCE", "body_text": " **********Jacques Chirac, the conservative Mayor of Paris, won the French Presidency on his third try today with more than 52 percent of the vote in mainland France, according to results from the Interior Ministry.. **********Lionel Jospin, the former Education Minister who had hoped to succeed Francois Mitterrand, a fellow Socialist who had held the Presidency for 14 years, conceded defeat half an hour after the polls closed at 8 P.M. **********With all votes counted except for overseas territories, Mr. Chirac led Mr. Jospin 52.7 percent to 47.3 percent, with 15,551,412 votes to 13,975,871. **********Speaking to several thousand cheering supporters in the palatial 19th-century Paris City Hall tonight, Mr. Chirac said, \"Our main battle has a name, the fight against unemployment.

He insisted on running again this year despite his failures in 1981 and 1988 even though public opinion polls at the beginning of the year gave him little chance of winning. **********But last month he surged ahead to become the front-runner and will now serve a seven-year term into the 21st century. **********Mr. Jospin, 57, looking disappointed at his defeat, told supporters tonight that he was conceding to Mr. Chirac. \"I congratulate him on his election to the Presidency of the Republic and I wish him good luck,\" Mr. Jospin said. **********Initially, Mr. Jospin had triumphed over the odds, coming in ahead of Mr. Chirac in the first round of voting two weeks ago, with 23.3 percent of the vote to Mr. Chirac's 20.8 percent. The early upset was a surprise after a wave of scandals that had left the Socialists seemingly discredited as well as exhausted after Mr. Mitterrand's 14 years in power. **********\"I felt a profound movement of renewal forming around my candidacy,\" Mr. Jospin said tonight. \"It did not permit victory today, but it will not stop, because it carries hope with it.\" **********Mr. Chirac's plans to reduce unemployment center on a package of measures to encourage private enterprise to invest and hire additional workers. He would offer companies $400 a month for two years for every worker they hire from the ranks of the long-term unemployed, and exempt employers from payroll taxes on the salaries of such new hires for two years. **********His first official act as President-elect will be to appear with Mr. Mitterrand, Vice President Al Gore, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and other leaders at the Arc de Triomphe on Monday morning for ceremonies to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. **********Next month, he may press President Clinton and other leaders at the annual meeting of the world's richest industrial democracies to agree on closer cooperation in light of the recent instability caused by the faltering dollar on currency markets. **********And he will have to explain to fellow European Union leaders meeting in Cannes on June 26 and 27 whether he really wants closer European political and monetary integration, after having said last week that he would first submit further agreements to the French people in a referendum. **********Mr. Chirac is expected to ask Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, 49, to be Prime Minister in place of Edouard Balladur, the fellow conservative who ran against Mr. Chirac for the Presidency in the first round last month but backed him in today's vote. **********Mr. Juppe has warned that France may decide in the next few weeks to withdraw its 4,500 soldiers from the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********One American official who knows Mr. Juppe and Mr. Chirac said tonight, \"They will have to decide whether they want to begin their Presidency by running the Tricolor down.\" But in a meeting with President Clinton in Washington last fall, Mr. Chirac raised only one foreign policy issue -- the situation in Bosnia, this official said. **********Most foreign diplomats believed last year that Mr. Balladur would win the Presidency. His lead in the public opinion polls soon faded and he came in behind Mr. Chirac in the first round with only 18.6 percent of the vote. The division among conservatives allowed Mr. Jospin to come in first. Conservative foes of the Mayor charged then that Mr. Chirac's stubborn insistence on running against the odds had divided the right in 1981 and 1988 and could cost the conservatives again in 1995. **********Mr. Chirac's victory gives his Rally for the Republic movement and its conservative allies political control of all important national political institutions for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic founded by de Gaulle in 1958. **********Mr. Chirac founded the Rally for the Republic in 1976 to perpetuate de Gaulle's political legacy. It, too, has been riddled with corruption scandals that could yet embarrass the President-elect once he moves to the Elysee Palace. **********Jean-Marie Le Pen, the extreme right-wing candidate who won 15 percent of the votes in the first round, compared France after the elections to a one-party state and said his ultranationalists would now concentrate on winning municipal elections next month in as many cities as possible. **********Mr. Le Pen said he cast a blank ballot today. Returns from eastern districts of France where he had come in ahead of all other candidates last month gave only a narrow victory to Mr. Chirac, indicating that many of the Le Pen votes may have gone to Mr. Jospin as well. **********Exit polls conducted by the BVA organization indicated that Mr. Jospin also won a majority, 52 percent, of the votes cast by 18- to 24-year-olds.

More than 10,500 candidates from 28 political parties are competing for 2,200 posts, from the Senate and Chamber of Deputies to mayors's offices and municipal councils. **********Since Mr. Aristide's election, Haiti has experienced much. **********There was a military coup that overthrew the President, three years of a brutal military dictatorship, a crushing economic embargo intended to topple that junta, the intervention last fall of 20,000 American troops to restore President Aristide to office and now the presence of United Nations peacekeepers. **********But suffering has only enhanced the meaning of the election. **********\"To be able to cast a ballot is one of the biggest things in my life,\" said Dugariste Ditreuil, 21, a student who was studying for final exams with friends on a park bench in the main square. \"I've been preparing myself for a long time to be able to take part in the betterment of my country, waiting for this moment to arrive.\" **********The Government estimates that 3.5 million people, nearly 90 percent of those thought to be eligible, have registered for Sunday's vote -- a 25 percent increase over 1990. **********Virtually no opinion polling has been done, leaving candidates of all political stripes free to forecast smashing victories. **********But Haitian political analysts and foreign diplomats predicted that most votes would be won by three political groups that supported Mr. Aristide in 1990: the Lavalas Political Organization, the National Front for Change and Democracy and the National Congress of Democratic Movements. **********\"Yes, if two-thirds of the people voted for Aristide in 1990, it is logical that the democratic sector will be heavily represented\" at all levels of power once the vote is in, said Gerard Pierre-Charles, leader of the Lavalas group, which has President Aristide's formal support. **********But, he added, since Haiti has little experience with democracy, \"no one knows what motivates people to vote, whether it is adherence to an organization or the force of a candidate's personality.\" **********With a few exceptions, the campaign has gone more smoothly than predicted. There have been isolated episodes of candidates being fired on or election officials being beaten up, and one former leader of the despised Tontons Macoute threatened to disrupt the vote when he was ruled ineligible to run. **********[ Overnight Friday, two polling centers near Cap-Haitien, on the northern coast, were attacked, Haitian and international officials said. One center was set afire and about 3,000 ballots burned; election supplies were stolen from the other Election officials said new materials had been sent and they expect voting to take place normally. ] **********So far the systematic violence and intimidation led by the disbanded Haitian armed forces that forced the cancellation of the 1987 presidential election and threatened the 1990 vote has been avoided. **********\"This time there's been no security problem, and it feels like a holiday for the entire country,\" said Osler Lyndor, 49, a laborer here who said he was enthusiastically following the campaign. \"For once we Haitians are not fighting with each other.\" **********The Haitian organizers of the vote and their United Nations advisers have taken many steps to avoid the vast fraud that has almost always marred elections. For instance, all voters are to have their fingers daubed with indelible ink to prevent them from voting more than once. **********Hundreds of official observers from the United States, Latin America, Canada and Europe, led by more than 300 delegates from the Organization of American States, will be deployed at polling places. The United Nations peacekeeping force of nearly 7,000 soldiers and police officers will protect voters. **********The campaigning has been marked by many organizational problems and irregularities, though, leading some opposition parties to complain of a deliberate effort to hinder their chances. Criticism of Anselme Remy, president of the Provisional Election Commission, and the eight other members has been almost universal. **********\"They have made a lot of honest mistakes due to lack of experience and lack of competence,\" said Jean-Robert Sabalat, who was chairman of the electoral commission that supervised the 1990 election. \"It's a pity, but they have lost their credibility, and no one trusts them anymore.\" Mr. Sabalat is running for a Senate seat. **********Mr. Remy's most controversial action was his announcement late last month that a million or more voter registration cards had disappeared. In an interview, he said he had made the statement to \"sensitize the public to the possibility of fraud in the system.\" **********American, United Nations and O.A.S. officials have since said that the cards were not, in fact, ever missing. But Mr. Remy has continued to insist that hundreds of thousands of cards are missing, and foreign election observers say his statements have cast doubt, apparently unnecessarily, on the credibility of the election process. **********The large registration fees that independent candidates and small parties are required to pay under the election code that President Aristide decreed into law in February are also controversial. Some opposition candidates fear they may triumph at the polls only to see their victories annulled because they have not paid the fees. **********Mr. Remy said a final tally in Sunday's vote would not be available for 8 to 10 days. Much of rural Haiti, where nearly three-quarters of the population lives, lacks electricity or telephones. The ballots will be counted by hand and the results taken, in some cases on foot or by donkey, over a precarious road system to regional counting centers. **********The vast majority of Haitian voters are illiterate, and each party has adopted symbols that will appear on the ballot next to candidates' names. **********But many independent candidates, including Manno Charlemagne, a popular protest singer who appears to be running a strong race for Mayor of Port-au-Prince, have complained that a Haitian flag was used on the ballot next to their names instead of their individual emblems. **********Mr. Odige, the election official, said he had his favorite candidates but he declined to disclose them. What is important, he said, is not so much the result as the process itself. **********\"Aristide's return opened the door for us,\" he said. \"Now we must step through it into democracy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/27/business/worldbusiness/IHT-international-manager-after-nearcrash-pirelli-is.html": {"writer_name": "James Hansen", "pub_date": "1995-07-27", "snippet": "Four years ago it was a cadaver.

The Italian tire and cable manufacturer Pirelli SpA, after its failed takeover of a German competitor, Continental AG, came as close as you can get to the edge without going over. **********\"There was a real risk of bankruptcy,\" said Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's managing director. \"There was panic both with investors and within the company.\" **********Mr. Tronchetti can afford to be philosophical about that disaster because the wind has changed. Pirelli SpA returned to profit last year, with net income of 147 billion lire ($91.5 million). It now looks set to turn in a fine 1995. **********\"In the first half, our consolidated sales were up 19 percent with respect to the first half last year, and gross operating profits were up 25 percent,\" Mr. Tronchetti said. **********Though the result reflected the devaluation of the lira, Mr. Tronchetti said that Pirelli's worldwide sales still rose 12.5 percent over the period, after compensation for exchange-rate effects. More than 80 percent of Pirelli's revenue comes from outside Italy. **********\"We don't see any reason why the trend shouldn't hold through the rest of the year,\" Mr. Tronchetti said. If the trend runs true, Pirelli's consolidated revenue of 9.25 trillion lire in 1994 could climb above 11 trillion lire in 1995. **********The few clouds on the horizon concern the tire sector, which accounts for just over half of company revenue. Tire sales are linked to car sales, and Pirelli says it sees signs the market may be softening. **********\"European auto sales are holding up, though growth is slowing,\" Mr. Tronchetti said, \"but the American figures are dipping.\" **********With respect to competitors such as France's Michelin and Japan's Bridge stone Corp., Pirelli is somewhat less vulnerable to an auto slowdown because it concentrates more on the replacement market than it does on supplying tires to manufacturers as original equipment. **********Though its tire sector is profitable, the best news is coming from its cable sector, where the information revolution is driving sales to telecommunications operators, particularly for Pirelli's high-end fiber-optics products. **********The company recently signed major contracts with MCI Communications Corp., Bellsouth Corp. and Sprint Corp. in the United States for the supply of high-volume fiber-optic cabling and equipment. It has also announced construction of a factory in South Carolina to meet growing American demand for optical amplifiers. These are now manufactured by Pirelli in France and exported to America. **********Outside North America, Pirelli is installing 1,200 kilometers (744 miles) of optical long-distance links in Brazil, a 1,000-kilometer energy link between Italy and Greece and a 1,600-kilometer telecommunications link in Malaysia. **********Pirelli's production staff likes to joke that all you need to know about tires is that they are \"black and round.\" By that standard, it may seem enough that cables are \"long and thin.\" But a revolution is under way in the market. **********\"Until now, cables have been dominated by a local producer protected by telecommunications and power-utility monopolies - that's disappearing,\" Mr. Tronchetti said. \"A truly pan-European cables market is now coming into existence.\" **********Information superhighways are sexy at the moment, but Pirelli says the next big growth may come from high-technology superconductor electric-power transmission lines, an area in which the company has laid a sizable research-and- development bet. **********Pirelli Cable Corp., an American subsidiary, is working with the Electric Power Research Institute to construct and test the world's first prototype high-temperature superconductor power cable in the United States. The Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and Ames national laboratories are collaborating on the project. **********HTS cables would permit utilities to greatly increase electric-power transmission along routes already near the saturation point. The new systems carry from two to five times as much power as present links, with lower energy losses. **********\"What we're doing is making HTS into an industrial product,\" Mr. Tronchetti said. \"It's expensive and will take off slowly, but by the end of the decade, I think it could be of primary importance for us.\" **********Large projects such as HTS, together with the black ink already in the books, are compelling signs that Pirelli is a company that has its nerve back. Mr. Tronchetti even hinted that Pirelli may be looking to make some acquisitions. **********\"We will not go out and buy volumes,\" he said, remembering the Continental fiasco. \"But we are considering purchasing some added value.\" **********Translated, he said that might mean acquisitions of small Asian tire and cable manufacturers as a way of gaining a foothold in important new markets. **********Pirelli recently signed joint venture agreements in Malaysia and Indonesia for cables. Mr. Tronchetti said the company was at \"an advanced stage\" in negotiations for a tire joint venture in China, and was also \"less far along\" in a joint venture in India for cable production. **********Company revenue is almost perfectly divided between tires (51 percent in 1994) and cables (49 percent). **********This historical accident - both were once applications for vulcanized rubber - gives Pirelli a foot in two different stirrups of the economic cycle, as cable investments by utilities and telecom companies tend to follow public-sector cycles, while tires are strongly linked to consumer spending. **********\"But it's not a question of ideology,\" Mr. Tronchetti said, refusing to guess how the mix might change in the future. \"Whatever opportunity comes along, we'll take it. Our job here is to maximize profits and nothing else.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-665195.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " **********Margaret Coughlin was named to the new position of vice chairwoman at Pamet River Partners, Boston.

These often-mocked daytime dramas once ruled the airwaves, but televised trials, at least 20 talk shows and dozens of specialized cable channels now contend for the same audience, leaving the soaps an increasingly smaller slice of the ratings pie. **********The biggest single cause of the soaps' recent woes has been the country's addiction to the O. J. Simpson trial. In the first three months of 1995, at least a million fewer households tuned in to the passion and grief served up on ABC's 'All My Children,' and two CBS shows, 'As the World Turns' and 'The Young and the Restless,' compared with the same period a year ago. **********But the ratings woes did not begin with that trial. An explosion of talk shows and the rise of Court TV took a hefty bite of the soaps' audience in the last decade. In early 1981, a high point for soap operas, the highest-rated soap, ABC's \"General Hospital,\" made a national spectacle of the courtship of Luke and Laura and had an 11.4 rating, according to the network's research. **********The top show today, \"The Young and the Restless,\" receives only a 6.7 rating and is watched by about 1.4 million fewer viewers each week than the queen of talk, Oprah Winfrey. (Each rating point represents 954,000 homes.) **********Because advertising rates are tied to ratings, this continued erosion has held down ad revenues for the networks and thinned the ranks of the soaps. In the last decade, seven soaps have been canceled by the big three networks, while only one -- \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" on CBS -- has been added, bringing the total to 10, down from 18 in 1970. **********\"This is the last repertory theater in America,\" said Felicia Minei Behr, executive producer of \"All My Children,\" one of the longest-running soaps. \"If this goes we will lose not only a big franchise and a lot of money, but we're going to lose a part of Americana.\" Despite the falloff in ratings, soap operas are still a multimillion-dollar business that pulled in an average of 15 percent of the networks' income last year, according to industry estimates. Last year nearly 50 million people tuned in each week, research shows, and the top four soap opera fan magazines have a combined circulation of more than two million. **********While soaps are making less money than they did in the 70's, the shows still earn a hefty profit for networks, with advertisers paying an average of $20,000 to $25,000 for a 30-second spot. **********A principal reason, ad executives say, is that soap operas cultivate a loyalty unrivaled in daytime programming, which is attractive for giant consumer-goods marketers like Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. **********\"Advertisers that use daytime still think soap operas are a great place to advertise,\" said Julie Friedlander, senior vice president of national broadcast negotiations at Ogilvy & Mather. \"Women love their soaps. They watch them with great intensity.\" **********Created in the 1930's to sell detergent and other household products to women, soap operas have traditionally been the preeminent form for titillating episodic dramas, first on radio and then on television. **********And though talk shows offer a competing diet of convoluted stories and impossible fates, most of these have not had the appeal of soaps among the demographic group most desirable to advertisers -- women aged 18 to 49. But that is changing.  Between October and December of 1994, for example, the \"Ricki Lake Show\" and the \"Jenny Jones Show\" got higher ratings among that category of women than half the soap operas on the air. **********And because the $200,000 typically required to produce a week's worth of talk shows pales in comparison with the $1 million price tag for five episodes of a soap opera, the challenge posed by talk television is formidable. **********Still, some marketers with large ad budgets for daytime television say the lurid content of many talk shows is not something they want associated with their products. \"I stay away from those shows,\" said William Kashimer, an associate media director at Colgate-Palmolive. \"We don't want to be near the skinheads beating people up.\" **********Last year, before the Simpson trial, soaps did surprisingly well.  While declining to give actual figures, Ms. Krushel of ABC said there was a comparative \"bull market\" in ad revenue for soap operas last year, adding that the network's daytime programming division had its most lucrative year since the early 80's. **********Unfortunately, the money that daytime dramas used to pull in as profit must now go into sprucing up the shows with higher production quality. Last summer, for example, the producers of \"All My Children\" spent about $500,000 to stage a tornado, fearing that anything short of a spectacular stunt would leave viewers bored."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/31/business/gilbert-acquires-xel.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gilbert Acquires XEL", "print_headline": "Gilbert Acquires XEL", "body_text": " **********Gilbert Associates Inc. said today that it had acquired the XEL Corporation for $30 million in cash.

Whitacre, the former executive with the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company who blew the whistle on possible price-fixing at the company, has agreed to plead guilty to at least two felonies involving other criminal activity, people who have been briefed on the agreement said yesterday. **********Under the plea deal, which was said to have been struck in early August, Mr. Whitacre is required to cooperate with the growing number of investigations involving the giant agricultural company, these people said. They include a fraud investigation involving corporate money some executives received in overseas bank accounts as well as several inquiries into possible price-fixing involving several agricultural products. **********The felony charges involve millions of dollars Mr. Whitacre obtained from Archer-Daniels in a Swiss bank account, people who have been briefed on the matter said. These people said Mr. Whitacre would plead to charges of evading income taxes and defrauding company shareholders, who under Federal securities laws must be informed of all corporate funds received by senior executives. **********As in all plea deals, Mr. Whitacre would be obligated by his agreement to answer truthfully all questions from the Government about the activities of both him and other executives at Archer-Daniels. The failure to do so under a plea agreement could result in the Government's revoking the deal. **********In this case, that commitment will be especially important. Both Archer-Daniels and executives who have spoken to the prosecutors agree that a crime may have been committed. But Archer-Daniels says that the money was embezzled in a conspiracy orchestrated by Mr. Whitacre, while the executives contend that it was paid as part of an organized, corporate scheme to allow them to evade income taxes. In a statement yesterday, the company denied ever engaging in such a scheme. **********For many weeks, the investigation of how money from Archer-Daniels had been sent to foreign bank accounts was thought to focus on Mr. Whitacre. But the decision in August to allow him to plead guilty indicates that at a very early stage the inquiry into those financial transactions may well have broadened beyond Mr. Whitacre's activities to those of other executives. **********The agreement also indicates that whether the ultimate charges prove to involve embezzlement or an illegal compensation scheme Mr. Whitacre will likely be a central witness in any case brought by the Government involving those financial transactions. **********No charges have yet been filed against Mr. Whitacre, and it could not be immediately determined when they might be. In a brief telephone call yesterday, Mr. Whitacre declined to comment. His lawyer, James Epstein, did not return telephone calls. John Russell, a spokesman for the Justice Department, also declined to comment. **********While it could not be immediately determined if the Government had imposed any requirement on what would be done with the money Mr. Whitacre was said to hold in a Swiss bank accounts, such plea deals almost universally require that any illegal assets be frozen and that the Government gain some degree of control over them. That would entail giving the Government some authority over the Swiss account, or transferring the money back to the United States. **********Despite the plea agreement, Mr. Whitacre does not appear to be too concerned about his future. Industry executives said that the former Archer-Daniels officer had been interviewing at other companies for jobs. During those interviews, those executives said, he has disclosed his agreement to plead guilty. **********But Archer-Daniels contends that at least in regard to the money that went to executives the company has nothing to be concerned about either. Responding to an article in some editions of The New York Times yesterday that said that the Justice Department was investigating whether off-the-books payments were made to executives through foreign accounts, the company said that it was \"studying its options for actions it may take against parties publishing unverified false and misleading accusations.\" **********Archer-Daniels first made its allegations against Mr. Whitacre in August, about a month after it learned he had been secretly taping conversations on behalf of the Government in the price-fixing investigations. The company said at the time that it was turning over its information about Mr. Whitacre to Federal prosecutors. **********But at about that same time, people who have been briefed on the matter said, Mr. Whitacre agreed to plead guilty to felony charges. In the middle of August, apparently after reaching the plea agreement, he attempted suicide. **********Several other executives are already caught up in the investigation. Last week, Archer-Daniels announced that it had dismissed two executives and placed a third on administrative leave for participating in an embezzlement scheme with Mr. Whitacre. **********The dismissals of two of those executives, Reinhard Richter and Sidney Hulse, came shortly after they were questioned by the company about the payments and they informed the company that they intended to cooperate with Federal prosecutors, lawyers involved in the case said. **********In a weekend interview with Bloomberg Business News that was released yesterday, Mr. Whitacre said that he did not approve the money that went to Mr. Richter. \"Reinhard is not part of Bioproducts, did not report to me and I had nothing to do with his payment,\" Mr. Whitacre said in the interview. **********The multiple investigations are a troubling development for one of the nation's largest, if least known, companies. Archer-Daniels is huge, with $12.8 billion in annual sales for the 1995 fiscal year, and almost $800 million in earnings. Its products, from corn to soybeans to food additives, are found in almost every kitchen in America. And its success has made the company and its chairman, Dwayne O. Andreas, one of the most powerful forces in the country in national politics for more than two decades. **********But despite that influence and success, the unfolding scandals at the company are bringing a heavy price. Almost two dozen lawsuits have been filed against Archer-Daniels by clients. And some large institutional shareholders are beginning to voice concerns about the way the company is run. **********For example, yesterday, Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, released a Sept. 8 letter he wrote to Mr. Andreas criticized the way the company's directors had handled the unfolding scandal. **********\"I find it particularly disturbing that the board has been virtually silent, despite reports that the investigations have targeted top company officials,\" wrote Mr. Hevesi, who manages city pension funds that hold 2.7 million shares in the company. \"The board's silence is not helpful in this situation.\" **********Shares of Archer-Daniels closed yesterday at $15.875, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-495195.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " **********Sally Tassani was named to the new position of operations director for a unit responsible for direct, promotional and interactive advertising at the Leo Burnett Co., Chicago.

Our roads are simply too crowded -- and building more means intolerable costs and environmental problems, while the congestion reappears in a few short years. As we enter the 21st century, public transportation is the only cost-effective way that growing communities can insure mobility for their citizens. **********The best transportation budget is, therefore, one that balances investments among roads, trains and buses. Four years ago, Congress and President George Bush developed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution by investing in both public transportation and highway construction. **********But the budget versions adopted now by the House of Representatives and Senate have unwisely abandoned that balanced approach. **********For fiscal year 1996, Congress has proposed to slash funds for public transportation and Amtrak while substantially increasing highway subsidies. Eighty-nine percent of the proposed House cuts in transportation assistance would come out of public transit and Amtrak, though they constitute just 15 percent of the Federal transportation budget. Meanwhile, highway subsidies -- 52 percent of the transportation budget -- would rise by more than a half-billion dollars. The Senate plan, while reducing highway funding by 3.7 percent, cuts mass transit funding by three times as much. **********In the Atlanta area, events at the Georgia Dome and Atlanta/Fulton County Stadium, as well as next year's Olympics, depend on the transit system, Marta.

Americans need efficient transit to encourage compact community development that preserves open space and uses infrastructure wisely so that metropolitan areas can sustain growth for generations to come. **********America needs convenient, affordable transit to allow people leaving welfare to get to jobs. America also needs a healthy balance between local needs and Federal resources. Congress should, therefore, promote a balanced transportation policy that: *********** Offers equal Federal matching dollars for public transportation and highways alike. Why skew our building projects toward highways if communities really need more public transit? Local elected officials should set the priorities and make the allocations of transportation dollars. *********** Continues to assist local transit systems through the transit operating assistance program. Many communities, especially smaller ones, depend on Federal aid to keep buses and subways running. The Mobile, Ala., bus system has shut down in anticipation of unbridgeable cuts in Federal assistance. And as many as 60 other systems may follow suit. *********** Maintains the strong Federal interest in transit capital and technological-innovation programs. With little room to expand our packed metropolitan-area highways, the nation must expand public transit. Federal help should be available to regions that cannot afford such a major investment -- just as large infusions of Federal capital helped build our world-renowned highway system. At the same time, the Government must continue to support the development of innovations like high-speed intercity rail; low-weight, low-pollution buses; up-to-the-minute schedule information accessible from people's homes, and technology that allows buses to pass through traffic signals ahead of cars. *********** Preserves a strong national passenger railroad. In many congested regions, intercity rail is by far the most cost-effective way to travel. Amtrak passenger miles rose 48 percent between 1982 and 1993. Ridership rose 87 percent on Northeast Corridor Metroliners, 49 percent between San Diego and Los Angeles, and 10 percent between St. Louis and Chicago. **********Yes, Congress and the President must be hardheaded when it comes to spending our dollars.

Big new money and markets have attracted graft and crime, but they are also creating a pluralism that undermines the strict control of the state. **********In the last two years, the once-firm grip over television broadcasts by the central Government has been significantly weakened by the creation of privately owned and relatively independent networks like NTV, or Independent Television, and TV6 Moscow. **********Both are run by professional journalists who left the huge, bureaucratic, state-owned Ostankino channel in disgust over low pay, commercial corruption and bad journalism. Both are expanding quickly, signing up local stations and moving into satellite transmission. **********NTV in particular has created an internationally respected Russian model for quality television news, while making increasing amounts of money on broadcasts of foreign entertainment dubbed in Russian. TV6 is now broadcast in 55 cities and will start a daily news program in September. **********Control of television was one of the last parapets of Soviet dictatorship to crack. Even in the days of glasnost, the former Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, dominated television as he pleased, analyzing his own lavishly covered activities in long lectures on free state air time. **********Some prominent Kremlin officials, worried about losing control as elections approach, have responded with threats and a raid on the headquarters of the main owner of NTV. **********\"This new pluralism means less state control,\" said Eduard M. Sagalayev, the president of TV6 and former general director of Ostankino. \"With more choice, television will become better, not worse. Even such tragic events as the killing of Mr. Listyev will make journalists tougher and work more professionally, because they understand what responsibility rests on them for the preservation of democracy.\" **********Mr. Listyev, who moved easily between journalism and entertainment on the one hand, and entrepreneurship and management on the other, was killed Wednesday night, apparently in a struggle over how advertising revenues were going to be organized in a restructured Ostankino, which broadcasts throughout the former Soviet Union. **********Today political leaders joined relatives in paying hommage to Mr. Listyev, whose private funeral was held at the small Resurrection Church in central Moscow. **********The First Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg Soskovets, condemned \"evil forces that want to scare the people.\" **********Later thousands of mourners gathered outside Vagankovskoye cemetery, where Sergei Filatov, President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief of staff, and others threw handfuls of earth on the coffin before it was lowered into its grave. **********The Ostankino television network has been infamous for the corruption and chaos of its management. Somehow, independent producers have been allowed to siphon off most of the advertising revenue, leaving the network unable to pay employees' wages or other expenses. **********But the restructuring of Ostankino has been forced by the extraordinary success of the new channels, and not simply by corruption. **********The Government, while preserving a controlling 51 percent of the shares in the new company, Russian Public Television, has sold the rest to 12 carefully selected companies and banks that can provide both money for investment and management expertise. Mr. Listyev, 38, had been made executive director of the station, which had announced it would temporarily stop showing ads while it tried to clean house. **********The war in secessionist Chechnya has been a kind of watershed for Russian television, displaying the power and influence of independent journalism like that of NTV. Because it is privately owned and financed, NTV successfully resisted pressure from the Government to conform to its propaganda line. **********NTV's courage emboldened Ostankino and the other state-owned station, Russian Television (RTR, Channel 2), to deliver more balanced news. Early in the Chechnya campaign, Ostankino reverted to calling its news program \"Vremya,\" or \"Time,\" the old Soviet title, and even read some official communiques. **********But the Government of President Yeltsin quickly found that the country had moved beyond the timid coverage of the Afghan war 10 years before, and the station had to expand its coverage. **********This new independence is regarded with some displeasure, especially by the Kremlin, with the country moving toward parliamentary elections in December and presidential elections in June 1996. Politicians here, even more than in the United States, are obsessed with the power of television, which is one of the few institutions that holds this enormous multinational state together. **********It was the power of television and its starring personalities that brought a clearly upset Mr. Yeltsin to the Ostankino studios on Thursday to express condolences and to promise action to find Mr. Listyev's killer. **********\"There is an unrealistic but powerful belief in the omnipotence of television,\" said Prof. Ellen Mickiewicz, an expert on Russian television who directs the DeWitt Wallace Center for Communications and Journalism at Duke University. **********The biggest change in Russian television, she said, is the development of markets for both viewers and advertisers. With the rise of NTV and TV6, which are slowly moving toward national network status and reach, viewers will have more choice and protection against state control. \"Pluralism is what nurtures the move toward democracy,\" Ms. Mickiewicz said. **********But she and Mr. Sagalayev, along with Yevgeny Kiselyov, the anchor and vice president of NTV, agree that while the media market is expanding, legal protections are not in place to buffer television from powerful politicians, let alone organized crime. **********NTV, like the liberal Sevodnya newspaper, is largely owned by the Most group, run by Vladimir Gusinsky, a former theatrical agent who has made millions of dollars in banking and other new businesses. Mr. Gusinsky is a Westernized liberal democrat and close to the ambitious Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov. He was once a supporter of Mr. Yeltsin, but he and his media outlets have criticized many political developments, not only the Chechnya war. **********So Mr. Gusinsky has been a target of intimidation by the Kremlin, in the person of Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Korzhakov, Mr. Yeltsin's chief of security. On Dec. 2, his troops raided the Most offices and beat employees, then said the next day that they had been investigating the crash of the ruble in October. **********Mr. Gusinsky, who has been spending more time abroad lately, said in a published interview that the attacks on Most began with its investment in mass media, especially television. \"They all began looking for a plot,\" he said. **********That search is expected to continue as election season approaches, and even NTV appears more careful now in its Chechnya coverage. NTV employees privately attribute the change partly to Kremlin pressure and partly to growing sympathy for Russian soldiers fighting a long war. **********Mr. Gusinsky is very rich, but he is vulnerable in a country still based on almost feudal hierarchies and loyalties to power. Yet even in this Russia, with its smaller Government budgets, money is talking louder and louder. **********And money, at bottom, explains the changes at Ostankino, which may have led to Mr. Listyev's murder. The Government had to finance a third of the budget, while the Communications Ministry took 80 percent of the receipts for transmission costs. And receipts were much lower than they should have been. **********Private producers and advertising agencies had grown accustomed to buying cheap television time and, covertly, to buying news coverage from underpaid journalists. These broadcasts were known as jeans programs because a few years ago they could be bought with money that might cover a few pairs of blue jeans. Today, with ad costs reaching $30,000 a minute, the stakes are much higher, and after setting up its own in-house agency, Ostankino increased advertising receipts sevenfold, reaching nearly $8 million a month. **********So the decision to ban ads altogether while reviewing old arrangements seems to have been enough to cause someone to put out a contract on Mr. Listyev's life. **********He himself had also done very well under the old system, other producers say. He had run a company, ViD, that copied foreign shows like \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Larry King Live.\" As their host, he became well known and popular, though some lawsuits alleged theft of intellectual property. **********Mr. Listyev is not the first to die by assassination. Valery Kurzhiyamsky, the director of studio music entertainment for Ostankino, was killed in January 1993. There is a lot of money in music, too. **********For all the troubles, television now provides Russians \"a much broader choice and range of opinions than before,\" Professor Mickiewicz said. \"It's one of the most positive outcomes in the development of Russia after the end of the Soviet Union.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/world/yugoslavia-rules-out-recognition-of-croatia-or-bosnia-soon.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslavia Rules Out Recognition of Croatia or Bosnia Soon", "print_headline": "Yugoslavia Rules Out Recognition of Croatia or Bosnia Soon", "body_text": " **********The Foreign Minister of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav federation accused Croatia today of \"disgraceful treatment\" of Serbs and made clear that Yugoslav recognition of either Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina would not be possible in the near future. **********The official, Vladislav Jovanovic, said in an interview that recognition of Bosnia made no sense because the country was in pieces. He added that prospects for recognition of Croatia had been pushed back by the \"highly undesirable, unfortunate, damaging and unconstructive decision\" by the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, to end the United Nations mandate there. **********Mr. Tudjman's decision to ask the 12,000 United Nations troops to leave after March 31 has opened the possibility of renewed fighting between Croats and the Croatian Serbs, who hold one-third of the country.

In this light, he asked, what treatment could the Serbs in the Serb-controlled are expect? **********It was therefore necessary to move slowly, the Foreign Minister argued, by establishing economic relations, opening the border between the Serb-held area and the Government-controlled area, insuring that Serbs in Croatia suffered no further mistreatment and \"leaving the Serbs under United Nations protection for some years.\" **********\"Formal or final recognition of Croatia should be the culmination of this process,\" he said. **********Such ideas are clearly unacceptable to Mr. Tudjman, who is 74 and determined to establish sovereignty over all of Croatia quickly. **********Turning to Bosnia, Mr. Jovanovic said: \"What does recognition mean in Bosnia? How could you define it? There is a messy situation: you have the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia, a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serbian entity. Whom are you to recognize? Early recognition of Bosnia by the European Union and the United States only led to an ongoing civil war.\" **********The first step in Bosnia, he said, should be international acceptance that the Serbs there are entitled to the same treatment as the Muslim-Croat federation. This would mean that Bosnian Serbs have the \"same right to enter an international confederation with us as the Muslim-Croat federation has with Croatia.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/30/business/market-place-analysts-say-optimism-has-returned-to-the-biotech-stocks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Analysts say optimism has returned to the biotech stocks.", "print_headline": "Market Place; Analysts say optimism has returned to the biotech stocks.", "body_text": " **********A SURPRISING thing happened on Monday when Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported encouraging results from an early trial of its genetically engineered drug for the treatment of Lou Gehrig's disease: its shares moved up. **********Back in the glory days of biotechnology, say 1991, favorable results in the first or second of the three phases of clinical trials required of a new drug for regulatory approval would inevitably send a company's shares soaring. But then a long string of drugs that had looked promising in phases one and two failed in phase three, shares plummeted and biotech stocks entered a long, cold night. No amount of good news -- even product approvals -- could move them. **********\"My job is basically to guess clinical trial data, and the appalling thing about 1994 was you could say 'we just cured death,' and the stock would stay flat or go down,\" said Timothy Wilson, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. As it happened, Regeneron shares gave up much of their gain by the market's close on Monday, but they are still trading at three times the low of $3 they hit a year ago, when the company disclosed that it was dropping clinical trials of an earlier Lou Gehrig's drug because of severe side effects. Regeneron shares doubled in January after P. Roy Vagelos, the former chief executive of Merck Inc., joined the company as chairman. **********Dr. Vagelos's recruitment gave investors confidence that there was more to Regeneron than one failed drug, and indeed, he has said the company's science is more broadly applicable than previously thought. But Regeneron is only one among several biotech companies whose shares have posted strong recoveries this year. A selective optimism has returned to the group, analysts say. **********Agouron closed unchanged yesterday at $22.75, more than twice its 52-week low of $9.75. Autoimmune has also more than doubled from a low of $4.50, to $10.125, off 37.5 cents, yesterday. Isis has more than tripled, from a low of $3.25 to yesterday's close of $12.50, up $1.25. Magainin closed yesterday at $6.8125, up 31.25 cents, from a low of $1.78. These companies have had steady progress in clinical trials, although all of them remain a year or more away from marketable drugs. **********The group has benefited from a realization that biotechnology is neither as easy a road to revenues as once thought or the washout that a dozen failed drugs made it appear. \"It's a lot riskier than people thought in 1991,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"It may be that only 1 drug in 10 gets to market, but we've been getting some 1's lately.\" **********One measure of the biotech sector's recovery is the year-to-date performance of mutual funds specializing in these shares: Fidelity Select Biotech, up 17.5 percent; Invesco Health Science, up 16.6 percent; Capstone Medical Research, up 20 percent. That is a far cry from the triple-digit returns that some biotech portfolios posted in 1991, but far better than the flat to negative performance of most of them last year. **********\"This is a final confirmation that we're in the up part of a cycle, and that typically lasts for two to three years,\" said James McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. His model portfolio, consisting of 13 biotech stocks, is up 30 percent so far this year. \"What makes it interesting is that these stocks got so cheap they can come up a lot and still be attractive,\" he said. **********Indeed, Mr. McCamant said he had noticed that institutions seemed to return to biotech stocks after an initial doubling in value from their lows. \"There was more interest in Somatogen after it doubled from 6 to 12 and it's still cheap here relative to the 50 it hit before they ever treated one patient,\" he said. \"In carefully selected stocks, the upside is still very large.\" **********In this newly favorable climate, a few companies are testing the market for public offerings. Cephalon filed for a secondary offering last week, after publishing surprisingly strong results on its lead drug, also for Lou Gehrig's disease, which was co-developed with Chiron. And Sequana Therapeutics, an early-stage company focusing on the human genome, filed an initial public offering earlier this month. **********\"I would expect to see some companies file deals, those with major corporate collaborations or real data,\" said Mark Simon, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens. \"But we all know one thing: If we print a lot of paper, the rally is over. There are not enough investors, and there's not enough capital.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/world/toll-rises-in-zaire-virus-even-as-epidemic-ebbs.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Altman", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 489, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Toll Rises in Zaire Virus Even as Epidemic Ebbs", "print_headline": "Toll Rises in Zaire Virus Even as Epidemic Ebbs", "body_text": " **********The World Health Organization yesterday reported an increase, to 153, in the number of deaths from infection with the Ebola virus in Zaire. But it said the new numbers represent cases that occurred in the earliest phase of the epidemic, from January to March, and are just now being confirmed. **********The latest counts are 205 suspected or confirmed cases, including the 153 deaths, up from the 160 cases, including 121 deaths, that W.H.O. reported on Friday. **********Philippe Stroot, a spokesman for W.H.O., said the agency still holds to a statement it made on Friday that \"the acute phase of the epidemic is over and transmission now has been greatly reduced, if not completely halted.\" **********The new figures were disclosed at a news conference in Geneva yesterday where three members of the W.H.O. team who had participated in the investigation in Zaire spoke. One member, Dr. David Heyman, predicted that the number of new cases and deaths would continue to rise over the next week and then drop. **********The focus of the epidemic is Kikwit, a city of about 500,000 people, and all cases occurred in five areas in Bandundu province surrounding Kikwit. Most of the newly reported cases occurred in Mosango, Bulungu, Imbongo, Mukala and Dua. No cases have occurred in Kinshasa, the capital, which has a population of six million and is about 300 miles from Kikwit. **********As evidence that the epidemic has slowed, Mr. Stroot said that only 12 new cases have occurred since May 21 and that all were incubating the virus before the W.H.O. scientific team imposed sanitary control measures. No more than two new cases have occurred on any day since May 21, he said. The incubation period of the virus is 2 to 21 days. **********W.H.O. said its scientists believe they have stopped transmission of the Ebola virus in Zaire. \"There are no new transmissions because the health workers can protect themselves and people have been instructed not to touch patients, dead bodies and blood,\" Mr. Stroot said. **********The scientists are now turning from finding cases to the research phase of their investigation. **********One theory the investigators will explore is whether there is a continual low level of transmission of Ebola virus that, for some unknown reason, burns out. Limited evidence suggests that transmission of Ebola virus explodes into an epidemic primarily when health workers are exposed to infected people admitted to a hospital where infection control practices are poor because of the lack of soap, clean water, surgical gloves and other basic equipment. **********A main goal is to find out where Ebola virus resides between epidemics. Ebola is one of the viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever and that are usually carried by rodents and other animals. **********So far the scientists have found no hints as to which animals or insects might carry the virus. \"They really don't know,\" Mr. Stroot said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/business/key-rates-748195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": " **********In percent"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/22/business/a-survey-finds-the-public-more-cynical-than-journalists-about-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1995-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Survey Finds the Public More Cynical Than Journalists About Leaders", "print_headline": "A Survey Finds the Public More Cynical Than Journalists About Leaders", "body_text": " **********The public thinks the press dwells excessively on negative news. But there is new evidence that members of the public are far more cynical than journalists about the nation's leaders. **********That surprising conclusion is the main finding of a detailed study of attitudes about the news media being released this morning by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press in Washington. The study included a national telephone survey as well as interviews and focus groups with journalists, business executives and community and political leaders. **********In a telephone poll, 66 percent of the public said the press was too focused on misdeeds and failures. **********But among the various groups questioned, only radio talk-show hosts expressed a degree of distrust of the country's political, business and civic leaders that nearly equaled the extreme distrust expressed by members of the public. **********The study, which was conducted before the Oklahoma City bombing, found that 77 percent of the general public and 65 percent of radio talk-show hosts gave public officials in Washington a low rating for honesty and ethics. Only 40 percent of the members of the national press gave Washington officials a low rating for honesty and ethics. **********Public distrust of leaders was also greater than that displayed by the other groups questioned, including members of Congress and business and community leaders. **********\"The public's profound distrust of influential groups, greater than the press and national and local leaders, raises deep new questions about the causes and consequences of public cynicism,\" the center's report said.  The finding that news professionals are substantially less cynical than their audience is likely to accelerate a broad discussion that has begun in journalism recently. **********Some journalists and media critics have been saying that the news media may be responsible for increasing public distrust of the country's institutions. And some journalists have been advocating new approaches to news coverage that try to alter the traditional focus on conflict and discord. Instead, some journalists say, news organizations should aim to improve public dialogue and explore methods of solving community problems. **********\"I think the public sees the press as part of the problem,\" said Edward M. Fouhy, executive director of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington. Mr. Fouhy, who has read the Times Mirror study, said it supported assertions by some press critics that people were so frustrated by growing tabloid-style journalism and shallow reporting that they had turned their anger on the news media. **********The findings by the Times Mirror center, a research organization financed by the newspaper publishing company, are likely to focus attention on those issues. The study raises new questions, for example, about whether journalists are somehow painting a different picture of reality than they intend. **********\"Have elite groups and the public increasingly different world views?\" the center's report asked. \"Is the press to blame? Can the press continue to play an effective watchdog role if the public is so skeptical of it and all other elites?\" **********Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University, said the study's finding that the public was far more cynical than reporters could mean that the news media had become too remote from its readers and viewers. \"They're missing a lot of what we're telling them,\" he said, \"and I think it's because they don't understand why we do what we do.\" **********For example, Mr. Kovach said, when reporters describe the motives behind politicians' actions it may not always be clear that they are trying to give the public additional information to provide context, and not necessarily suggesting sinister aims. **********The study found that journalists agreed with many of the criticisms of their work. Both print and broadcast news people acknowledged that there was more opinion in news coverage than there should be and that they did not adequately cover good news. **********But the study also finds a widespread \"disconnect\" between how the media see themselves and how the public sees the media. **********For example, the public and journalists appear to be far apart on their perceptions of what constitutes \"good\" coverage. Asked by the center's researchers to grade the quality of the various news media, journalists gave the lowest grades to local television news and the highest grades to large national newspapers. **********But the public generally gave the highest marks to television news and to local television news in particular. More than 80 percent of news professionals gave newspapers a grade of A or B, while only 36 percent of the public gave newspapers such high grades. At the same time, 67 percent of the public gave high grades to local television news. **********The center conducted focus groups beginning in January and February, conducted 515 telephone interviews with news media executives and journalists and conducted a telephone survey of 1,819 adults between March 22 and 26. The researchers also conducted interviews with members of Congress, mayors and local legislators, chief executives of large public companies, community leaders and educators."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/20/business/information-technology-digital-commerce.html": {"writer_name": "Denise Caruso", "pub_date": "1995-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Digital Commerce", "print_headline": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; Digital Commerce", "body_text": " **********IF you believe everything you read, you must think everyone spends every waking hour in cyberspace. They're having cybersex, using cybercash to buy cyberzines, engaging in cyberactivism, committing cybercrimes and in general embarking on a mass exodus from the deadly ennui of physical existence. **********Unfortunately, this is easier written than done. What's required to enjoy the cyberlife is a sufficiency of bandwidth -- that is, the number of digital graphics and the amount of video and sound that can move over a network in a given time. And a commodity it is not. **********Bandwidth still costs a bundle; not many people outside of universities and large corporations have it. But increasingly, the outsiders who do have it are likely to subscribe through their local telephone companies to a service called I.S.D.N., for integrated services digital network. **********I.S.D.N. uses standard copper wire and the public telephone network to deliver from 3 to 24 \"channels\" (64,000 bits a second) capable of carrying digital voice or data signals into homes and businesses. Each digital channel can perform like a standard telephone line, or can combine into larger conduits depending on the information flow. **********Its ability to provide bandwidth on demand makes I.S.D.N. a boon to Internet users. Browsing the Web on an analog phone line (at about 9,600 bits a second, the most popular modem speed today) is the equivalent of changing the channel on your television and watching while the screen draws itself one line at a time. **********With I.S.D.N., browsing doesn't yield instant results -- it's more like unrolling a poster -- but it's vastly more responsive and enjoyable. And it's relatively cheap: as little as $30 a month in some service areas, about the same as a premium cable service. **********But the net community is buzzing about a ruling the Federal Communications Commission handed down in January that could snuff out the service just as it is getting going. The ruling forbids telephone companies that provide I.S.D.N. to charge less money for more bandwidth, stating that each channel in an I.S.D.N. bundle is, in effect, a separate phone line and must be priced accordingly. **********The net effect of this pricing formula will raise the cost of I.S.D.N. service by as much as 50 percent before the end of the year, crippling both customers and vendors experimenting with new, high-bandwidth on-line services. **********Telephone companies have been using digital technology for years to deliver more calls with greater reliability and speed. But it has been difficult to get these modern efficiencies into the local loop -- the physical wire that connects a customer's equipment to a telephone company's central office -- because virtually all telephones, fax machines, modems and so on are designed to work with standard analog signals. **********I.S.D.N., developed in the early 1980's, was the first technology that provided enough extra bandwidth, using the existing loop, to make it practical for customers to invest in digital equipment. But it was not until September 1992 that the Nynex Corporation started the commercialization movement by asking the F.C.C. for permission to reorganize its prices to include the new service. **********The F.C.C. quickly ruled that I.S.D.N. circuits should be priced as if they were a bundle of individual phone lines. Nynex asked the agency to reconsider; two years later, the F.C.C. said it would not, and is now standing by its original decision. **********While the F.C.C. was taking two years to say no, the number of I.S.D.N. lines in the United States grew to almost 500,000. Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell, among others, expanded I.S.D.N. offerings. Pacific Bell says I.S.D.N. is its fastest-growing service, from 13,000 lines in 1993 to 24,000 in 1994. **********But now that they know the F.C.C. will enforce its rules, both companies predict steep drops in demand -- as much as 35 percent. Bell Atlantic predicts as many as one in four existing users with I.S.D.N. equipment will cancel service. **********Both the F.C.C. and the telephone companies are blaming each other for creating such an absurd situation, and they're both right. The companies were nearly blind to the future of I.S.D.N. when the F.C.C. decided against Nynex in 1992. Bell Atlantic was the only company that filed comments in routine support of Nynex's motion for reconsideration. Not to mention that the companies are not in compliance today with the F.C.C.'s 1992 ruling -- not exactly a strategy designed to win sympathy in Washington. **********The F.C.C., for its part, looks daft. Charged with shepherding us into a global information infrastructure, it appears not to know the difference between analog and digital. Presumably, this isn't true, but the agency should have used its own 1992 decision against Nynex to publicly champion a swift rule-making procedure to encourage new digital services. **********Now, of course, the F.C.C. is doing just that. Jim Schlichting, chief of policy planning in the F.C.C,'s Common Carrier Bureau, says the agency is examining I.S.D.N. and similar technologies. \"We believe the telephone companies may well have a point -- that circumstances have changed,\" he said. **********In the meantime, most of the big I.S.D.N. players have filed waiver petitions, hoping the agency will not require price increases to take effect before the new rule-making is finished. Under the circumstances, it's not likely the F.C.C. will respond kindly -- unless it gets a lot of heat from I.S.D.N. customers who want to keep their cheap, fast access to the Internet. **********That address, I believe, is isdn@fcc.gov. **********Denise Caruso, an information-technology analyst and commmentator based in San Francisco, will write this column on alternating Mondays."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/business/l-don-t-forget-about-american-coat-makers-158195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Don't Forget About American Coat Makers", "print_headline": "Don't Forget About American Coat Makers", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********It's somewhat unfair to view the layoff of 300 Ukrainian workers -- a result of curbs on Ukrainian coat exports -- as a way \"to shield a relative handful\" of coat makers in Maine and elsewhere (\"In Ukraine, a Free-Market Lesson Learned Too Well,\" Jan. 1).

And while it cannot be said that they have altered the face of the country, they have left an indelible mark in many areas, from science labs to concert halls. Even on the streets, there are signs in Russian at almost every turn. **********By many yardsticks, Israel is a success story for the Russians (and they are almost always called Russians here, regardless of their republics of origin). Most have jobs, nearly half own their own houses and, overwhelmingly, they tell pollsters that they see their future in Israel, no matter how flawed they may find it. **********But this remains an unusual group of immigrants -- top-heavy with doctors, scientists, engineers and musicians, too many for a small country to absorb even if policy makers did everything right. At least 70 percent are said to be working either entirely out of their fields or at levels well below the elite status many enjoyed in the Soviet Union. **********Perhaps more important, many are convinced that veteran Israelis are hostile to them, and they feel that political leaders ignore them, paying attention only when elections come around, which is about to happen again. **********They are disappointed, even angry. **********They are people like a middle-aged piano teacher who moved from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Jerusalem five years ago and would seem to have reason to be satisfied. She rents an apartment, owns a car and has a regular teaching job at a music school. She was well dressed as she stood the other day by a curbside bulletin board in downtown Jerusalem, scanning Russian-language notices for jobs and housing. **********But she was not happy. **********In Georgia, she said, declining to give her name, she worked at a higher level, heading a school department. Her apartment here is small. As for the quality of her Israeli students, she wrinkled her nose. \"Here,\" she said, \"children aren't used to working hard, and their parents don't ask them to work hard.\" **********\"There's no hope for the future,\" she said. \"Maybe for our kids, but not for us.\" **********Mr. Sharansky, a short, compact man of 47, hopes to tap this dissatisfaction with his new movement, which he may turn formally into a political party before the 1996 national elections. **********If he does -- and for now he keeps his cards close to the vest -- he might win as many as 5 or 6 of Parliament's 120 seats, opinion polls indicate. In Israel's multiparty coalition politics, that could be enough to make him a powerful figure, able to make or break governments the way various religious parties have done for years. **********And so, while some Israeli leaders might like to make this perennial dissident disappear, they lack that Soviet luxury and instead will probably have to deal more directly than they have with the issues raised by his new Movement for Israel and Immigration. **********His message is that Israel has a rare opportunity to transform itself economically through the talents of these immigrants, but has not done nearly enough to make the most of it. **********The 560,000 newcomers include 63,300 engineers (almost twice the number of Israeli-born engineers), 13,600 doctors (as many as those born here), 28,500 teachers, 5,200 scientists and 13,400 artists, writers and journalists. **********Worse, Mr. Sharansky says, perceived Government failures are scaring people who might otherwise come. As a result, Israel may miss a \"historic moment\" to bring in a million more Jews, most of them likely to come from Russia and Ukraine. **********\"For the first time in the history of Zionism, both the gates of Zion and the gates of the biggest Jewish communities are open,\" he said in an interview. \"Relatively small efforts that depend fully on us, not on Moscow or Washington, can bring tremendous results.\" **********He argues that Israel can attract those Jews mainly by improving life for the Russians already here, especially with jobs and housing. It cannot expect them to come because they burn as he did with Zionist ardor, he says. **********Many in this immigration wave are not even Jewish, with some estimates running as high as 30 percent. And most of the Jews have meager religious roots after decades of Communist oppression. Living in a Jewish state is, of itself, not necessarily enough for them. **********The Russians' concern about the availability of work can be seen in the decline in their numbers since this immigration's heyday five years ago. **********Nearly 185,000 arrived in 1990, in the Soviet Union's twilight. Then, the great rush subsided as the job picture blurred here and as Jews there waited to see how things would change. The yearly total has shrunk to roughly 65,000. **********Moreover, the people coming now are likely to be less educated. Those classified as \"scientific and academic professionals\" accounted for nearly 40 percent of the 1990 newcomers. Last year, the figure had slipped to 28 percent. Industrial and construction workers were 16 percent of the total in 1990. Last year, they were 25 percent. **********Still, 65,000 immigrants a year is high by historical standards -- testament, Israeli officials say, that they are doing something right. **********Even as the immigrants begin to blend into Israeli society, studies show that the Russians tend to \"ghettoize\" themselves by sticking together more than earlier immigrants. Veteran Israelis have a litany of complaints: that the Russians look with contempt on them as uncultured \"Levantines,\" that they expect opportunities never afforded previous generations of immigrants and are never satisfied with what they get, that they lack true Zionist values. **********Alexander Mirkin, who arrived from Moscow in 1991 and lives in Maale Adumim, a large West Bank settlement just outside Jerusalem, says some of the complaints are valid. \"Many Russians do whine,\" said Mr. Mirkin, a surveyor who started his new life here as a laborer in a carpentry shop. \"But I find that it's getting easier and easier here. You have to start somewhere and be willing to work hard.\" **********For their part, many other Russians feel that it is the Israelis who are contemptuous. They complain that the men are all stigmatized as gangsters and the women as prostitutes -- stereotypes that are indeed widely held. **********Resentments deepened last fall when Labor Minister Ora Namir pronounced herself \"very uneasy\" about recent immigrants, saying that nearly all of the adults were elderly or disabled or single parents -- dependent people dumped on Israel. **********Other officials later called Mrs. Namir's demographic portrait wildly exaggerated, but by then the damage was done. **********Even before that, many Russians were disillusioned with the Government. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised in his 1992 election campaign to make immigration a top priority, on a par with national security. He won thanks in part to Russian votes, which went to his Labor Party over the incumbent Likud by a ratio of well over 2 to 1. Since he took office, though, his attention has drifted elsewhere, and many immigrants feel taken for granted. **********Particularly glaring is the way Mr. Rabin has used hard-won United States guarantees on $10 billion worth of Israeli Government loans. Those guarantees, a source of great friction between Israel and Washington in 1991, were billed then as critical for housing all the Russians pouring in. **********Since 1992, Israel has raised $4.3 billion from private sources by using the loan guarantees to get favorable interest rates. But little, if any, of the money has been designated specifically for the Russians. About $2 billion sits in the bank as foreign reserves. Much of the rest went for road building and for credits to private businesses. **********By raising the threat of an immigrant political party in 1996, Mr. Sharansky wants to rechannel Government energies. He is well aware that in Israel nothing focuses a political leader like the prospect of a small party's bringing down his Government. **********A big question is whether immigrants will automatically support him. A similar party ran in 1992 and failed to win a single parliamentary seat. **********But there are many more newly arrived Russians now, with 400,000 expected be eligible to vote next year. Some polls show 40 percent to be ready to vote on ethnic lines, and that may be enough to get the major parties to pay attention. **********His ambition, Mr. Sharansky said, is not really to become a member of the Israeli Parliament. With a smile, he added, \"Then again, I didn't want to be a political prisoner either.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/09/business/gm-registering-shares-for-pension-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 259, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

It is uncertain whether he should play a round of golf, and if so, at which of the country's 250 proud golf courses. **********Since the trip was announced in May, Jean Kennedy Smith, the American Ambassador here, has been deluged with requests from politicians, local officials and ordinary citizens to send the President to their hometowns. Embassy officials have also been asked to bring the President to the official opening of a pig farm. **********The biggest question so far is who is really related to the President. The Cassidy Clan, on his mother's side, appeared to be in front of the field a month ago. They produced a 65-year-old farmer, Mick Cassidy, as a true cousin several times removed, descended from one Lucas Cassidy who emigrated in about 1750. Mr. Cassidy made no claims for himself, but he was accorded widespread publicity after he was interviewed and photographed by The Irish Times. **********But Mr. Cassidy lives in County Fermanagh, which is in Northern Ireland. If the President visited him, that could be seen as a slight to the other Cassidys who live here in the Irish Republic or to the putative ancestors on the President's father's side, who have the family names of Hayes and Ayres. Genealogists and genealogy buffs all over Ireland set out to wither the roots of the Fermanagh Cassidy. **********After weeks of research by its Genealogy Office in Dublin, the Irish Government has passed to the White House an opinion that Mick Cassidy's relation to Bill Clinton is highly dubious. Still, the Government has arranged for a Clinton heraldic banner and coat of arms to be made while the search for a certifiable cousin continues. **********For golf, the White House is said to be considering Ballybunion, in the western county of Kerry, the home of the Foreign Minister, Dick Spring. Mr. Spring was quoted last year as saying he had invited the President to Ballybunion and that acceptance was likely. But the American Embassy is getting many calls for the President to play elsewhere. A man from Cork, on the southeast coast, called in with statistics to prove that there was much less rain in Cork than in Kerry in December. **********There is a serious side to all this, of course, revolving principally around how Mr. Clinton (one eye on the Irish-American vote in the 1996 presidential campaign) might try to advance the Northern Ireland peace effort, now snagged in a dispute between the British Government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. **********Last week the Rev. Ian Paisley, the flamboyant Northern Ireland Protestant leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, predicted that the peace effort would be in such a shambles that the President would cancel his visit. But for the moment, the White House position is that the President will indeed come if the politicians are even close to starting all-party negotiations toward a peaceful settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/18/world/signs-in-wind-of-morocco-drug-crop.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1995-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Signs in Wind of Morocco Drug Crop", "print_headline": "Signs in Wind of Morocco Drug Crop", "body_text": " **********Scientists sampling the air in southern Spain the other day came across a surprising event, a great stream of marijuana pollen coming off the Mediterranean waters, carried by a warm southern wind. **********The pollen, though invisible to the naked eye, was measured along no less than a 250-mile stretch of the Spanish coast, from Estepona to Cartagena, and it reached more than 100 miles inland, beyond Cordoba. **********\"This is exceptional,\" said Eugenio Dominguez, coordinator of Spain's Network for Aerobiology, which detected the particles. \"We've never measured marijuana pollen in so many places.\" **********Researchers soon established that the tiny grains appearing in their microscopes were harbingers of a likely bumper crop of marijuana in Morocco, across the water some 25 miles to the south. At this time of year, they said, the great marijuana plantations are in flower along the north coast of Morocco between Tangiers and the Algerian border. **********\"No, you don't get high breathing this,\" Mr. Dominguez said by telephone from Cordoba, where he is a biology professor at the local university. \"We'd all be very cheerful by now, but the pollen does not contain the narcotic compound.\" **********While provoking chuckles among some scientists and potential customers, the wafts of pollen are also a reminder of a reality that many European officials have preferred to overlook: that Morocco is the largest supplier of marijuana to Europe and one of the world's leading hashish producers. Most of the country's marijuana crop is converted to hashish, its resin concentrate. **********Thanks to Europe's huge appetite for the thin-leafed plant, Moroccan farmers have multiplied their crop tenfold in the last two decades. **********In public, European governments have said little about Morocco's marijuana trade. The reticence stems partly from the need to remain on good terms with the country's leader, King Hassan II, at a time of mounting instability in neighboring Algeria. **********Officials monitoring the drug trade recognize that marijuana earns foreign currency for Moroccan farmers, and that without it the large number of immigrants heading to Western Europe would be even larger. **********In private, though, European Union governments have pleaded with the King and his Cabinet to curtail the crops and to clamp down on exports. The King reportedly agreed and in 1992 announced an eradication campaign against kif, as the plant is known locally. But Morocco still largely turns a blind eye to its most important export crop. **********One important part of the equation, diplomats and police officials in Spain and France concede, is Europe's own ambivalent attitude toward so-called soft drugs. **********While pressing Morocco and other drug producers and offering them aid to promote substitute crops, some European governments emit conflicting signals by removing penalties for the use of soft drugs and even tolerating production at home. **********In 1994, after an independent study concluded that Morocco's hashish production had reached an all-time high of 1,500 tons a year, a delegation from the European Union went to Morocco to ask its Government for a more serious crackdown. Its main concern, the delegation said, was that the Moroccan hashish network in Europe was also being used by cocaine and heroin traders. **********Morocco replied that if it were to comply, it would want more European aid in exchange, said an official familiar with the visit, who put Morocco's current hashish earnings at more than $2 billion dollars a year. Besides, the Europeans were asked, did it make sense for Morocco to eradicate a crop that sooner or later might become entirely acceptable in Europe? **********In the Netherlands, hundreds of soft-drug cafes openly sell hashish and marijuana, and Dutch plant breeders are growing such large amounts of cannabis in greenhouses that insiders predict that the Dutch market may soon be self-sufficient. **********Cannabis gardens, indoor and outdoor, also quietly flourish in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the last decade in much of Europe, the police have not punished people caught with small amounts of soft drugs. **********In Morocco, smoking hashish preceded the European habit. Along its north coast, marijuana fields have existed for more than a century, and farmers who turn their crop into hashish have long supplied tea houses from Tangier to the Sahara. The hashish pipe, usually smoked only by men, accompanies many a glass of sugary mint tea. **********In the past, Morocco's cannabis fields covered some 15,000 acres. But by 1993 they had expanded roughly tenfold, to more than 160,000 acres, said Geopolitical Drug Watch, a Paris-based private study group. **********Much of Morocco's exported hashish passes through Spain. Carlos Lopez Riano, the head of Spain's antidrug campaign, said he had heard about the fresh wave of marijuana pollen. \"We're on the alert,\" he said, explaining that Spain had expanded its coastal patrols and its vigilance at ports and airports in the last few years. **********\"Just the same, I hope they have a hailstorm that will destroy their crop,\" Mr. Lopez added. **********The scientists who discovered the cannabis pollen said they had not been looking for it. The spore traps in Spain are part of a Europe-wide warning system that tells people who have allergies when and where all kinds of pollen counts are high. And this, said Mr. Dominguez, who coordinates the network in Spain, is how the exceptional volumes of cannabis pollen were detected. **********\"Like it or not,\" he said laughing, \"these days, Big Brother is everywhere.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/business/inside-568195.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSIDE", "print_headline": "INSIDE", "body_text": " **********INVESTING IT /Page 4  Oakley, maker of Blades and M frames, hopes the rage for its sunglasses translates to its stock.

Tokyo says a three-decade-old agreement governing aviation between it and the United States is unfair and should be renegotiated. **********Japanese officials said they still hoped to resolve the matter through diplomacy, as the American sanctions do not take effect until the second half of next month at the earliest. If Japan imposed sanctions of its own, however, the tensions could increase. **********There was also some concern that the aviation dispute could disrupt efforts to arrive at a compromise in the two nations' pointed dispute over automotive trade. **********Officially, the United States and Japan both say that the aviation and auto issues are separate. But it seemed clear that in announcing the proposed aviation sanctions three days before last-ditch auto negotiations were to begin, Washington was sending a message of toughness to Tokyo. **********That message might well cause the Japanese to stiffen their position, at a time it seemed there had been some movement toward compromise in the auto talks. \"This is not going to help,\" a United States official involved in those negotiations said. **********The special session on cars and car parts is to take place in Geneva on Thursday and Friday. If there is no agreement to open Japanese markets by June 28, 100 percent tariffs on the import of 13 Japanese luxury cars into the United States will take effect. **********The Japanese have held off from imposing automotive countersanctions against American imports because it would be awkward for them to take such a step while arguing at the World Trade Organization that Washington's sanctions violated international trade rules. Aviation issues, however, are governed by separate agreements outside the new trade forum. **********Both disputes are potentially complicated by the attitude of Mr. Kamei, who as Transportation Minister would be involved in a settlement of the aviation dispute as well as the auto dispute. **********In April Mr. Kamei, a right-winger, said the United States was \"enslaving\" the Japanese people by keeping the dollar weak against the yen. It is thought that he might want to be seen standing up to the United States as a way of increasing his popularity, just as the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is said to have furthered his political ambitions by maintaining a strong stance on automotive trade. **********Tokyo's response to the threatened aviation sanctions came amid dismay from some Japanese officials, who had hoped for further negotiations. Officials said Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had requested more talks when he met with the American Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, last week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the economic summit meeting. **********Mr. Christopher turned down Japan's request, officials here say. But the Japanese were still under the impression that negotiations were possible. **********The United States said it was punishing the Japanese in the area of aviation because they had refused to grant Federal Express new routes beyond Japan to other Asian destinations, particularly to the new cargo-distribution hub it has built at Subic Bay, the former American naval base. Under a 1952 aviation agreement with Japan, approval of those routes should be automatic, the Americans say. **********Japan has argued that the 1952 accord, signed under the occupation and before it had its own international airlines, is biased in favor of American carriers and that in any case, the United States is violating it. It has said it will talk about the Federal Express routes in the context of a broad renegotiation of the agreement. **********Washington's threatened sanctions would bar Japan Airlines and Nippon Cargo Airlines from carrying to the United States some cargo picked up elsewhere in Asia and routed through Japan. Washington said it would consider barring such cargo from as many as five areas -- Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. **********Toyoichiro Nakata, president of Nippon Cargo Airlines, said at a news conference today that the United States had \"gone too far\" in proposing sanctions.

They sell their names and logos for use on jackets, T-shirts, mugs, caps and other goods through a central organization, NFL Properties. And at the end of the year, each of the 30 teams shares equally in the proceeds. No matter that the Dallas Cowboys alone account for one-fifth of all sales of N.F.L. merchandise, nearly twice as much as the next best team. **********Enter Jerry Jones, the Arkansas oilman who in 1989 acquired the Cowboys and their stadium for $140 million. Mr. Jones's mantra is that teams can market themselves on their own much better than does NFL Properties, and he has set out to prove it in ways that are enraging the league. **********Last month, he gleefully tweaked the league when he told Coca-Cola, an NFL Properties sponsor whose soda is poured in 28 of 30 N.F.L. stadiums, that it was out, replaced by Pepsi-Cola and Dr. Pepper, in a 10-year, $25 million deal. Then, this month, he struck a deal with Nike, which is not an N.F.L. sponsor, that stunned the league and the many companies with which it does business. For the price of $2.5 million a year through 2001, he let Nike paint its trademark swoosh on the Cowboys' stadium, develop a theme park at the stadium, and outfit all Cowboys coaches and other sideline personnel in Nike-made attire. **********Mr. Jones flaunted his deal during a nationally televised Monday night game against the Giants at Giants Stadium. He distributed a news release that blared \"Cowboys Owner Bucks N.F.L. Again,\" and strode to his team's sideline with Phil Knight, the chairman of Nike, and Monica Seles, the tennis star and Nike endorser. **********Mr. Jones has even called for the end of NFL Properties, to encourage each team to pursue individual entrepreneurial success. \"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to do better than they did,\" he said. \"You wake up in the middle of the night thinking of ideas.\" **********Now the league has decided enough is enough, and is taking the extraordinary step of suing one of its own. Last Monday, it took on Mr. Jones in United States District Court in New York, seeking $300 million in damages. It contended, among other points, that Mr. Jones had embarked on a \"wrongful plan and scheme to destroy the structure and operations of NFL Properties in order to gain for the Cowboys more than an equal share of licensing revenue.\" **********It is a debate that is energetically argued in many fields, from Hollywood to law to consulting to finance. The biggest producers tend to believe that everyone should eat what he kills, while their colleagues favor throwing everything into a common pot. Just as bankable movie stars now insist on fees 50 times greater than the supporting actors and just as investment bankers bargain for huge bonuses linked to their own deals, Mr. Jones wants an end to one-for-all-and-all-for-one. **********And when everyone cannot come to terms, an organization can come apart at the seams. **********The dispute also raises an issue that dogs all the professional sports leagues. Is the N.F.L. a single business that competes in the market for entertainment, the way McDonald's competes in the restaurant market? Or is it a group of independent businesses conspiring to dominate the professional football industry? Not surprisingly, sports leagues have been loathe to touch the question: an unfavorable answer would open them to antitrust suits, blowing away the authority they exercise in everything from the division of television revenues to collective bargaining with players. **********A day after the lawsuit was filed, Mr. Jones alighted at a special owners' meeting in Atlanta, where his 29 brethren and league officials questioned his renegade philosophy. While he muted his often rousing rhetoric, he nonetheless said he had done nothing wrong. **********\"In my mind, there is no issue of the rules not being followed,\" he said. Nike, Pepsico and Dr. Pepper struck sponsorship deals not with the team but with the stadium, he said, and therefore did not fall under N.F.L. restrictions. **********Mr. Jones is now rumored to be on the verge of a deal with American Express, which the league believes would ambush its sponsorship deal with Visa U.S.A., which just began, and a deal with AT&T, a rival to GTE, another NFL Properties sponsor. **********\"This is a big crack in Properties,\" said Michael Beindorff, executive vice president of Visa U.S.A., the San Mateo, Calif., credit card company. \"We're very concerned because we've invested a lot of money in time, planning and strategy in this unique five-year relationship.\" **********PAUL TAGLIABUE, the N.F.L. Commissioner, and Sara Levinson, the president of NFL Properties, who was recruited a year ago from MTV, argue that Mr. Jones is working against the best interests of the other teams, and that what's good for the league is good for every team. **********They paint an Armageddon-like scenario if Mr. Jones's free-enterprise system defeats the N.F.L.'s brand of socialism. They see the value of sponsorships and licenses falling, declining product quality, and the destruction of NFL Properties' carefully designed and highly integrated methods of promoting the league. All this is spoiling a time when NFL Properties' revenue, from 325 licensees and 35 corporate sponsors currently, has grown nearly 400 percent since 1988. **********\"It's impossible to pull out one area of Properties without destroying the entire fabric of what we're doing,\" Ms. Levinson said. \"To build an audience, you have to promote the game through what we, the sponsors and retailer do.\" **********NFL Properties abhors chaos and any attempt to divert it from its course. As a promotional machine, only the National Basketball Association is its peer. In addition to awarding product licenses and selling sponsorships, it plans the Super Bowl. It executes large national promotions and sweepstakes like Coca-Cola's \"Monsters of the Gridiron,\" Gatorade's \"Punt, Pass & Kick,\" and a Hershey's Super Bowl sweepstakes with coupons on 100 million candy products. And it stages the N.F.L. Experience, an theme park at the Super Bowl. **********The battle between Mr. Jones and the N.F.L. is particularly fiery because the Cowboys are a valuable asset, trading on the three decades of nearly unbroken national fame, from the days of Tom Landry and Don Meredith, through the current reign of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin. **********\"This wouldn't be happening if it were the Tampa Bay Buccaneers doing this,\" said George Daly, dean of the Stern School of Business at New York University. **********In 1990, when the Cowboys' record stood at 1-15, merchandise with the Cowboys name and logo accounted for just 2 percent of the retail sales of NFL Properties' licensees. At that time, the struggling team actually benefited from the revenue-sharing arrangement. **********But by 1992, the share had risen to 16.9 percent. It peaked at 27.8 percent in 1993, and is now at 20.3 percent, still far greater than the second-place San Francisco 49ers, at 11.3 percent. **********\"I'd be doing this if we were still at 2 percent,\" Mr. Jones said. **********The two sides could compromise on a formula that guarantees teams a minimum payment from NFL Properties, but would reward those that sold the most with extra payments. Or the league could allow teams to solicit sponsorships from companies in product categories not pursued by NFL Properties. **********\"They have to change,\" said Frank Vuono, president of Integrated Sports International, an East Rutherford, N.J., sports marketing company and a former NFL Properties vice president. \"The rules were created for owners who didn't own their own stadiums and didn't spend $200 million for their teams. There's room for mediation, and the business-oriented owners know it. But Jerry's forcing the rest of them not to trust him. He's telling sponsors that he'll deliver the most prominent team in the league, get them on 'Monday Night Football' and make it worthwhile not to sponsor the N.F.L. -- and do it at a cheaper price.\" **********If the lawsuit goes to trial, the focus will be on the N.F.L.'s inner operations and could examine the antitrust implications of a partnership whose members cooperate by sharing their gate receipts, television fees and NFL Properties revenues. **********Some experts on sports business support the N.F.L. \"Tagliabue is right,\" said Mr. Daly of the Stern Business School at New York University, who has done work for the league. \"If you want to maximize the value of what's produced, you do it on a coordinated basis.\" **********He said he agreed with the N.F.L.'s view that a sponsorship deal involving the Cowboys stadium is the same as a deal with the team itself. \"You can no more separate a stadium from a team than you can the left guard from the quarterback.\" **********BUT Paul Weiler, a professor at the Harvard Law School, disagreed. \"Jones is right as a matter of law,\" he said. **********Professor Weiler said one issue was \"whether an NFL Properties exclusive contract can be extended to cover stadium licenses.\" More important, he said, is \"whether the contract violates antitrust law as a restraint of trade.\" Lacking an antitrust exemption to market on a leaguewide basis, \"the N.F.L. clearly does not have the right to control stadium deals,\" Professor Weiler said. **********Still, said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, antitrust law has usually been applied with restraint to the governance of sports leagues. \"Courts do look at the structure of leagues and exempt certain centralized activities,\" he said. **********Mr. Jones is a rogue in a league with few others, except the Oakland Raiders' Al Davis, who successfully challenged the N.F.L.'s right to control the relocation of a franchise when he moved from Oakland to Los Angeles. His return to Oakland caused the league last month to file suit. **********Mr. Davis, president of the team's general partnership, obliquely criticized the suit against Mr. Jones. \"I like the way he does business,\" Mr. Davis said. \"He's a winner.\" He would not say whether he would buck NFL Properties, as Mr. Jones has. He probably cannot: he does not own the team and the stadium he plays in, in contrast with Mr. Jones, the Miami Dolphins' H. Wayne Huizenga and the New England Patriots' Robert Kraft. **********Mr. Jones said he had no problem with sharing television and gate revenues. One critic, Tom Shine, president of Logo Athletic, the apparel maker and second-largest NFL Properties licensee, said: \"He likes some rules and not some others. This isn't a buffet line.\" **********But Mr. Jones thinks he has the right to choose his team's apparel, control his sidelines and select any sponsors he wants for his stadium. **********\"Jerry is shaking up the status quo and we're glad to be part of it,\" said Brad Shaw, a spokesman for Pepsico. **********NIKE also seems pleased. Indeed, Mr. Jones and Mr. Knight made for a perfect mating of business renegades. Mr. Knight has proudly built a company -- its slogan, \"Just Do It,\" summarizes its philosophy -- that is known for flouting the sports bureaucracy. Frustrated in its attempts to become a league licensee, Nike made an end-run, assured by Mr. Jones that it was doing no wrong. **********\"We are pleased to have an agreement with Jerry Jones, which we believe will prove to be good for the sport,\" said Keith Peters, a company spokesman, who added that Nike still wants to become a licensee. **********How will this battle conclude? The Federal court may eventually tell the combatants to settle before it imposes a plan. That scenario led to the creation of the league's current free agency plan with the players' union. Mr. Jones may be pushing the limits, in hopes that the league will partly agree. Mr. Tagliabue, who has never been as publicly angry as he was at last Tuesday's owners' meeting, may not be so willing. Pat Bowlen, the owner of the Denver Broncos, said: \"I'd like to think there could be a negotiated settlement with Jerry, but I doubt it. The only solution may be for Jerry to come home.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/business/company-news-clark-equipment-shares-up-53-on-takeover-threat.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLARK EQUIPMENT SHARES UP 53% ON TAKEOVER THREAT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CLARK EQUIPMENT SHARES UP 53% ON TAKEOVER THREAT", "body_text": " **********Shares of the Clark Equipment Company rose 53 percent yesterday in the wake of the Ingersoll-Rand Company's threat to undertake a $1.34 billion hostile takeover of the construction-machinery maker.

Kiernan 3d, the partner who, with Joseph R. Zimmel, heads Goldman's communications media and entertainment division. \"The velocity of change is so great, people are constantly looking for market judgments and advisory judgments.\" **********Frank J. Biondi, president and chief executive of Viacom, said: \"The values in these business have gone up so much, you're seeing an awful lot of people coming into the market. It's become a prime market for mergers and acquisitions and capital markets and a big business by anybody's standards, including Wall Street's.\" **********Goldman and more recent arrivals to investment banking in the communications and technology area may have to work especially hard to edge out the traditional heavy hitters. **********Lazard, for example, continues to dominate these businesses, according to Securities Data, a research company based in New Jersey. According to Securities Data, for the period this year through June 21, Lazard led investment banking firms in providing advice for mergers and acquisitions in the radio, television, cable, video, software, telecommunications and communications equipment industries. The value of the transactions was put at $16 billion. **********During the same period, CS First Boston advised on $11.7 billion of such transactions, and Goldman on $6.7 billion.But when it came to raising capital, the rankings change. So far this year, Goldman leads in managing initial public offerings for these industries. **********Another measure of Goldman's growing stature in the telecommunications and technology world could be found in Lazard's recent attempt to woo John L. Thornton, a Goldman partner. Mr. Thornton, who has increasingly become the favored investment banker of Rupert Murdoch, the media tycoon, remains at Goldman. **********At the moment, it looks as though there should be enough contracts to go around, particularly as many transactions involve at least two, and sometimes as many as half a dozen, investment banks. This is to sidestep potential conflicts of interest. And often there is a need for a number of investment banks to fill a variety of roles -- to provide advice on mergers and acquisitions, for example, or to give fairness opinions, or to raise debt and equity capital. **********\"This is a gigantic business,\" said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers who follows telecommunications and related industries. He estimated that the media, telecommunications and entertainment industries in the United States alone would be raising upward of $30 billion in capital over the next two years. **********Seeking that market, Goldman has \"essentially built its businesses on client relationships that go back a long way,\" said Mr. Kiernan, checking off long-standing relationships with companies like Knight-Ridder; Dow Jones & Company Inc.; ; Times Mirror Company, and Seagram Company, which recently bought 80 percent of MCA. **********In fact, over the last five years, the fees Goldman earns from information-related businesses have more than tripled, insiders at the firm say. This means that such fees add hundreds of millions of dollars each year to the firm's coffers. **********In its haste to increase such business, though, Goldman has sometimes stumbled. Last year, the firm had to pull out of a planned public offering for TeleWest, the cable joint venture based in Britain between U.S. West and Tele-Communications Inc.Goldman was at the same time raising capital for B Sky B, Rupert Murdoch's cable company. **********\"We switched to Morgan Stanley,\" said Douglas M. Regan, TeleWest's director of investor relations. \"B Sky B was the conflict. Everybody understands the state of play. I'm sure they were sad to lose the business.\" **********Furthermore, Goldman's decision to play only a negligible role in the high-yield debt market initially hampered its ability to win business from cable companies. \"We're strong in TV and radio, but at first we missed the boat on cable,\" said Willard J. Overlock, the Goldman partner who heads the mergers and acquisitions business. **********The once and future clients of the investment firms like being fought over. \"The good news is there now are a lot of people out there who are knowledgeable and effective, and that's why we've used different people,\" said Mr. Biondi of Viacom. He names some of the investment bankers that his company used recently: Allen & Company for strategic advice; Smith Barney and Goldman as investment bank advisers in Viacom's takeover of Blockbuster and Paramount; Bear, Stearns in Viacom's recent $1 billion capital raising, and Wasserstein Perella & Company for advice on some cable television acquisitions. **********Meantime, Lazard questions the new investment banking muscle coming into its traditional area of expertise. \"Clients figured out a long time ago that there's brains and there's brawn, and if they want to they can go one place for one, and one place for the other,\" said Steven Rattner, a Lazard managing director, who runs his firm's media and entertainment division."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/business/funds-watch-some-see-a-better-year-for-domestic-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1995-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some See a Better Year for Domestic Bonds", "print_headline": "FUNDS WATCH; Some See a Better Year for Domestic Bonds", "body_text": " **********The last shall be first. **********That's the story behind a rally in municipal bond funds this year.

The technology, in essence, controls the valves in an engine electronically and eliminates the need for a mechanical camshaft. **********The result could be an automobile with fuel economy and horsepower improvements of 10 to 15 percent and decreased air pollution. **********Such a feat would have been discounted by auto makers only a few years ago. They have long insisted that greater fuel efficiency could be obtained only with pint-sized and, consequently, unsafe cars. **********But regulation often drives innovation. Changes in California's environmental rules will require that by 1998, 2 percent of all new vehicles emit no pollutants. And the Federal Government is working with auto makers to develop a car that achieves fuel economy of 80 miles a gallon by 2002. **********To meet ever-increasing demands for fuel efficiency and cleanliness, auto makers have been striving to improve traditional engines rather than switch entirely to ultra-clean electric engines because of the limited ability of batteries to power a car. **********Domestic auto makers hope to overcome the inherent tradeoff of greater speed for fuel economy by eliminating an engine mainstay: the camshaft. Because the camshaft relies on cams in set positions to open and close the valves of an engine, it can optimize the burning of fuel at only a limited range of engine speeds, usually from 45 to 50 miles an hour. **********Ford has been studying an electronic valve system for the last five years, and Rod J. Tabaczynski, director of Ford's power train research laboratory in Dearborn, Mich., said that all auto companies were seriously considering various approaches to the technology. **********\"The advantages are significant,\" Mr. Tabaczynski said, adding that he expected to see electronic valve control on a wide scale within 10 years. **********Both the Chrysler Corporation and the General Motors Corporation are evaluating the technology, but have nothing planned for production. Floyd Allen, executive engineer of power train engineering for Chrysler in Auburn Hills, Mich., said the technology was \"very promising,\" but the speed of activating the valves was not yet reliable. **********THE Honda Motor Company is relying on its camshaft-driven variable timing and emissions control, or VTEC, engine, which was unveiled in 1990 to meet new pollution standards. To provide additional power at high speeds, the engine switches from one set of lobes, which control the speed and height of the valves, to another. But Honda has no plans to move to an engine whose valves are operated entirely electronically. **********On Jan. 6, Honda introduced the first engine certified to meet new California standards. Based on the VTEC, the new engine will run on cleaner-burning reformulated gasoline and is expected to reduce exhaust emissions by 90 percent from current California emissions standards. **********One electronic-valve technique is being promoted by Aura Systems Inc., a small El Segundo, Calif., company with a patented technology -- although a financially checkered history. Aura's approach would replace the camshaft with an electronic system that automatically opens and closes the valves. **********Timing the valves electronically would allow the sequence at which they opened and closed to change as driving conditions changed, optimizing the performance of the engine at any speed. The system uses a computer to direct the engine valves and varies the amount of air being pushed through the engine, which is needed for combustion to occur. **********Aura's system, called electromagnetic valve actuation, relies on electromagnets to control the system. A car's existing computer system sends commands for valve positions to a module the same way it sends commands for fuel injection. **********In fuel injection, an electronic fuel injector determines the revolutions per minute of the engine, and is told by a computer when to open and close an actuator or valve, which causes the fuel to be injected into the cylinder. With the Aura system, a controller like the electronic fuel injector will determine fuel usage and the way to maximize horsepower. **********For a valve to open, the engine computer sends small command signals to an electronic module that controls the power to the Aura unit. The power shuts off the current to one of the electromagnets, releasing an armature and cocking a spring. The spring is pulled down to a second electromagnet, which locks the valve into position. **********The Aura process can open and close engine valves in less than three-thousandths of a second, and takes only one-half horsepower of energy to operate, compared with a typical camshaft, which requires 3 to 5 horsepower to operate. **********RON GOLDSTEIN, senior vice president of Aura, said the system had the potential to increase fuel economy by as much as 30 percent, depending on engine type, and could reduce automobile air pollution by 25 percent. **********The Aura system varies the amount of air being pushed through the engine, so it can develop the ideal mixture of air and fuel, which has an effect on speed, engine performance and emissions. For example, at high speeds, the computer could program the valves to open more, allowing the intake of more air to better power the engine. **********\"I would be surprised if every manufacturer wasn't looking at this,\" said John German, an engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., who said the camshaft had always been a compromise. \"The ability to open and close valves as you want and vary it on the condition has always been a goal.\" **********But Mr. German pointed out that a manufacturer had yet to design a system that worked precisely, quickly, reliably and inexpensively. **********And it is unclear whether Aura's approach would be one of those adopted. Aura said that it had contracts with the Cummins Engine Company in Columbus, Ind., and several large auto makers, which the company would not identify, to evaluate the system. **********Aura will not go far with the system without a big partner, because of its troubled financial history. A series of its auditors have resigned in disputes about accounting, and in 1992 the company became the target of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the trading of its stock -- an investigation the company did not disclose until last summer. And last year the company paid $6 million to settle several class-action suits from shareholders who contended that the company had inflated its revenue projections and misrepresented the viability of its technology. **********Yuki Hosoi, assistant to the vice president of Yamaha Motor U.S.A., in Cypress City, Calif., which has a contract with Aura to evaluate the technology, said it offered great \"possibilities\" in performance, emissions benefits, and cost. While the valve system is comparable in weight and size to the camshaft, he said, it contains half as many parts, making it simpler to assemble and produce. **********Mr. Tabaczynski of Ford said another advantage of electronic-valve technology generally was its ability to burn fuel thoroughly in all driving conditions. That allows for an extremely smooth-running engine, and could reduce hydrocarbon emissions by 10 to 20 percent. **********Mr. Tabaczynski added that the system appeared to be no more expensive than the existing camshaft. \"It's more a function issue,\" he said. If the operational issues can be overcome, he added, there \"would be no inherent reason not to do this on every engine.\" **********The greatest potential drawback to the technology, Mr. Tabaczynski said, is that it might create too much friction in the valves, which could affect efficiency. In addition, the auto makers need assurances that the electronic system could withstand extremes of temperature. **********IF electronic-valve systems can be made to work, and perform economically, \"it could be a real asset to engine technology,\" said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation in Ann Arbor, Mich. He pointed out that the mechanical process using the camshaft took years to gain wide acceptance, and the electronic system could face similar obstacles. **********But, he said, the benefits could be worth the effort. \"If someone has a way to do it and it's validated,\" he said, \"it could be a real winner.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/business/dow-sets-another-record-on-rate-cut-expectations.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1995-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Sets Another Record On Rate-Cut Expectations", "print_headline": "Dow Sets Another Record On Rate-Cut Expectations", "body_text": " **********After two days of treading water, the stock market rose sharply yesterday to record levels, mainly on the strength of an accelerating rally in a bond market convinced that the Federal Reserve is about to cut short-term interest rates. **********The Dow Jones industrial average surged 42.54 points, to 4,589.64, posting its 40th record advance this year. **********Goaded by fresh evidence that the economy was slowing -- this time, by a large jump in unemployment claims -- bond traders sent corporate borrowing costs plummeting, helping to lift prices in the leading stock indexes. Indeed, interest rates fell so far that at one brief point in the session long-term interest rates were less than short-term interest rates, a reversal of the usual notion of risk. **********Trading in stocks was unusually heavy as a result, with 422 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, a level normally seen only on days when stock-related options expire and traders are forced to buy and sell shares. **********Meanwhile, the value of the dollar, which would be hurt by an interest-rate cut, rose. Some analysts said the rise, in a thinly traded currency market, resulted in part from some traders moving to the sidelines in advance of the Fed's July 5 policy meeting at which Fed governors will debate a cut in rates. **********The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index headed even higher on a percentage basis, 1.3 percent, compared with 0.94 percent for the Dow. The S.& P. rose 7.09 points, to a record 551.07. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index gained 10.90 points, to 940.09, also a new high. **********The stock market rally has dazzled analysts. So far this year, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 have each risen nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq index more than 25 percent. The American Stock Exchange computer technology index, an index of 26 of the high-tech stocks that have largely led the market, has risen nearly 45 percent. **********The initial spark for the bond rally and, an hour later, the stock rally was the Labor Department's report that weekly jobless claims hit a 17-month high last week. While these numbers are often volatile, they give clues to the more important monthly job-creation data, which is next scheduled for release on July 7. Many bond traders are betting that the job-creation data will be so weak that the Fed will authorize an interest-rate cut either before or shortly after the report. **********Bond yields fell. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 6.47 percent from 6.54 percent. Briefly, the 10-year Treasury bond's yield fell to 5.995 percent, or less than 6 percent, the Federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks. It ended the day at 6.03 percent. **********\"Is the bond market overinterpreting the weekly jobless claims? Of course,\" said Neal M. Soss, co-founder of Soss & Cotton, an economic consulting firm. \"But it's the only new information they have.\" **********Moreover, how much the Fed cuts may prove to be as tricky as whether it should cut at all, some analysts say. David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading for the Swiss Bank Corporation, said he doubted that the Fed would cut rates soon. **********But if the Fed cuts a relatively small one-quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, it may send the wrong signal to the financial markets. \"The currency market will sell off and it'll be very bad,\" Mr. De Rosa said. \"Twenty-five basis points will look like a political concession and that they really didn't want to do it. Twenty-five has the ugly connotation that the Fed may have compromised itself.\" **********A cut of half a point, or 50 basis points, would look like a policy decision, he said, and may have the paradoxical outcome of prompting only a minor drop in the value of the dollar. **********The dollar rose to 84.54 Japanese yen from 84.04 and to 1.3981 German marks from 1.3844 marks. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.32 points, to 294.93, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining issues by 1,536 to 745. The American Stock Exchange composite index climbed 1.90 points, to 495.97. **********Among advancing stocks was UAL, parent of United Airlines, which jumped 5 5/8, to 141 1/8, after securities analysts said they expected earnings to be higher than previously estimated. International Paper rose 3 3/8, to 82 3/4, on speculation that the Fed would cut interest rates, thus lowering borrowing costs for the capital-intensive paper business. **********Among declining stocks was Digi International, a telecommunications equipment company, which fell 4, to 21 3/4.

But last week, when Mr. Bronfman reached a coveted distribution agreement with the new studio Dreamworks SKG, he was indeed looking like a movie mogul. **********David Geffen, one of Dreamworks' three principals, along with the film director Steven Spielberg and the producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, said that \"while I think the deal would likely have happened with Ovitz there, it was made very much more quickly with Bronfman.\" **********The workings of all major industries involve a mixture of ego, image and economic muscle, but nowhere is this truer than in the entertainment industry. At stake in Mr. Bronfman's takeover of MCA is the future of an entertainment conglomerate that creates films and television shows that occupy the leisure time of millions of Americans. **********It is too soon to know whether the projected $1 billion in revenue from the Dreamworks agreement will prove profitable or paltry, just as it is impossible to know whether Mr. Bronfman was smart or faint-hearted in balking at Mr. Ovitz's demands. **********Press accounts at the time said Mr. Ovitz was seeking a compensation package worth $250 million. But people familiar with the negotiations say Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Bronfman's friend and longtime business adviser, wanted much more: a total of at least $360 million made up of $285 million in MCA stock, $50 million in salary over 10 years, $25 million in Seagram stock, plus a bonus of unknown size. **********Neither Mr. Bronfman nor Mr. Ovitz would be interviewed for this article. **********\"By the standards of modern American business, it appears to have been a colossal deal for Mr. Ovitz,\" said Graef Crystal, an expert on executive compensation and author of \"In Search of Excess.\" **********\"It sounds as if it would have been history's largest base salary and history's largest stock-option grant, ahead of Steve Ross,\" Mr. Crystal said, referring to $215 million in stock options the late Mr. Ross received when his Warner Communications merged with Time Inc. in 1990. **********In any case, the Ovitz and Dreamworks episodes illustrate the extent to which the 40-year-old Mr. Bronfman, in seeking to use Seagram shareholders' wealth to inject new energy into MCA, will find himself tested by the art of the deal, Hollywood-style. **********The last two weeks may also demonstrate that Mr. Bronfman's $5.7 billion purchase of 80 percent of MCA from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company was probably the easy part. That deal came together in weeks and Seagram formally completed the purchase on June 5, the same day it announced the end of negotiations with Mr. Ovitz. **********In contrast, Mr. Bronfman's scuttled courtship with Mr. Ovitz was a protracted affair -- although one whose unraveling became entwined with the successful pursuit of the Dreamworks deal. **********That Mr. Bronfman would turn to Mr. Ovitz made sense in many ways. When Mr. Bronfman briefly worked in Hollywood in movie production while in his 20's, he made a number of highly visible friends whom he kept after joining Seagram, the family liquor and spirits business. Later Mr. Bronfman welcomed Mr. Ovitz, head of the leading talent house, Creative Artists Agency, to that group. It was Mr. Ovitz, informants say, who counseled Mr. Bronfman during the acquisition of MCA. **********The two men began talking early in April, after the MCA agreement, about the possibility of Mr. Ovitz's running MCA. But these were only general conversations because Mr. Bronfman's first order of business was working out a graceful way to change the relationship of MCA's longtime chairman, Lew R. Wasserman, and its president, Sidney J. Sheinberg, to the company. These were men he could not afford to offend. **********Mr. Wasserman, 82, is a highly respected Hollywood elder, while Mr. Sheinberg, 60, is a close friend and mentor to Mr. Spielberg, whose films for MCA have generated the bulk of the studio's profit in recent years. Mr. Geffen has remained close to MCA since selling his Geffen Records label to the company in 1989, a deal that made him extraordinarily wealthy. **********In time, Mr. Bronfman arranged for Mr. Wasserman to stay on as chairman emeritus of MCA, and Mr. Sheinberg is expected to receive a lucrative production deal at Universal Studios. **********It was not until mid-May that Mr. Bronfman began to seriously consider the terms Mr. Ovitz had proposed, several people close to the talks said. They added that Mr. Ovitz wanted a 4 percent equity stake in MCA, with an estimated value of $285 million, on top of the $50 million in salary, the bonus and the Seagram shares. **********Executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Ovitz demanded a high price because he knew he would have to sell his 56 percent stake in Creative Artists Agency, and his departure would inevitably reduce the value of that stake. Federal rules prevent movie studios from being involved in the talent-agency business. **********For several weeks, the talks continued in New York and Los Angeles, though they focused more on the future of MCA than the specifics of Mr. Ovitz's proposal, according to those familiar with the discussions. But things were not going all that smoothly. During that time, Mr. Ovitz varied his demands. For example, he sought to bring an ever-growing number of people from Creative Artists to MCA. **********By May 31, when Edgar Bronfman Jr. flew to Montreal for a Seagram board meeting and the company's annual meeting, he and Mr. Ovitz had yet to come to terms. The board was informed that discussions were continuing and that no preliminary agreement had been reached, according to one person with knowledge of the talks. **********By then, too, there were objections from his father, Edgar M. Bronfman, Seagram's chairman, and his uncle, Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the board. **********Bronfman family trust funds control 31 percent of Seagram's stock. **********Charles Bronfman, in particular, had been skeptical of his nephew's investment in MCA and questioned him extensively about the deal during board room meetings, according to executives close to the discussions. He had little patience with Mr. Ovitz's demands. **********On June 1, the day after the board meeting, Mr. Bronfman and his lawyers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett proposed the basis of an alternative deal to Mr. Ovitz in Los Angeles and to his adviser Ronald L. Olson, of the Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, who was in New York. Mr. Ovitz had wanted his $285 million in MCA equity in the form of restricted shares -- special stock that he would receive at basically no cost to himself. **********Suppose, Mr. Bronfman said, that Seagram asked him to invest about $75 million of his own money in MCA -- perhaps through a low-interest loan from Seagram. The remaining $210 million would come in the form of stock options -- which are the right, but not the obligation, to buy stock, generally at the market price. Because MCA is a unit of Seagram and has no publicly traded shares, Mr. Ovitz's $75 million investment would have bought him 1 percent of the company outright. He would also receive stock options that would have given him 3 percent more of the company at the end of the 10-year agreement. **********With this counteroffer, Mr. Bronfman effectively rejected the idea of giving Mr. Ovitz a stake in MCA for nothing. **********Several people believe that if the two sides had come to terms earlier, Mr. Ovitz might have attained somewhat more of his original demands. **********The new proposal evidently did not sit well with Mr. Ovitz, and by Thursday evening Mr. Bronfman was telling some associates that it was still tough to predict if an agreement could be reached. **********One of his confidants was Mr. Geffen. Meeting in the Fifth Avenue apartment Mr. Geffen uses when he is not in Beverly Hills, Mr. Bronfman disclosed that the negotiations had taken a difficult turn. He said he hoped that Mr. Geffen and Dreamworks would still be willing to discuss a distribution deal with MCA before talking to other studios, even if Mr. Ovitz did not come aboard. **********Mr. Geffen, as well as his Dreamworks associate Mr. Katzenberg, have long had chilly relations with Mr. Ovitz, according to industry experts. The third Dreamworks partner, Mr. Spielberg, is represented by Mr. Ovitz. **********Yes, Mr. Geffen told Mr. Bronfman, Dreamworks would still be willing to talk. **********Although the negotiations between Mr. Bronfman and Mr. Ovitz seemed to be souring by Friday morning, Mr. Bronfman had not totally given up. He told one associate that perhaps the two sides could still come to terms. But by now, the prospect of an agreement with Dreamworks might have made it easier for him to take a tough stand with Mr. Ovitz. **********Late into Friday evening, and throughout the weekend, Mr. Olson was in New York with Seagram's lawyers, though those efforts were \"the death rattle\" of the deal, as one person familiar with the negotiations described them. **********Even the revised proposal would still have been among the top two most generous deals in corporate history, Mr. Crystal, the corporate compensation expert, said. Industry executives say Mr. Ovitz may have been getting cold feet about the deal partly because he was giving up a position as perhaps the most powerful man Hollywood for a job that would have made him a Seagram's employee. **********\"There was no magic bullet,\" an executive close to the talks said. \"It dawned on everybody for different reasons that the gap was no closer to closing than when they first started. So they concluded that it was just not going to work.\" **********The collapse of the deal was seen as a setback to the calculated agenda of Mr. Bronfman, who had to admit that he had no backup plan and said he would oversee MCA himself for a while. But the speed of the Dreamworks deal with MCA -- it was forged in just 90 minutes between Mr. Bronfman, Mr. Geffen, his friend of 20 years, and Thomas P. Pollock, the Universal Studios president -- contrasted vividly with the tortured talks with Mr. Ovitz. Wall Street analysts said it was positive for Mr. Bronfman. **********Over the long term, though, the outcome may have been more damaging to Mr. Ovitz, the superagent. The consensus in Hollywood now is that his priorities seem blurred, raising questions about how much loyalty he may retain from his troops and his clients in the future. **********Although some agents at Creative Artists are now restless, no one is expected to leave before early next year, when C.A.A. agents pick up their annual bonuses. **********The final act of the Ovitz-Bronfman drama was in many ways anticlimactic. Mr. Ovtiz picked up the phone to call Mr. Bronfman and inform him that he was no longer interested. Mr. Bronfman, according to friends, was waiting for the call."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/business/big-companies-in-mexico-among-the-peso-s-worst-victims.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1995-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 935, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Companies in Mexico Among the Peso's Worst Victims", "print_headline": "Big Companies in Mexico Among the Peso's Worst Victims", "body_text": " **********The first reports detailing the impact of the peso devaluation on businesses in Mexico paint a brutal picture of huge foreign-exchange losses, steep declines in sales and an erosion of confidence so great that even the most ambitious expansion plans are being scuttled. **********Wal-Mart, which was gung-ho on Mexico before the devaluation on Dec. 20, announced last week that it had shelved plans to open 24 new stores in Mexico in 1995. \"They are temporarily on hold,\" a Wal-Mart spokesman, Gerardo Ruiz, said. \"We are monitoring the situation daily.\" **********Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have temporarily shut down their Mexican assembly lines to clear inventories that have ballooned since the peso was devalued last month, and sales dropped about 40 percent. In that time, the peso has lost 39.65 percent of its value against the dollar. **********Mexico's largest banks reported foreign exchange losses during the last two weeks of 1994 that were big enough to drag down balance sheets for the entire year. Banamex, the nation's biggest bank, lost $234 million in the fourth quarter and reduced its total net income to about 17 percent of what it had been in 1993. **********Mexico's biggest companies have also reported enormous losses. Cemex, one of the world's largest cement companies, reported $127 million in foreign-exchange losses. The devaluation cost Televisa, the powerful media company, $142 million. **********And the biggest Mexican company of all, Telefonos de Mexico, was hit with a fourth-quarter foreign-exchange loss of $862 million. **********Analysts say that despite such losses, many companies will soften the effect of the devaluation by taking the huge losses on their 1994 taxes. Still, investor concern about company performance, and worries over the prospects for a $40 billion package of loan guarantees from the United States, has depressed the Mexican stock market. Last week, the market dropped more than 5 percent and closed at 1,957.65, its lowest level in nine months. **********Inflation is the Government's big fear, and the first glimpse of the devaluation's effect shows why. During the first half of January, prices on average rose 2.3 percent, which may not sound like much. But if prices kept increasing at that rate throughout the year, the final compounded figure for 1995 would exceed 70 percent. **********The Government hopes, and economists generally agree, that 2.3 percent should represent the inflationary peak, as businesses responded directly to the devaluation by giving their prices one big boost. If the Government can maintain control in subsequent weeks the rate should decline, although many private economists still think that the official estimate of 19 percent annual inflation is optimistic. **********One way the Government controls inflation is an agreement with labor and business to limit wage and price increases. Minimum wages, which are set by the Government, were allowed to rise 7 percent, plus a tax rebate of 3 percent for workers with the lowest incomes. **********The Government, however, cannot control union wages, which companies negotiate with the workers at each plant. The 7 percent minimum-wage increase is only used as a guideline. Many analysts fear that as prices soar, pressure will build to raise contract wages just as much. **********But one of the first big contracts to be renegotiated after the devaluation left Government officials smiling. The several thousand union workers at the Nissan Motor Company plant in Aguascalientes, 260 miles northwest of Mexico City, agreed to a wage increase of 11.19 percent, after originally seeking 18 percent. \"With that, the recovery plan will work,\" said Santiago Onate Laborde, Mexico's Labor Secretary. **********Official unemployment figures showing the effect of the devaluation will probably not be available for a month. But the Confederation of Mexican Workers says that at least two small businesses have been closing each day since the peso was devalued. Volkswagen is reported ready to lay off 1,400 administrative workers, and the nation's oil monopoly, Pemex, said it might have to lay off 3,000 people. **********Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City, said the biggest effect on businesses has been the deep uncertainty left by the collapse of the economic strategy that the Mexican Government relied on for six years. For example, since the decision was made to let the value of the peso float freely, executives have not known what index to use to set prices. **********\"Nobody really knows what to expect,\" he said. **********A business assessment by Lehman Brothers uses each company's foreign-exchange exposure and level of debt as measures of vulnerability. Companies like the food retailer Cifra, which has few assets or liabilities in foreign currency, are expected to weather the storm. At Tamsa, an international steel-pipe producer, exports amount to 68 percent of sales, but 95 percent of its liabilities are in foreign currency. **********For some companies, the devaluation presents a bittersweet opportunity. Mauricio Brener is director general of an industrial group that makes and also imports rubber products. Fierce competition from the United States and East Asia since Mexico lowered tariffs had severely cut into one of his primary businesses, automobile gaskets and seals. **********However, since December, those foreign-made parts have become at least a third more expensive than those he produces, and the auto makers have come to him for help. **********Mr. Brener finds it striking that by replacing imports with locally made products, Mexican companies like his will survive. Import substitution had been Mexico's basic economic strategy for many years until the mid-1980's. **********\"Even though it sounds crazy, in the medium term, this is going to be beneficial for Mexico,\" he said. \"It will set our minds straight about where we are, where we want to go and how we are going to get there.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/02/business/company-news-payment-to-mobil-settles-long-running-amoco-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAYMENT TO MOBIL SETTLES LONG-RUNNING AMOCO SUIT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PAYMENT TO MOBIL SETTLES LONG-RUNNING AMOCO SUIT", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it had settled a long-running patent lawsuit with the Amoco Corporation for $114 million in cash, which will result in a third-quarter after-tax gain of $70 million, or about 18 cents a share.

Mining officials said they believed that 106 workers had been in the elevator and that they had little hope of finding survivors. **********In a country with a history of mining disasters, the accident at the Anglo-American Corporation's Vaal Reefs Mine near Orkney, 95 miles southwest of Johannesburg, ranks as one of the worst. **********\"Pieces of flesh were scattered all over the floor as a two-floor mining carriage was crushed into a one-floor tin box,\" James Motlatsi, president of the 339,000-member National Union of Mineworkers, was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association. **********Vaal Reefs officials and investigators said steel safety blocks that should have broken the 12-ton train's fall were inexplicably missing from Shaft No. 2, where the accident took place. **********\"Nothing like that can be anything more than negligence,\" Mr. Motlatsi said. \"The safety mechanisms were not in place.\" **********The Energy and Mineral Affairs Minister, Roelof F. Botha, said in a statement, \"The locomotive could not have moved as it did had it been properly controlled.\" **********\"The driver is alive so he must have either jumped out of the locomotive or in any event was not in it,\" the statement said. Officials indicated that the driver had been hospitalized for shock, but it remained unclear when he had left the train. **********\"It is clear in this accident that the human factor must have played a role on the basis of what is known at this stage,\" Mr. Botha said after visiting the shaft. \"The cause cannot be attributed to a natural unforeseen event.\" **********Rumors circulated on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange today that the tragedy could have been caused by an act of sabotage. **********Anglo-American's divisional communications manager, Charmaine Russell, dismissed questions of sabotage, however, saying: \"Anglo-American is investigating the cause of the accident. There is no room for speculation on the tragedy.\" **********Dick Fisher, the regional manager of the Vaal Reefs mining company, an Anglo-American subsidiary, said the train had entered a tunnel that was supposed to be closed to locomotive traffic. The driver was not on the locomotive at that time, the ministry statement implied. **********According to sketchy explanations of the sequence of events, the falling locomotive clipped the cables that hoisted the mine elevator carrying the accident victims, causing it to plummet more than 1,500 feet. **********An instant after the elevator smashed into the pit's bottom, the train crashed down on top of it. **********The accident was one of the worst in recent decades. The country's worst disaster occurred in 1960, when 437 workers died in a coal mine south of Johannesburg. In 1986, more than 175 gold miners died in a fire in the Kinross mine, 100 miles east of Johannesburg. **********Mining officials say some 69,000 mine workers, most them black, have been killed in industrial accidents since 1911. Between 600 and 900 miners are killed and 15,000 badly injured each year in South African mines. The National Union of Mineworkers, the country's largest black labor union, has campaigned over the years for greater mine safety. **********Since the end of apartheid last year, the mining industry has faced renewed criticisms from political groups and workers alike for what many say are low wages and poor working conditions. **********Last week, the Government received a report on safety in the mining industry. Because of their great depth, South Africa's mines have long been considered highly dangerous, even as industry reforms have been instituted in recent years to introduce new safeguards. **********Mining is South Africa's largest industry, and gold is the largest earner among a list of mining products that include diamonds, platinum and coal. The Vaal Reefs mine is South Africa's second most productive, with $845 million in revenue from gold sales in 1994. **********The administration of Nelson Mandela, the country's first multi-racial Government, has discussed nationalizing some mines, or forcing the industry to share more of its revenues with ordinary citizens. It has taken no action, however. **********Mr. Mandela, speaking at a news conference near Johannesburg today, said new safety regulations would be imposed to \"bring the sorry train of death and injury to an end.\" **********In order to reach the site of the accident, rescuers had to walk two miles underground to Shaft 2, where the wreckage of the crushed elevator sits, buried under the wreckage of the locomotive. **********As miners from other shafts milled about, seeking word of the fate of friends and answers about how the accident occurred, rescue workers removed 13 badly mangled bodies. **********Those who were able to reach the site at the bottom of the pit said the shaft elevator had been squashed beyond recognition and had been reduced by the impact of the train to less than half of its original height. Each of the two levels of the elevator is thought to have carried about 50 workers. **********Rescuers said it would take at least 24 hours to cut through the wreckage and remove the bodies.  \"Its just a heap of mangled steel,\" Garth Ellis, a rescue team worker told the South African Press Association.

The Dow Jones industrial average topped 4,600 for the first time ever on Wednesday, and then exceeded 4,700 just two days later. And this move is just continuing a bull market that erupted 13 years ago. **********If you've owned stocks for much of that period, you've probably done better than you ever dreamed possible. You may also be getting a bit nervous. Can such good things last forever? Should you take some of your chips off the table? And if so, how? **********One widely held belief is that you should not consider doing any such thing. Over the long term, argues Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, stocks beat any other investment. **********\"My feeling is that most people should buy a diversified list of equities and use that as nearly 100 percent of their long-term holdings, and they should do that whether or not the valuations tend to be on the high side or on the low side\" at the time of purchase, he said last week. **********Still, the short term can be a pretty long time. It took the Dow a quarter-century to get back to its 1929 peak after that crash. Similarly, at the end of 1965, the Dow was almost 10 percent higher than it was at the end of 1981. Things could have been worse. At the end of 1974, the index was 36 percent below its 1965 level. **********But since the early 1980's the stock market has put on an amazing show. Had you bought the Dow in mid-1982, and spent the dividends on whatever you wanted, including taxes, you would have more than quintupled your money by the middle of this year. On an annual basis, the return over 13 years works to better than 14 percent a year. **********And how unusual is that? Trace the Dow Jones industrial average back to the beginning of this century, and you'll find that prior to this year, it had never shown a 13-year record in which it averaged as much as 13 percent a year during the entire stretch. (At the peak in 1929, the figure was 11.5 percent; at the peak in 1987 it was 11.8 percent.) That doesn't prove prices are likely to tumble quickly, but it provides one more indication that prices have risen much faster than usual in recent years. And the record of the past is that periods of extraordinary returns have usually been followed by below-average profits. **********Mr. Siegel, whose book \"Stocks for the Long Run,\" published last year by Irwin, has become a favorite of the \"buy and never sell\" advocates, concedes that some people might be able to time the market. But it is clear that he thinks it is folly to try, and believes that for truly long-term investing, there is never a bad time to buy stocks. **********His calculations emphasize the advantages to investors who reinvest all dividends, although doing that is impossible for someone who pays taxes. (The taxes, even if paid from other funds, are properly viewed as additional contributions to the investment account.) And while he emphasizes that investors got even again within 15 years after the stock market crash of 1929, that calculation assumes that they held on and were able to reinvest the dividends at low prices, rather than use them, as many no doubt felt called upon to do, to pay daily expenses during the Depression. **********One critic of Mr. Siegel's work, Michael Harkins of the New York money management firm of Levy, Harkins, says the figures indicate that this is a very good time to get out of the market. **********\"If you look at Siegel's numbers, the largest part of the return comes from reinvesting the dividend yield,\" he said. But, he added, dividends, expressed as a percentage of the share price, \"are at a record low.\" He said the Dow could fall 350 points from its current level and it would still have a dividend yield lower than it had at the peaks in 1929 and 1987. **********Dividends have risen, to be sure, but not nearly as rapidly as share prices, and now a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks, such as those in the Standard & Poor's 500, yields less than 2.5 percent, a record low. Bulls say that dividends are likely to continue to rise and point to the fact that companies are paying out a relatively low proportion of their earnings. **********And a lot of people these days could not care less about dividends. Most young high-tech companies don't pay any, and they have been the stars of this market. The momentum players -- investors and mutual funds that crowd into whatever has been going up -- have helped to drive them still higher. If you have been wise enough, or lucky enough, to have your money in such hot areas, now may be an especially good time to try to protect some of the gains. **********It may be useful to recall that 13 years ago, when stocks were very cheap by any measure, the buy-and-hold-forever strategy was not being advocated. An article on the front of this very section on Aug. 15, 1982 -- just after the market had hit bottom, though no one knew it at the time -- was headlined \"Dark Days on Wall Street\" and spoke of virtually unanimous forecasts that share prices were headed lower. Even the bulls, it said, \"concede a sharp decline is likely.\" Much of Wall Street forecasting is based on a rear-view mirror. Now the past looks glorious; then it looked hideous. **********Still, there is no doubt that a buy-and-hold strategy has been a good one for those with the ability, as well as the patience, to wait out downturns. If you are sincerely determined to follow that strategy, we suggest turning to another article. The rest of this one will focus on ways to protect your profits from one of the most extraordinary bull markets in American history. Short Against the Box **********The easiest way to cut your exposure to stocks is, of course, to sell some or all of your stocks or, if your money is in mutual funds, redeem shares. The virtues of that strategy include low transaction costs; every other strategy to be mentioned in this piece involves paying more to brokers. But it also means triggering capital-gains taxes if the securities are held in anything other than a tax-deferred retirement account. **********Moreover, there is talk in Washington of cutting the capital-gains tax rate. Whether such a cut will be passed or not is uncertain, and, equally important, it is uncertain what the effective date would be. It could be painful to learn that a sale took place just before the effective date, meaning that a lot of taxes could have been saved had you been just a little more patient. **********In fact, some analysts think that talk of a capital-gains tax cut is helping to hold the market up by preventing selling for just that reason. If it is reasonable to think that lower capital-gains tax rates are good for stocks in the long run, it is also clear that the immediate effect of the last two reductions, in 1978 and 1981, was to provoke a wave of selling that had been delayed awaiting the tax change. That selling temporarily depressed prices. **********One way to avoid taxes on stocks, while still getting rid of the risks (and potential rewards) of them, is to \"short against the box,\" to use the Wall Street jargon. That involves borrowing shares and selling them, just as in any short sale. The difference is that you already own what you are selling short, so you are not betting that the price will go down, as in a normal short sale. Thanks to what may be the least defensible tax loophole around, Uncle Sam figures that selling short what you already own does not trigger a tax. **********Let's say you own 1,000 shares of Microsoft bought five years ago for $15 a share, and you sell them at current prices of about $95. That would produce a profit of $80 a share, or a total of $80,000. The Internal Revenue Service would lay claim to $22,400 of that at the current rate of 28 percent. **********But if you instead sell short 1,000 shares at $95, you have locked in the same pretax result, albeit with the need to pay a bit more to your broker. For every dollar Microsoft rises in the future, your gain on the stock you still own will exactly cancel out your loss on the short position. And vice versa if the price falls. The difference is that the Government sees those as two transactions, with no tax due until you close them out. **********That tactic is now routinely used by many large investors. Consider the family of William Dart, which made about $175 million in Salomon Inc. stock, buying when it was depressed due to the Treasury bond scandal a few years ago and then selling shares last year. But they sold by shorting against the box. Result: Big profits, no tax. Alternate Investments **********If you sell, there is the question of what to do with the money. You could spend it, of course, but we'll assume this is investment money. The safest course is to put it in the bank. **********The average bank now pays about 5 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, while money-market funds pay around the same. Of course, these days some technology funds go up that much in a week, so for someone used to the excitement of stocks that may seem tame. **********You could, of course, play the bond market. But it too looks a little expensive to some people. In fact, the rapid decline of interest rates this year has been one reason for the stock market's explosion. A 30-year bond now yields around 6.5 percent, with the potential for capital gains if rates move lower (and losses if rates move the other way).And, finally, you could simply move to stocks that might be less risky. Utilities are traditionally defensive vehicles, with fat dividend yields. **********They have underperformed of late, in part because of fears of a changing competitive picture that might affect those dividends. But they probably would not fall as far as other stocks if a bear market did hit.  The Option as Insurance **********If you are not willing to sell, there are still ways to protect your gains in the stock market. You can use options -- yes, a form of the dreaded derivatives. Such strategies have the virtue of letting you keep getting profits if your stocks rise, albeit lower ones than if you did not use them, while getting protection from price plunges. \"In the midst of a mania, no one can tell where the top will be,\" said Mr. Harkins. Indeed, it is possible that the \"buy-and-hold-forever\" theory will catch on to such an extent that prices will until valuations are truly extreme. If so, the eventual fall would likely be that much more severe. **********Options can be very safe investments, and they can be among the most risky. Since the whole point of this article is how to protect profits, we're going to stick to the safe ones. **********A few options basics: Call options allow the buyer to buy something at a set price up until a deadline. Put options are similar, but give the option buyer the right to sell something. The most important thing to remember about options is that there are two sides to every options trade. One side sells, or writes, the option. The other side buys it. The worst thing that can happen to the buyer is for the option to expire worthless, in which case all the money spent to buy the option is lost. On the other hand, the seller of the option can lose a lot if the market moves the wrong way. So the general rule for the risk-averse investor is to buy options, not sell them. There is one exception, which involves writing an option that merely commits you to sell stock you already own. **********If most of your profits are in a few stocks, you might want to consider buying puts on them. A put is an option giving the buyer -- you -- the right but not the obligation to sell the stock at a specified price at any time up to the date the option expires. **********Let's return to our Microsoft example. On Friday, you could buy a put option giving you the right to sell 100 shares of stock for $80 at any time up to Aug. 18, for a total of $56.25 plus commissions. You have purchased insurance to protect most of your gains, in return for giving up less than 60 cents a share. By buying an option with a strike price of $80, you have remained at risk for small losses, but assured big ones will not arrive. **********What that amounts to is an insurance policy that will expire in just six weeks. If you want a longer one, it will cost a lot more. A put option giving you the right to sell at $80 up until January 1997 would have cost you $4.75 a share. **********In general, the larger the portion of the gain you want to protect, and the longer you want the protection to last, the more you will pay. **********There is a way to get that insurance with no cash out of pocket, but at a cost of giving up some upside. You could write a call option on Microsoft stock, agreeing to sell it for, say, $110. The money you get from that option can be used to buy the put option. Then, if the stock rises to that level, it will be purchased from you -- triggering all those taxes. At the cost of surrendering some of the upside you have protected yourself against most of the downside. **********There are similar strategies available using index options. As is noted on page 7, such strategies involve one of many exchange-listed options covering indexes as broad as the Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues and as narrow as indexes on retail or insurance stocks.

And the nature of the allegations -- that she bilked a program intended to help her strongest constituency, destitute residents of squatter camps -- may endanger the popularity she has won as a militant champion of the downtrodden. **********When police officers armed with shotguns descended on her red-brick mansion here in the black metropolis this morning, taking up stations on the roof and surrounding wall, Mrs. Mandela was in West Africa, traveling in defiance of the President, who had asked her to stay in South Africa to answer a storm of charges about her activities. **********Through her spokesman, Alan Reynolds, she described the search as a \"publicity stunt\" by the police, continuing a decadeslong campaign to discredit her. **********The move against Mrs. Mandela was the climax of a week in which the President sent troops to put down a police mutiny and a prison riot, announced a beefing up of security forces in high-crime areas and set up a new disciplinary committee to investigate assertions of financial impropriety by several prominent members of his party. **********\"He was worried that the impression was starting to be created that this was a lame duck Government, that it was uninterested in law and order,\" said Mr. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitendzhe, confirming that the police action today was part of a pattern. \"He was worried this was beginning to undermine confidence in the Government.\" **********No figure has come to represent the President's exasperation as fully as Mrs. Mandela. **********Although in the poorest black settlements she is revered as a patron of the downtrodden, she has few defenders any more among her comrades in the liberation movement. **********Her shady business dealings, her autocratic style and her sometimes rancorous appeals to racial resentment have antagonized many who once lionized her as the \"mother of the nation\" out of respect for her courage under intense police harassment during the 27 years her husband was imprisoned. **********Her big fall from the movement's grace came in 1991, when she was convicted of kidnapping for sending thugs to abduct four young men. One of the victims was later found dead with his throat cut. Mrs. Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison, but the sentence was set aside on appeal. **********In the aftermath of the trial, Mrs. Mandela was formally separated from her husband, forced to resign her senior positions in the African National Congress and shunned by many black leaders. **********But she rode the adulation of the Congress's rank-and-file to a remarkable comeback and was elected to Parliament. **********In recent months she has been dogged by persistent accusations of impropriety, from hiring a plane to run illicit diamonds from Angola to using her Government office to drum up business for her daughter's show-business promotion company. **********Eleven executives of the Women's League, including Adelaide Tambo, widow of the former Congress president, Oliver Tambo, resigned last month to protest what they called Mrs. Mandela's high-handed rule. Her husband rebuked her for a speech condemning his Government as overly solicitous of whites, extracting from her a grudging public apology. **********Although no warrant has been issued for Mrs. Mandela's arrest, the police described the allegations against her in unusual detail today, in hopes of defusing suspicion that they were renewing an old vendetta. **********According to Capt. David Harrington, a police spokesman, Mrs. Mandela used official pressure and kickbacks to win Government contracts for a company, Professional Builders. The contracts were to build houses for black shack-dwellers in at least four squatter camps. **********In exchange for her influence, he said, Mrs. Mandela demanded that the company give 50 percent of its shares to her daughter Zinzi, and a small number of shares to her personal doctor. The police said the company also paid Mrs. Mandela an initial cash bribe worth about $20,000, and promised monthly payments worth about $9,000. **********Mr. Netshitendzhe, the President's spokesman, said Mr. Mandela was not told in advance of the timing of the raids on his wife's home and several related business premises, but when he was briefed last week he told the authorities they should pursue the case without favor. **********\"His general comment was, it is a police matter, and no one is above the law,\" Mr. Netshitendzhe said. **********At Phola Park, a squatter camp east of Johannesburg that Mrs. Mandela adopted as her showplace, leaders of the local civic association said they had long ago grown disenchanted with her promises of houses, a school, a clinic. **********In fact, they said, when other agencies began delivering services, Mrs. Mandela disrupted construction by threatening to stir a popular protest unless she was given control. Phola Park now has a makeshift school, a clinic and hundreds of new housing plots laid out with water and sewers; none of it was built by Mrs. Mandela, but because she was such a visible presence at the camp, many residents are convinced she is their main benefactor. **********\"The leaders all see through her now,\" said one local leader, who spoke on the condition she not be named. \"But the people still think she can do no wrong.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/world/castro-given-big-welcome-by-mitterrand.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 772, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Castro Given Big Welcome By Mitterrand", "print_headline": "Castro Given Big Welcome By Mitterrand", "body_text": " **********In a slap at American policy toward Cuba, President Francois Mitterrand welcomed President Fidel Castro to Paris today for a three-day private stay that has most of the hallmarks of a state visit. **********Mr. Mitterrand, who has often described the United States blockade of Cuba as \"stupid,\" welcomed Mr. Castro to Elysee Palace with military honors and a formal lunch. **********\"I thought to myself: that's it, the end of apartheid,\" Mr. Castro told the French leader at lunch, commenting on his warm reception. **********Mr. Castro flew in this morning from Copenhagen, wrapped against the early morning cold in a green military overcoat bearing red military insignia, and was escorted to the official government guest house, the Hotel de Marigny. **********There he was joined by Danielle Mitterrand, the President's wife, who greeted him with kisses on both cheeks and sat down to a breakfast of croissants and orange juice with him.

It was purchased for only $1.8 million by the Los Angeles State Building Authority, a partnership of the State of California and the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. The seller was the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency entrusted with selling the assets of insolvent savings and loan associations. **********The partnership agreed to buy the property in June and expects to complete the purchase in October. **********The state plans to spend an additional $61.5 million on the building, a 10-story structure built in 1918. Much of the money will go toward reinforcements against earthquakes, as well as other safety features to help the building meet current city codes. **********The building, which is expected to reopen in 1999, will gather 1,700 state employees from 41 sites in the Los Angeles area. **********The purchase is a \"major set piece in the revitalization of the Broadway-Spring Street area\" of downtown Los Angeles, said Daniel Garcia, chairman of the redevelopment agency's board of commissioners. The area, also called the historic core, is just east of the new high-rise financial district. **********The deal stems from an executive order from Gov. Pete Wilson to consolidate state office uses in downtown areas of Los Angeles and other cities, including Oakland and San Bernardino. The Broadway store project will help the state meet a goal of consolidating 750,000 square feet of government office space in the historic core. **********In addition to being a partner in the purchase, the redevelopment agency assisted in the deal by forgiving part of the building's property taxes, so the money could be reinvested in the structure. **********\"The old Broadway building was a critical issue for us, as a means to shore up the public investment the state already had in the area,\" said Kevin Eckery, Deputy Secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency. **********Chief among the state's assets in the historic core is the 825,000-square-foot Ronald Reagan Building, a state office building built in 1989 two blocks south of the Broadway building, amid dilapidated buildings at the edge of the city's Skid Row section. **********The former Broadway store, with 45,000 square feet of space on each floor, is well suited to office use, Mr. Eckery said. He added that the building would encourage the use of mass transit; a station of the city's new Metro Rail subway system is a block west of the building. **********The purchase also meshes with ambitions of the city's redevelopment agency to introduce new uses and new tenants into empty buildings of the historic core, which was the city's financial center from the turn of the century until the 1960's. The area is prized by preservationists as a collection of handsome old office buildings, banks and a group of flamboyant movie palaces. But many of the buildings are considered obsolete for modern office use. Since the 1960's, most downtown office tenants have moved to newer towers. **********The void left by big companies in the historic core was quickly filled by retail businesses, created largely by immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Broadway has become an intensely busy shopping street for the Hispanic community, and storefront properties command some of the highest retail rents in the city. In many buildings, however, the upper floors sit empty. **********But after years of failed and struggling projects, investment is focusing again on the historic core. Mr. Garcia, the redevelopment agency chairman, cited several projects for the area, including the renovation of the upper stories of the Million Dollar Theater and the Grand Central Market, both on Broadway, into apartments and office space. **********The agency has approved a plan to renovate the Broadway Spring Arcade, a retail and office building. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is planning a $150 million complex, including a new cathedral, on the site of the existing St. Vibiana's Cathedral. **********\"The area is showing a spark,\" Mr. Garcia said. \"Three or four of the big pieces are falling into place.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/world/major-turns-cool-to-british-links-with-european-union.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1995-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1062, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Major Turns Cool to British Links With European Union", "print_headline": "Major Turns Cool to British Links With European Union", "body_text": " **********Four years ago, when the drive for closer integration of European countries seemed to be moving ahead inexorably, Prime Minister John Major signaled his desire to join in by proclaiming that Britain belongs \"at the heart of Europe.\" **********Now, it is not at all certain that the drive is still gaining ground. And as far as Mr. Major is concerned, one thing is clear: Britain's heart does not belong to Europe. **********Faced with a rebellion of back-benchers in the Conservative Party who believe that the European Union is taking too much power and looking for a strong issue to beat back the popular opposition Labor Party, Mr. Major has recently been staking out a tougher stance on Europe. **********It became obvious this week that he has taken many of the top figures in Government with him. Newspaper reports of the barrage of speeches and comments at a Cabinet meeting to thrash out policies toward Europe made it seem as if the European Union, not inflation or crime or racism, was the kingdom's main enemy. **********Britain's role in the 15-nation European Union is one of the main question marks hanging over the country's future. While the Labor Party is still committed to closer integration, the Conservatives are backing away from the political and monetary union envisioned in the Maastricht Treaty negotiated in December 1991 to define the union. **********On Friday night, speaking to a group called the Conservative Way Forward, Mr. Major adopted a tougher line on the central issue facing the European Union, the question of a single currency. He insisted that economic conditions in Europe were not yet ripe for such a dramatic step and that it \"would tear the European Union apart.\" **********In an address laced with condemnations of a \"centralist Europe,\" Mr. Major insisted that the pound would not join a single currency by 1997. He added that Britain would soon propose additional criteria to be required to make the common currency a reality in addition to those already in the Maastricht Treaty. **********The treaty calls for a convergence among the countries in such areas as their level of debt and inflation rate. If Britain were to insist upon common standards in such additional areas as the rate of unemployment, that would in effect make a single currency impossible to achieve, most economists believe. **********The tougher position was summed up in a speech delivered by Mr. Major at Leiden University in the Netherlands in September. He insisted that Britain \"is irrevocably part of Europe\" but that \"it must be the right sort of Europe.\" **********By this he made clear that he meant a Europe that was \"flexible,\" that did not try to impose a conformity upon its members, and that recognized the validity of the nation-state as a basic political unit. **********Politicians' visions for Europe must be supported by the people, he said, adding: \"Popular enthusiasm for the Union has waned. We need to listen to these warnings if we are to make the right moves in the future.\" **********In an interview with David Frost on the BBC last month, he spelled out the implications of his position for Britain's negotiating posture at an Inter-Government Conference of the European Union in 1996, which will map the Union's future. **********He indicated that Britain would use its veto to block efforts to change the Union's constitution to remove the veto, for instance, amend voting procedures to make it more difficult for a minority to block undesirable legislation, extend \"massive\" new powers to the European Parliament or mandate a commitment to a single currency. **********Because some nations, notably Germany and France, are expected to try to use the conference to further the union's integration, this stance will probably put Britain at odds with its major partners. Britain has already gone head to head with the other countries in disputes over everything from the voting method used by the Union to the election of the President of the European Commission. **********There are signs that Mr. Major's assertion that \"the high tide of federalism\" in Europe has already been reached is playing well with the British public. On the critical issue of a single currency, 55 percent of Britons who responded in a recent poll for the BBC by Harris Research opposed it and only 31 percent favored it. **********The Cabinet is still divided on the issue. Kenneth Clarke, the powerful Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is often placed in the \"pro-European\" camp, still adheres to the idea of eventual monetary union. But Mr. Major has been hardening his opposition to achieving it, at least during the next two or three years. **********At last week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jacques Santer, the new Commission President -- who secured his post when Britain vetoed a contender backed by the other countries -- renewed the commitment to a single currency and said he wanted to stick to the timetable to achieve it, by 1997 or 1999 at the latest. German and French leaders have taken the same position. **********Mr. Major's dawning \"Euro-skepticism,\" as the British have been calling it, also may pay some political dividends by bolstering his wafer-thin majority in Parliament. A group of Conservative rebels has been temporarily expelled from the party for refusing to go along with perfunctory bills to pay money to the European Union. **********The Government is wooing them to get them to return, since without their nine votes, the Tories are four short of a majority and need to rely upon other parties, like the Ulster Unionists, to get bills passed. **********The anti- and pro-Europe speeches and statements were unleashed by an article in The Times of London. It asserted that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had been given a \"devastating rebuff\" at a Cabinet meeting for laying out an approach to next year's conference that was not sufficiently tough. **********The story, denounced as untrue by a spokesman for the Prime Minister, prompted politicians on all sides to declare themselves.

More than a score of companies are in a race to develop an Alzheimer's drug, the prize being treatment for the devastating brain disease -- and a product that analysts say could easily be worth $1 billion a year for the winner. **********And with Athena and Lilly now seen as the lab leaders by virtue of their Alzheimer's test mice, little Athena could emerge as the mouse that roared. The company is in a position to profit handsomely -- with or without Lilly. For it is Athena, not Lilly, that actually holds the rights to the Alzheimer's mouse, the only research animal of its type so far. **********The situation is rare in the biotech industry, where tiny, cash-short companies are usually forced into much less advantageous alliances with the big drug companies. But because of a collaboration agreement between Athena and Lilly that is good through the end of 1996, Athena and Lilly would share the proceeds from an Alzheimer's treatment if the treatment was developed before 1997. If not, little Athena would be in a strong bargaining position to force big Lilly to renegotiate the alliance under sweetened terms, or to shop its mouse around to other big pharmaceutical houses. **********\"Our strategy with Lilly is to proceed very aggressively, to use this mouse model to test our best leads, and to get a compound into the clinic before the end of the collaboration,\" said John Groom, president and chief executive of Athena, which is based here. **********And what if the partners are not yet in clinical trials when the collaboration agreement expires? Mr. Groom declined to speculate. But he made clear that he considered the mouse to be his company's ticket to success. **********\"By the end of 1996, we will have a rich base of clinical leads, and a much greater understanding of how this pathology advances in the brain,\" Mr. Groom said. \"That's the great benefit of this mouse.\" **********Meanwhile, Lilly executives stress that they plan to keep doing business with Athena. Athena's agreement with Lilly calls for Athena to receive a royalty on any drug produced before Dec. 31, 1996, but the agreement could be extended. **********\"The intention is that this is a longer-term alliance of partners,\" said Robert Postlethwait, president of the Lilly business unit focusing on central nervous system drugs. \"It's mutually beneficial, and I think that both parties are interested in a longer relationship.\" **********Alzheimer's disease, an illness that eventually destroys the mind's ability to reason, is thought to be unique to humans. So in the past there has been no animal model on which to test new drugs. But by being genetically engineered to carry a human gene associated with Alzheimer's, Athena's transgenic mice are expected to provide the long-sought animal model for studying the disease and for measuring the effectiveness of various drug compounds at slowing or stopping its progression. The most promising compounds might then be tried with humans. **********Still, the process of discovering and developing new drugs is always a risky business, perhaps never more so than for Alzheimer's disease, an illness of no known cause, for which there is still no diagnostic test. And probably because the Athena-Lilly partnership could spend $100 million or more on their quest for a treatment, investors have reacted cautiously to news of the test mouse, which researchers for the company reported last week in an article in the scientific journal Nature. **********As word of the research report has circulated in recent weeks, Athena's stock has risen. Even so, closing unchanged at $9 yesterday, it remains off its 52-week high of $10.125, which was reached last February. **********And Lilly's stock, which enjoyed a small spike last week, trading above $66, has since dropped back. Its shares fell 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $64.25. **********That Athena even has rights to this strain of mice is one of those biotech stories in which success springs from roughly equal measures of serendipity and scientific expertise. Many companies have tried and failed to produce a mouse carrying the Alzheimer's gene. But it was Athena that was close enough to success to recognize the right technology when the company happened upon it two years ago -- not in its own labs, but in the research efforts of a then-struggling biotech company known as the Exemplar Corporation. **********Exemplar, based in Waltham, Mass., was developing transgenic animal models for use in the areas of AIDS, cancer and genetic toxicology, but it was the Alzheimer' s mouse that drew Athena's interest. Athena was working on a similar animal and recognized the potential of Exemplar's mouse; Athena had the necessary expertise in-house, as well as in its network of academic collaborators, to validate the model for use in Alzheimer's research. Exemplar, meanwhile, had run out of money. **********So Athena bought all of the assets of Exemplar in December for 420,000 shares of Athena's common stock, then worth about $7 a share, and a cash payment of $100,000. Exemplar's situation was all too common in the current financing climate for biotech companies; whether public or private, they often cannot raise additional funds. For companies in its category, Athena has been somewhat unusual in its ability to remain solvent. **********Founded in 1986 along with a dozen or more other venture-capital-backed neuroscience companies, Athena separated itself from the pack by a strategy based on acquiring products that could generate real operating revenues in the years or decades it might take to develop a breakthrough drug. Having real product revenues has helped buoy Athena's share price. **********Toward that end, it created a field sales force to market branded and generic drugs primarily to Parkinson's disease patients in their homes; acquired distribution rights to Permax, Lilly's Parkinson's drug, and licensed two anti-spasticity drugs, which are currently in clinical trials. It has also developed a novel antibody that prevents white blood cells from entering the brain, which could enter clinical trials next year as a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis. **********Although Athena has not yet turned a profit, it has seen its revenues grow, to $32.3 million in 1994 from $18.6 million in 1993. **********\"The critical thing is to get cash-flow neutral,\" Mr. Groom said. \"The market will tolerate you not making a profit incredibly better than it will losing money.\" His goal is for Athena to have revenues of about $100 million in 1996. At that level, it would break even or be slightly profitable. **********But it would still need the deep pockets of Lilly or another partner to finance the trials needed to go from a promising mouse model to a product. Developing a new drug costs an average of $100 million, and a drug for a disease as complicated as Alzheimer's could cost far more. Nevertheless, having an animal model is a tremendous step forward, because it allows the companies to test compounds before beginning clinical trials using humans. **********For Alzheimer's, \"This is the first time ever that researchers have had in their hands an experimental model that most probably is a true model of the disease in humans,\" said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, publisher of Bioventure View, an industry newsletter. \"You now have a tool for testing the efficacy of compounds where you can feel like you're going to get something useful from that information.\" **********But caveats remain. **********The mouse model is based on the observation that the brains of Alzheimer's patients, when autopsied after death, are riddled with plaques of a material called beta amyloid protein. Researchers created the mice by implanting a mutation of a human gene that causes overproduction of a protein previously shown to be a precursor of beta amyloid. The mice form plaques in their brains nearly indistinguishable from Alzheimer's patients'. **********But whether beta amyloid is in fact the cause of Alzheimer's remains a subject of debate in the neurology community. \"What remains to be seen is, now that we see the pathology, will we see corresponding behavioral changes,\" said Richard Pops, president and chief executive of Alkermes Inc., a neurology company formed close to the same time Athena was. \"It really comes down to how much faith you put in the amyloid process,\" Mr. Pops said. \"Is it the cause or the effect?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/23/business/company-news-585295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS", "body_text": " **********BFP HOLDING CORP., New York, a commercial printing and graphic arts holding company, plans to merge its Treasure Chest Advertising Co. unit with two Sullivan Communications Inc. units, Sullivan Graphics Inc. and American Color, in a stock-for-stock transaction.

The news that it would be postponing the purchase sent Genentech's shares tumbling nearly 5 percent today. The stock fell $2.50, to $47.875, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The new terms limit the risk in the stock, analysts said, but they also limit the potential return, making the shares less attractive. **********\"The terms of this deal are quite onerous for Genentech shareholders,\" said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly. \"If you are an active equity investor, you expect a reasonable upside and there isn't much here.\" **********As part of the deal, Roche, the drug giant based in Basel, Switzerland, will acquire worldwide marketing rights outside the United States to Genentech's existing drugs as well as any drugs in development that it chooses. In return, Roche will share development costs and pay royalties on sales to Genentech, a pioneering biotechnology company based in South San Francisco. **********Under the revised terms, Roche can purchase the common stock of the company at a predetermined price that escalates quarterly up to $82 a share. If Roche does not complete the purchase by June 30, 1999, Genentech stockholders will have the option to exercise a put, or the right to sell at a specified price, on some or all of their shares at $60 a share within a 30-day period beginning July 1, 1999. At these rates, the maximum rate of return is about 15 percent; the minimum, over a four-year period, about 6 percent. **********G. Kirk Raab, Genentech's president and chief executive, said that the terms were the best that could be negotiated, given an inhospitable market for biotechnology stocks. While he acknowledged that the investor seeking a high rate of return for a high degree of risk would be less interested in Genentech, he said the company should now attract more conservative investors. **********\"If you own our stock, you know what the downside is,\" Mr. Raab said. \"There are not many equities where you know the worst case scenario is $60 a share,\" he said. \"Genentech is clearly a long-term investment, and even more so now.\" **********Executives close to the deal said that the arrangement was the most advantageous that could be struck after it became clear Roche had no intention of paying $60 a share by June 30. Roche bought 60 percent of Genentech in 1990 and had made large purchases of Genentech shares on the open market in recent months, fueling analysts' assumptions that it would complete the earlier deal. **********But those shares had been bought in the mid-$40's. With most analysts estimating that Genentech will earn $1.35 a share in the current year, the option price of $60 a share would represent a multiple of 45, which is significantly higher than most drug stocks command. **********At the same time, it had become clear that Genentech could not maintain its aggressive spending on research, manufacturing and marketing without further limiting earnings. **********\"From a purely industrial point of view, they seem to have struck a good balance because Genentech is going to get more support from Roche,\" said Kevin Wilson, an analyst with S. G. Warburg. \"At the same time, Roche has been relieved of its immediate responsibilities. **********\"It seems that Genentech management have done a good job from a company point of view,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"It's debatable whether they've done a good job for shareholders.\" **********As part of the agreement, Roche has the right to co-develop a Genentech drug. Should it do so, Genentech and Roche would split all American development expense, and Roche would pay for non-American development expenses. Roche would pay a royalty of 12.5 percent until a product reached $100 million in sales, when the royalty for that product's full sales became 15 percent. **********Roche also gains exclusive rights for and will pay Genentech a 20 percent royalty on Canadian sales of its current drugs for heart disease, cystic fibrosis, and the treatment of short stature in children, as well as European sales of Genentech's cystic fibrosis drug."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/18/business/business-digest-195295.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********International **********The Japanese earthquake failed to realize Wall Street's worst fears.

Asked if he thought that the delay raised the likelihood of renewed I.R.A. violence, he said, \"I don't think that's an issue at this time.\" **********The British decision was sent to Mr. Adams in Dublin by the Northern Ireland Office, which administers the British province, in Belfast. The letter said the decision was based on assurances from Sinn Fein that it would discuss I.R.A. disarmament \"in a serious and constructive manner,\" and added that Britain was now willing to discuss the question of British security forces in the province, an issue Sinn Fein calls \"demilitarization.\" **********Mr. Adams, speaking in his small office in a dingy downtown Dublin building, discussed the peace effort with unusual frankness, in terms of his personal doubts and depressions. And he spoke in a conciliatory tone about the domestic political problems that may have caused Prime Minister John Major of Britain to delay the disarmament talks. **********There was none of the angry polemic he has often used to castigate Mr. Major and Britain. Generally, he conveyed calm resolution to keep talking until Britain agreed to his demand for all-party talks. **********He added that the all-party talks should also be called immediately. Most officials and experts say that while the ministerial talks between Sinn Fein and London will start soon, the all-party talks are at least several months away, mostly because the Protestant Unionist parties still refuse to be seated with Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein's ultimate goal is a united Ireland without British control in the North; the Protestants want the North to remain part of Britain. **********He said the delay made Roman Catholic republicans and nationalists here and in the North feel that Britain had been \"deliberately misbehaving.\" In a reference to the I.R.A. and other Catholics, he said, \"So one gets an undermining of the process among the very people who have taken the chances and the risks to put it together.\" **********He gave this unusually candid analysis of British tactics and policy: \"One has to try to think for your enemy. You have to factor in the reality of the situation John Major is facing, the difficulties with his own party, with his own country. On the other hand, this is the only positive thing he has going for him. He can be the British Prime Minister who actively, even if it never wins him an election, brought about, was part of moving the entire process forward, bringing an end to this age-old conflict. It is something I think that he will not, or should not, ignore.\" **********\"They would seek,\" he said of the British Government, \"to be giving as little as possible over as protracted a period as possible. It is war through negotiations. I don't think it's so much a conspiracy as I presume there are various tendencies in the British establishment who are managing this process, and they're not a monolith, and undoubtedly they want a settlement, and some would want a settlement which would be far-reaching, and some would want a settlement which would be the minimal approach, and it would depend on which tendency is in the ascendancy at one particular time.\" **********\"I've been involved in this process for nearly 25 years,\" he said. \"There are times when one can become despondent, the pessimism of the intellect can actually make you depressed. But the intellect meets the optimism of the will, and we have a will to take this forward. There is a political will. I think it will be difficult and dangerous.

His critics call him authoritarian and at times dictatorial. But Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, an articulate and charismatic leader, is still very much a favorite of the World Bank and international powers. **********Diplomats here call Mr. Museveni, a former guerrilla commander, \"America's darling\" and \"Africa's new man.\" Nine years ago he took power in a country battered by decades of civil war and killings that eclipse even the Rwandan massacres. In that period, his focus on building and liberalizing the economy has brought new life to Uganda, though the country is still not an economic power. **********In part because of his liberal economic policies, and in part because of a straightforward style so different from that of his neighbors, President Museveni has for many years succeeded in defying international pressure that makes aid contingent on democratization efforts. **********But lately international donors have been restive about Mr. Museveni's pronouncement that for at least the next five years, Uganda will remain a nation with a single political movement. And Uganda cannot survive without the roughly $800 million of foreign aid it gets annually. **********A Western diplomat in Kampala said: \"Democratization will be a big nut to crack. This is the critical period. This is 1995, Uganda's year of decision. He's popular and he's good, but he's not opening up, and it will cause him problems. He's so good in so many ways. He's the exact kind of man an African state needs at this point. But if he stops the clock, then in five years his own system will get hardened arteries. To me Museveni lives in a glass house.\" **********Mr. Museveni's army swept into Kampala after a five-year guerrilla war, and in 1986 he formed a broad-based Government under the National Resistance Movement.  Though the Government does not allow political parties, opposition figures have been allowed to run for office as individuals. Mr. Museveni argues that multiparty systems aggravate tribal divisions. **********Last year the elections for the Constituent Assembly were deemed by diplomats and human rights officials to be one of the freest and fairest elections in Africa. There are many independent newspapers in Kampala and two independent radio stations, the only ones in the region. **********Mr. Museveni says he believes that his economic program is crucial to the country's stability. He has freed markets, stabilized the currency, cut inflation, sold off state-owned companies and trimmed the civil service and the army. None of it was easy. Landlocked Uganda is mostly agricultural and very poor, its fabric torn apart first by the civil war and now by the AIDS epidemic. **********He has a very personal style that contrasts most with the unsmiling rigidness of Daniel arap Moi, President of Kenya, Uganda's main trading partner. While the Kenyan President, the longest-governing leader in the region, is not approachable and always flanked by heavy security, Mr. Museveni is constantly on the move both in Uganda and abroad, \"holding court,\" as the Ugandans describe him. He prefers a khaki safari suit and floppy hat to a suit and tie, delivers his riveting speeches from such unlikely podiums as the roof of his car, and rarely misses a chance to crack a joke, although his travels this month made it impossible to get an interview with him. **********But the same man's Government has arrested and harassed opponents and been accused of authoritarian tactics. In November he shuffled his Cabinet to get more of his supporters in it, diplomats say. **********In Africa, where governments are all too often defined by regions and tribes, Uganda is one of the most stable, yet it remains polarized along ethnic lines. **********The most powerful ethnic group, the Baganda -- the wealthy educated urban elite -- are pushing for a federal state with more power for their titular king. **********In the last year, there has been increasing instability in parts of the north as rag-tag guerrillas of the Lord's Resistance Army, armed by the Sudanese Government, have fought with Ugandan soldiers and planted land mines, making roads impassable. They adhere to no particular religion, despite their name, and their leader embraces an eclectic collection of beliefs including living by the Ten Commandments and eschewing riding bicycles and eating the meat of white chickens. **********The opposition is weak and without a clear platform. The strongest are supporters of the Ugandan People's Congress, the party of former President Milton Obote. Mr. Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths during his rule. Unapologetic about its own history, the party views Mr. Museveni as just another despot. **********\"As a person, Museveni is highly ambitious,\" said Cecelia Ogwal, the assistant secretary general of the People's Congress. \"The man cannot tolerate debate. He wants to solve problems by military ways. The U.P.C. of today is not the same one as the U.P.C. of yesterday. Let us not be judged by the childish behavior of our youth.\" **********\"Sincerely speaking and knowing democracy the way I do, we have reached a deadlock,\" she said, adding in reference to Mr. Museveni's party: \"The N.R.M. is anti-democratic. In effect it is a military government.\" **********Publicly, Ugandan officials say they have cordial relations with all their neighbors except the Sudan. In reality, relations are tense with Kenya and Zaire, while Uganda remains very close to Rwanda, whose rebels -- now the new Government -- fought alongside Mr. Museveni in the Ugandan civil war. Ugandan territory is the conduit for military equipment to the Sudanese rebels. **********Mr. Museveni's main theme, echoed by his ministers and in almost every one of his speeches, is that Africans are \"backward.\" **********\"We know Africa is backward,\" said Amama Mbabazi, the minister of state for defense. \"We need to resolve the differences. We have to focus on other development issues. If we don't resolve our petty differences, then we shall perpetually remain backward.\" **********Although Kenya and Uganda rely on each other, tensions between them constantly simmer. **********Kenya, wary that its neighbor may have expansionist goals, has accused Uganda of arming Kenya's dissenters and believes that Uganda was responsible for helping the Rwandan rebels take over Rwanda last year. In the last month, scores of Ugandans have been arrested in Kenya.

So Hillary Rodham Clinton's strong wish to lead the American delegation to the United Nations Conference on Women in Beijing next month has prompted much hand-wringing among senior diplomatic officials who are not sure she should go. **********The geopolitics are plain enough: should the most prominent woman in the United States lend her presence to a conference on women's rights that happens to be held in a country with an abysmal record on human rights -- especially when China is holding the American human rights advocate Harry Wu on espionage charges and Chinese-American relations are rubbed raw. **********The domestic politics are clear, too: Congressional Republicans are chomping to seize the issue as an example of the mishandling of foreign policy by Mr. Clinton, and to accuse him of coddling dictators as he once accused George Bush of being too soft on China. House and Senate leaders have called for an American boycott of the conference. **********The office politics are murkier: knowing Mrs. Clinton's desire to lead the charge on an issue that has long concerned her, Administration officials, including the President in his news conference last week, have studiously avoided saying no, and some are ambivalent about the risks and benefits involved. **********For her part, Mrs. Clinton argues -- as she did in a speech to a women's group in Denver last month that her aides took pains to fax to a reporter today -- that the conference is \"an important opportunity to focus attention on women.\" She said that the American delegation should \"play a very big leadership role in shaping the agenda\" and that \"the United States should do all that it can to make sure that barriers to women's participation are broken down, and that training and credit and political involvement and health care and education are available to all women.\" **********As the Clintons began the first full day of a 17-day vacation in the Grand Tetons this morning, the official word from the White House was that there was no official word. Unofficially, senior Administration aides in Washington gave slightly conflicting status reports. **********Some in the West Wing and the State Department said the current plan was to wait a few more days to see if Mr. Wu might be released, before making a decision by next Monday, which they described as the last realistic point at which the logistical arrangements for such a trip could be made. **********Aides to the First Lady insisted there was no \"drop dead date,\" but they acknowledged pressure to make a decision soon, since Mrs. Clinton would leave for Beijing from V-J Day commemorations in Hawaii over the Labor Day weekend, and perhaps visit Mongolia, Cambodia and Thailand as well. **********On Monday, Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher and the deputy national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, met separately with Mrs. Clinton to go over the pros and cons. Aides to both the First Lady and the President said today that Mrs. Clinton would rely on their judgment in making her decision. **********Moreover, at least some officials outside the First Lady's staff have argued that Mrs. Clinton's visit could be good for Chinese-American relations in the long run. Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and former Ambassador to Beijing, switched his vacation plans to be available to escort her. **********The matter remains complicated, balancing the enormous attention Mrs. Clinton would win among the 50,000 delegates and reporters at the conference with practicalities as particular as the fate of one man. **********Over the weekend, Mr. Wu's wife, Ching Lee, wrote to the First Lady, imploring her not to go. Mrs. Clinton has not yet replied, but officials said there was general agreement that it would be extremely problematic for Mrs. Clinton to attend if Mr. Wu remained in custody. **********At the same time, these aides said the Administration was determined not to link Mrs. Clinton's decision too closely to Mr. Wu's fate, or to the status of Chinese-American relations in general, but to the mission of the conference. **********Washington will be well represented at the once-a-decade conference in any event. The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, is the official head of the American delegation, which includes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, and former Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey. Mrs. Clinton would be the honorary chairwoman. **********Officials said today that if she went, Mrs. Clinton would most likely stay in Beijing one day, address the conference, spend the night and then move on, holding no meetings with Chinese Government officials or dissidents to emphasize that she was attending an international conference, not honoring the Chinese. **********But among the Administration's concerns is that however brief her stay, Mrs. Clinton could easily become embroiled in disputes or demonstrations by the various delegations at the conference, and that her visit would almost certainly be interpreted by the Chinese as a sign of American nonchalance about its human rights record."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/07/business/rule-threatens-future-of-a-bank-annuity.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1995-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rule Threatens Future of a Bank Annuity", "print_headline": "Rule Threatens Future of a Bank Annuity", "body_text": " **********In an action hailed by the life insurance industry, the Treasury Department moved today to severely restrict sales by 11 small banks of a new kind of tax-deferred annuity, which is financed with Government-insured certificates of deposit. **********The Treasury Department's proposed rule -- which effectively begins Friday -- guts the new annuity, called the Retirement C.D., by treating it for tax purposes like a zero-coupon bond, for which income taxes must be paid on each year's accrued interest. **********The ability to let interest accumulate and compound free of taxes until money is paid out has caused an explosion in the sale of traditional annuities by insurance companies. Americans put $86.4 billion into insurance company annuities last year, up from $51.6 billion in 1991, according to the American Council of Life Insurance. **********Although the effect of the proposal is immediate, the Internal Revenue Service cannot formally adopt the rule until after a public hearing on Aug. 18. **********Retirement C.D.'s purchased before Friday are unaffected and the interest in them will accumulate tax free, a Treasury spokeswoman, Beth Brooke, said. **********When a Retirement C.D. matures, the bank does not write a check for the principal and interest, as it would with a regular C.D. Instead, it pays out a portion of the money immediately and returns the rest in a series of regular payments that continue until the annuity's owner dies. **********\"This rule doesn't kill us, but it sure wounds us,\" said Rick Fasold, the president of the American Deposit Corporation, in Denver, which is seeking a patent on the Retirement C.D. **********He said the rule would still allow sales of the Retirement C.D., but only if a stream of payments began within one year of purchase. But he and others said that most investors buy an annuity so it can grow tax free for many years before they begin receiving payments, which usually end at the owner's death, although payments sometimes continue for a minimum number of years or until a spouse or child dies. **********\"We think it's the right move,\" Joseph McKeever, a Washington tax lawyer who represents the Committee of Annuity Insurers. The American Council of Life Insurance, whose members count on annuities for more than half of their profits, said it concurred with the Treasury action because \"it represents sound public policy.\" **********But Dennis M. Gingold, the Washington banking lawyer who created the Retirement C.D., said the Treasury action \"just shows how powerful the insurance industry is.\" **********\"The life insurance industry went crazy over this,\" he added, \"because between one-fourth and one-third of the insurance company annuities sold last year were sold in banks and they want to maintain their monopoly.\" The proposed rule does not affect banks that act as sales agents for insurance company annuities. **********Mr. Gingold said that if the rule was adopted, he would challenge it in court. \"We will win because the law, going back to 1954, is very clear and it allows for tax-deferred interest on certain annuities not sold by insurance companies, and we meet the exception,\" he said. **********The American Bankers Association, however, did not share Mr. Gingold's confidence. **********\"We agreed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that this was a valid product and that banks could sell it, but we recognize that there is an open question about whether taxes on the interest can be deferred,\" said Phil I. Corwin, a lawyer for the bankers group. He said the American Bankers Association had not decided what stand to take at the public hearing this summer. **********Mr. Gingold said his product \"is clearly superior to insurance company annuities because ours is insured up to $100,000 and theirs isn't insured, and the fact is that insurance companies sometimes do fail.\" **********Critics have said the interest rates offered by the 11 small banks would, even with tax deferral, provide less money than customers could get from insurance industry annuities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/10/business/international-briefs-production-prices-rise-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Production Prices Rise in Britain", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Production Prices Rise in Britain", "body_text": " **********The prices of goods leaving British factories and the raw materials used by manufacturers rose in September, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.

Analysts had forecast earnings of about 29 cents a share in the most recent quarter, according to Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. Lehman said on Tuesday that its earnings would exceed Wall Street estimates after Moody's downgraded its debt. **********Revenue for the quarter ending Feb. 28 totaled $707 million, down 18.5 percent from $868 million in the 1994 quarter. **********Indeed, compared with the 1994 quarter, Lehman's performance was off notably. During that period, the firm reported $73 million worth of pretax earnings, or 41 cents a share. (The pretax earnings were before $31 million in charges for severance and accounting changes.) **********But the first two months of the 1994 quarter were the last two months of extraordinary profitability on Wall Street. In trying to gauge how much securities firms are recovering from the financial debacle of 1994, many analysts are forgoing year-over-year comparisons and looking instead at how a firm's performance in the current quarter compares with the previous one. On that basis, things are looking a bit better, the analysts said. **********Lehman's earnings were $1 million less than the $46 million it made in the previous three months, and its revenue was only $1 million lower than the $708 million posted in the fourth quarter of 1994. **********\"The numbers were a little bit better than expectations, even though investment banking was a bit weaker, which is in line with what is happening in the rest of the industry,\" said Guy Moszkowski of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. \"But since Lehman's quarter consisted of the December-February period, these numbers will be different than the rest of the street. Since early February, the trading environment has started to improve.

Lehman's shares fell $1.125 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $18. **********The downgrading, which the firm said could increase its borrowing costs by as much as $100 million, was announced after the stock market closed on Tuesday. Only a month ago, Moody's had reaffirmed its ratings on $15 billion in Lehman debt. **********\"I was surprised at the downgrade,\" said James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. \"The review was done a month ago. I can't think of anything that has happened to Lehman since then that would have justified this.\" **********Debra Parry, a managing director of Moody's, said events like the collapse of Barings Securities and the Bankers Trust Company's announcement earlier this month that it would sustain a loss of $125 million or more in the first quarter were \"important elements\" in the decision to downgrade Lehman's debt. **********\"It is our perception that the operating environment that the securities firms face is more challenging today than it was several months ago,\" she said. **********The downgrading of Lehman \"is a very unusual circumstance,\" she added. \"But we feel a very strong obligation to have the ratings reflect our current perception of the company's business risks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/01/business/usair-makes-sharp-changes-in-upstate-new-york-fares.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1995-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "USAir Makes Sharp Changes in Upstate New York Fares", "print_headline": "USAir Makes Sharp Changes in Upstate New York Fares", "body_text": " **********In what might be a precursor to a new pricing strategy throughout its stronghold in the Northeast, USAir has quietly but radically changed its prices for flights that connect major East Coast cities and Pittsburgh to most cities in northern and western New York State. **********While the new fare structure means savings opportunities and added flexibility for some fliers, particularly families on weekend trips, it means fare increases of 75 percent or so for weekly commuters and others. **********Under the policy, which took effect without a public announcement on Aug. 15, round-trip fares were eliminated in the affected markets. Saturday and Sunday flights now cost $69 to $79, with no advance purchase required; the previous policy priced walk-up tickets at $199 or so every day. A $49 fare for children 2 to 11 years old flying with an adult has been added in these markets. **********But for those who commute to work or between job sites, the new policy has increased ticket costs as much as 75 percent because two one-way tickets cost more than the old round-trip discount fare, which was available by buying a ticket home on Friday night and a return to work on Monday to take advantage of the Saturday night stay requirement for discounts. **********\"USAir has apparently decided that the yield on the round-trip fares was lower than it was willing to accept,\" Ed Perkins, editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter, said. \"And where they have the market by the throat, they can do this kind of monopolistic practice to raise yields.\" **********Yield refers to the revenue an airline collects for each mile that each seat is flown. USAir has the highest costs of major airlines at about 11 cents a passenger mile, compared with about 7 cents for some discount carriers, such as Valujet and Southwest Airlines. **********Mr. Perkins said he expected more airlines to drop round-trip discount fares that require a Saturday night stay, a practice pioneered by Southwest Airlines. \"Southwest has proven you can do yield management without requiring round trip and a Saturday night stay,\" Mr. Perkins said. **********As word of the new one-way ticket policy spread on a recent flight between La Guardia and Rochester, several commuters expressed anger at the rate increases. **********\"They are going to almost double my weekly commute cost from around $161 to $281,\" said Lillian W. Silver, associate dean of the Columbia Business School, who commutes weekly between her home near Rochester and her job in Manhattan. \"I'm, well, I'm expletive deleted.\" **********Affected by USAir's new price structure are all flights connecting the three major New York airports -- La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark -- plus Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh or Washington on one end with Binghamton, Buffalo, Elmira, Ithaca, Rochester, Syracuse or Utica on the other end. **********USAir is the dominant carrier in those markets and, in some cases, it offers jet service while its competitors fly only turboprops. **********The new fare structure does not affect full coach fares on weekdays, except that the outbound and return flights will be ticketed separately. **********Because 21-day advance purchase tickets are now one way, a Saturday night stay is no longer required to qualify for a discount. For example, USAir had charged $398, plus a $3 airport fee, to fly from La Guardia to Buffalo and back on the same day. Under the new policy, the price for two one-way tickets, purchased three weeks in advance, is $318 plus the $3 fee, a saving of 19 percent, said David Castelveter, USAir public relations director, last night. **********Two other changes could also benefit some fliers. One-way advance- purchase ticket holders are now allowed to travel standby, taking any unsold seat on any other USAir flight the same day. Under the old policy, standby travel was allowed only on the return portion of a round trip. **********Also, passengers who want to change their travel to another day can do so without paying a $50 reticketing fee if unsold discount seats are available, Mr. Castelveter said. **********\"We thought this structure would create a simpler, easier-to-sell fare menu that would more appropriately meet the needs of both the business and leisure passengers,\" Mr. Castelveter said. \"Over the years there was a tremendous sense of distrust by the traveling passenger as to whether he or she was getting the lowest fare.\" **********Mr. Castelveter said that because of an antitrust consent decree that USAir and other major airlines had signed with the Justice Department, he could not say if the new policy would be expanded systemwide or even throughout the Northeast, where USAir is the dominant carrier. **********Airlines have repeatedly tried in recent years to develop simpler fare structures. **********In the spring of 1993, USAir announced \"our new short-hop fares,\" adding, \"Short-hop fares are here for the long haul.\" The $39-to-$99 round-trip discount fares throughout the East were quickly scaled back to weekends and then eliminated after several months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/23/business/a-struggle-to-deal-with-a-20-billion-precedent.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1995-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Struggle to Deal With a $20 Billion Precedent", "print_headline": "A Struggle to Deal With a $20 Billion Precedent", "body_text": " **********As the United States and Mexico argued about the last details of a $20 billion rescue plan last week, one of the Clinton Administration's top economic officials fielded the same question time and again in his travels through Brazil and Argentina: If Mexico's ills spread, is the United States prepared to bail out its other big trading partners? **********Much like other Administration officials, from Treasury Secretary Robert E.

American troops have been stationed in Europe and Asia for decades as the guarantors of territorial security and protectors of United States interests abroad. But in Mexico, the United States has just stationed billions of dollars of capital and an elite unit of financial police, declaring that otherwise hundreds of thousands of American jobs might be lost and a financial panic could spread through emerging markets around the world. **********It is compelling if unpopular logic. But it has left many in Washington wondering where to draw the line: What countries are now so vital to the new American economy that they cannot be allowed to fail? **********Moreover, doesn't the Mexican bailout send an unwanted message to countries and those who invest in them around the world? Overborrow, overspend and fear not, because in the new international economy, everyone is so interdependent that there is always a bailout around the corner. **********Not surprisingly, the message that the Administration is trying to send to the markets these days is a simple one: Don't count on it. **********\"Mexico was unique,\" Mr. Rubin said. The reason, of course, is the porous border with the United States. The financial turmoil in Mexico City, the White House kept reminding Congress, would be measured by the number of illegal aliens flowing into California and Texas. And then there are the 700,000 jobs the Administration contends are dependent on exports to Mexico, including 130,000 created in the last year. **********Indeed, Mexico has virtually matched Japan as the second-largest market for American exports behind Canada. Through the third quarter of last year, Mexicans bought more than $51 billion in goods from the United States, compared with $51.7 billion by Japanese and $112 billion by Canadians. **********Mexico had other special characteristics. More than most other big emerging-market countries like Argentina and China, it has been heavily dependent on short-term financing from abroad. That is the kind of investment that mutual fund managers can redirect with a few clicks on their computer keyboards, calling their money back to the United States or sending it elsewhere. **********One lesson of the crisis is that it is safer to follow the example of countries like China and Indonesia, which have depended more heavily on foreign direct investment to build roads, factories and other necessary supports for economic growth. It takes a lot longer to move a car factory out of the country than it takes to get a short-term bond out. **********And finally, as Mr. Rubin has said many times, Mexico has been the prototype economy, an exemplar of the way to privatize big industries, open markets and create a growing middle class eager to buy imports. If the prototype failed, he argued, it would discourage countries like Russia or even South Korea from following the same path. **********But in one respect, Mexico was hardly special. It was one of the many emerging markets outside the United States, Europe and Japan in which Americans had dived headlong in recent years through mutual funds, lured by projections of huge profits and apparently unconcerned that they had only a vague idea of what made those economies tick. **********Mr. Rubin feared that if investors decided to bail out of Mexico, they would bail out of everything that vaguely resembled Mexico in what he termed a \"catalytic effect.\" There are suggestions that he was right. When Mexico's stock market declined, it took much of Latin America with it many days, and it was blamed, rightly or wrongly, for plunges as far away as Poland and Hong Kong. **********That could have happened 20 years ago as well, of course. But as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, pointed out in recent testimony, now it can happen so much more quickly. \"In today's world,\" he said, \"Mexico became the first casualty, if I may put it that way, of the new international financial system.\" **********Mr. Greenspan is among those warning that the bailout, which he heartily supported, could create what economists call a \"moral hazard.\" That is, investors looking at emerging markets could factor in the prospects of a bailout if everything goes bad. That, in turn, could keep the markets from accurately assessing the risk of investing in, say, Argentina or Indonesia. **********As a result, Mr. Greenspan urged that any bailouts must emulate the Mexican rescue and carry such high costs and rigorous terms that investors worry that they would pay a price, as well. **********Now the bailout theory has a new wrinkle. Because this one cost the United States so much, there is a new drive to overhaul the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations so that the United States Treasury does not become the World Market-Emergency Fund. Here, too, the fear is that such an overhaul might encourage more countries to live at the edge, knowing that there are bigger institutions around to save their necks. **********The issue will be among the key topics at the Group of Seven meeting of leading industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, this summer. But in the meantime, the United States is saying anew that no one should expect to be treated the way the Mexicans were. **********\"It would be very foolish if we didn't learn from this,\" Mr. Christopher said last week to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"It was fortunate that the President had available $20 billion in a stabilization fund that he could bring to bear on this particular crisis.\" **********But $20 billion does not grow on trees, he noted, and \"the United States probably could not handle a second crisis like that.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/05/world/us-plans-to-give-bosnia-spy-planes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Plans to Give Bosnia Spy Planes", "print_headline": "U.S. Plans to Give Bosnia Spy Planes", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration promised yesterday to provide United Nations commanders in Bosnia with unmanned spy planes, a move that would eliminate the risk of losing more American pilots following the downing Friday of an F-16 fighter. **********Defense Secretary William Perry said that sending the drone aircraft would benefit the United Nations forces because the low-flying planes transmit images instantaneously to ground commanders and are not hampered by cloud cover. **********Mr. Perry also said that there was no evidence to support the contention by Gen.

Their commitment is for two years. **********Beginning on Aug. 31, Independents will be distributed free in theaters specializing in so-called art house films as well as at independent-film festivals and to new subscribers of the cable network, the Independent Film Channel, which is owned by the Cablevision Systems Corporation. Plans call for one million copies of each issue to be given away each quarter. **********\"Independent film has crossed over,\" Marian Schwindeman, executive vice president for marketing and business development at Entertainment Weekly in New York, said yesterday. \"And there seems to be more awareness in the ad community that independent film is reaching large numbers of consumers.\" **********Ms. Schwindeman is also executive director of Entertainment Weekly Ventures, a unit that the magazine, owned by Time Warner Inc., formed in January to offer advertisers so-called added-value marketing programs. She provided a sneak preview of Independents before a news conference scheduled for tonight at the Walter Reade Theater in Lincoln Center. **********The genesis of the publication was a proposal made a year or so ago by Entertainment Weekly at an annual \"media meeting\" held by executives of Absolut and TBWA Advertising, the brand's agency since 1980. The meetings, known throughout the media industry by their nickname, the media marathon, offer magazines and newspapers the opportunity to present ideas for Absolut advertisements to supplement the wittily stylish campaign from TBWA, a unit of the Omnicom Group. **********\"It happened to coincide with something we were talking about,\" said Claude P. Fromm, executive vice president and media director of TBWA in New York, \"to get some association for Absolut with film\" to accompany the brand's popular series of advertisements tied to art, fashion and music. **********Independents will complement a group of movie-themed ads by TBWA, he added, including \"Absolut Hollywood\" (the bottle as a film star) and \"Absolut Marilyn\" (a tribute to Marilyn Monroe), as well as a project the agency is developing with the American Film Institute to support film preservation. **********Robert Bernstein, national marketing manager for Absolut at the House of Seagram unit of Seagram in New York, said: \"Film is a new door we're opening up that we think is right for the brand. And we look for areas for Absolut to enter to match the personality of the brand, cutting-edge and ahead of the curve. That's independent film.\" **********The program faces two potential stumbling blocks. Because Independents is being given away rather than sold, readers might disdain it as the publishing equivalent of a movie that goes straight to video. That's a difficulty encountered by previous free movie publications like Preview, which Ms. Schwindeman supervised at Premiere magazine, and Moviegoer, which was produced by the 13-30 Corporation for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. **********\"That's always a consideration,\" Mr. Fromm said, \"but we think of it like Playbill, not a freebie, giveaway publication but as something of value.\" **********The other problem is a conflict-of-interest issue. Five sponsors of Independents release films the publication will cover: Fine Line, owned by Turner Broadcasting System; Miramax, part of the Walt Disney Company; Fox Searchlight, a unit of the News Corporation; Gramercy Pictures, and Sony Pictures Classics, part of the Sony Corporation. **********And Seagram owns 80 percent of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal Pictures -- a partner with Polygram N.V. in Gramercy. In fact, a scene from a new Gramercy film, \"The Usual Suspects,\" appears on the cover of the first issue of Independents. **********\"The majority of our coverage goes to the five independent partners,\" Ms. Schwindeman said, because they \"account for more than 90 percent of the independent film market. **********\"But none of our partners have editorial approval or see anything prior to printing,\" she added. \"Some didn't like that.\" **********Ms. Schwindeman, Mr. Fromm and Mr. Bernstein declined to discuss financial aspects of Independents, though they disputed a report in The Hollywood Reporter that the program would cost $600,000 -- half to be paid by Absolut and the other half by the other sponsors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ad-institute-seeks-a-director.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad Institute Seeks a Director", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ad Institute Seeks a Director", "body_text": " **********The New York council of the American Association of Advertising Agencies is seeking a successor to Harold Levine, who has served for a decade as director of the Institute of Advanced Studies, which offers training for young employees of agencies. \"It's time for a new director to make his or her imprint on the institute,\" said Mr. Levine, 74, a founder of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver in New York, who added that he would continue to serve as a consultant to agencies.

Yeltsin said of Chechnya: \"The situation is developing normally.\" Soldiers \"are not involved in combat activities, but are engaged in creative work,\" Mr. Yeltsin said, without defining the nature of the creation. \"Interior Ministry units, in small groups, continue to disarm the militants,\" he continued, while other ministries restore urban services and build houses. **********Most of these assertions are dubious, however, fitting the pattern the Russian propaganda machine has cut for itself from the beginning of this vicious civil war and raising new questions about the quality of the information Mr. Yeltsin is receiving. **********As the war in Chechnya continues, much to the dismay of Russia's putative Western partners, it is holding up a spotlight to all the cracks in Russia's fragile political, military and economic condition. **********\"Chechnya has exposed and aggravated all the weaknesses of central and democratic institutions,\" said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"It's just an enormous mess, a serious of bad choices that got bigger and badder.\" **********In fact, according to Western reporters and other more objective Russian news agencies, like Interfax, the Russian army has not taken Grozny or even encircled it. Russians are still fighting around Minutka, which is only 1.5 miles from the blackened ruin of the presidential palace and the central square. They are still fighting their way into the southern part of the city, around the Chernorechenskoye reservoir. And there are many reports that Chechen units have moved in from the north, behind Russian lines, to harass them in the eviscerated city. **********The Chechens have moved their military headquarters out of Grozny, a clear victory for the Russians and an indication that Grozny will eventually fall, as the Chechens continue the war, less visibly, in the villages and mountains. But much of Grozny remains an extremely dangerous military zone with fluid lines, and the new, Russian-named leadership of Chechnya has postponed a planned move into Grozny. **********Similarly, Mr. Yeltsin has once again postponed a speech to Parliament assessing the Chechen affair. His report to Parliament, originally scheduled for Jan. 11, and then for today, has been rescheduled once more for Feb. 16 or 17. **********Even the army's declaration that it is about to leave Chechnya appears to be unfounded. A Defense Ministry spokesman told Interfax that at least one division and two motorized infantry brigades -- no less than 12,000 troops -- would remain in Chechnya. Given that the invasion force was some 40,000 troops, equally divided between the Defense and Interior ministries, 12,000 soldiers is 60 percent of the army's original commitment. **********Sovetskaya Rossiya, a pro-Communist paper of the old style, has reported that the army regards the performance of the Interior Ministry troops with contempt. Army officers told the paper that the day after a building is handed over to the Interior troops, it must be cleared of Chechen snipers once more. **********In addition to resistance in Grozny itself, the villages to the south are full of Chechen fighters. Russian officials expect more heavy fighting in Gudermes, 22 miles east of Grozny, and in Shali, 15 miles to the southeast. Fighting continues around Argun, 12 miles east of Grozny, and in other, closer villages. **********So the partisan war is just beginning, and while the normal trajectory of a news event means that village battles and ambushes will get less attention, Chechnya is far from \"normalized.\" The drain on the military will continue, and no Russian soldier is likely to feel very comfortable there for a long time to come. **********As Chechens prepare to commemorate the anniversary of their mass deportation by Stalin, on Feb. 23, 1944, official paranoia about Caucasian revenge found an extraordinary target Wednesday night. **********Ramazan Abdulatipov, an ethnic Avar and the Deputy Speaker of the upper house of the Russian Parliament, was visited at home by policemen with signed authority to check all \"people of Caucasian nationalities\" living in Moscow, Mr. Abdulatipov's spokesman, Ruslan Valiyev, said today. The police were looking for illegal weapons, Mr. Valiyev said, criticizing this \"loyalty check\" on even the highest-ranking officials from the Caucasus. **********In a larger institutional sense, says Pavel Y. Felgengauer, the military editor for the newspaper Sevodnya, the army has been shown to be a mess: with low morale, bad training and hardly a single unit battle-ready. The army itself contains more soldiers than Chechnya's entire population of 1.2 million, he points out, and all those soldiers have families, who all have votes. **********After Chechnya, he said, soldiers are faced with the same low pay and bad housing, coupled with new attacks on them for being \"murderers, marauders and war criminals. **********So Mr. Yeltsin is thought likely to dismiss the Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, and possibly the head of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, Valentin Stepashin, who pushed the original covert war. **********While Mr. Yeltsin has valued loyalty all his career, General Grachev's loyalty is not much use if he has lost the respect of the army. Even before Chechnya, he was in trouble over corruption charges stemming from the Soviet army's pullback from Central Europe. **********He was attacked again in Sevodnya, which published a leak from inside the Kremlin about a Defense Ministry account in a German bank that held some $20 million. But the Ministry denies there is anything illegal about the account, or that General Grachev had any connection to it. The writer, Sergei Parkhomenko, said in an interview that he might have been shown the documents to try to discredit General Grachev, saying that Mr. Yeltsin's entourage is \"very badly disposed\" toward the general. **********Today Mr. Yeltsin dismissed two Deputy Defense Ministers, Gen. Matvei Burlakov, a Grachev ally already suspended on corruption allegations, and Gen. Georgi Kondratyev, who had sharply opposed the Chechen war. **********In the meantime, the casualty list grows. Officially, 907 Russian soldiers have died and 3,400 have been wounded, with 456 more missing in action. But officers speaking to the Russian press estimate the number of dead to be up to five times higher. **********On the Chechen side, casualties are impossible to estimate. The head of Parliament's defense committee, Sergei N. Yushenkov, estimates that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Chechnya and 100,000 are homeless, but it is hard to gauge. Grozny itself, a city of some 400,000 before the war, has fewer than 100,000 people now."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/12/world/aid-for-trapped-rebel-muslims-is-blocked-by-croats.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1995-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 459, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aid for Trapped Rebel Muslims Is Blocked by Croats", "print_headline": "Aid for Trapped Rebel Muslims Is Blocked by Croats", "body_text": " **********While the world focused this week on the exodus of tens of thousands of Serbs from the Krajina region into Bosnia and Yugoslavia, a few miles from here 30,000 refugees are trapped, without international assistance or anywhere else to go. **********They are renegade Bosnian Muslims, followers of Fikret Abdic, a former Communist with a reputation as a shady businessman, who led them in an alliance with Bosnian Serbs against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government fighting for control of the Bihac enclave in Bosnia. **********Mr. Abdic has fled into Croatia since his forces were routed when the Croatian and Bosnian Government forces joined to save Bihac. **********[ Mr. Abdic surrendered to the Croatian Army south of Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and has been put under house arrest in the capital, The Associated Press reported, quoting police officials. ]  The refugees, who have been camped along a three-mile stretch of road for at least four days, have very little food and are forced to drink water from a river. **********Their condition is described as desperate by United Nations officials and aid workers, who said today that the Croatian authorities had refused to allow food and other supplies to be sent to the refugees. **********The Croatian Government certainly does not want them to stay here, diplomats and United Nations officials said today. **********\"I think these people got lost in the whirlpool of history,\" said Kris Janowski, a spokesman in Zagreb for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, noting the attention that had been paid to the more than 100,000 Serbian refugees who fled this week. **********Croatian officials have said repeatedly that it is for security reasons that they will not allow aid agencies or journalists access to the refugees.

Japanese manufacturers need a weaker yen to remain competitive in export markets. The yen's decline is said to be the result of portfolio managers' moving out of yen holdings, where long-term interest rates are at a scant 2.8 percent, for higher-yielding dollars at 5.9 percent and Deutsche marks at 6.4 percent. **********But observers in Tokyo scoff at the suggestion that institutional investors are rushing to sell yen \u2014 now 30 percentbelow this year's high \u2014 to buy U.S. bonds where yields are a mere half-percentage point above the 20-year low set in 1993. **********\"Japanese institutional investors have become a lot more sophisticated than they once were,\" said Richard Koo, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. **********\"They're no longer prepared to chase markets higher. If anything, institutional investors have been sellers of foreign securities at over 102 yen,\" taking profits on purchases made when the dollar was at 90 yen, he said. **********Individual investors, by contrast, are shifting out of maturing yen investments into higher-yielding foreign securities, but Jesper Koll at J.P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo said he doubted the \"sporadic, unbundled\" shifts from those clients would account for the substantial weakening of the yen. **********The more likely big sellers of yen are the highly leveraged, highly speculative foreign hedge funds. The year-end for many of them is November, so they will be looking to close positions and book profits. But if they were selling stocks \u2014 as rumored \u2014 what explains the market's rise? **********The rumor simply does not fit with the facts, which leaves the suspicion that the Bank of Japan \u2014 which of late has ceased its ostentatious intervention in the currency market \u2014 is now engaged in covert intervention, aiming, as always, to drive the yen to a level where its weakness becomes self-propelling. The yen coincidentally ended the week trading just beyond the chart point where technical analysts say it signals further weakness. **********The central bank would appear to have a double objective in fostering weakness at this point:It wants a weaker yen to relieve the pressure on industry as a means to spur growth, and it can use the dollars it gets from selling yen to deposit with Japanese banks whose dubious credit standing blocks them from borrowing in the interbank market. **********The dollars the central bank accumulates through intervention and then deposits with commercial banks do not show up as an increase in reserves. The reserves measure only official holdings of foreign securities. Thus, the latest $1 billion increase in official holdings gives a misleading impression of the central bank's activity in the foreign-exchange market. **********Meanwhile, the Japanese banks that can still borrow continue to pay a premium over the benchmark offered rate to raise money in the interbank market. Analysts report that some smaller banks have been shut out even in the Tokyo market. **********This is driving the banks to dispose of dollar assets. Bankers in London say that the disposals are orderly and not wholesale dumping, but a widening of spreads on floating-rate rates and on fixed-rate sovereign paper is attributed to pressure on prices resulting from Japanese sales. **********Cr\u00e9dit National SA last week sold $150 million of 10-year subordinated floating-rate notes. They had been expected to be priced to yield 45 basis points over the three-month interbank rate for the first five years but were offered at a spread of 55 basis points to account for the changed environment. **********After five years, the spread rises to 1.25 percentage points. But that is unlikely to happen because the issuer can be expected to call the issue after five years. Subordinated debt starts losing its value as capital when the remaining life is below five years. **********Bankers question whether there is much life left to the dollar sector, with interest rates near historic lows and amid expectations for another cut in U.S. interest rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/25/world/mexican-talks-break-off-until-may-with-no-accord.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1995-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexican Talks Break Off Until May With No Accord", "print_headline": "Mexican Talks Break Off Until May With No Accord", "body_text": " **********After four tense days filled with brinkmanship and bravado, Government negotiators flew back to Mexico City today and Indian rebels returned to their forest refuge after peace talks in the southern state of Chiapas were recessed late Sunday night without reaching any significant agreements. **********As they left San Andres Larrainzar, the Indian town in Chiapas where the talks were held, both sides made it clear that peace efforts had not broken down.

Also gone was a call for rolling 25-year extensions rather than a permanent renewal of the accord. **********The nations with nuclear weapons -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia -- generally favor an indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty, although China has said it could accept automatic 25-year renewals. **********Two of the treaty's original negotiators, George Bunn of the United States and Roland M. Timerbaev of the Soviet Union, who are attending the treaty conference here as observers for nongovernmental organizations, said today that they favored the 25-year renewal plan.

About 30 percent of the imported wines sold in the United States come from France. **********Previous campaigns for French wines, by Lois/U.S.A. in New York, \"worked well for us,\" Ms. Pefau-Dore said, carrying such themes as \"French wine is French art,\" stressing lower-price French wines and \"It's a great time to be French,\" which urged consumers to drink French wines with cuisines like Italian, Chinese or all-American fare. **********\"But we felt it was time for some sort of a change,\" she added, \"to make French wines more accessible in the minds of American consumers, particularly younger consumers in their 20's and 30's, educating them that wine is not something that's forbidding.\" **********So Balet & Albert decided to shift the advertising approach. **********\"There are psychological barriers to buying things French,\" said Rick Albert, partner and president of the agency, who spent five years working for the American wine market leader, E. & J. Gallo. \"So to overcome them, we need to make the brand friendly, truly French but in an American vernacular. **********\"A 28- or 30-year-old on a date, out on business, who wants to show off a little, will not order French,\" he added. \"He or she can't pronounce the name; it's tough. So instead it's, 'I'll have the Stags Leap chardonnay.' \" **********To counter those perceptions, the print ads feature a quartet of attractive young men and women -- as toned and tanned as any cast members of \"Melrose Place\" or \"Central Park West\" -- in poses shot by the fashion photographer Dewey Nicks. They assert that French wines are the perfect accessories for a special time of day known as \"the 'oui' hours,\" a play on the theme \"Say 'yes' to wines from France.\" (So it's not Moliere, but it's not Jerry Lewis, either.) **********In one ad, the foursome is huddled around a barbecue grille during a drizzle, drinking red wine as \"sizzling things happen in the 'oui' hours.\" In a second, \"wild things happen\" as a couple get romantic, and in a third, \"unexpected things happen\" -- a young woman in curlers and a housecoat is greeted by three friends bearing large bottles of Champagne. **********\"That model is a very brave soul,\" Marc Balet, partner and creative director of Balet & Albert, said, laughing. \"She caught me on the street the other day and said, \"Oh my God, what did I do?' \" **********That is indicative of the playful, free-spirited campaign, which seeks to counter perceptions that French wines are stuffy and only for oenologists. Or as Mr. Balet put it, \"Nobody is drinking wine to have a bad time.\" **********To underscore that point, the print ads will appear in life-style and fashion magazines like Allure, Conde Nast Traveler, In Style, The New Yorker, Out and Vanity Fair, rather than in the epicurean publications that are typically part of the media schedule for French wines. **********The address of the Web site, http:/ /www.frenchwinesfood.com/, which is scheduled to begin operating late next week, will be included in all the print ads. Using the Internet represents \"another attempt to reach this consumer who is smart and 'in,' \" Ms. Pefau-Dore said. The audio portion will offer recorded pronunciations of the names of 40 French wines. **********The campaign, with a budget of $2 million to $2.5 million, will run through December and then return in the early spring, when Food and Wines from France sponsors an annual \"April in Paris\" promotion. **********You can almost hear Joanie Sommers and the Count Basie Orchestra now."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/international-briefs-aegon-offers-to-buy-big-norwegian-insurer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Aegon Offers to Buy Big Norwegian Insurer", "print_headline": "International Briefs; Aegon Offers to Buy Big Norwegian Insurer", "body_text": " **********Aegon N.V., one of the world's 20 largest insurance companies, said yesterday that it had offered to pay 2.7 billion kroner ($436 million) for Vital Forsikring A.S., Norway's second-largest insurer.

But many lawyers and experts on the way companies are managed see nothing to cheer about. They say the behavior of the company's board of directors fell far short of what shareholders should expect. **********Among their questions are whether the Del board was too dominated by friends and associates of the chief executive, Dan K. Wassong, with no truly independent directors who could step back and act dispassionately. They also asked whether a separate board committee should have guided the company's response. And they wondered why Mr. Wassong was allowed to remain deeply involved in the board's deliberations. **********The bottom line, securities lawyers and specialists in board room practice say, is that American law requires a board of directors to act on behalf of the company's shareholders, not its management. And for all the much-ballyhooed rise in independence and assertiveness among company boards, the Del case is a reminder of how difficult it can be for directors to handle serious accusations against a successful chief executive whom they count as a close friend, these experts say. **********\"There has been lots of talk about how boards are taking control and getting involved and truly representing shareholders, but my gut tells me that directors are still pretty much controlled by those who invite them to serve,\" said William C. Jennings, a specialist in risk control at Coopers & Lybrand. **********Mr. Jennings also faulted Del's directors for misjudging the potential damage the case could do to the company's reputation with its primary customers -- working-class women who buy its Sally Hansen nail products and its Flame-Glo cosmetics. **********By contrast, if Del's board had followed what experts say are the best practices, the case may have been settled earlier, more quietly and less expensively -- or perhaps might not have been filed at all, they said. And even if the case had turned out the same way, the company would have been spared some of the damage to its image. **********Joseph Grundfest, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member and a law professor at Stanford University, said that even if the directors did not believe the accusations against Mr. Wassong they should have seen that a thorough, credible and independent examination of the complaints was carried out to reassure customers, employees and shareholders. **********\"Even if the chief executive never did anything wrong -- let's assume that! -- the process the board followed in this case is not one that is calculated to give the public much confidence in the outcome,\" he said. \"Because they used a process that is subject to so much question, they may have wound up with the worst of all possible worlds: the chief executive is innocent, nobody believes it, and the corporation has still paid out the big bucks.\" **********Harvey Goldschmid, a professor of corporate law at Columbia University, commented, \"A dispassionate, disinterested look at the issue by the board becomes mandatory -- and clearly this board was not in a position to have gotten that look.\" **********At Del, which is based in Farmingdale, L.I., and has about 1,100 employees, the corporate handling of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint was largely directed and supervised by Robert Haines, whose law firm is Del's general counsel and who has been an outside director since 1970. Speaking on behalf of the board, Mr. Haines defended the board's decision not to set up a special committee to carry out that task. **********\"I did not see any need for the directors who were outsiders to meet separately,\" he said. \"We had competent outside counsel who were giving me independent views.\" **********He continued: \"We on the board have known each other for a very long time, and the other directors were relying on me to keep them advised. It is a smaller and friendlier board than at many companies.\" **********Mr. Wassong abstained from any formal board votes related to the E.E.O.C. case, but Mr. Haines said he did not insist that the chief executive leave the room for any part of the board's deliberations. \"I did not feel it was necessary to ask him to leave because we have never felt that these charges had any substance from the beginning,\" Mr. Haines said. **********The Government complaint was filed on behalf of 15 women employees, mostly from Mr. Wassong's secretarial pool, who said the chief executive had indulged in lewd and abusive behavior for years. In the lawsuit filed by the E.E.O.C., the women said Mr. Wassong had grabbed the breast of one employee, conducted office business with his fly open, routinely used vulgar language and made degrading comments about the appearance of his employees. **********Why didn't the women take their complaints about Mr. Wassong to his bosses, the corporate directors? Mary Dixon, one of the women represented by the commission, said, \"The board members were all personal friends of his -- that was very apparent to all of us.\" **********Jonneigh Adrion, another complainant, said Mr. Haines and Mr. Wassong \"spoke almost every day by phone, about both company and personal matters.\" **********One outside director was Steven Kotler, president of Schroder Wertheim; his firm had been hired by Mr. Wassong as Del's investment banker in past deals and is Del's continuing financial adviser. Mr. Wassong's son worked at Mr. Kotler's firm for two years after his graduation from college. **********Another outside director from December 1993 to December 1994, the period in which the complaint was drawn up and filed in court, was Richard J. Soghoian, headmaster of Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School in Manhattan. Mr. Wassong's son had been a student at the school, whose amenities include the Dan K. Wassong Swimming Pool. **********In fact, Mr. Haines acknowledged that he considered only two of the current board members to be \"outside\" directors: Marcella Maxwell, a member of the Mayor's Commission on the Status of Women in New York City and a respected community leader, who was recruited by Mr. Haines after the Federal investigation began, and Robert A. Kavesh, a business professor at New York University. Mr. Haines said he did not consider Mr. Revson, Mr. Kotler or himself to be \"true outsiders\" because of their various business associations with the company. **********Charles McCarthy Jr., a Washington lawyer who advises corporate directors, said it would have been far better if the Del board had \"insulated itself and empowered an independent third party to advise the outside directors.\" He added, \"They've fallen short of the mark.\" **********Mr. Haines recruited an impressive collection of law firms to help Del prepare either to go to trial or reach a settlement. Among them were Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld of Washington; Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn of Manhattan and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius of Philadelphia. **********Those advisers said they dealt only with Mr. Haines, and occasionally Mr. Wassong, and had no contact whatever with the other board members. Contrary to what many corporate governance specialists recommend, Mr. Haines said he did not feel it was necessary to have the legal advisers attend board meetings because \"I was keeping everyone fully informed.\" **********\"There isn't anything tougher for directors to do than to deal with allegations against the person who invited them to the party,\" said Mr. Jennings of Coopers & Lybrand. And boards can face significant consequences if they discharge that duty poorly. **********At Morrison Knudson in Boise, Idaho, for example, board members have been accused in private lawsuits of failing to adequately monitor the policies of a former chief executive, William Agee, until it was too late to prevent serious financial damage. At W. R. Grace & Company in Boca Raton, Fla., directors have been sued for approving a \"golden parachute\" for a former chief executive, J. P. Bolduc, who was forced to resign in March when sexual harassment allegations arose in the midst of a ugly feud between him and his former mentor, J. Peter Grace Jr.  And directors of the Cooper Companies in New York were publicly chastised by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 1994 for failing to deal responsibly with accusations of fraud raised in May 1992 against the company's co-chairman, Gary Singer. **********The most notable distinction between these and the Del case, is that Mr. Wassong has kept his job and the three other chief executives have not. Indeed, as the E.E.O.C. investigation progressed in the spring of 1994, the Del board increased Mr. Wassong's salary and bonus to more than $1.1 million and eased the repayment terms of a $2 million loan the company made to him, at 6 percent interest, to finance his purchases of company stock. He now owns 35 percent of the company, and he and Mr. Revson together control 51 percent of the company's stock, enough to decide the outcome of any proxy fight challenging Mr. Wassong's power. **********Nor is Mr. Wassong likely to face any financial liability from the company's E.E.O.C. settlement. Although Fay Clayton, a securities and discrimination lawyer in Chicago, said she felt Mr. Wassong should have borne the burden of the settlement, Reinier Kraakman, a law professor at Harvard University, said a lawsuit by shareholders aimed at recovering the settlement costs from Mr. Wassong \"would be a very tough row to hoe.\" He said the board had made a business judgment that Mr. Wassong was innocent and that a settlement was better for the company than a courtroom trial. \"A business judgment is very hard to attack,\" he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/07/business/ibm-expected-today-to-name-chief-for-new-worldwide-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1995-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 640, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

Firestone, head of the home services unit of the Ameritech Corporation, to lead a worldwide consumer division that would greatly expand the company's offerings in on-line services, people familiar with I.B.M.'s plans said. **********Before joining Ameritech, Mr. Firestone, 40, was an executive at American Express, where he worked under Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who is now I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive. But unlike other outsiders Mr. Gerstner has brought to I.B.M., Mr. Firestone has strong ties to the company: his father was a 30-year I.B.M. veteran who served as a marketing executive in Japan. **********Neither Mr. Firestone nor I.B.M. officials would comment about the expected appointment. **********The consumer division is the most significant new business initiative taken by Mr. Gerstner since he joined the company two years ago. Taking over at one of the lowest points in I.B.M.'s history, he has returned the company to profitability largely by cutting costs. With the new consumer unit, he is steering I.B.M. in the direction of a potentially rich source of new revenue. **********Speaking to financial analysts last week, Mr. Gerstner said research conducted by the company indicated the global market for consumer spending on computer-related goods and services would soar, to $116 billion in 1998 from $54 billion in 1993. In the United States, he added, the proportion of spending by consumers is expected to rise to 39 percent of the total domestic market for information technology, from 18 percent in 1993. **********\"It's a growth opportunity we cannot ignore and we will not ignore,\" he said. **********Although I.B.M. is among the most recognized brand names in the world and established the dominant standard for the personal computer in 1980, it has repeatedly stumbled in the consumer market. **********Mr. Gerstner acknowledged there was room for improvement, but added that I.B.M. already had \"several billion dollars\" in annual sales from consumer-related products, chiefly personal computers and Prodigy, the consumer on-line service that it owns jointly with Sears. **********Those businesses would now be transferred to the new consumer unit, which will have dedicated marketing and development arms and will focus on selling about 10 types of products in 10 countries worldwide. **********\"The vision is that we'll take what we've already got, but what we've got is very small compared to what we think can be there,\" said G. Richard Thoman, the head of I.B.M.'s personal computer business and another American Express veteran who will be Mr. Firestone's immediate superior, in an interview last week. **********In addition to being familiar with telecommunication services, Mr. Firestone has extensive international experience. Fluent in Japanese, he helped develop Japan into one of American Express's biggest markets and subsequently headed up the company's global travelers checks division. **********Mr. Thoman said about half the consumer products would be related to the personal computer, such as add-on devices, games and software, while the remainder would come from network-related services. **********\"There is no question that we view the on-line services business as an important element of this,\" he said, adding that such services have only just begun to grow in the United States and have not yet taken hold overseas. **********Mr. Thoman did not appear to be concerned about competition from the Microsoft Corporation, which is expected to start a worldwide on-line service later this month, and he was unclear about the role Prodigy would play in the company's expansion plans. **********\"Prodigy will be part of our thinking in our U.S. activities,\" he said. \"We are clearly thinking about what we should do outside the U.S. and that is something that we and Sears have to think about and talk about.\" **********\"We could have partners in other countries and we could also be partners with Sears,\" he added. \"We haven't figured out to the ninth decimal point what we're going to do.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/08/world/moscow-journal-glassy-eyed-etiquette-a-guide-to-russian-toasts.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1995-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moscow Journal; Glassy-Eyed Etiquette: A Guide to Russian Toasts", "print_headline": "Moscow Journal; Glassy-Eyed Etiquette: A Guide to Russian Toasts", "body_text": " **********Maksim Bykovsky, a graduate student and businessman, rose slowly to his feet, a full glass of vodka in his hand. It was time for the third toast -- to the dead, he thought, but wasn't sure. He'd had a bit too much to drink already, and the party in his apartment here was just getting under way. **********Confusion is common on the complicated etiquette of how to drink and toast in Russia. In the military, it is traditional to drink the third toast to those who've died in war -- unless it's the second toast. **********Even the duty officer of the Defense Ministry wasn't sure, and had to call back. \"It's the third,\" he finally said, no doubt after profound research. But there is no disagreement among soldiers that the next toast -- the fourth -- is to the hope that no one will ever drink the previous toast for those around the table. **********The next 10 toasts are often reserved, at least among soldiers, to women. This intelligence leads to the main conclusion: that Russians drink to get drunk, and it's only when drunk -- in vodka veritas -- that any Russian really trusts another. But on the way there, toasts are used for many purposes, from the sentimental to the political, and they are often a mechanism for the kind of pointed truth-telling normally avoided in social or business conversations. **********There is little confusion about the rules for first and second toasts. It is considered uncivilized to start drinking without a first toast, which is a kind of blessing or sacrament. The second follows quickly. In a well-known Cossack expression, \"Between the first and second toasts, a bullet should not pass.\" The bureaucrats have their own version: \"Between the first and second, you shouldn't squeeze a finger\" (theirs are normally quite thick). **********In the old days, the first toast was always \"To Stalin!\" -- even at a child's birthday party. Other than personality cults, Communism produced a bizarre collection of strange and lifeless toasts, like a favorite one of the Komsomol or Young Communists: \"To the success of the scheduled tasks!\" **********Among close friends, the first toast may be brief and informal -- as simple as \"Budem zdorovy!\" -- \"Let's be healthy!\" -- or even just \"Budem!\" or, in dire cases, \"Boum!\" The last is used toward the end of a drinking bout, when it is difficult to articulate anything else. **********At a wake, the first toast is raised to the dead person, and glasses must never be clinked. **********At birthdays, the first toast is to the health of the celebrator; the second to that of the parents. **********At weddings, similarly, the first toast is to the newlyweds, the next to their parents. But then begins the special Russian combination of collective, forced hilarity, common around the twin topics of liquor and love, that still carries a kind of totalitarian flavor. **********When the guests drink from their glasses, traditionally the supersweet domestic champagne (still known and sold as Sovetskoye Shampanskoye), there are always one or two who will shout: \"It's bitter, make it sweeter!\" Suddenly there is a rhythmic chorus, like a chant at a soccer match, of \"Gorko! Gorko! Gorko!\" -- \"Bitter! Bitter! Bitter!\" **********The poor newlyweds can stop the chant only by initiating a long kiss, during which relatives and friends (even the bride's mother) count in unison: \"One, two, three,\" and so on. The longer the kiss, the greater the applause. A mediocre effort will produce another shout of \"Gorko!  Gorko!\" and force a repetition of the entire humiliating performance. **********Sometimes, after numerous repetitions, the couple may be spared by the tamada, a Georgian title for the toastmaster, a semi-dictator who is supposed to know the social intricacies and keep the party, and the vodka, flowing. **********Soldiers, bored in peacetime, must often drink without any occasion. Officers in small provincial garrisons commonly catch a cockroach, rarely a difficult task in Russia, and chase it along the table, prompting two quick toasts: \"S priyezdom!\" or \"Happy arrival!\" and \"S otyezdom!\" or \"Happy journey!\" New Yorkers may practice this at home. **********\"There is still a manhood thing attached to it all,\" said Thomas R. Pickering, the American Ambassador here, who long ago discovered that the key qualification for his job is the ability to eat and drink anything. In his many official banquets all over vast, vodka-sodden Russia, he has found that among his hosts, \"the worst of them want to get falling-down stone drunk, while the best of them want to get happy, loose and seriously emotional -- peeling away the layers of convention and protection.\" **********But he understands that toasts, especially at official gatherings, are a way to get political points across. After the social graces, warm words and touch of humor, \"there is always time for a message.\" In return, he says, \"there's always full equal time for a response and more.\" **********When Westerners appear to be holding back, Russians will shout: \"Do dna!\" -- \"To the bottom!\" or bottom's up. Russians, fearing to be more incapacitated than others around the table (the sober one was regarded as a likely stoolpigeon), have a complicated series of fines for those who arrive late. Normally the penalty involves drinking, do dna, the largest available glass, vessel or urn, filled with vodka. **********If \"do dna\" is feared, the toast to remember is equally simple: \"Na pososhok!\" -- basically one for the road, from the word posokh, for walking stick or staff. It is another Cossack toast, and it is considered extremely bad manners to offer any more toasts or require any more drinking once a guest has uttered it. But it is also extremely bad manners to utter it too soon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/09/business/stratton-oakmont-is-fined-by-nasd.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1996-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stratton Oakmont Is Fined by N.A.S.D.", "print_headline": "Stratton Oakmont Is Fined by N.A.S.D.", "body_text": " **********Stratton Oakmont Inc. agreed to pay a fine of $325,000 today, and its head trader agreed to pay $50,000, to settle a case connected with the underwriting of an initial public offering, the National Association of Securities Dealers said. **********The penny-stock brokerage firm and Steven P.

Commit acts of genocide!\" said Antonio Cassese, president of the tribunal, his voice rising. \"You may enjoy impunity!\" **********This, he said, was the message that would go \"to military leaders and all dictators\" if the Bosnian Serb leaders indicted for atrocities in the Bosnian war were not brought before the tribunal. **********As head of the tribunal's 11 judges and of its appeals chamber, Mr. Cassese's primary duty is to guarantee a fair trial for the accused. Beyond that, he sees  another role, that of the tribunal's conscience, warning of dire consequences if it is rendered powerless -- \"a giant without arms and legs,\" as he put it -- with those accused of being the worst offenders never coming to trial. **********Not only is there a risk that the tribunal will fail, Mr. Cassese cautions, but also that the credibility of the United Nations and other international institutions will be damaged. **********Mr. Cassese, appointed tribunal president three years ago by the United Nations, is a former professor of international law at the University of Florence and has represented Italy at several international forums on human rights. **********Since his appointment, Mr. Cassese has spent much of his time on quiet diplomatic missions to persuade governments, including those of Croatia and Serbia, to cooperate with the tribunal. But with four trials now under way and a long list of hearings scheduled, Mr. Cassese is stepping into the limelight. **********One of the most troublesome issues is that of bringing the Bosnian leader, Radovan Karadzic, to trial on charges of genocide. Dr. Karadzic remains free, based in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters outside Sarajevo. After recent negotiations between the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and Richard C. Holbrooke, a United States envoy, Dr. Karadzic has resigned as leader of his political party and has pledged in writing to retire from public life, although  he has broken other promises in the past. **********When asked about a motion filed by two American lawyers for Dr. Karadzic arguing that the recent hearings presenting evidence against him were politically motivated to get him to resign, Mr. Cassese responded sharply. **********\"This is totally preposterous,\" Mr. Cassese said in an interview, conducted in English with occasional digressions into French. \"The indictments of Mr. Karadzic are based on war crimes and investigated over a long time. We're not interested in playing politics.\" **********In their motion, the lawyers said the tribunal was \"biased\" and using a double standard against Bosnian Serbs. **********\"I've heard that quite a few times, especially in Serbia and even in Moscow,\" Mr. Cassese said. \"We are absolutely impartial and even-handed, but the lack of  cooperation by Serbs and Bosnian Serbs has worked against them.\" **********Until recently the tribunal prosecutors were unable to work in Belgrade or in the Serbian-controlled part of Bosnia. \"So we obviously have more evidence for crimes against Muslims or Croats,\" he said. \"Finally the Serbs have understood they were making a huge blunder.\" **********To underline his point, the normally discreet Mr. Cassese cited a letter he had just sent to the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, reminding him of his obligation to arrest Croats charged with war crimes, in this case, Dario Kordic, a Croatian politician living in Zagreb who has been indicted for war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims. **********\"We know that he has an apartment in Zagreb,\" Mr. Cassese said. \"We have reports that he has been seen there.\" President Tudjman has so far not replied to the letter. **********Until now, the public face of the tribunal was largely that of Richard Goldstone, the outspoken chief prosecutor from South Africa. Mr. Goldstone openly complained of a lack of operating funds and of the reluctance of governments to cooperate. But his office nonetheless set the court in motion by  issuing indictments on a wide range of war crimes, although to his frustration,  only seven of the 75 suspects indicted are in the tribunal's custody. **********Mr. Goldstone will return this summer to his position on South Africa's Constitutional Court, having set out the tribunal's basic strategy. He will be succeeded by Louise Arbour, a Canadian Judge. **********With trials now under way, several defense lawyers have criticized the tribunal's procedures, particularly its rules on admitting evidence, which were  virtually copied from the Nuremberg trials. **********This criticism bothers tribunal experts who say the views of hundreds of jurists were taken into account in writing the rules, which were drawn from different legal traditions. **********American lawyers on loan from the Justice Department dismissed complaints about the admission of hearsay evidence. They said the kind of hearsay evidence presented so far at The Hague would certainly be admitted in most American courts. **********Mr. Cassese said it is perhaps inevitable that at this early stage of the proceedings, a good deal of misinformation exists. Edward Medvene and Thomas Hanley, the Los Angeles-based lawyers for Dr. Karadzic, have protested to the court that he cannot be charged under the doctrine of command responsibility because in international law this \"has never been applied before against a civilian official.\" **********Mr. Cassese says their observation is incorrect, noting that command responsibility was indeed applied to civilian leaders in the Tokyo trials after  World War II. **********\"So what if it hadn't,\" Mr. Cassese went on. \"Command responsibility is a very broad notion that can apply to whoever plans or aids and abets the commission of crimes, that means any leader, political or military.\" **********One prosecutor dealing with the Karadzic case said the entire argument was academic. \"The Constitution of the Serb Republic headed by Mr. Karadzic states clearly that the president is the commander in chief of the military,\" he said. **********A few days ago, as Mr. Cassese met with reporters to review the two weeks of  hearings held to publicize the tribunal's indictments of Dr. Karadic and his military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, he began saying, \"We have now exhausted all the avenues open to us.\" **********But he said the tribunal might rethink its present ban on holding trials in the absence of the accused if key figures of the Bosnian war were not brought to The Hague to face charges by early next year. **********A trial in absentia is permitted in much of Europe but not in American, British and other courts that follow the tradition of common law. Mr. Cassese said the issue has provoked debate among judges from the outset. \"The discussion is still under way,\" he said. **********The procedure was allowed at the Nuremberg trials after World War II. Martin  Bormann, for example, was tried and sentenced to death in his absence. **********Instead of holding trials in absentia, the judges invented a new formula, the so-called rule 61, which permits hearings without the accused being present. \"This was done so that we don't get stuck, so that someone who is indicted cannot simply block the process by not showing up in court,\" Mr. Cassese said. **********This was the legal proceeding conducted regarding Dr. Karadzic, and a similar hearing brought evidence against General Mladic. The hearings led to the issuing of international arrest warrants against the two Bosnian Serb leaders, increasing pressure on countries to arrest them. Mr. Cassese said that in the next few months, such hearings leading to possible arrest warrants will be held  for all 75 people indicted so far."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/business/international-briefs-imperial-chemicals-says-earnings-fell-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1996-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Imperial Chemicals Says Earnings Fell in Quarter", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Imperial Chemicals Says Earnings Fell in Quarter", "body_text": " **********The British chemical giant Imperial Chemicals Industries P.L.C. reported a fall in first-quarter profits yesterday and warned that the next three months' results would also be lower.

Jean Crepin, a retired French Army officer who oversaw the development of the Exocet missiles, which played a key role in the war in the Falklands, died on Saturday in the French department of Seine-et-Marne, near Paris, where he lived. He was 87. **********General Crepin, who was known for his loyalty to Charles de Gaulle in World War II, started out as an artillery lieutenant in 1930, attained the five-star rank of general d'armee in 1961 and retired from active service in 1967. **********His career included service during the Liberation of Paris from the Germans in 1944. He also commanded French forces in Algeria in 1960 and 1961 and in Germany from 1961 to 1963. **********The French newspaper Le Monde recalled him as \"gruff, reserved, authoritarian, but esteemed by his peers.\" **********In 1967 de Gaulle, as France's President, asked him to become the president of Nord Aviation, a large, state-owned concern manufacturing planes and tactical missiles. He went on to hold important positions at another state-owned industrial concern, now known as Aerospatiale, from 1970 to 1975. **********As an armaments-industry executive, General Crepin became regarded, as Le Monde put it, as \"the designer of France's missiles.\" Another French newspaper,  Le Figaro, said in its obituary that General Crepin had \"given the impetus\" to the development of the Exocet family of missiles and other weaponry. **********In the war in the Falklands in 1982, Argentine warplanes wielded Exocet missiles with lethal accuracy against British Navy vessels. Exocets were also a  featured weapon in the \"tanker war\" phase of the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq. **********The son of an industrialist, Jean Crepin was born in Barnaville, a village near Amiens in northern France. He attended secondary schools in Amiens and Paris and graduated from the Polytechnique school for artillery officers and engineers. **********His military career took him first to China and then to Cameroun, in West Africa, where in 1940, as a captain, he rallied to de Gaulle's Free French Forces. He saw World War II action in Libya, Tunisia, France and Germany. And he was the colonel commanding the artillery of the Free French Second Armored Division in 1944 when that division freed Paris. He also saw action later in the war, notably at Strasbourg and Berchtesgaden. **********General Crepin served in Vietnam in the mid 1940's during that country's fight against French rule, and in Algeria in the late 1950's and early 1960's when it was racked by a pro-independence revolt and by dissidence among French settlers and French military personnel there. **********De Gaulle picked him in 1960 to replace Gen. Jacques Massu in the key post of French commander in Algiers. De Gaulle dismissed Massu in a crackdown against dissent in the military hierarchy in Algeria, and by the time the shake-up was complete, General Crepin was commander for all of Algeria. **********From there he went on to command French forces in Germany. From 1963 to 1966, he held a high NATO command in central Europe. **********He was awarded various French decorations, as well United States medals, including the Silver Star . **********He was predeceased by his wife, the former Simone Granday. They had two daughters, Francoise van der Plaetsen and Bernadette Menahem."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/business/the-media-business-ibm-taps-spinal-tap-actors-to-sing-its-olympic-praises.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1996-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 495, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;I.B.M.
